Andrew Houston, 48, denies driving carelessly on the A9 between Newtonmore and Kingussie on 9 July 2013.
His wife Abigail, daughter Mia and GP Dr Mohammed Ali Hayajneh died in the crash near Ralia.
Inverness Sheriff Court was shown a video tape of Andrew Houston reliving the moments after the crash.
The solicitor advocate told officers how he tried to free himself from the wreckage to help his dying wife, 42-year-old Abigail and seven-year-old daughter, Mia.
"I have no idea what caused the collision. I wish I knew, I wish I knew",  Mr Houston said.
He said: "I could hear Lily talking and I could see little Mia. She didn't seem to be injured. That's the strange thing. There were no obvious injuries to her.
"But I remember someone trying to give her CPR. Two men were trying to help. I couldn't get out.
"I wanted to get out and help Mia but I couldn't. I was stuck."
Mr Houston denies causing the death of Abigail, Mia and 62-year-old physician Mohammad Hayajneh by careless driving and crossing into the opposite carriageway on the A9 at Ralia, near Newtonmore on 9 July 2013.
His Audi A4 collided head on with a silver Jeep Cherokee being driven by Dr Hayajneh's wife, 59-year-old Ursula from Duisburg in Germany.
The court was told police confirmed at the time he was not under the influence of alcohol or on a mobile phone at the time.
Police experts also established there were no mechanical defects on his car which could have contributed to the crash.
A Peugeot 206 carrying four Polish tourists managed to avoid a collision by swerving off the road and crashing into a road sign moments before.
Mr Houston suffered cracked ribs and a broken foot as a result of the crash.
He told how he took his wife and daughters to Inverness for a short break before he headed to Dornoch Sheriff Court for a trial.
They went on a dolphin spotting cruise before he rejoined them and began his journey back south.
The court heard he told PC Donna MacLeod of Police Scotland: "I slept well the previous night and I felt fine on the journey. We had stopped in Aviemore for a short time before the accident."
He apologised to officers for becoming upset during the questioning.
"This is embarrassing, I am just vaguely aware of an impact and just awfulness afterwards.
"I remember an almighty bang and I thought 'Oh my God' something is going toâ€¦
"I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. I'm really sorry I wish I could. Just the horrid aftermath."
Mr Houston is a senior partner at McSporrans defence solicitors in Edinburgh.
The trial, which is expected to conclude on Thursday, continues.
