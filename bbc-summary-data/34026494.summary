Stefan Forge, a 47-year-old microbiologist from Harrogate, was hit at Buttersyke Bar on 22 August in 2001.
A fellow rider was also hit and suffered serious injuries.
North Yorkshire Police said "with the passage of time we hope someone is in a position to come forward".
Officers said a front spoiler from a type of Seat vehicle was found near the scene and want to trace the driver and eliminate him from the investigation.
Police investigating the collision are now carrying out a review of the case and appealing to anyone who has any information but has not contacted the police.
Sgt Ian Pope, of the Major Collision Investigation Unit, said: "Fourteen years have passed since Stefan died and I am hoping that with the passage of time, someone is now in a position to come forward with information that can help our investigation.
"Stefan's family have had to carry on with their lives, not knowing the full circumstances of his death or who was responsible.
"We are still working on behalf of them, and hope that someone with that vital piece of information that will lead us to the identity of the vehicle and its driver, is out there."
