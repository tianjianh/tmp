"Spectre is a movie entirely driven by Bond," Mendes explained in a new behind-the-scenes Vlog.
"He is on a mission from the very beginning."
The director also said the storyline would develop the characters of Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, and Ben Whishaw as Q.
The vlog also features footage of the characters shooting scenes, in addition to a glimpse of a car chase.
Spectre will be Daniel Craig's fourth outing as 007, but he has hinted it will be his final film in the franchise.
Mendes directed Craig as the superspy in Skyfall in 2012.
"The reasons I'm doing the second Bond movie are the reasons I would do any movie, really, which is all to do with the story," he said.
Bond's tragic childhood in Scotland and the death of his parents featured in Skyfall - which shared the name of his family home.
Mendes said the new film returned to the theme.
"It's about whether or not to pursue the life he's always pursued, whether he matters and is he going to continue or not."
The first picture of Dave Bautista as the villainous assassin Mr Hinx was publicly unveiled on Thursday.
Spectre's cast also includes Lea Seydoux, Andrew Scott, Christoph Waltz and Monica Bellucci.
The film will open in cinemas worldwide on 6 November.
