Kieron Dyer led an Ipswich Town veterans side for the match against Newmarket Town, for Shaun Whiter and Joey Abbs.
Mr Whiter, 27, had both legs amputated after he was struck by a car while helping friend Joey Abbs change a flat tyre in Newmarket, Suffolk.
Newmarket player Mr Whiter and Soham Town Rangers player Mr Abbs attended.
Mr Whiter was discharged from Addenbrooke's Hospital on Friday, while Mr Abbs, who also suffered a serious leg injury during the crash on 1 July, was released from the hospital after six days.
"You don't think this is ever going to happen to you but unfortunately it has," Mr Abbs said.
"It has been a horrible, horrible thing... but everyone's been brilliant and shown their support."
Ex-England manager Terry Butcher also played for the Ipswich team in the game at Newmarket's ground, which is thought to have raised around £15,000.
A fundraising page set up by Mr Whiter's fiancée, who he is due to marry next July, has already raised nearly £73,500 of its £120,000 target.
Reg Winch, partner of Mr Whiter's mother, said: "It's been overwhelming and it's restored our faith in human kind.
"His aftercare is incredibly expensive and is very long-term. The prosthetics - while being amazing now - are also amazingly expensive.
"Plus, there are alterations to his living conditions and occupational health for work."
Cambridge United has also revealed plans to host a fundraising day in aid of the footballers on 9 October.
A 40-year-old man from Haverhill, Suffolk, has been charged with two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and is due at Cambridge Crown Court on 8 August.
