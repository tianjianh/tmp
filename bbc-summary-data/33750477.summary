[SN]TITLE[SN]
Partick Thistle 0-2 Celtic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle were unable to test a Celtic side who returned from midweek Champions League exertions in Baku to record a comfortable win at Firhill.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals by Tom Rogic and Kris Commons, neither a starter on Wednesday against Qarabag, ensured Celtic join Hearts on maximum Scottish Premiership points.
Midfielder Rogic improvised to give Celtic the lead after 28 minutes.
Commons seized on hesitancy to slide in a second and, though sub Mathias Pogba improved Thistle, Celtic cruised home.
If Ronny Deila can draw satisfaction from witnessing the Australian midfielder Rogic, in for injured captain Scott Brown, score the opening goal, the Norwegian may have been puzzled that his team led by only that solitary strike at half-time.
His team were sharper across the pitch than their Glasgow rivals, despite that tiring trip to Azerbaijan, and dominated throughout.
Rogic was joined in midfield by Commons, who came in for Gary Mackay-Steven, and Leigh Griffiths was evidently in the mood to justify his inclusion, with Nadir Ciftci suspended.
The former Wolves forward rose above the taller Callum Booth to head an early Emilio Izaguirre cross over the bar, pinged a free-kick on target that was comfortably saved by Tomas Cerny, had a fierce shot saved by the experienced Czech and was alert to well-placed long balls from defender Dedryck Boyata.
A goal was all that was missing from his first-half contribution.
Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong was forced to go off after 20 minutes with a groin injury.
His replacement, Callum McGregor, was yet another attacking headache for the Jags' central defensive pairing of 19-year-old Liam Lindsay and Jack Hendry, 20, both making only their second appearance.
Allowed to advance to 25 yards unchallenged, Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk slapped a low shot off the Thistle post before McGregor helped forge the breakthrough.
If the sub's low cross into the box for Griffiths was perfectly directed, his team-mate's lay-off was ideally weighted.
Rogic, though, had come a fraction too far to fashion a traditional shot but he threw out the lower half of his leg to flick the ball smartly into the net.
The home fans had seen not a single chance crafted by their team so their enthusiastic penalty appeals were perhaps understandable when David Wilson's side-footed volley struck the flailing arm of Celtic's stand-in captain Mikael Lustig just before half-time.
However, referee John Beaton correctly observed that the Swede had his back to the ball and was only a yard away from Wilson, and waved aside the appeals.
New Thistle signing Pogba came on for Steven Lawless to make his debut five minutes after the break and threatened at the near post before Van Dijk cleared.
By that point, though, Celtic were two goals up as a long ball from Nir Bitton caught out Booth but not Commons, who latched on to it and dinked it beyond Cerny.
Thistle were at least competing better but the direction of play changed little, with Griffiths testing Cerny with a further shot and free-kick.
Alan Archibald's team created their first real chance in the 88th minute when sub David Amoo slipped past Izaguirre and cut the ball back for the unmarked Pogba, but his shot from 10 yards flew wide.
