23rd May.
I was born in Enfield and raised in north London until I was about 10. After that we all moved to the green, green grass of Hertfordshire where I've lived ever since!
One older sister called Daniela who's a fashion designer and used to live in Italy!
I write and compose my own music and I've played the piano for many years! (I think I'm pretty good - but I'll let other people be the judge of that!)
I'm addicted to rollerblading and I've just discovered the thrills of skiing in the Alps. I spend a lot of time on my Mac designing graphics too.
Blue
It's got to be jeans, they go with pretty much everything.
Well, after spending much of the morning in bed, I'd have to rally some friends and family round to enjoy mum and dad's Sunday roast. Later, we would all crash out on the sofas with the Sunday newspapers and the TV on in the background.
I've got to say cats! The Boleto household isn't complete unless there's a cat causing mayhem. At the moment we've got Bella, she's around two years old. Before Bella, we had Bepeâ€¦ he was a very cool dude!
My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I've seen it hundreds of times and it never gets old. As I'm half Greek Cypriot, this film is more like a documentary - very true to life!!!
I enjoy listening to loads of different genres of music. At the moment I'm a big fan of Alphabeat and Adele. I think the Sugababes and Lucie Silvas are pretty cool as well.
Losing my hearing. I've always had a bit of trouble with these old ears!
I can still watch episodes of Friends while laughing my head off, but mostly my close friends and family are the ones that keep me sane and smiling.
My first job was in a record shop when I was 16. At university, I worked in a clothes store - which I hated - then ventured into the world of journalism after graduating, working for Sky News and Five News for two and a half years.
Jennifer Aniston. She's a fantastic and absolutely beautiful comedienne, but she can also do some of the serious acting stuff too. I think Robert De Niro is a brilliant actor. I loved him in Meet the Parents.
Anything Italian, but mainly my dad's secret recipe lasagne.
The Troodos Mountains in Cyprus. I have lots of family there and loads of happy memories. Cyprus is so small you can go from one side to the another in the space of a couple of hours!
A good Newsround story should have a number of elements. It needs to be relevant, affecting the lives of you at home - but it also needs to be engaging, so it's really important that we think about covering stories differently.
It's also vital that our stories give you guys the chance to interact and share your views. That way we know if you like the story or not!
Being a journalist can be so much fun, but it can also be really demanding and competitive. Try to get some work experience at a local paper, or how about writing short stories for a website? If you're really ambitious you could set up your own website or mini-magazine!
Make sure you stay focused. Once you've got your results start knocking on lots of doors. There are quite a few routes into journalism so don't worry if you get the door slammed in your face once in a while, I certainly did! Eventually, I completed loads of unpaid work experience and made sure I stayed in contact with all the right people.
The best piece of advice was given to me by the legendary ex-TV newsreader, John Suchet. He told me to seize every single opportunity with both hands and to make the most out of every situation. Wise words indeed!
Working for Newsround makes me pretty happy - I've wanted to work here since I was about eight! Going out with friends on the weekend and catching up with all their stories also keeps me happy!
My Apple iMac. I think I've fallen in love with a computer!
I'd love to host my own TV or radio show one day, interviewing important people as well as chatting to celebrities. Most of all, I want to entertain people for many years to come and get more interested in the news!
