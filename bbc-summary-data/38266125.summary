The Miami Dolphins will play the New Orleans Saints in one of those contests as part of the NFL's International Series.
There will be two games staged at Wembley and two at Twickenham Stadium.
London hosts four games in 2017, one more than in 2016 and the most it has ever hosted.
The New York Giants became the first side to win at Twickenham in October when they beat the Los Angeles Rams 17-10.
Meanwhile, at Wembley, the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Indianapolis Colts 30-27 and the Washington Redskins tied 27-27 with the Cincinnati Bengals.
London hosted its first NFL game in 2007 and the NFL says there has been "accelerated growth" in audience figures since then. It says the UK has a fan base of more than 13 million people.
