Australia dual citizen saga: Court to hear cases in October

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dual citizenship saga that has gripped Australian politics for almost two months will not be tested in court until October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The court will decide whether seven MPs are ineligible to sit in parliament for potentially being dual citizens when they ran for office.
A preliminary hearing for five of the politicians took place on Thursday.
The final outcome could imperil Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's slender grip on power.
The most high-profile person under scrutiny is Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, a New Zealand dual citizen until last week.
Mr Joyce sits in the lower House of Representatives, where Mr Turnbull's government has only a one-seat majority.
Under Australian law, anyone who holds dual citizenship cannot run for office.
If any government MPs in the lower house were to be ruled ineligible, it would trigger a by-election, and Mr Turnbull could face barriers to retaining power.
The High Court of Australia said it would conduct the hearings over three days from 10 October, about a month later than the government had hoped.
On Thursday, the court heard submissions from lawyers for Mr Joyce and:
Two UK dual nationals, government Senator Fiona Nash and independent Senator Nick Xenophon, will have their cases referred at a later date.
Chief Justice Susan Kiefel acknowledged the issue was unusual and that there was a "high level of urgency" in resolving the debate.
However, she rejected a push by Australia's Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue, QC, to have the cases heard in September, to allow legal teams more time to prepare.
