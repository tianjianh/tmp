A kidney specialist at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary has been suspended for three months after it was ruled he had developed an improper emotional relationship with a female patient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Colin Millar admitted making repeated visits to the 19-year-old in hospital, which were clinically unnecessary.
He sent her text messages and invited her to join him on a coastal walk.
He also sent her a present of rubber ducks on her birthday.
The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) suspended his registration for three months, with a further review hearing to be held before the suspension concludes.
