Michael James, 59, from Carlisle, died in hospital after the crash on Dalston Road in the city on Tuesday evening.
A 16-year-old male pedestrian was seriously hurt. Three other pedestrians suffered minor injuries and a passenger in the vehicle was also hurt.
The family of Mr James, who worked at the Pirelli tyre factory, said it was the "darkest day" they had faced.
A statement said: "Following a tragic accident, we have lost a loving and caring family man with traditional values, morals and standards.
"Michael was brought up in Carlisle, studied at Morton School and worked for Pirelli for 35 years. He was a fanatic of keeping fit and loved to run and cycle and spent many hours on the hills surrounding Cumbria.
"He selflessly put others before himself and will be sorely missed by his wife Gill, daughters Hannah and Molly and his many family members and friends.
"We would also like to extend our thoughts and prayers to the other parties involved and wish them a speedy recovery."
Cumbria Police have appealed for witnesses to the crash, which happened at about 17:50 GMT.
