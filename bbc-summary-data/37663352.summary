[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-1 Leeds United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kemar Roofe's first goal for Leeds earned a victory at Molineux as Wolves' winless run in the Championship was stretched to five matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Oxford United forward Roofe, who arrived at Elland Road in July, turned home Hadi Sacko's cross from close range midway through the second half.
Sacko should also have scored in the first half but chipped on to the bar.
Joao Teixeira had Wolves' only shot on target, but his first-time effort in the box was saved by Rob Green.
Wolves, who have lost four of their last five league games, looked toothless in attack once again despite creating several chances after head coach Walter Zenga changed their usual formation by playing two strikers.
Iceland forward Jon Dadi Bodvarsson failed to find the net for the eighth Championship game in a row and has scored just twice in 12 league matches since joining from Kaiserslautern.
Helder Costa, arguably Wolves' most creative player during their run of poor form, wasted a glorious opportunity to equalise in stoppage time, sending his shot over.
Garry Monk's Leeds, who have won five out of eight league matches, rise to 10th in the table.
Wolves head coach Walter Zenga:
"It is a little frustration with the situation. I think the team created and played well and tried to do the positive things.
"The negative point should be if the team doesn't play and doesn't create anything. The team played well and created chances. We have to convert these chances into goals.
"We have to continue to work hard, don't think everything is negative because the only negative is the result.
"We had an important meeting after the game, only me and the players, and I am sure 100% that things are going to change."
Leeds boss Garry Monk:
"We are really competitive now. Overall our character shone through today and we got the deserved three points.
"I think we saw it out quite comfortably. Three points and a clean sheet - you have got to be happy.
"I think that it was an excellent performance. A really gritty typical Championship game where you have to dig in."
