A woman trapped in an attic during a blaze at her Cardiff home was given "vital survival guidance" by the fire service control operator as crews travelled to rescue her.

The woman made the emergency call just after 03:30 BST on Saturday from the house in Llanishen.
Crews were faced with a well-developed fire on the first floor of the house, but located and rescued the woman.
One of her adult sons had escaped the blaze before crews arrived.
They were both treated at the scene by Wales Ambulance Service Trust and taken to hospital.
The woman had been unsure whether a second adult son was in the house as he had gone out the night before, but South Wales Police tracked him down.
The cause of the fire is still not known and is being investigated.
A spokesman for South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said: "All of the emergency personnel at the incident worked well in partnership to bring this incident to a successful conclusion.
"However, had it not been for the calmness of the person making the emergency call and the advice and calmness of the fire control operator giving vital survival guidance this could easily have had a more devastating outcome."
