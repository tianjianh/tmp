The Stags dominated for long spells and had the best of the chances, but twice found themselves behind.
For the second successive home game the Stags lost possession and were punished on the counter-attack as Jordan Slew ran onto the ball in his own half and raced clear on 14 minutes, leaving Jamie McGuire in his wake, and he slotted home across Brian Jensen and off the far post.
It was their only effort of the half with Argyle keeper Luke McCormick by far the busier.
He stopped a tame early Matt Green effort, tipped away a curling James Baxendale shot, made a fine block from Ashley Hemmings and watched a Mitch Rose blast sail over the bar.
But Mansfield were level on 58 minutes as Green flicked on a Rose cross and Hemmings blasted home a rising shot under the far angle from the far post.
Hemmings twice came close to another, firing just wide and hitting a post.
But the Pilgrims, who have only lost once in 16 games snatched it as Slew fed Fox to fire home an excellent finish from 18 yards.
