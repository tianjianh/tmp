Caithness turbines deemed risk to RAF Lossiemouth radar

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan for three wind turbines looks set to be refused permission because the project has been deemed a risk to the operation of military radar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wind Harvest Ltd has proposed the small wind farm for land at Hill of Lychrobbie, near Dunbeath in Caithness.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has objected because the turbines could interfere with radar at RAF Lossiemouth in Moray.
Highland councillors have been asked to refuse the farm planning permission.
Planning officers at Highland Council said that, while it was recognised the renewable energy project would benefit nearby communities, the MoD's objection could not be ignored.
The officials noted that the developer had sought to resolve the problem with the MoD.
Councillors will consider the officers' recommendation that planning permission be refused at a meeting next week.
RAF Lossiemouth, which is located across the Moray Firth from Dunbeath, is a base for Typhoon and Tornado jets squadrons.
