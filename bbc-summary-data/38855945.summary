[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 claims for compensation from families affected by the baby ashes scandal in Aberdeen have been received by the council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together at Hazlehead Crematorium and given back to relatives of the adult.
The parents of the infants were told there were no ashes.
Aberdeen City Council said it had received 205 claims and the process for determining compensation was moving to the next stage.
The date set for all claims to be lodged was 1 February.
The council announced in December last year that it had approved a new financial compensation scheme for those affected.
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
