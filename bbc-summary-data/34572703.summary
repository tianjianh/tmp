Plans to turn a Victorian Portsmouth prison into flats have been revealed.

City and Country, which owns HMP Kingston, showed the proposals for up to 270 homes at the site.
The developer said if social housing was to be included there would need to be 380 homes built, with blocks of up to 14 storeys instead of seven.
The Ministry of Justice sold the prison in 2014 after it had closed in 2013 to cut costs. The plans are being shown at a public consultation event.
After previous public meetings the public showed most support for a museum, with 28% of the votes, or housing with 21%.
Richard Winsborough, associate director of planning at City and Country, said: "The reason the museum doesn't feature is to make sure this scheme is viable, and residential is the highest value.
"If people think we are missing a trick they can come and tell us."
Under the proposals the gatehouse of the Grade II-listed building built in 1877 would be converted to apartments and be used as pedestrian access to the site.
City and Country is hoping to submit a planning application to Portsmouth City Council in December.
A public consultation takes place from 15:00 BST to 20:00 at the former prison.
