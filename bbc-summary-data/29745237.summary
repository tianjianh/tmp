Tulisa: I don't want to move on after my year of hell

Tulisa Contostavlos is philosophical about her year from hell but says she likes to be reminded about it.

Speaking on The Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Nick Grimshaw, the singer said she didn't want to move on.
"It's because it makes me appreciate the good times," she said. "Life is a rollercoaster and the lower you are the higher you'll go."
Last month, the former N-Dubz singer was found guilty of assaulting a man at a music festival.
The 26-year-old denied hitting celebrity blogger Savvas Morgan at the V Festival in Chelmsford, Essex, in August last year.
She was ordered to pay £3,020, including £2,700 legal costs, a £200 fine and £100 compensation.
Four days earlier, the N-Dubz singer and former X Factor judge's trial over drug dealing claims collapsed.
After two court trials in one year, Tulisa said her fans helped her get through it.
"My fan base were really supportive and stayed with me throughout, others just left me when the trial kicked off," she told Radio 1.
"But when they found out what really happened, people came up to me in the street to support me.
"I feel like the bad times have fired me up, you have to turn negativity into positivity."
It's two years since the singer has released any music.
In 2012, after a stint on X Factor as a judge, she released her debut solo album The Female Boss, but it received poor first week sales.
Before that she was in N-Dubz for 11 years, the Camden-based hip-hop group, with her cousin Dappy and their friend Fazer.
She says things are good between her and Fazer despite the group splitting up in 2011 and he helped with her new single Living Without You.
"I'm back now and it's all about my music," she said.
But don't expect an album anytime soon.
"I have probably got enough material, but at the moment I'm just going to focus on singles. It will be single, single, banger after banger."
And she also played down rumours surrounding a possible appearance on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!
"Those rumours come up every year," she said. "I'm a musician. I've done TV but I've never really been a reality TV star and it's not the route I'm looking to go down and when I do TV I want it to be connected to music.
"I couldn't do it anyway, I wouldn't last five minutes.
"I can't even handle a spider in my bath tub. I'm scared of the dark and I've got ultimate epic bug phobia."
