Mr Eastwood is challenging current leader Alasdair McDonnell, and party activists will vote next month at the annual SDLP conference in Armagh.
Earlier this year, Mr Mallon called on Dr McDonnell to step down as leader.
Asked about Mr Mallon's endorsement of the Foyle MLA, Dr McDonnell said Mr Mallon was "entitled to his opinion".
"People have elected me to do a job and I'm going to do that job," he told BBC NI's The View programme.
"Seamus is a very distinguished member of the party, but we have some 300-odd other delegates out there with opinions.
"The majority have pledged their support to me."
