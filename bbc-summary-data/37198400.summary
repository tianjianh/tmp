Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark says he would love to sign Chris Burke but admits it is "a long shot" that the club will be able to conclude a deal for the player.

The former Rangers winger has been training at Rugby Park this week having worked under Clark at Birmingham City.
"It would be a fantastic way to finish the transfer window," Clark said.
"I think it's a very long shot, but you live in hope. You never know in this game and we'll see what we can do."

Speaking after his side's 1-1 draw with Rangers, Clark said Burke's influence on the young players in his squad has been evident this week.
"I had him at Birmingham. I made him captain for a few games," the Killie boss told BBC Scotland.
"He's a terrific pro, fantastic to have around the place, a great example to the young players I have, to show what it takes to become a top player, which he is.
"It would be difficult (to sign him) but I would love it to happen."
Clark was pleased with his side's performance against Rangers, which saw them withstand a late onslaught with 10 men following Greg Taylor's red card for a wild lunge on Joey Barton shortly after James Tavernier had cancelled out Kris Boyd's opener.
"It feels like a very good performance. I thought we were excellent," Clark continued.
"When you go down to 10 men against a team like Rangers, who pass it and rotate around the pitch the way they do with the quality they have, for us to stay in the game, we have only been pegged back by a world-class free-kick.
"I thought we were real value for our lead at half-time and I just thought the performance was very, very good.
"I've said to them that that's the standard for our performance level. We have to be ready to repeat that once the games come back after the international break.
"Remember we've won a game. Some teams in the league haven't won a game. We have to knock the negativity around this football club on its head.
"It's not doom and gloom in our dressing room that seems to be circulating on the outside."
