Shrewsbury sign Reading defender Zak Jules and Norwich midfielder Ebou Adams

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town have signed teenage Reading defender Zak Jules for an undisclosed fee on a two-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The League One club have also signed Norwich City midfielder Ebou Adams on loan until January.
Adams, 21, signed from non-league Dartford in February 2016, will be making his second loan move from Carrow Road, having had a brief three-game stint with Braintree last season.
Jules, 20, did not play a first-team game for the Royals.
But he did make 10 Scottish Premiership appearances for Motherwell during a loan spell last season, and he was a member of the Scotland Under-20 squad that finished third at the recent Toulon tournament.
Shrewsbury have now made five summer signings, having previously brought in strikers Lenell John-Lewis and Arthur Gnahoua and midfielder Jon Nolan.
