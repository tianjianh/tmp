Christian Nade's early strike gave the Sons a 1-0 lead at the interval.
But goals from Ryan Hardie, Aidan Connolly and James Craigen in the second half secured Rovers a seventh win in their last nine unbeaten games.
Steven Saunders' last-minute goal came too late for Dumbarton, who remain five points clear of Livingston.
