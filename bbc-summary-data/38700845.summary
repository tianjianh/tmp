Patrick Bauer and Nathan Byrne helped Karl Robinson's men complete a perfect smash and grab, cancelling out Zach Clough's free-kick.
A victory which furthers the Addicks' own play-off ambitions was made all the more impressive considering that they were a man short from the 12th minute onwards following Lewis Page's red card.
After Page was sent off for a professional foul on Josh Vela, Clough then made the punishment count double with a brilliant free-kick, his ninth goal of the season.
But Robinson's side refused to lie down, equalising on 23 minutes when Jake Forster-Caskey's free-kick was turned in at the far post by defender Bauer.
The Addicks then grabbed a shock lead in first-half stoppage time when Forster-Caskey led an impressive counter, feeding Byrne to slot the ball under the advancing Ben Alnwick.
Bolton, now without a win in their last five games in all competitions, threw all they had at Charlton after that and struck the woodwork when Andrew Taylor's cross deflected off Chris Solly.
They failed to seriously test goalkeeper Declan Rudd in the second half, however, as they slipped to a second consecutive 2-1 defeat in front of their own fans.
Charlton, unbeaten since Christmas, have now picked up 11 points from their last five matches to climb to 11th, just six points off a play-off place.
