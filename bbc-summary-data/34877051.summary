[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man and his uncle have received life sentences after being found guilty of shooting dead a teenager in south London to "teach him a lesson".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Purdy, 18, was shot in the head in Bermondsey after confronting his girlfriend's ex, Michael Bagnall, about "threatening" messages.
Bagnall, 22, of Hospital Way, Lewisham, must serve at least 28 years.
His uncle Andrew Bayne, 37, of Trundleys Terrace, Lewisham was sentenced to at least 30 years.
During the trial at the Old Bailey, jurors heard that they both suffered from learning disabilities, but Judge Christopher Moss said they were still "able to organise and carry out this dreadful murder".
As they were led from the dock, Bagnall launched into a tirade of abuse at the judge and shouted out "I'm glad he's dead" in the courtroom packed with Ben's family.
In a statement, Ben's mother, Joanne Treston-Smith, said: "The void that Ben's death has left will never be filled. We will always have him missing in our lives."
The court heard that the murder followed a feud between Michael Bagnall and the victim, who was going out with the Bagnall's ex-girlfriend.
Bagnall was said to have resented the new relationship and sent the girl "threatening messages" by phone or Facebook.
On the day of his murder, Ben Purdy decided to confront Bagnall, tracking him down in which led to a "skirmish" in Bermondsey, south London.
After that encounter, the jury heard Bagnall and and his uncle Andrew Bayne decided Mr Purdy needed to be "taught a lesson".
The pair armed themselves with a self loading pistol and an array of other weapons and got in a car to scour the streets for Mr Purdy and his friends.
When they caught up with them, Bayne shot Mr Purdy in the head on 23 November 2014. He died in hospital the next day.
