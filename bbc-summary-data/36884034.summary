They will face a select side from the east African country's Premier League as part of a major sponsorship deal signed with SportPesa.
The game will be "part of Kenya's campaign to compete in the World Cup for the first time in 2022", SportPesa chief executive Ronald Karauri said.
Hull have signed a club record deal with the Kenyan online gaming company.
On the club's website, Hull said the deal is a multi-million pound contract for three years and includes the company's name and logo appearing on the team shirts for the next three seasons.
