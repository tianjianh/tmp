Wrexham manager Gary Mills is relishing his first cross-border derby against Chester in the National League on Saturday.

Mills experienced the Nottingham derby for both Forest and Notts County and also played in East Midlands derbies.
The former Leicester City player recognises derby matches are special occasions for both sets of supporters.
"For a manager it's only three points but for the fans it's a little bit more," he said.
"Living in the area, if you don't win you're reminded of it and if you do you've got a big smile on your face walking down the high street.
"The fans have been magnificent for us this season so we've got to try and repay them on Saturday and get them the win."
Wrexham have received international clearance for new loan signings Joe Quigley and Jon Nolan.
Chester beat Wrexham 2-1 in last season's corresponding fixture with the Dragons winning the return at the Racecourse in March.
