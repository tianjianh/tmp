Pose. Snap. Filter. Upload. These are the steps many will take on National Selfie Day.

Named as word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries in 2013, the selfie has stuck around.
Here are some famous examples.
Justin Timberlake wasn't quite N Sync with the rules of casting a ballot when he voted in the US elections in 2016.
The singer uploaded a photo of himself voting inside the polling station, which has been illegal in Tennessee since 2015.
Despite his good intentions to encourage people to vote on Instagram, Timberlake could have faced up to 30 days in prison or a fine of $50 (Â£40), or both.
UK astronaut Tim Peake's journey into space captivated the nation. He was the first astronaut representing Britain to carry out a spacewalk and naturally took a selfie to remember the moment.
And it was nothing short of out of this world. Sorry.
"It will "be etched in my memory forever - quite an incredible feeling", he said.
Relations between the UK, US and Denmark were strong back in 2013. Former PM David Cameron, former US President Barack Obama and former Denmark PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt posed in what was described as one of the highest-powered selfies ever snapped.
The trio posed for the picture at the memorial service for former South African President Nelson Mandela but not everybody enjoyed it.
Some critics said they were "disrespectful" and "inappropriate" at the event.
Two gymnasts at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games showed the two parts of Korea could get on - at least for a moment.
Lee Eun-ju of South Korea and Hong Un-jong of the North took a smiling selfie together during the training period before the games started.
The pictures of the two women were widely praised at the time as capturing the Olympic spirit.
The Britons who competed at Rio 2016 also got in on the selfie action. But unlike the Korean gymnasts they waited until after the Games.
Members of Team GB, who won gold medals, were snapped on their flight home with a British Airways cabin crew member.
Revellers flocked to not only get a glimpse of Pope Francis but also to take a selfie with him.
These musicians looked extremely pleased to have been able to capture the moment during his Jubilee audience in St Peter's Square, in Rome, in 2016.
Christine Beynon came out as female in her mid-60s. She documented her transition in a series of selfie portraits.
Christine talks about growing up in a conservative village in Ireland, and deciding to publicly embrace her identity many years later.
People holding up four fingers in selfies attracted a lot of high profile attention from celebrities like Tom Hardy, Kristen Bell and David Tennant. But it wasn't a new peace sign... its aim was to raise awareness for mental health.
One in four people are affected by mental health issues, the BBC's controller of factual commissioning said.
Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw said he wanted to get involved "to help people realise they're not alone".
"Having mental health issues is nothing to be ashamed about."
