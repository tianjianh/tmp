[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former detective sergeant wrongly convicted of rape has been granted a judicial review into his dismissal.

After Trevor Gray was jailed in May 2012, his wife traced a witness whose evidence led to his conviction being quashed on appeal in 2013.
When he returned to work, Mr Gray was suspended and then sacked following a Nottinghamshire Police investigation - a decision upheld by a tribunal.
The review will take place on a date to be fixed between 25 April and 27 May.
Updates on this story and more from Nottinghamshire
An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report into the original investigation by Nottinghamshire Police - seen by the BBC - had initially recommended two senior detectives with the force, who looked into the case, face misconduct proceedings.
But the IPCC and the force agreed the pair would face no formal sanctions, and instead were "given management action relating to performance development".
IPCC lead investigator Stephen Webb also said one of the two detectives did not have the necessary qualification to lead the investigation, as the officer had not achieved a level 2 PIP accreditation.
Mr Gray, who had 25 years' experience with Nottinghamshire Police, said he still felt "an element of bitterness" over spending 14 months in prison.
"It shouldn't have happened," he said. "I look forward to having the perverse decision of the force in dismissing me overturned."
He added he would be making a claim for compensation, but said that was currently on hold pending the outcome of the review.
Mr Gray, of Watnall, Nottinghamshire, was retried and acquitted in February 2014.
A Nottinghamshire Police spokeswoman said: "The force acknowledges the IPCC report from July 2015... and has recognised there is some learning for the force."
An IPCC spokesman said it was "considering" making the report public.
