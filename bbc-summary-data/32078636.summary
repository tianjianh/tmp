Cyril Smith M1 arrest: Five witnesses come forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five people have come forward to help an investigation into claims Cyril Smith was released from police custody despite images of child abuse being found in his car boot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week it was revealed an inquiry had been launched into the Liberal MP's arrest on the M1 in Northamptonshire.
But he was released from custody after making a telephone call to a third party in London, it has been claimed.
Northamptonshire Police has not revealed details of the five people.
After the force started its investigation into the arrest, officers appealed for anyone with information on Mr Smith, who died in 2010, to get in touch.
In particular it called for retired police officers who may have been involved in his arrest or had knowledge of it to contact the force.
It said it was not prepared to reveal if former officers were among those who have got in touch so far.
Labour MP Simon Danczuk first made the claim in his book about Smith, published last year.
Despite being taken into the police station, the material said to have been found in Smith's boot disappeared, Mr Danczuk said.
