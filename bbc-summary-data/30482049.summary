Three-year-old Scarlett Kent was having breakfast when the vehicle slammed into the dining room, leaving her pinned against a wall by the dining table.
Her father Carl Kent said: "I believed the dining table saved her life".
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) later arrested an 18-year-old man over the crash on Dudley Road in Irlam, Salford, on Sunday morning.
A police spokesman said officers spotted the red Volkswagen Passat - which had been reported stolen the previous evening - at about 09:15 GMT.
Officers chased the car after the driver refused to stop, GMP said.
The 18-year-old, who was arrested on suspicion of the vehicle's theft, dangerous driving and failing to stop after a collision, remains in custody.
Mr Kent said he was washing up in the kitchen when he heard an "almighty bang".
"My daughter was screaming. I came in to see she had fallen off the chair and the next thing you knew, there's a car in my dining table," he told BBC North West Today.
"She was screaming, she was hysterical. I had to pick her up and get her away from the dining table and the chair. She was trapped obviously and very upset.
"We're still in shock to be honest. It's not really hit home. We've got no dining room - it's ruined Christmas really."
Police are appealing for anyone with relevant information to contact them.
