[SN]TITLE[SN]
Poorer students to pursue interests outside school thanks to new scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pupils from poorer backgrounds will get help to follow their interests outside school in a new scheme launched by the Welsh government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The "Pupil Offer" will allow pupils to work with organisations in the arts, science, sport, culture and heritage.
Students in the first three years of secondary education will take part when it is launched in September.
Sports Wales, The Arts Council and the National Museum of Wales will all be involved among others.
The 40 schools in the scheme are already part of the Schools Challenge Cymru initiative, where Â£20m has been given to under performing schools to help them improve.
In November, education minister Huw Lewis told a conference of university leaders he expected them to get involved with the Pupil Offer by opening their doors and facilities to pupils.
Concerns were raised, however, about how practical that would be as students would need background checks before working with under-18s.
