A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the South Island on Monday (11:02 GMT on Sunday) - killing at least two people - was followed hours later by one of 6.3.
Christchurch, about 110 miles away from the epicentre, felt the quake strongly.
But after engineers checked the Hagley Oval, the venue for the Test, it remains on schedule to take place.
New Zealand bowler Matt Henry, who lives in Christchurch, said he "woke up to quite a long rumble" which was "a bit scary".
He said cricket "always brings a community together", adding: "For a brief moment, you can get back to a bit of normality.
"It's probably good timing to have the Test match this week and it will be a really good occasion."
The tremors were felt about 120 miles north in Nelson, where the Pakistan squad were staying.
Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur told TVNZ: "We were on the seventh floor of the hotel and it was pretty scary.
"The boys all raced downstairs and most of the guys slept in the team room. They were a bit scared to go back up to their rooms."
The second Test will take place in Hamilton on the North Island from 25 November.
Pakistan women, who are also touring New Zealand, were on the 13th floor of a hotel in Christchurch when the tremors started.
They are due to play New Zealand in the fourth one-day international on Thursday.
