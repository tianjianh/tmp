Aurigny's jet has been grounded after suffering its third bird strike in the 20 months it has been in service.

The Embraer was hit on Monday night on a flight from Guernsey to Gatwick.
The airline said there was no danger to passengers but the plane had been grounded for engineering tests.
Aurigny chief executive Mark Darby said they had chartered an alternative aircraft while the jet is out of action.
Flights were disrupted in September 2015 after a plane hit a buzzard as it took off from Guernsey Airport.
In August 2014 there were delays when a bird hit the jet as the aircraft was bound for London airport.
The Embraer 195 operated its first flight between Guernsey and Gatwick in July 2014.
Mr Darby said one cause of the strikes could be the way "birds are managed at different airfields" but added he was unable to say at what point the bird-strike took place.
