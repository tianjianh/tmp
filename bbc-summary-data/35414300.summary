Hibernian: Kevin Thomson keen to continue playing role

Hibernian player-coach Kevin Thomson sees his long-term future in management but hopes he can still help the club reach the Premiership as a player.

Thomson started his third spell at Easter Road last week having negotiated his release with Dundee's Paul Hartley.
"I had a chat with the manager at Dundee and felt that the travelling was really hard on the body," the midfielder told BBC Scotland.
"I'm only 31. I feel as though I can contribute."
Thomson was Dundee captain but had made only 12 appearances for the Premiership side this season because of a number of niggling injuries, before the chance came to return to a club sitting second in the Championship.
"I thought about not so much calling it a day but potentially looking at a new opportunity and this opportunity arrived straight after and it was certainly something that I couldn't pass up," he said.
Thomson has had a career plagued with injury and feels that these may now be catching up with him, the reason why he has been unable to play as much as he would have liked this season.
"I have had two knee reconstructions, two ACL ligament ruptures, after which I have had screws put in both knees," said the former Rangers midfielder, capped three times for Scotland.
"I also broke my leg four times at Middlesbrough in the space of a year.
"I don't want any sympathy, but it's always nice to get some respect when people know how hard you have had to dig to get back to where you got to.
"I feel as if I've got a couple of years to give and, if I can do that then retire, I will be a happy lad."
Thomson was speaking ahead of Saturday's League Cup semi-final against St Johnstone at Tynecastle.
Hibs last lifted the League Cup in 2007, when they defeated Kilmarnock 5-1 at a rain-soaked Hampden Park, but Thomson had left the club a few months earlier to join Rangers so missed out on a winners' medal.
"I would have loved to have been on that pitch and been involved," said Thomson, who will have a coaching role with Hibs' academy. "The team were terrific at Hampden.
"It is hard when you are a Hibby and you're here as a captain and they go on to lift the cup and potentially that could have been me.
"It is not a regret as such, but I would have loved to have been there myself.
"Jealousy is probably the right word. I was probably jealous of the starting 11 and the two or three subs that got on that day."
