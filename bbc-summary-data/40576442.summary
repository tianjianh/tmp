[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Colchester loanee Pyke, 19, scored twice for Vale in a pre-season friendly win over non-league neighbours Kidsgrove on Saturday.
Pyke failed to score in 12 outings for Colchester last season after joining the Essex club on loan during the January transfer window.
Vale have signed two other strikers Tom Pope and Tyrone Barnett this summer.
Boss Michael Brown has also made six other close-season signings, winger Cristian Montano, goalkeepers Rob Lainton and Sam Hornby, and defenders Joe Davis, Graham Kelly and Antony Kay.
They are also expected to sign experienced full-back Lawrie Wilson following his release from promoted Championship side Bolton Wanderers.
