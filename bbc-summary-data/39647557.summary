Avan Mogridge, 32, of Church Street, Stamford, Lincolnshire, attacked the 18-year-old woman in a wooded area off Parkway, Guildford, on 22 October 2016.
After pleading not guilty a jury convicted him by a majority of 10:2 of two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one threat to kill.
He was listed on the Sex Offender Register and remanded for sentencing at Guildford Crown Court on 19 May.
Commenting on Wednesday's verdict, DC Tim Faltermeyer of Surrey Police, said: "This was a brutal attack on a young woman who was going about her normal day to day business when she was subject to a prolonged vicious attack.
"I would like to commend the victim for the great courage and bravery she has shown throughout this investigation and the trial.
"Thanks to her bravery Mogridge has been brought to justice for the horrifying crimes he committed that day. I hope that this verdict enables the victim to somehow get closure for the horrifying ordeal she was subject to that morning."
