Khan was convicted and sentenced for killing a homeless man in a hit-and-run case but was bailed pending an appeal.
He had sought leave from the Bombay high court to travel on 28 May.
The organisers of the Arab Indo Bollywood Awards said last week that he had already confirmed his attendance. He is to star in the finale on Friday.
The actor is due to perform two dances.
Khan is one of the most bankable stars in Bollywood with a huge fan base. He has appeared in more than 80 Hindi-language films.
He was convicted of culpable homicide on 6 May and sentenced to five years in prison.
But two days later, the high court granted him bail and suspended his sentence pending the hearing and disposal of his appeal against the conviction.
The high court said the actor would need to seek the court's permission to leave India.
The suspension of his sentence was welcomed by his fans but others argued that most do not have the benefit of having cases expedited in the same way.
A man was killed and four others injured in 2002 when he ran them over as they slept on a pavement in Mumbai.
