The deal, reportedly worth more than Â£100,000 a week, replaces the five-year agreement he signed in February 2015.
"Everyone knows what I feel for this club," said Kane, 23, who has scored five goals in 17 England appearances.
"To sign another contract is a special feeling. We have got a great young squad and the club is moving in the right direction."
Kane has scored six goals in 10 appearances for Spurs this season, despite missing 10 games with an ankle injury.
He scored 21 times in the top flight in 2014-15 and won the Golden Boot with 25 league goals last season.
