A bid is being worked up which could attract about £1m for the regeneration of a historic Borders town centre.

Scottish Borders Council and community groups in Jedburgh hope to establish a Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme.
It could allow access to a funding programme managed by Historic Environment Scotland.
It is hoped an application could be submitted later this summer. If the bid is successful it would run for five years from April 2017 to March 2022.
Among the building repair projects which could be funded are works at the Port House building, the Abbey ramparts and the Canongate Bridge.
A similar scheme has already been delivered in Kelso which saw improvements to eight priority buildings and repairs to 30 other properties.
Another project is ongoing in Selkirk.
Councillor Ron Smith said: "As we have seen with the successful Kelso scheme, the funding, including that leveraged from the private sector, can make a significant positive impact on the town with a much improved town centre and retail vacancy rates significantly reduced, and I wish the same success for Jedburgh.
"This partnership approach has also helped to stimulate the private sector in Kelso and we now have a very proactive Chamber of Trade working together to promote the town and encourage new visitors to stay and spend."
Councillors Jim Brown, Sandy Scott and Rory Stewart, who represent Jedburgh said they were fully supportive of the bid.
"Following the success of the Kelso scheme, we welcome the opportunity to bid for additional funding for Jedburgh's historic town centre," they said in a joint statement.
"The town is an important gateway to Scotland and we are keen to work with all our partners to encourage new spend and investment in the town to ensure Jedburgh remains a key visitor destination."
