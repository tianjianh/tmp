Under-threat Lloyd George museum given Budget cash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Gwynedd museum dedicated to the only Welsh prime minister is set to be saved after receiving a financial boost in Chancellor George Osborne's Budget.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lloyd George Museum in Llanystumdwy will get £27,000 a year over three years from 2017/18.
It is the same amount Gwynedd council will cut from the venue's funding which put its future at risk.
Dion Hamer, from the museum, said the funding was "great news".
The museum was established in 1947, two years after David Lloyd George died. His second wife, Frances, left some land in the village to build a permanent memorial to her husband.
The museum launched a £250,000 centenary appeal earlier this year.
