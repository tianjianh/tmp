A stationary Toyota was taken after the suspected thief had a "confrontation" with the driver on a slip road near to the A3.
The two youngsters were still in the car, unharmed, when it was later abandoned in the Whiteley Village area.
Officers had earlier tried to stop a car travelling clockwise on the M25 near junction nine at Leatherhead.
The vehicle failed to stop when requested by officers shortly before 10:00 BST before coming to a halt on the junction 10 slip road with the A3 at Wisley.
Members of the public reported that a number of people got out of the car and ran from the vehicle.
Police said it is believed several people ran from the scene and possibly across the A3.
One is believed to have run to a nearby slip road and stolen the Toyota.
"The dangerous driving and subsequent actions of the vehicle occupants put the lives of other road users at risk," said Det Insp Pete Howgate.
