The incident took place in Ladyburn Street in the Seedhill area of the town at about 18:30 on Saturday.
The 22-year-old was attacked from behind. His daughter was uninjured.
Police have appealed for help in finding the suspect for the "unprovoked and violent attack" - a white man, about 5ft 7in tall and of slim build, with untidy short dark curly hair.
He was said to be wearing a navy blue top and tracksuit trousers.  He was of gaunt appearance and had a plaster on his face just under his left eye.
The injured man was taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital where he was treated and released the next day.
