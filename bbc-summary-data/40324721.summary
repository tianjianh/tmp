[SN]TITLE[SN]
Humber Bridge could get zip wire and abseiling under new plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Experiences for "adrenaline junkies" are among revised plans being drawn up to transform the Humber Bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A zip wire, abseiling and "walking of the bridge's cables" are being considered, in addition to a visitor centre and glass lift.
Last November, East Riding of Yorkshire Council rejected proposals which included a hotel, restaurant and an office block.
Bosses said they wanted to turn the bridge into a tourist destination.
Kevin Moore, chief executive of the Humber Bridge Board, said the office block plans had been shelved but they were still considering whether to include the hotel and restaurant.
"We want to bring in adrenaline experiences, so safely walking the cables, possibly abseiling, a zip wire. These are all things some people may want to do here.
"Obviously we've got to look at the health and safety implications. But we really want to interpret the bridge in as wide a way as we possibly can."
The initial proposals would have allowed visitors to travel under the bridge at Hessle in a glass gondola before changing to the lift which would have ascended 510ft (155m) to the top of the north tower. These plans are now being reviewed.
Mr Moore said they would have a "revised concept" formed by December, which would then be submitted to the authority.
The council's planning committee voted against the original scheme because of concerns over the 60,000 sq ft office block.
