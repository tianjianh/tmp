Glasgow Airport has won its second major award this year, after being crowned UK Airport of the Year at the National Transport Awards in London.

The airport was recognised for its efforts in growing passenger numbers, securing new routes and its commitment to customer service.
The award follows Glasgow's success in claiming the title of Scottish Airport of the Year in June.
This year alone, the airport has secured 26 new routes and services.
It has also recorded double-digit growth in passenger numbers every month since November 2014.
Last week, airport trade body ACI Europe named Glasgow Airport as one of Europe's fastest-growing airports in August.
Over the past 18 months, Glasgow has invested more than Â£25m in terminal redevelopment works.
This included a major refurbishment of international arrivals and the Â£3.5m extension of its east pier, allowing the airport to accommodate an extra 750,000 passengers per year.
Airport managing director Amanda McMillan said: "To have been named both Scottish and UK Airport of the Year is a tremendous honour and it is an achievement the 5,000 people who work at Glasgow Airport can be proud of.
"Together, we have continued to build on the success of 2014 by adding further new routes which has translated into consistent passenger growth.
"We have also made a significant investment in enhancing our facilities for passengers, but the most pleasing aspect has been our operational performance.
"Despite securing an additional one million passengers, 99.4% of passengers have passed through security in less than 10 minutes during 2015. This award really is testament to the efforts of the entire airport campus."
