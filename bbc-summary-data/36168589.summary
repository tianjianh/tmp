Highland Council said the road linking the A82 on the east bank of the River Ness with Dores Road would ease travel across the city.
A campaign had opposed the road's construction because the route will cross areas of green space.
The start of building work could mean delays at the A82's Bught Drive junction for six weeks.
Highland Council expects to spend £55m building the road and creating new rugby pitches and also a new course and clubhouse for Torvean Golf Club.
The project forms part of the £315m Inverness City Region Deal announced in March.
The first stage of the West Link's construction is expected to last until late next year.
By 2020 people should be able to travel from the Southern Distributor Road to the A82, using a new bridge over the River Ness, and avoid having to go through the city centre.
Margaret Davidson, leader of Highland Council, said: "It is good to see this section of the work under way.
"The West Link will deliver significant economic benefits to the city and surrounding area, reducing congestion and enabling jobs and housing development."
