The Ports occupy bottom spot and they are 11 points adrift of Carrick Rangers with four games left.
"We look forward to it and we'll have a good chance against Ballinamallard," said Ports boss Niall Currie.
Ballinamallard are 11 points clear of Rangers, who sit in the relegation play-off place, so they will retain their Premiership status with a win.
Carrick are not in action until Saturday, when they take on Ards, but their destiny may already have been decided by events at Shamrock Park.
Portadown came from behind to beat Carrick 2-1 last weekend and Currie is hoping for a repeat display.
"We've a lot of kids playing at the minute and if they play like they did against Carrick then we have every confidence for this game," he added.

"All our remaining matches are ones we can really challenge for."
Ballinamallard will be without the suspended Ryan McConnell but Stuart Hutchinson is set to return.
"It will be a massive challenge as they are fighting for their lives - it's going be a tough game," said Mallards manager Gavin Dykes.
