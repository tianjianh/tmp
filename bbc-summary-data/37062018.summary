A jazz festival has returned to Powys after supporters rallied round to save it.

Orchard Media and Events Group quit as organiser of the Brecon Jazz weekend last year due to "financial considerations".
But residents came together to raise funds and attract sponsors so it could take place for the 32nd time.
A feasibility study will be done over the weekend to assess the festival's future.
Brecon Jazz project producer, Lisa Davies, said: "The trades are behind it, the town council are behind it, so many members of Brecon are behind it, I think it shows more of a want than a need for it."
