One of the climbers was injured after the pair got into difficulties on Bosigran Cliff, known as Commando Ridge, in Cornwall.
Coastguard rescue teams from Lands End, St Ives and Penzance lifted the climbers to safety on Saturday afternoon.
The poor weather conditions meant a "challenging rescue" said coastguards.
Nic Lonsdale, senior maritime operations officer at Falmouth Coastguard said: "'People who know the area will know why it's called Commando Ridge.
"These teams worked hard and brilliantly to rescue these climbers and did a marvellous job."
