Brits abroad: Photos of expats in Spain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are about five million British expats living and working abroad, with the popular destinations being Australia, Spain and the US. Figures from 2011 suggest that about 3,000 British citizens every week move away from the UK on a long-term basis.

Photographer Charlie Clift decided to track down a few of those and headed to Spain to meet those living on the Mediterranean coast.
"Immigrants are so often spoken about in terms of statistics or stereotypes," he told me. "I want people to understand the variety within a group showing how different each person can be.
"I thought it would be interesting not to focus on immigrants coming into the UK in the way that much of the British media does, but to look the other way, and focus on British people who are immigrants themselves in other countries.
"Some could not speak Spanish and hardly integrated with the locals, whilst others had married Spanish people and educated their children in local schools. I found a common thread of Britishness running through each and every one of my subjects, but beyond that they varied hugely."
Here are a few from the series so far and you can see more on Charlie Clift's Brits Abroad website.
