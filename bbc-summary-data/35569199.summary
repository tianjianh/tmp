Police said it was "totally out of character" for the young woman and are concerned for her welfare.
More than 100 people have been involved in the search operation, including her boyfriend and family.
Devon and Cornwall Police, a Coastguard helicopter and search and rescue helicopter have assisted with the operation, as well as Teignmouth RNLI lifeboat, Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service and Dartmoor Search and Rescue Team.
Torbay Hospital on-call Director Martin Ringrose said: "We are aware that one of our junior doctors is missing.
"Our thoughts are with her family and loved ones at this very distressing time.
"We will do whatever we can to support the authorities investigating her disappearance and searching for her, as well as providing support to her colleagues, who are anxious for her wellbeing."
A police spokesperson said: "We are searching for a missing person and we are extremely concerned for her welfare. The conditions have been rough since she was reported missing.
"We are working with the Coastguard and other agencies."
A statement released by UK Coastguard said they had been called to support the police operation at 6.20pm on February 12.
Torbay, Teignmouth and and Berry Head Coastguards have been involved in the search.
