Greg Binnie, 19, earlier pleaded guilty to running at and making offensive gestures towards Rangers' goalkeeper Wes Foderingham after climbing over fencing at Hampden Park on 21 May.
Binnie must also stay in his home between 20:00 and 06:00 for two months.
The teenager, from Ratho in Edinburgh, was sentenced at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
He was charged under the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act and accused of being engaged in behaviour which was likely to incite trouble.
Binnie was also given a two-year football banning order.
Hibernian FC have issued Binnie with an indefinite ban from watching the team playing or buying any tickets for home or away games.
The court heard Binnie climbed over fencing and entered the field of play immediately after the end of the match between Rangers and Hibs, which the Edinburgh side won 3-2 after a last minute goal.
Binnie, a former SFA intern, was working as a squash coach at George Watson's college in Edinburgh but has since lost his job.
Sheriff Ian Miller told Binnie, who is a sports coaching student: "I see no public utility in sending you to prison, instead I see a much greater public benefit in giving you the chance to use your considerable gift and talent in a way, while giving others a chance to take advantage of this gift and talent."
The court heard Binnie had no previous convictions and testimonies on his behalf from college lecturers and others were given to the court for consideration.
Defence counsel Lorenzo Alonzi described Binnie's actions as "boyhood stupidity".
He said it was "stupidity arising out of the sheer excitement of the situation".
The lawyer said: "Mr Binnie has already been punished significantly as a result of the direct consequence following his actions that day."
The court heard both he and his mother had received threats on social media and that it he was "genuinely remorseful".
