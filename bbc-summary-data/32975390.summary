[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones is meeting his Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon for talks in Edinburgh later.

They are expected to discuss the planned referendum on EU membership and UK ministers' plans to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights.
Both devolved governments oppose the latter move, promising to resist the idea in any way that they can.
Both are also firmly in favour of continuing membership of the EU.
Ms Sturgeon's SNP has called for Scotland and Wales to have an effective veto in the planned referendum, meaning all nations of the UK would have to vote No before the UK could withdraw.
On Tuesday, Mr Jones described the idea as "morally right" but "legally difficult".
A spokesman for Mr Jones said: "We anticipate that those subject areas will be up for discussion, as well as the economic situation, inter-governmental relations and the respect agenda."
The meeting will take place at Bute House, the Scottish first minister's official residence.
It is the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since Ms Sturgeon became first minister.
