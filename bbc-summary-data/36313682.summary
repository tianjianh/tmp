The 30-year-old moved to Leigh in November on a two-year contract after his release by Salford following a "disciplinary procedure".
Chase won the 2011 Man of Steel while at Castleford, also earning his 11 England caps during a four-year stay.
The New Zealand-born stand-off scored two tries in his five appearances for the Centurions this season, with his last appearance on 1 May.
"He came to Leigh and wanted to fall back in love with the game," owner Derek Beaumont told BBC Radio Manchester. "He came from a difficult situation from Salford and it's proven hard to do that.
"He's had a couple of things that have been made available to him as an opportunity and there are a couple of options he can explore outside of the game.
"He came and spoke to me and felt it was in his best interests if he was given that opportunity and I've accepted that."
Leigh signed Australian former London Broncos half-back Josh Drinkwater this week from West Tigers until the end of the season.
