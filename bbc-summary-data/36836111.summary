The show will be made available the day after it is broadcast on CBS All Access, the network's US subscription streaming service.
It is the franchise's first return to television since 2005 with a new ship, characters and civilisations, although casting has yet to be announced.
Production is set to begin in Toronto in September.
Alex Kurtzman, who co-wrote and produced the blockbuster films Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) will also serve as executive producer for the series.
The Netflix deal will see the show available in 188 countries excluding the US and Canada.
The whole back catalogue of Star Trek TV series will also be made available to watch.
'Hailing on all frequencies'
"Star Trek is already a worldwide phenomenon and this international partnership will provide fans around the world, who have been craving a new series for more than a decade, the opportunity to see every episode virtually at the same time as viewers in the US," said Armando Nunez, CBS Studios president and chief executive officer.
"The new Star Trek will definitely be hailing on all frequencies throughout the planet."
The original Star Trek spawned 13 feature films and five television series.
It was last on screen with Enterprise, which was set a century before the original series featuring Captain Kirk, and ran from 2001 to 2005.
Paramount Pictures confirmed this week it had approved plans for a fourth Star Trek film featuring the current crew of the starship Enterprise.
Producer JJ Abrams has said the role of Chekov, played by Anton Yelchin who was killed by his own car at his home last month, will not be recast.
The actor's parents took out a full-page advert in the Hollywood Reporter on Monday to thank the industry for the support they have received since his death.
"We are deeply grateful for your unconditional love for our son. He would be surprised by how many hearts and souls he touched," they said.
