Australia thrashed Ireland, who were already eliminated after losing their first three group games, by seven wickets in Delhi.
But they needed New Zealand to beat South Africa to clinch their place in the last four.
The White Ferns duly recorded a seven-wicket victory to top the group with four wins from four matches.
Australia finished second and could face England in the semi-finals on Wednesday if England beat Pakistan in their last group game in Chennai on Monday.
England lead Group B with six points, while West Indies and Pakistan have four each and India have two.
Ireland's openers failed to score from the first 11 deliveries as Australia bowled a tight line.
Clare Shillington broke the shackles with a six and then hit three successive boundaries before falling for 22.
Cecelia Joyce hit three fours in her 22, but the Irish managed only two boundaries in the last 15 overs.
Kim Garth top-scored with 27, but took 46 balls to do so, and in total there were 65 dot balls in Ireland's 91-7.
Ciara Metcalfe dismissed Australia's Alyssa Healy for six, courtesy of a superb one-handed catch by skipper Isobel Joyce.
Garth saw off Meg Lanning, the top-ranked international women's batter, but Elyse Villani stroked six boundaries in her 43 from 35 balls, before being well caught by Lucy O'Reilly off Garth with just seven required.
Ellyse Perry finished unbeaten on 29 as Australia eased home with 40 balls to spare.
In Bangalore, South Africa were bowled out for 99 after being sent in to bat by New Zealand, with Sophie Devine and Leigh Kasperek grabbing three wickets each.
The White Ferns replied with an opening stand of 57 between skipper Suzie Bates, who hit 29 off 25 balls, and Rachel Priest, who smashed a run-a-ball 28.
Both openers fell in the space of two overs, but Devine hit an unbeaten 27 with three fours and a six to complete a dominant all-round performance.
