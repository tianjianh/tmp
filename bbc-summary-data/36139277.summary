Second-row Markham, 24, is leaving for France after four seasons with the islanders to join Stade Rouennais.
Prop Herriott, 23, is moving to fellow Championship side Rotherham.
Meanwhile, hooker Martin Garcia-Veiga, 29, will return to his native Argentina, and back Aaron Penberthy is undecided if he wants to stay.
The 23-year-old told BBC Radio Jersey: "I'm not too sure what I want to do. This season hasn't been my greatest in terms of game-time, so I need to think about what's best for me.
"I'm pretty sure we'll find out what's happening in the next few weeks. I've been through a lot at Jersey and we'll see what happens in the next few weeks."
Herriott confirmed he would be moving back to England to join a side four places below sixth-placed Jersey in the second tier for family reasons.
"I'm going to Rotherham because my girlfriend is pregnant, otherwise it would have been a nice place to stay," he said.
Jersey finished the season with a 34-0 home defeat by Yorkshire Carnegie, the first time this millennium that Jersey have failed to score in a home league game.
