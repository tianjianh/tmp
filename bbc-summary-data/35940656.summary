Andrew Frankish, 22, and his brother Daniel, 19, both from Redcar, were given 21-week jail sentences suspended for two years after attacking a bulldog named Baby, who was later put down.
Footage of Andrew Frankish repeatedly throwing Baby down stairs and stamping on her was released by the RSPCA.
More than 250,000 people have signed an online petition.

Both brothers, who admitted causing unnecessary suffering to Baby, were also given a six-month curfew and banned from keeping animals for life.
Redcar's Labour MP Anna Turley and UKIP MEP Jonathon Arnott both said the pair should have been jailed when they appeared before magistrates in Hartlepool.
Ms Turley, who has asked Justice Secretary Michael Gove to review the sentence, said: "I am disgusted by their actions.
"Lots of my constituents have contacted me expressing their horror at this cruel attack and the disbelief that the perpetrators have avoided jail.
"My fear is that the leniency of their sentencing will send a message to the brothers and other animal abusers that law enforcement is indifferent to animal welfare, which is why I have written to the minister asking for sentencing practices to be reviewed."
Mr Arnott said: "What more barbaric suffering does someone have to inflict on an animal before they are sent straight to jail?
"I am glad that they have been banned from keeping animals for life but I have no doubt that all right-minded people think that a 21-week suspended sentence was insufficient punishment."
