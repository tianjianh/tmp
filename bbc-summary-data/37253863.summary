The Met said the three injured girls - two aged 13 and one aged eight - were related to Makayah and his aunt, who was a 34-year-old hairdresser.
The car struck the group at about 14:05 BST on Lennard Road. It had been pursued by police from nearby Birkbeck Road in Beckenham.
One witness said the car was being followed by two police vehicles when the driver "lost control and ploughed into a family".
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating.
Over the past 10 years, 252 members of the public have died following road traffic incidents involving the police in England and Wales, according to the IPCC.
In London, there were 498 crashes involving a pursuit by Met officers in 2015-16.
Friends and neighbours left floral tributes at the scene of the crash on Thursday.
Family friend Emma Cameron called the news "devastating" and said Ms Cooper was "a genuinely lovely girl".
"She never had a bad word to say about anybody. She was the kindest friendliest warmest person. It's just awful," she added.
Makayah had recently auditioned for a part in a television series.
His agent Sam Brown, managing director of Brown and Mills Entertainment, described Makayah as "an extremely talented young actor" and "joy to be around".
"We cannot express enough our sadness and our thoughts are with the family at this terrible time," she added.
A victim support fund for those injured in the crash on the Gofundme website had raised nearly Â£5,000 by Friday morning.
