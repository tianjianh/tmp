[SN]TITLE[SN]
New meningitis vaccine for students and children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Young people have been urged to have a new vaccine protecting them from potentially life-threatening meningitis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The advice from Wales' chief medical officer Dr Ruth Hussey comes after a rise in meningococcal group W cases.
Available from Monday, it replaces the meningitis C vaccine and also offers protection from A and Y strains of the disease.
Children aged 13 to 18 and students are eligible.
Dr Hussey said secondary school-aged children were at an increased risk of getting the disease and said those who have already had the MenC vaccine should get the latest jab too.
All students under 25 who are attending university for the first time in the autumn are advised to get the vaccine from their GP surgery at least two weeks before they start.
People born between 1 September, 1996, and 31 August, 1997, can get it from their GP, while younger people will have it at their surgery or in school in the next two years.
