The 38-year-old, who played 297 games for Luton, joins on a three-month loan with a view to a permanent move.
Tyler, whose Luton deal expires in June, is unlikely to play this term due to back injury.
"I am delighted to be back and I can't wait to start working with the goalkeepers," Tyler said.
"I am 38, 39 next month, but I am still raring to go when it comes to playing and I can't wait to get started on the training ground."
Tyler's first spell with League One side Peterborough lasted 15 years, before he left for Luton in 2009.
Posh manager Graham Westley said: "Mark is legendary at the club in terms of his past, he is ambitious to build his career from playing into coaching and is anxious to have the opportunity to play as well.
"He brings a wealth of goalkeeping expertise and he has the ambition to go into coaching, so all of the boxes are ticked and we are delighted to have him here."
