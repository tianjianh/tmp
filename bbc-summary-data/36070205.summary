Celtic have no plans to sack manager Ronny Deila following Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Rangers.

Pressure has been growing on the Norwegian for some time.
Some fans believe the defeat by their rivals at Hampden Park was the final straw, with a number taking to social media to call for his sacking.
But it is understood that the Glasgow club will now concentrate on retaining the Scottish Premiership title with Deila in charge.
The 40-year-old's side were beaten by the Championship winners after a penalty shoot following a 2-2 draw with their city rivals.
However, despite the man himself admitting he faces an uncertain future, it would appear that Celtic intend to continue with Deila until at least the end of the season.

They are eight points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the table with five games remaining.
And there is a fear that any change of manager now might disrupt their progress to what would be a fifth consecutive league title.
Deila, who previously led Stromsgodset to the Norwegian title, took over at Celtic after the departure of Neil Lennon in 2014.
He led Celtic to the league title, while they also lifted the Scottish League Cup, in his first season.
On the downside, they lost to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in last season's Scottish Cup semi-final and to Ross County in this campaign's League Cup last four.
Deila's side also lost to Malmo in a play-off to reach the Champions League group stage before finishing bottom of their Europa League section.
