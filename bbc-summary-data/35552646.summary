[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lance Sgt Matthew Lawson, 37, who had just shared an early Valentine's meal with his wife in Kingston-upon-Thames, saw the teenager running towards them with police in hot pursuit.
Mr Lawson, from Derby, stuck out his foot and tripped the man up.
Footage of the incident has been viewed thousands of times online.
Police in Kingston said he was a "legend".
Lance Sgt Lawson is based at Wellington Barracks beside Buckingham Palace. He plays the euphonium in the Band of the Scots Guards, who will perform for the Queen on her 90th birthday in June.
He said: "I heard a shout of 'Stop! Police!' and immediately my military training just kicked in.
"I saw the policemen chasing a guy and I thought 'He's a bit of a whippet, they'll never catch him.'. So I reckoned I'd buy them a few seconds, and just stuck my leg out to trip him up.
"The guy fell and as the police grabbed him, they called back 'cheers, mate, thank you' and my wife and I just continued on our way and thought nothing more of it."
