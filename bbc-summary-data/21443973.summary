Apple Shop muddle prompts new name for Wroxham Barns store

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Norfolk business called the Apple Shop says it has had to change its name after becoming inundated with complaints about iPhones and iPads.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The shop, at Wroxham Barns, said it had received up to 24 calls a week since the technology giant opened a store in Norwich in 2009.
Owner Geoff Fisher, who sells cider and juice, said it was amusing at first, but some callers had been rude.
He said the shop would be renamed The Norfolk Cider Shop from Easter.
Mr Fisher said: "I've had complaints about broken iPods and dropped iPads and Apple Macs. It can be very funny, but some people are very rude and they slam the phone down.
"My telephone number has a Norwich prefix and so people unawares ring up the Apple Shop. All I can say to them is, 'I'm very sorry, I cant help you, but please do come along and get some proper Norfolk cider to get over your sorrows'."
The Apple Shop was opened at Wroxham Barns - a collection of shops near the Broads village - 20 years ago by Mr Fisher's brother, Stephen, after he started up the Norfolk Cider Company in 1987.
Mr Fisher said Apple had not forced him into the change and he had "a lot of respect" for the company.
He said: "My most amusing caller was an elderly gentleman who rang up and the first thing he said was, 'I've been very silly'.
"'I said, what's the problem? He said, 'I'm 87, and I've gone and bought an Apple Mac and I don't know how to use it'.
"I said, 'Well, I'm very sorry, you have been very silly, perhaps you should give it to your grandchildren'."
