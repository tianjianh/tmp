McKenzie grabbed his fifth goal of the season in the 12th minute as he fired home from 35 yards after a poor clearance from goalkeeper Zander Clark.
Sean Longstaff almost doubled Killie's lead on the half hour mark, but his shot was well saved by Clark.
Conor Sammon doubled Killie's lead midway through the second half as he headed home Greg Taylor's cross.
Despite their third win in a row at McDiarmid Park, Kilmarnock remain in eighth place in the Premiership as Dundee and Partick Thistle also won.
With Hearts losing at Firhill, St Johnstone missed an opportunity to move into fourth place.
Kilmarnock fully deserved the win in a game in which they always looked the more threatening team.
The side under caretaker Lee McCulloch dominated the first half and created the better of the chances throughout.
Quick thinking and superb execution from McKenzie fired the visitors in front, with the midfielder's spectacular looping shot sailing over Clark.
Killie had gone close just eight minutes earlier when Kris Boyd's free kick from 25 yards was palmed away by the Saints goalkeeper.
David Wotherspoon tested Killie goalkeeper Freddie Woodman with a free kick, but it was easily held.
Conor Sammon then clipped a neat shot goalward from the edge of the area, but Clark stretched full length to beat it away.
Longstaff forced a save from the goalkeeper as the pressure on the home team intensified, but Saints rallied and MacLean's looping header landed on the roof of the net.
St Johnstone had plenty of possession in the second half, but they lacked punch and struggled to test the visitors' goalkeeper.
Sammon added a second for Killie in the 71st minute after finding space at the far post to nod in Greg Taylor's delivery.
Saints continued to work hard but struggled to find a way past the visitors' defence and Killie always looked like they carried the threat of adding to their lead.
They settled for what they had though and that gave them a comfortable and precious away win in Perth.
Tommy Wright St Johnstone Manager
"The first 45 without doubt is the worst I've seen since I've been at the club its was brutal, we didn't do any of the basics well, kept giving the ball away and couldn't get out of our own half, the pitch was bumpy so why did we continue to pass it around our own half and give them opportunities?
We got a reaction in the second half, we were much better, without working the keeper we had opportunities, but we should stop the cross, defend the cross and the keeper should save the header.
We gifted them a goal, Kilmarnock were better but if you look at it we could have got away with a 0-0 if we had defended better, That was poor and we got what we deserved."
Lee McCulloch Kilmarnock Manager
"I'm delighted with the result, delighted with the performance, I thought we stopped St Johnstone playing in the middle of the pitch.
They didn't have any clear cut chances, they are a top team and have a top manager but we're delighted to come here today, score two great goals and have a couple more chances as well.
I thought we looked organised I thought our desire and energy all over the pitch was brilliant today."
