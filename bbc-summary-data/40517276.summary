Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley has told a High Court judge he is a "power drinker" who likes to get drunk.

The Newcastle United owner was giving evidence on the fourth day of a trial in London where he is being sued by investment banker Jeffrey Blue.
Mr Blue says the sportswear tycoon promised to pay him £15m if he used his expertise to increase Sports Direct's share price to £8 each.
However, the finance expert claims he was paid only £1m.
Mr Ashley denies the claim and says Mr Blue is talking "nonsense".
Mr Justice Leggatt has heard the dispute relates to a conversation in a central London pub, called the Horse and Groom, four years ago.
Mr Ashley told the judge he would have had four to five pints within an hour, after being asked how much he had drunk by a lawyer representing Mr Blue.
"It was a fun evening, drinking at pace," he said. "I like to get drunk. I am a power drinker."
Mr Ashley added: "My thing is not to drink regularly. It is binge drinking. I am trying to get drunk."
Mr Ashley also said he had been trying to "have a good night out".
Asked how much Mr Blue had drunk, he replied: "He would never have been able to keep up. He's a lightweight when it comes to drinking."
Mr Ashley went on say he had "never taken a penny out of Sports Direct - salary or otherwise".
He added that he was the "last person to know" at Newcastle United, saying: "They are really not interested in my opinion."
The court was previously told Mr Ashley would regularly hold management meetings in pubs and on one occasion vomited into a fireplace after drinking 12 pints.
The hearing continues.
