The Canadian led the Flyers to sixth place in the Elite League last season and a sixth successive play-off spot.
But they missed out on the final-four weekend after a two-leg quarter-final defeat by Belfast Giants.
Dutiaume admitted he had a big decision to make with the club reconsidering its long-term future.
However, the Flyers announced last week that they will be in the Elite League next season.
"The club had to take a step back at the end of last season, and consider their long-term future and the options available to them, both in this league and in other leagues," said the 43-year-old, who arrived in Kirkcaldy as a player in 1998 before taking over as a coach in 2005.
"I also wanted to take my time to consider my position and my future. To represent this club for almost a quarter of its existence is a huge honour, and something I am extremely proud of.
"When I spoke with the directors regarding the future of the club and the season ahead, I wanted to bring up some of my own concerns.
"I also wanted to express my desire to ensure we get more information out there in the public domain and that we all work hard to be a more engaging and transparent organisation.
"I get that fans are frustrated right now, but we are not able to sign a whole team in such a short period of time.
"We are in advanced talks with a couple of returning guys and I would like to think that we will be in a position to share that information very soon with our fans."
