Measures to secure fostering and adoption services have been announced by the Welsh government.

In August, the largest professional association of social workers wrote to the Welsh government to voice concerns.
That stemmed from the collapse of one of the largest charities in the field, the British Association of Adoption and Fostering (BAAF), in July.
The Wales Adoption Register, which it had run, will now pass to the National Adoption Service (NAS).
Training, consultancy, legal advice and a helpline for the public and professionals will be operated by a new body, set up by adoption agency St David's Children Society.
It will be known as the Association for Fostering and Adoption Cymru @ St David's.
The new body will recruit from former BAAF Cymru staff, with some others transferring to the NAS, an organisation which promotes and supports best practice in adoption across Wales.
Last month, the British Association of Social Workers wrote to Health and Social Services Minister Mark Drakeford to say it was "very concerned" by the BAAF's closure.
Announcing the new arrangements on Wednesday, Mr Drakeford said they would "strengthen and secure" the future of the adoption and fostering services previously provided by BAAF Cymru and safeguard jobs.
"I see these new arrangements as a step towards making the register even more effective and easier to use," he added.
He said there had been "no interruption" to services, with steps taken to ensure the BAAF continued to operate into September.
The BAAF also runs an independent review mechanism, which considers applications for potential adopters who have been turned down.
Mr Drakeford said he hoped to be able to make an announcement on the future of that service "very soon".
