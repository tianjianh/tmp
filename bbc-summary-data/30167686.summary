Sweden's Henrik Stenson has retained his DP World Tour Championship title, winning by two shots in Dubai.

The 38-year-old shot back-to-back birdies on the 17th and 18th to card a 70 and finish 16 under par.
His Ryder Cup team-mates Rory McIlroy, Victor Dubuisson and Justin Rose were tied for second place on 14 under.
Spain's Rafael Cabrera-Bello started the day as joint leader with Stenson but successive double bogeys on the 16th and 17th saw his challenge fade.
Stenson had struggled on the back nine, hitting his tee shot out of bounds on the 11th to gift his playing partner Cabrera-Bello a two-shot lead.
But as the Spaniard collapsed twice hitting the water, Stenson hit a brilliant tee shot on the 17th for a tap-in birdie to reclaim the outright lead.
"It feels great," said Stenson. "I'm exhausted to say the least.
"It was hot out there and tricky on the back nine. I did not play my best and had a shocking hole on 11 which knocked me back, but I did not give up. I just had to dig in there and wait for something to happen.
"I had a couple of close calls this year to get my win and it was not to be. It's been close but eventually you get something if you stick around and I surely did that."
Northern Ireland's world number one McIlroy and Englishman Rose both missed birdie putts on the 18th, finishing joint second with France's Dubuisson.
McIlroy said: "It seemed like no-one took it by the scruff of the neck and I thought if I could post 16 under I might have a chance. I just did not play well enough to win this week."
Ireland's Shane Lowry finished a shot further back in fifth to move into the top 50 in the world rankings.
The win means Stenson stays in second place in the Race to Dubai standings behind McIlroy - who had already made sure of the title a week ago as no challengers can catch him.
