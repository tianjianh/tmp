Man faces trial over 'lottery scam'

A man is to stand trial accused of defrauding almost £33,000 from three women by claiming they had won lottery prizes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]

Mr Sunnie denies two charges, which are alleged to have taken place between August 2013 and August 2014.
A trial will take place in July.
Prosecutors allege Mr Sunnie "became concerned in an arrangement which you knew facilitated the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property".

He denied a charge of fraud and another under the Proceeds of Crime Act at Dundee Sheriff Court.
