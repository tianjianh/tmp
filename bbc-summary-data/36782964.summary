The EastEnders star will be one of 10 celebrities to look into their family trees in the 13th run of the show.
The stories of Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden and pop star Cheryl will also feature in the autumn series.
Executive producer Colette Flight said an "extraordinary range of incredible stories" would be told.
The BBC said Dyer's story would trace his family from "poverty and crime in the East End back through the centuries to an incredible connection to royalty".
It added the investigations into Cheryl's past had discovered her "long forgotten great grandfather, a quintessential Tommy in the First World War", while Holden's featured a "Napoleonic-era cross-channel romance and the forgotten tragedy of Britain's worst ever maritime disaster".
Other celebrities set to feature in the new series include newsreader Sophie Raworth, acting great Sir Ian McKellen, The Royle Family's Ricky Tomlinson, film actor Warwick Davis and ex-Casualty and Strictly Come Dancing star Sunetra Sarker.
Flight said their stories were "sometimes tragic, sometimes funny, but always compelling".
