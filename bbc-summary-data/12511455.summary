Nepal country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With its ancient culture and the Himalayas as a backdrop, landlocked Nepal was closed to the outside world until the 1950s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Since then the country has seen the creation of a multi-party parliamentary system, a decade-long Maoist insurgency and the abolition of its monarchy.
Flanked by China and India, it is home to eight of the world's highest mountains including Mount Everest, known locally as Sagarmatha.
As one of the world's poorest countries, Nepal's economy relies heavily on aid and tourism.
A devastating earthquake in April 2015 killed thousands of people, flattened villages and reduced numerous heritage sites to ruin.
Since then political infighting has delayed much of the reconstruction despite billions of dollars having been pledged.

Bidhya Devi Bhandari was elected as Nepal's first woman president in a parliamentary vote in October 2015. She is the deputy leader of the ruling Communist Party of Nepal Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML) and a former defence minister.
She is a campaigner for women's rights and widow of late communist leader Madan Kumar Bhandari.
The post of president is mainly ceremonial.
Prime minister: Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda
Pushpa Kamal Dahal was elected as prime minister for the second time in August 2016.
Better known as Prachanda (Nepali for "fierce one"), he led a decade-long insurgency against the monarchy which culminated in the king relinquishing his absolute powers and being forced to give up his throne in June 2008.
He became the first elected prime minister of Nepal in August 2008 but his government collapsed nine months later in a row over his attempt to dismiss the army chief.
Mr Dahal is the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist-Centre).
Media freedom is restricted by the fact that journalists have been the victims of violence, activists say.
There is a small film industry, nicknamed "Kollywood".
