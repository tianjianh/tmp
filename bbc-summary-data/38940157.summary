Ipswich Town 1-1 Leeds United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promotion hopefuls Leeds United were held to only their fourth Championship draw of the season at Ipswich Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Freddie Sears put the home side in front early on when he volleyed in Grant Ward's right-sided cross.
Ipswich's Jonas Knudsen saw a good chance deflected over before Stuart Dallas levelled with a poked finish.
David McGoldrick had chances to win it for Town but hit the bar, misjudged a cross and was denied by Rob Green as Leeds held on for a hard-fought point.
Ipswich have now failed to win in their last three league matches at Portman Road, but started brightly with Sears immediately justifying his selection ahead of Brett Pitman.
The 27-year-old added the assured finishing touch to a flowing move which involved Ward and the impressive Emyr Huws, and it could have been 2-0 had Knudsen not spurned a chance from a few yards out from Huws' low cross.
Having laboured for most of the first period, Leeds equalised with their first shot on target, Dallas putting the ball through Bartosz Bialkowski's legs at the back post from Chris Wood's flick-on.
After the break McGoldrick hit the bar with a chipped attempt from a corner, with Christophe Berra only able to head the rebound straight at Green in goal.
The Town striker had further opportunities to win it, but failed to get a touch to Kevin Bru's dangerous cross before Green produced a good stop after Sears sent him through.
Despite falling to find a second goal Mick McCarthy's side extended their unbeaten run to four games to stay 13th, while Leeds remain fifth.
Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy: "Overall I thought we were the better team. Six to eight weeks ago, we had 12 fit first-team players and kids on the bench and it was difficult for us all.
"We have got Didzy (David McGoldrick) back fully fit and have added some more quality players so it is not rocket science that we are now playing much better.
"Fans want to see a team play well and win, and I continue to have great support from the majority."
Leeds manager Garry Monk: "It was always going to be extremely difficult here and the pitch didn't help either side.
"We didn't react well to their goal and we probably equalised against the run of play. But both teams defended well in the second half and we concentrated until the end.
"You could see the players' character and commitment - I think we deserved the point."
