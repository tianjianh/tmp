Princess of Wales Hospital: Inquiry call after neglect case collapses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Families at the centre of a collapsed trial into alleged neglect at a Bridgend hospital fear relatives may have been harmed by care failings.

In October, two nurses who worked at Princess of Wales Hospital were cleared of wilful neglect.
Now families want an inquiry into standards of care from 2010 to 2012.
The health board responsible for the hospitals said it would apologise to the families for their more general allegations of poor care.
Two other nurses pleaded guilty to wilful neglect of a patient and, along with a third, to falsifying blood glucose readings. They are due to be sentenced in December.
A government-ordered review into the Princess of Wales and Neath Port Talbot hospitals found "unacceptable" care of elderly patients in 2014.
Chief executive of Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board Paul Roberts said: "What we are planning to do is, as soon as the court case is over, we plan to write to families specifically affected by that and invite them in if they want to come and talk to us about concerns.
"In that letter there will be an apology because we already owe one, quite clearly."
Speaking to the BBC's Week In Week Out programme, whose initial investigation was one of the factors leading to the decision by Health Minister Mark Drakeford to order the review, families called for a wider look at general standards of care in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board between 2010 and 2012.
The families said the Trusted to Care review did not take into account their experiences.
Emma Brittain's father Alun Evans suffered a stroke in 2012 and was left in a coma for 20 days.
She has questioned whether it may have been connected to his blood sugar levels and the falsification of his records.
Families said concerns include relatives being left without food or water for days and not receiving medication.
Karen Phillips' mother, Sonia, was one of the patients involved in the collapsed trial.
"I felt [the trial] would give me answers and because it collapsed I don't have those answers and I don't know that I ever will," she said.
Care problems were highlighted by Week In Week Out in 2013 after Gareth Williams raised concerns about his mother Lilian's standard of care at both hospitals.
She was admitted to the hospitals four times between August 2010 and November 2012 before she died.
The findings of the 2014 Trusted to Care report sparked a series of spot check inspections and a follow-up review in 2015.
