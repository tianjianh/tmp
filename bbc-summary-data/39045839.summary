Former Liverpool vicar admits £100,000 Liverpool diocese thefts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Anglican vicar has admitted a string of thefts totalling more than £100,000 from his diocese.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rev Michael John Fry, 57, of Aigburth Vale, Liverpool pleaded guilty to eight offences over eight years ending on 1 January 2014.
The sums he stole began with £1,751 between December 2005 and January 2007, increasing to £20,049 between December 2011 and January 2013.
He was remanded on bail to be sentenced on 23 March at Liverpool Crown Court.
Fry was a member of the St Luke in the City Team, which included three parish churches - St Michael's on Upper Pitt Street, St Bride's on Percy Street and St Dunstan's on Earle Road.
He resigned from his post early in 2014.
Judge Robert Warnock told the court Fry had been in the care of the community psychiatric team for about a year but had since been discharged from their care.
He was bailed pending the writing of a pre-sentence report.
