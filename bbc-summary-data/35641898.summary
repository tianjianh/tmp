Premiership: Northampton Saints v Worcester Warriors (Sat)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton have made four changes to the side that narrowly lost at Newcastle last week, bringing in wingers Ken Pisi and Tom Collins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victor Matfield and Teimana Harrison come in to the pack.
Worcester are unchanged from last weekend's 31-23 home victory over Sale, the Warriors' first win in 13 games.
Dean Ryan's men are seeking only a second Premiership double over Saints, having won 13-12 at Sixways on the opening weekend of the season.
Worcester won that tight game in added time thanks to debutant Tom Heathcote's penalty.
But the Warriors have struggled since, only ending their long losing run last Saturday against mid-table Sale when their latest international signing, scrum-half Francois Hougaard, scored on his debut.
Ryan's Warriors have only recorded one Premiership away win since he took over, the 17-12 victory at Newcastle in March 2014.
Worcester have lost all six Premiership away games this season, with bottom club London Irish suffering the same fate.
Northampton have lost two of their six Premiership home games this season, to Saracens and Wasps.
Worcester's only 'season double' over Northampton came in the 2004-05 campaign.
Warriors director of rugby Dean Ryan told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"That first game against Saints in October will be a big motivator for them as well as us. We understand the pressure we're under.
"After last weekend's defeat at Newcastle, they'll be wanting to come out and play again and that'll be a huge challenge for us.
"Hopefully last weekend's win will be a catalyst for us to keep going and playing with the same intent. Nailing results is very important to us."
