Tom, a pupil at Kelvin Hall School, is among 212 12-year-olds who have been selected as torchbearers through the London 2012 Get Set Education programme.
He said he was "really excited" about the role.
Tom was nominated by his teacher Sean Thompson after representing his school at football and rugby and being selected to represent Hull at a regional cross country event.
His father Peter said: "To actually get the call to say he's been picked... we were blown away. We were gobsmacked. It's amazing."
On 18 June, the torch will arrive in Bridlington and go via Beverley to Hull, where it will stay overnight.
On 19 June the torch will exit the East Riding, going past the Humber Bridge, though Brough and Goole.
The procession will return to the Humber region on 26 June, arriving in Scunthorpe and visiting places including Wrawby, Immingham and Cleethorpes.
The Dock Tower abseil will take place on 27 June.
Councillor Terry Geraghty, from Hull City Council, said: "We are delighted to be hosting the Torch Relay in our great city.

"I look forward to welcoming the city's inspirational torchbearers who will run our route."
Alice Kaye, who lives near Brigg in North Lincolnshire, has also been chosen to carry the Olympic flame.
The 17-year-old is a student at Caistor Grammar School and is part of the Scunthorpe and District Athletics Club. She was selected through the Lloyds TSB London 2012 Olympic Torch Relay nomination scheme.
She said: "I'm incredibly excited. Just being part of the Olympic Games is incredible."
Power lifter Lynn Williams, who represented Great Britain at the 2011 Special Olympic World Summer Games in Athens, will carry the torch in Goole.

In her nomination the 54-year-old was hailed as a "shining example to young people with learning difficulties who may have their own Olympic dreams".
The Olympic flame arrives in the UK on 18 May and begins its 70-day journey at Land's End on the morning of 19 May.
During the 10-week relay the torch will be carried by 8,000 torchbearers and will travel about 8,000 miles.
Locog says the torch will come within 10 miles of 95% of the population.
