A £35.1m Lotto jackpot - the biggest prize in the UK game's history - has been claimed by a single ticket, lottery operator Camelot has said.

The ticket matched the winning numbers in Wednesday's draw - 50, 57, 31, 17, 41 and 15 - to win £35,133,888.
Camelot has not revealed whether a syndicate or an individual held the ticket, or where it was bought.
The jackpot beats the previous record prize, won by two tickets that shared £66m in January.
Wednesday's jackpot will be paid out at a ticket validation appointment, and the winner will then decide whether or not to go public and share their news, Camelot said.

The National Lottery said it was delighted that the "life-changing win" had been claimed.
In January, David and Carol Martin, a couple from the Scottish Borders, shared the £66m jackpot with another winner, who chose to remain anonymous.
The prize, which was the result of 15 rollovers, broke a 21-year-old record.

A few weeks later, Gerry and Lisa Cannings, from Deeping St James, near Peterborough, won £32.5m.
They waited a week to claim their prize because they were having their house redecorated.
The record prior to January's win was a jackpot of £22.5m, claimed by two business partners from St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, in 1995.
National Lottery jackpots have been dwarfed in recent years by those won by British winners of the Euromillions lottery.
Money for that prize comes from ticket sales in a number of European countries and the jackpot often rolls over for many weeks.
The biggest UK Euromillions winners are Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, who collected £161.6m in 2011.
"When she won the lottery she was sitting here crying. It was too much stress for her" - Mother of Jane Park, who won £1m at the age of 17
"It will enrich her life so much and that's the most important thing on the agenda" - Paul and Debbie Lawton, who planned to use their £6.9m helping their three children, including their eldest daughter Tracey who has cerebral palsy
"Being Trotters we were always going to be millionaires one day" - Neil Trotter, who won £107.9m on the Euromillions lottery
