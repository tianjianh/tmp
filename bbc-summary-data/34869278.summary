"Bullies need to understand what they have done"

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As part of national Anti-Bullying week Newsround has been asking kids about the best way to stop it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A special vote was launched on the CBBC website to see if kids think it's better to help bullies or punish them. More than 2,400 children voted and 47% thought that bullies should be punished for their actions, with 53% saying bullies should be helped.
We also asked a panel of 100 children during Bullying - The Newsround Debate what they thought and 70% of them agreed that bullies needed help.
Solei, who's nine said: "Bullies need to understand what they have done. If they keep on doing it, they should be punished."
But, 11-year-old Daniel said: "Bullies should be punished. What they are doing is wrong and has serious consequences."
