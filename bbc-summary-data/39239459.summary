[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 0-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High-flying Fleetwood had to settle for a goalless draw with AFC Wimbledon after failing to score for only the third time this term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bury and Rochdale are the only other teams to have stopped Town scoring in the league this season and it was an uninspiring clash at Highbury.
Ash Hunter latched on to David Ball's through ball to run one-on-one with James Shea but the goalkeeper pulled off a fine diving save to push the fierce strike to safety.
Ball just curled the ball round the left post from the dead-ball line while Bobby Grant's effort from 12 yards fizzed over the crossbar as Town ended the first half strongly.
It was a feistier second half and Wimbledon nearly took the lead against the run of play in the 72nd minute. A rare defensive mix-up from Cian Bolger and Ash Eastham saw the ball fall sweetly for Andy Barcham but his snap-shot flew over the bar.
That chance woke the visitors up and it was Neal Ardley's men who nearly snatched the points at the death as Barcham blasted just over.
