The comedy series, which has been airing since 2012, will be broadcast from Rio to mark the end of the Paralympics.
The seven adverts will be signed by David Ellington, a deaf actor and artist.
He will lip-sync, dress up as a cupcake salesman and wear a swimming cap and trunks as part of the break.
A fully signed and audio described version of the break will also be available on All 4's Watch Live feature.
The ad break has been produced with the support of the charities Action on Hearing Loss and the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) with each brand involved donating to the charities.
David Steadman, executive director for fundraising and marketing at Action on Hearing Loss, said: "There are currently 11 million people in the UK living with hearing loss and we are very encouraged to see the innovative steps that Channel 4 is taking to ensure that everyone is included."
The first series of The Last Leg was broadcast in 2012 to run alongside the Paralympic Games in London.
The show's success led to it being kept on by Channel 4 as a comedy talk show, looking back at the week's news events and featuring interviews with special guests.
