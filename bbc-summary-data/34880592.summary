An underwater photo of a group of tadpoles silhouetted against a bright blue sky has won first place in the inaugural Royal Society Publishing photography competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The photograph was taken by biologist Bert Willaert, while he was snorkelling in a canal in Belgium.
He explained: "Clear water is hard to come across in the part of Belgium where I live, as a consequence of eutrophication.
"Algae grows from the nutrients flushed down the drains in detergents and sewage, clouding the waters and suffocating other oxygen-dependent life.  When I noticed these common toad tadpoles in the crystal-clear canal I wanted to capture the chance encounter from their perspective."
The competition received more than 1,000 entries, submitted for three categories.
Runner-up for Ecology and Environmental Science was Martha M Robbins from Germany for her shot of a silverback gorilla near the Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda.
