A group of climbers are making their way down one of South East Asia's highest peaks after being stranded by an earthquake, officials say.

Initial attempts to rescue the 137, caught high on Malaysia's Mount Kinabalu, had to be abandoned due to bad weather.
The tourism minister for Sabah state, Masidi Manjun, tweeted there had been fatalities, without elaborating.
The 6.0 magnitude earthquake triggered landslides, trapping the climbers.
The quake was powerful enough to snap off one of Mount Kinabalu's distinctive "Donkey's Ear" peaks. All climbing activity on the mountain has been suspended.
Malaysian media reported at least one person had died, with rescuers trying to reach victims buried under rocks.
The US Geological Survey said the earthquake happened at around 07:15 local time (00:15 BST), at a depth of 10km (32,800ft). The epicentre was 54km (33 miles) from Mt Kinabalu.
Mt Kinabalu, which stands at 4,095m, is popular with climbers from around the world.
Many are attracted to the challenging "via ferrata" climbing route, where cables, metal rungs and bridges are set into the rocks on the steep terrain to help people ascend.
Mr Manjun said that 32 guides were assisting the tourists on their way down, with the group moving "cautiously due to (a) damaged trail".
"Other than ongoing rescue efforts, our priority is to send food, drinks and warm clothing to those still stranded on the mountain," he said.
Some of the group had climbed to the summit to watch the sunrise as the earthquake struck.
The 'conquerable' Mt Kinabalu
Earlier, one person apparently trapped, a Facebook user identified as Charlene Dmp, said: "Currently we're waiting for the helicopter to save us.
"We cannot go down for now because there are lots of stones falling, there's no safe route down, and there are still tremors. Thank you for all your concern and prayers."
There were no reports of major damage or injuries from the earthquake in other parts of Sabah.
