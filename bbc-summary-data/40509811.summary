Mikayla Haining, from Mackay Road, died on 8 June after being taken to Raigmore Hospital with serious injuries.
Police confirmed earlier this week that they were treating her death as suspicious.
Officers said they had been carrying out a complex investigation, which remains ongoing despite the man having been charged.
He is expected to appear at Inverness Sheriff Court on Thursday.
Det Insp Brian Geddes said: "Following the death of three-week-old Mikayla Haining, I can confirm a 19-year-old man has been charged and reported to the procurator fiscal.
"This has been a complex investigation and it remains ongoing. I would like to thank the community for their patience while these enquiries have been, and continue to be carried out."
