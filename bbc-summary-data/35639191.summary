[SN]TITLE[SN]
Andy Council dinosaur mural on Oxford pub in Totterdown painted over

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dinosaur mural on the side of a Bristol pub has been mistakenly painted over by workmen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work, on a wall of the Oxford pub in Totterdown is one of street artist Andy Council's trademark creations, that mix dinosaurs with architecture.
It was painted on the pub in November as part of an arts trail.
Mr Council said the dinosaur would "be making an appearance again" and he may paint the whole pub rather than just one wall.
"When I heard it had been painted over I thought it was funny because it was an accident and you do come to expect it," he said.
Landlord of the Oxford, Jon Evans, said regulars set up a crowd-funding campaign dubbed 'Get Me Another Dinosaur' to pay Mr Council to redo the mural.
Mr Council has also painted murals at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and has a model in the Bristol M Shed museum.
