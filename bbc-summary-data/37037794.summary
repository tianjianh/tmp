Nathan, aged 16, from Paignton, was reported missing to police on Friday and divers discovered his body on Sunday near the River Dart in Totnes.
Devon and Cornwall Police said it was possible he had fallen into the river after taking a "new pyschoactive substance" (NPS).
The teenager's family described him as "full of life and loving".
Nathan's mother Mandi Retter said his death had "screwed up our lives forever".
His brother Daniel said: "He did love people so much. He couldn't express it enough. Everyone that knew him thought he was funny."
His grandmother, Margaret Retter, added: "The last time I saw him it was just wonderful. I was coming up the path last weekend and he just leaned out the bedroom window shouting 'Hi Grandma'.
"He was just full of life and loving, it was a lovely memory."
A memorial afternoon will be held at St John's Church in Totnes on Tuesday 16 August.
