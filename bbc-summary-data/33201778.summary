They scored another through Lloyd Lewis, but Australia held on to win.
Australia started strongly and scored the game's opening try through number eight Korczyk, converted by Andrew Deegan.
Wales responded as wing Adams dived over in the corner, only for Australia to replenish their lead as lock Lealaiaulolo-Tui powered over from a rolling maul.
That left Wales trailing 14-5 at half-time, though they chipped away at that deficit with two penalties from Daniel Jones.
Tries from front-rower Faingaa and player of the tournament nominee Placid put Australia in control, but Wales refused to yield.
Benham scored out wide and Australia's Campbell Magnay was sent off for a second yellow card.
