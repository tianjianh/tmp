[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sturgeon names candidates for new Lord Advocate and Solicitor General

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon has put forward her candidates for the roles of Scotland's top law officers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Wolffe QC and Alison Di Rollo have been nominated for the posts of Lord Advocate and Solicitor General.
Subject to the approval of parliament, Mr Wolffe will take over from Frank Mulholland, who stepped down as Lord Advocate at the Holyrood election.
Senior advocate depute Ms Di Rollo will succeed Lesley Thomson, who has been the Solicitor General since 2011.
If approved by MSPs and appointed by the Queen, the pair will become the final members of Ms Sturgeon's ministerial team.
The first minister said she was "extremely pleased" to recommend Mr Wolffe and Ms Di Rollo for the posts.
She said: "James has an outstanding legal background and extensive experience at all levels, including the House of Lords, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union.
"Alison led the work of the ground-breaking National Sexual Crimes Unit for three years, having previously held the role of deputy. Her outstanding leadership in this most sensitive of areas has inspired confidence in all connected to it."
Mr Wolffe, who is currently Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, said it would be a "great privilege" to act as Lord Advocate, while Ms Di Rollo said she was "delighted an honoured" to be nominated.
The Lord Advocate is a minister of the Scottish government and acts as its principle legal advisor, but takes decisions about criminal prosecutions and the investigation of deaths independently.
