The deal is expected to be completed on 11 September.  Proceeds from the cash sale will be used to reduce net debt.
The move is part of Burton-based Punch's strategy to sell its non-core pubs at a rate of about 200 a year.
Punch boss Duncan Garrood said the sale would allow it to focus "on our higher quality core pub estate".
The disposal comprises 150 pubs from the non-core estate and eight pubs from the core estate that "no longer meet our criteria as a core pub".
The pubs being sold generated earnings before interest and tax of £7.3m over the past 12 months, and have a current book value of £52.5m, Punch added.
After the sale, the company's core estate will have about 2,900 pubs and the non-core estate will have about 550 pubs.
Punch will issue a full-year trading update for the financial year to 22 August on 1 September.
