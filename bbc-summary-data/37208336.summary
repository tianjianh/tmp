[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fresh appeal over a suspected child abduction has come from Surrey Police more than 48 hours after the incident.

The force is still investigating claims a boy was "taken against his will" into a van on Redstone Hill, Redhill, on Thursday afternoon.
Supt Pete Fulton said a large number of officers had carried out an extensive and thorough investigation.
He said police were still urging anyone with any information to contact the force.
Officers have carried out house-to-house inquiries and visited the nearby railway station on Friday.
They have also reviewed hours of CCTV footage from across the area, checked and eliminated potential vehicles matching the description, and checked regional and national databases for missing children.
Supt Fulton said the force had also dealt with more than 100 calls from the public in less than 24 hours.
He said: "In the 48 hours since the call, a large number of officers have carried out an extensive and thorough investigation into this report.
"The appeal for help from the public and media has received an overwhelming reaction which we are extremely thankful for.
"Reports of this nature are extremely rare and we are sure the public understands that when information such as this is received we have to do all we can to find out what has happened."
After the alert was raised on Thursday, police mobilised forensics, dogs and the police air service.
Officers said they were "completely satisfied" with the credibility of the witness.
The owner of a van shown in a CCTV image and initially circulated by police was traced and ruled out of the inquiry.
No parent has reported a child matching the description as going missing - the boy was described as white, about 4ft (1.2m) tall, wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
