Mayor Geoff Gollop and Councillor Kevin Quartley found their vehicles burnt out at their homes, after two separate attacks in the early hours of Monday.
Avon and Somerset Police confirmed officers were called to properties in Henleaze and Bishopsworth.
He said the incidents were being treated as suspicious but it was unclear if they were linked.
"Anyone who was in  Fallodon Way, Henleaze, or Kings Walk, Bishopsworth, in the early hours of Monday, is asked to contact police or Crimestoppers anonymously," the force spokesman added.
"Attacks such as these are cowardly and disgraceful, and we wish the investigators well in their efforts at bringing those responsible to justice," a statement from all political parties on the Liberal-Democrat-controlled council said.
Mr Gollop, who represents Westbury-on-Trym ward, said it was more frightening thinking about the fire afterwards.
"At the time the only concern was to get the family clear of the house and make sure we were all safe.
"It's only looking back on it that you wonder why and what caused anybody to think anything can be dealt with in that particular way," he added.
