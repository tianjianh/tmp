Wales v Argentina: Jamie Roberts drops to the bench as Sam Warburton returns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones return to the Wales team for Saturday's game against Argentina, with centre Jamie Roberts dropped to the bench.

Both forwards missed last Saturday's 32-8 defeat by Australia.
But Gethin Jenkins retains the captaincy in a team showing six changes with Liam Williams back on the wing and Leigh Halfpenny retained at full-back.
Tomas Francis comes in at tight-head with Gareth Davies at scrum-half for the injured Rhys Webb.
Harlequins centre Roberts' last appearance for Wales as a replacement was against Ireland in March, 2009.
Interim coach Robert Howley highlighted "a number of defensive errors" by Roberts against the Wallabies.
Howley also pointed to Wales' try against Australia by Scott Williams and his familiarity with Scarlets team-mate Jonathan Davies in midfield in making the change.
"Jamie is defence captain so we made the decision that the standard of defence wasn't good enough and we've made the change and Jamie will be on the bench," said Howley.
"It was also in light of Scott's performance as well. An individual try he scored, the combination, Scott and Jon Davies are used to playing with each other.
"It's disappointing. It's certainly not something I look forward to when you are dropping a player that experienced, but when you have the performance that we did in that area you have to make a change.
"In fairness when we met the leadership group on Monday, Jamie was the first player to put up his hand and say he made mistakes so I expect a positive response if and when he's needed off the bench on Saturday."

Ospreys lock Jones missed the match against Australia following the death of his father, Tim.
Interim coach Rob Howley explained the decision to keep Jenkins as captain by saying: "With Sam returning, we have spoken to him and we feel its best for him to focus purely on his performance and role on Saturday, leaving the captaincy with Gethin."
Howley did the same thing during the 2013 Six Nations when Jenkins captained the team with Warburton at blindside flanker for the decisive 30-3 win against England.
Jenkins said: "It's not that strange really because he's in the ranks down at the Blues when I'm captain."
Former Wales captain Howley said Tipuric and Moriarty offered "glimpses" out wide of their attacking threat against Australia, contributing to Dan Lydiate being omitted.
Jenkins will break the record for appearances by a front-row forward as he makes his 128th appearance for Wales - taking his overall tally including Lions Test matches to 133 - one more than ex-New Zealand hooker Keven Mealamu.
The match also marks the 50th Wales Test appearance of fly-half Dan Biggar.
Second row Bradley Davies, who started against Australia, is injured and drops out of the match day 23, with Gareth Anscombe on the bench in place of Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies.
Howley said Davies "did particularly well" after making his Wales debut against Australia, but Anscombe returns after recovering from a "tweaked" hip.
"We had more possession when Sam came on and it was great to see him with the ball in hand," added Howley.
"But it's a four-match series and it's important we try and give game time to Gareth as well."
