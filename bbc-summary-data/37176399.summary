[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Etienne have signed midfielders Henri Saivet from Newcastle United and Jordan Veretout from Aston Villa, both on season-long loans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frenchman Veretout, 23, who made 21 Premier League starts for Villa last season, was signed last July for £8m from Nantes by Tim Sherwood.
Senegal international Saivet, 25, only made two Newcastle starts after moving for £5m from Bordeaux in January.
Both Villa and Newcastle are now in the Championship following relegation.
Of the players who featured in the Premier League for Villa last season, Veretout is now the eighth to be sold or released.
For both Veretout and Saivet, their respective loan moves to St Etienne mean a return to Ligue 1, the French top flight.
