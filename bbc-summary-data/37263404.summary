[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 0-2 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Hogan's double earned Brentford their first away win of the season and consigned Brighton to their first home defeat since New Year's Day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hogan raced on to Lewis Macleod's pass to fire home on the break - the first goal Albion had conceded at the Amex this season.
Tomer Hemed's close-range effort was hooked off the line by John Egan as Brighton threatened an equaliser.
But Hogan sealed the win in the second half with a left-foot finish.
The Seagulls had scored 10 goals without reply from three league and cup home games this term and carved out several chances, with Anthony Knockaert forcing Bentley into a low save and then heading straight at the keeper.
Brentford had won just once in their past six league trips to Brighton, but Hogan was a regular threat on the break, and was denied one-on-one by home keeper David Stockdale.
The defeat ended Brighton's 12-match unbeaten run at home, the longest in the Championship, and saw them drop to 13th, while the Bees have jumped to seventh.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"We were beaten by the better side. Brentford kept the ball better and we didn`t impose ourselves on the game.
"There is no doubt that goals change games and it`s how you react afterwards. In this game it was important for the team who got the first goal and it made us a bit desperate in our game.
"Brentford were better on the ball but, from a defensive point of view, the first goal was very disappointing. The second goal was about individual quality from the lad Hogan."
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"I am pleased with the result and the performance and Hogan will be disappointed not to have got a hat-trick.
"The better team won. We restricted a good team to a few chances and didn`t give them much time on the ball.
"Having seen Brighton in their previous two home games, I changed our system to 4-1-4-1 and it is very pleasing to be the first side to score at the Amex this season and first to win."
