Daley will be competing at his third Olympics, having made his debut at the age of 14 at the 2008 Games in Beijing.
Tonia Couch will also go to her third Games while 16-year-old Lois Toulson, who will compete in the women's 10m synchronised, is the youngest athlete selected for Team GB's squad so far.
"I want to go out there and win an Olympic gold medal," Daley said.
"I feel like I'm at my peak in terms of strength and conditioning, my consistency and the degree of difficulty with my routines," he told BBC Sport.
Daley will compete in the 10m platform, and alongside Dan Goodfellow in the synchronised 10m. The duo won European silver together in May.
"The men's 10m platform and synchro will be tight fields with so many talented athletes and I'm going to do everything I can to ensure I'm at my best for my two events in Rio," added Daley.
Britain's best-ever diving medal haul from a single Olympics is two from the 1960 Rome Games.
The squad will head to Rio with the belief they can set a new record, having enjoyed record-breaking results at world and European championships over the past 12 months.
World bronze medallist Jack Laugher will compete in the individual 3m springboard competition and alongside Chris Mears in the synchronised event.
Sarah Barrow marks an incredible resurgence in form by achieving selection for the individual 10m platform event.
Following two years of chronic shin problems - including a stress fracture and a non-cancerous tumour - she was dropped from the long-established synchronised 10m platform line-up earlier this year.
After briefly being paired again with Couch and helping secure Team GB a place in the event at Rio 2016, she was dropped once more and did not compete in the record-breaking European Championships for Britain in May.
But the 27-year-old Plymouth-based diver won the 10m platform title at the Olympic trials to secure herself a place in the event with Couch.
"This will be my third Olympics and I feel I have learnt so much from both Beijing and London that I can use to my advantage in Rio," said Couch.
"The pool [in Rio] is great and I loved competing there in February so can't wait to go back."
In addition to Toulson and Goodfellow, Grace Reid and Freddie Woodward will also be making their Olympic debuts in Rio.
