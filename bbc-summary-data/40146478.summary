[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ruthless Yorkshire took just an hour and a half to take Lancashire's last six wickets and set up a Roses match win inside three days at Headingley.

Ryan Sidebottom took 3-38, for match figures of 6-60, as Lancashire resuming on 141-4, were bowled out for 209.
Tim Bresnan took 3-50, while Ben Coad got the key wicket of Shiv Chanderpaul for career-best match figures of 8-59.
Yorkshire openers Adam Lyth and Alex Lees then polished off the target, reaching 61-0 to win by 10 wickets.
Having begun the third day still nine runs behind, but with six wickets left, with Chanderpaul and Dane Vilas at the crease, Lancashire still had realistic hopes of saving the game, or at least stretching it into the final day.
But they crucially lost Vilas and Chanderpaul, the second highest scorer in the match following Lyth's crucial first-innings century, on 149-6, before they had gone past Yorkshire's first-innings score.
Vilas edged to slip off Sidebottom without adding to his overnight 22, to only the 14th ball of the day, then Chanderpaul, who had added just four to his overnight score, was caught behind for 47 off youngster Coad, his second wicket of the innings, and eighth of the match.
The 22-year-old Harrogate-born paceman, who had taken just two first-class wickets before the start of this season, has now taken 35 first-class wickets this season, more than anyone else in the country.
Ryan McLaren and Jordan Clark (35) held up Yorkshire with a seventh-wicket stand of 48. But, Bresnan then finished things off, taking three wickets in 16 balls as Lancashire lost their last four wickets for 12 runs inside 27 balls.
He had McLaren caught at third slip, then had both Clark, controversially, and Stephen Parry caught behind, either side of Sidebottom accounting for Tom Bailey.
Having started this game a place behind their old rivals in fifth, Yorkshire's second win of the season, with the best part of five sessions to spare, lifts them above Lancashire, into third in the Division One table.
Lancashire avoided a points deduction in this match by operating for 19 of Yorkshire's 21 overs with spinners Steven Croft, Stephen Parry and even England Test opener Haseeb Hameed as they improved their minus three over-rate from the first innings.
Lancashire's next game starts this Friday (9 June), when they host reigning county champions Middlesex at Southport.
Yorkshire also start their next four-day game the same day, when they must travel to Taunton to play bottom-of-the-table Somerset.
Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We were outstanding from start to finish. We dominated the game.  I've just said in the dressing room that 'we strive for perfection'. And the only area was we should have got a 250-lead, not 150.
"Other than that, I asked us to be more ruthless. Our catching was a lot better. As a bowling unit, we were top drawer. As good as you'll see in county cricket.
"I'm pleased for Lythy because you always go through a lean patch as a batter. He's worked really hard and put a decent shift in in the nets. I'm pleased he's got his rewards.
"This period of games is massive in the scheme of the season. I said before this game that it won't be won and lost in this period, but you can make some dents in the table."
Lancashire coach Glen Chapple told BBC Radio Manchester:
"Yorkshire basically won the game on a pretty spicy pitch. They were pretty relentless on the first day and we weren't able to match that.
"It comes to down to old fashioned English conditions, which were bowler friendly. And the Yorkshire bowlers were outstanding.
"We didn't live up to their bowling, especially Ryan Sidebottom and Ben Coad early on. They just hammered out a length and gave our batsmen nowhere to go.
"I don't think it was down to the toss at all. It was basically the quality of our bowling didn't match theirs. We have to take that on the chin."
