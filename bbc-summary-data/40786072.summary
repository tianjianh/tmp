[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eastleigh 1-0 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Williamson's goal gave Eastleigh a narrow win over Sutton in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Craig Eastmond and Kieron Cadogan threatened for Sutton in the first half, with first Graham Stack and then Andrew Boyce to the rescue.
Eastleigh began the second half with a shot direct from the kick-off and then a Paul McCallum volley, both easily gathered by goalkeeper Jamie Butler.
They broke through, though, just before the hour when Mark Yeates took on the defence and when his shot was blocked, Williamson followed up to score his first goal for the club.
Yeates and substitute James Constable went close to a second but one proved enough as Ross Lafayette was just unable to reach Jeffrey Monakana's late cross.
