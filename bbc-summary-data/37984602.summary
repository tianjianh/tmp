The hosts were bowled out for 161 in Colombo with two wickets apiece for Laura Marsh, Alex Hartley and stand-in skipper Danielle Hazell.
England started their response well with opener Tammy Beaumont hitting 78 from 79 balls.
And they easily reached their target with just over 20 overs remaining.
Captain Heather Knight and fast bowler Katherine Brunt missed the game with hamstring and thigh injuries respectively and will be reassessed before the final match of the series on Thursday but Hazell was pleased to have helped guide her side to victory.
"The girls put in a really good performance," she said afterwards.
"I'm proud to have captained the team today and if it comes my way again, I'll be happy to do it."
England clinched qualification for the 2017 Women's World Cup by winning the second match of the series on Saturday.
