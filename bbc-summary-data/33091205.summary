[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Vincent Hall, 22, from Talysarn near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, was arrested in Chicago on 2 May.
He faces charges of rape, serious sexual assault and kidnap. A trial date has yet to be set.
A separate investigation is under way in Wales, where Mr Hall worked at a leisure centre in Caernarfon.
North Wales Police said it arrested a man in October "on suspicion of offences committed online" and he was bail.
He was suspended by Gwynedd council from his post at the Arfon Leisure Centre, where he also taught children to swim, pending the outcome of the inquiry.
Appearing in court in Eugene on Wednesday, reporters from local TV station KMTR TV described Mr Hall as being "sombre" and "staring at the ground".
Local newspaper, the Register-Guard, said a Welsh interpreter was in court to help him understand the process.
According to the newspaper, lawyers acting for Mr Hall asked for more time to prepare their case before a trial later in the year.
Following his arrest, the Federal Bureau of Investigation appealed for more information about Mr Hall amid concerns that he had travelled to other parts of the United States.
