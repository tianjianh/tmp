A group of African embassies in Delhi have requested India to postpone a cultural event following last week's killing of a student from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Masunda Kitada Oliver was beaten to death by a group of Indian men last Friday after an argument in Delhi.
Two men have been arrested in the case.
The embassies said they did not want to participate in Africa Day celebrations on Thursday because of repeated attacks on African students in India.
"This [the decision to not participate in Africa Day celebrations] is because the African community in India, including students, are in a state of mourning in memory of the slain African students in the last few years, including Mr Oliver," said Alem Tsehage Woldemariam, Dean of African Group of Heads of Mission.
The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICRC) has planned to celebrate Africa Day on Thursday to showcase African culture, food and literature.
In a tweet on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj promised to ensure the safety of African students in India.
"I have asked my colleague General VK Singh to meet the heads of missions of African countries in Delhi and assure them of Indian government's commitment to the safety and security of African nationals in India," she tweeted.
Mr Woldemariam said African nations were worried about the increasing number of attacks on their students in Delhi.
"Given the pervading climate of fear and insecurity in Delhi, the Africans Heads of Missions are left with little option than to consider recommending to their governments not to send new students to India, unless and until their safety can be guaranteed," he said.
In February, a Tanzanian student was assaulted and partially stripped by a mob in the southern city of Bangalore.
