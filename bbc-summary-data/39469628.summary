Chelsea's surprise defeat by Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge makes the title race "more interesting", says Blues boss Antonio Conte.

The Premier League leaders suffered only their second home defeat of the season as Palace boosted their survival hopes with a 2-1 win.
Tottenham's win at Burnley means they are seven points behind Chelsea.
"For (the media) it's a good result, because it makes this more interesting in the championship," Conte said.
"But I always said the league finishes when you have the mathematical certainty that you won. Otherwise you must fight, you must play every game to try to win."
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says he and his players still believe they can catch Chelsea following their 2-0 win at Burnley.
"It's an important, a massive three points for us to still believe we can fight for the title," said the Argentine.
"We showed great belief and character and faith. That makes us proud."

"I don't think it can be done. But Tottenham have been brilliant since the turn of the year. They're the two best teams and let's see what they can do."
Prior to Palace's visit, Chelsea had not lost in any competition since a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham on 4 January.
It looked like they were on course for another victory when Cesc Fabregas struck early on, but two quick goals from Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke secured a fourth successive win for Palace.
The Eagles, having looked in real danger of going down earlier this season, are now four points clear of the relegation zone.
"Nobody expected it," said Palace boss Sam Allardyce, who has never been relegated from the Premier League as a manager.
"It's an absolutely outstanding victory for us, particularly in the position we're in."
