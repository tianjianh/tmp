Plymouth Argyle 6-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle were promoted from League Two in style as they thrashed Newport 6-1 to add to the Welsh club's relegation worries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two goals at the end of the first half from Matty Kennedy and Jake Jervis put the Pilgrims in control before Graham Carey made the win safe.
The promotion party was in full swing before Ryan Taylor added a fourth and Kennedy a fifth as the Exiles wilted.
Jervis scored Plymouth's sixth before Aaron Williams' consolation strike.
Plymouth's victory keeps alive their hopes of winning the League Two title.
Newport remain one point outside of the relegation zone thanks to Hartlepool's 2-1 defeat by Leyton Orient, but they have seen their goal difference take a hit.
The result was Newport's heaviest defeat of the 21st Century.
Plymouth Argyle captain Luke McCormick told BBC Radio Devon: "It's overwhelming really, we've been trying to do this for certainly the last three years and even before that.
"The club's been through some real tough times and this is the other end of the scale.
"The fans on the pitch in front of me, they deserve it more than anything."
Newport County boss Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "We played a very good team and congratulations to them on their promotion.
"Matching them was just a step too far for us today."
