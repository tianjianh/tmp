[SN]TITLE[SN]
Poppi Iris Worthington death: Secrecy continues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost two years of secrecy surrounding the death of a 13-month-old child in Cumbria must continue because of further police investigations, a High Court judge has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week, a coroner took seven minutes to declare the December 2012 death of Poppi Worthington was unexplained.
Many details have not been made public prompting what Mr Justice Peter Jackson called "some concern".
However, the judge said the case must be allowed to be investigated fully.
A 46-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman have been arrested in connection with the death and are on conditional police bail until December.
The judge said he had deliberately not made public his own "fact-finding judgement" into the case.
He said: "As a result of the judgment further police investigations into Poppi's death are now taking place.
"A decision by the Crown Prosecution Service may then follow.
"In the interests of justice it is essential that this process is allowed to take place without interference and that any criminal proceedings are not prejudiced."
