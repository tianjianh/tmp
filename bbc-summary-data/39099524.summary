The world number 18 had not won on the PGA Tour since the Deutsche Bank Championship in September 2015.
He started the day with a four-shot lead, and finished with a 12-under total of 268, four shots ahead of Morgan Hoffmann and Gary Woodland.
"My putter saved me. It was tough out there today and I fought as hard as I could," said the 25-year-old.
"I felt like I hit a lot of shots that I thought would turn out good. The wind was heavy today, it was blowing pretty good so it kept us on our toes.
"The two birdies I made on 12 and 13, if I didn't make them it would have been a pretty tight race."
His win means he moves to 10th in the FedExCup after his fourth career victory.
England's Tyrrell Hatton, who started the day in second place, carded a two-over 72 to finish in a large group sharing fourth on seven under.
