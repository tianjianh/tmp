Jordon Ibe: Wycombe Wanderers pay off debt to ex-owner Steve Hayes with sell-on clause

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe have cleared off a debt in the region of £1m to ex-owner Steve Hayes through a Jordon Ibe sell-on clause.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ibe came through Wycombe's youth ranks before moving to Liverpool in 2012 and joined Bournemouth in a Cherries club-record £15m move this summer.
When Hayes handed over the League Two side to the Wycombe Wanderers Trust in 2012, it was agreed a seven-figure fee would be paid over 10 years.
That has now been paid six years early, with a nominal surplus left over.
Hayes, whose debt owed by the club was interest-free, has also made a "significant donation" to the Trust as a goodwill gesture.
Chairboys chairman Andrew Howard said: "Steve was incredibly supportive of the club during the change of ownership and helped to ensure that Wycombe Wanderers could continue.
"This turn of events marks the end of an era and I would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Steve for everything he has done."
