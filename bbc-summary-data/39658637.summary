The Portsmouth Supporters' Trust (PST) has confirmed the former Disney chief executive will attend a meeting at Portsmouth City Guildhall on 4 May.
He will present his vision for the club at the meeting and answer questions from the audience.
Eisner and his Tornante investment group are in negotiations until 1 June.
Before the meeting, which will be for PST shareholders only, members will be sent a voting pack containing details of the terms submitted by Tornante and the Eisner family.
A two-week ballot will then open on Saturday, 6 May and close on Friday, 19 May.
Eisner, 75, is in a 70-day negotiation and due diligence period with Portsmouth, who clinched automatic promotion from League Two on Monday.
The PST currently owns a 48% stake in the club and has three representatives on the nine-member club board.
