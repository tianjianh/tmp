Two men, aged 18 and 19, were found injured inside the house in Salisbury Road, Canterbury last Thursday, while a 21-year-old man was found nearby.
One of the victims remains in hospital, but his injuries are not life-threatening, police said.
The arrested man, a 19-year-old from London, was released on bail until 14 September pending further inquiries.
Police said news of the  end-of-year party had spread on social media and it was well-attended as a result.
Six first-year students had shared the house and two organised the party.
Officers were called to the house at about 01:15 BST.
