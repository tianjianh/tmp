A 15-year-old girl has died five days after she was swept into the sea off the Irish coast during Storm Desmond.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aoife Winterlich from Dublin was one of four teenagers from a Dublin-based scout group who were swept off rocks at Hook Head, County Wexford, on Sunday.
Two of the four swam to shore, but the girl and a 15-year-old boy were rescued by an Irish Coast Guard helicopter.
The rescue operation is now the subject of an air accident inquiry.  Scouting Ireland is also investigating.
Irish police said they were notified on Friday afternoon that the girl had died in Crumlin hospital.
