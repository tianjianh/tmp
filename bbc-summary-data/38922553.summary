CCTV operators called police when they spotted a man placing an object under a seat in the city's Whitefriargate in the early hours.
Officers said they found a "small device covered in camouflage material" under the bench.
It was identified as a being part of a Geocache game, where players track down online clues and hunt for hidden boxes using GPS devices.

Ch Insp Darren Webb said: "If people want to Geocache we don't want to stop them or spoil anyone's fun.
"However, what I would say is that if you're placing the caches, please apply some common sense to where you put them - particularly in urban areas.
"I would suggest anyone who is planning to do to let us know who they are, where and when they are planning to place it, with pictures and a description of the container, so we can ensure there are no issues."
