The 27-year-old moved to Tynecastle in September last year, scoring seven goals in 36 appearances as Hearts finished third in the Premiership.
"Arnaud has been immense for us since joining last season," head coach Robbie Neilson told the Hearts website.
"We were lucky to get him in the first place, to be honest. He's a real talent with great technique and vision."
Djoum, who was born in Cameroon but has represented Belgium at U19 and U20 level, has previously had spells at FC Brussels, Anderlecht, Roda JC, Akhisar Belediyespor and Lech Poznan.
The midfielder is happy at Tynecastle but admits he will leave before his new deal expires if all goes to plan, since he has ambitions to play in England.
"It was an easy choice to sign again because I have good feeling about this club," he said. "I think it has a good future and I get confidence from everybody here. It feels like home.
"The manager was also a big part of my decision. He has given me a lot of confidence on the pitch and I'm grateful.
"But (England) is always something I'm thinking about. Even though I've signed the new deal it is always a possibility to go there.
"I just have to work hard and maybe if I stay one more season I can move on.
"In the second year at a club it is always important to improve, to show people that your first season was not down to luck. I want to improve again this year and see what happens."
