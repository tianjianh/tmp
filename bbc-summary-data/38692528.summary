Buying a wide man was one of Blues boss Gianfranco Zola's main priorities.
He had also been in the market for Derby County's Johnny Russell, as well as Robin Quaison, from Italian Serie A side Palermo.
But Birmingham have now agreed an undisclosed fee with the Turkish side, reportedly close to Â£2.2m.
Austria-born Frei, 23, who has won five international caps for Turkey, after representing Switzerland, where he was raised, from Under-15 through to Under-21 level.
He has a Moroccan mother, but chose to commit his international future to Turkey, the home country of his father.
Frei has been with Besiktas, since joining the Turkish side from Fulham, where he spent three seasons.
His arrival follows the completion of striker Lukas Jutkiewicz's move from Burnley, and the signings of West Bromwich Albion midfielder Craig Gardner and full-backs Emilio Nsue and Cheick Keita from Middlesbrough and Italian side Virtus Entella respectively.
