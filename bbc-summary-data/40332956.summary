A driver who seriously injured two of his passengers in a crash, leaving one of them paralysed, has been jailed for two years and eight months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Sargant, 22, ploughed into a lamppost and a tree in Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, early on 25 September.
He pleaded guilty at Southampton Crown Court to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
He also admitted drink and drug-driving and possessing cannabis with intent to supply.
The court heard how the group of four friends had been out drinking in Eastleigh before Sargant offered them a lift home.
The crash in Templars Way left his front-seat passenger, a man aged 19, in a critical condition and subsequently unable to walk.
Another 19-year-old man suffered nerve damage to his arm, while Sargant and a third passenger escaped with minor injuries.
PC James Fibben said: "A young man faces the rest of his life in a wheelchair. It is only sheer luck that nobody died that night."
Sargant, of High Street, Eastleigh, was banned from driving for six years and four months.
