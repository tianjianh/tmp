The 29-year-old was out-of-contract at the Iron, having made 109 appearances and helping the club to the League One play-offs this season.
Daniels will provide competition for Dan Bentley, with whom he spent time with at Southend, and Jack Bonham.
"His signing will give us one of the strongest goalkeeper departments in the league," said head coach Dean Smith.
Daniels came through the ranks at Manchester United, and has also previously played for West Brom, Shrewsbury and Tranmere.
His departure leaves Scunthorpe short in the goalkeeping department, with Joe Anyon having left for Chesterfield.
