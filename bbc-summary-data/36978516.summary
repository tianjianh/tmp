Emergency services had to help bring the flood under control and prevent it spilling into underground car parks.
Those responsible said they belonged to the militant group the Regional Action Committee of Winemakers (Crav), France 3 reported.
Crav has been alarmed by cheap imports and has claimed previous attacks.
"Why this action? Because we are never listened to," a Crav representative told France 3.
The attack happed in Sete, a port town in Languedoc-Roussillon, one of France's biggest wine producing regions.
Basements and nearby homes were flooded, according to Midi Libre.
Earlier this year, Spain summoned France's ambassador after French farmers seized Spanish lorries and drained their cargo of wine, near Le Boulou in southern France.
A local union leader for winemakers, Frederic Rouanet, condemned the latest attacks but told Decanter magazine he too was concerned about the rise of cheap imports making it into French shops.
