A man left badly scarred when acid was thrown in his face has said he relives the attack 15 or 20 times every day.

Samir Hussain said covering his face with his hands saved his sight but he was left unable to fully close one eye.
The 28-year-old, who is backing calls for controls on the sale of corrosive substances, said he felt the acid "eating away" at his face.
He now wears a facial mask and said customers at the Kent shopping centre where he works often ask what happened.
"I work in a public-facing role and it is something I talk about on a daily basis," said Mr Hussain, who works in Tunbridge Wells.
He must wear the mask all day and night for at least 18 months as part of his treatment following the attack at Cineworld in Crawley, West Sussex in September.
"When it was thrown, automatic reaction was to raise my hands and cover my face," he said.
"So luckily my eyesight was saved, although my eyelid does not close properly any more.
"When it hit my face it was a cold shock and that's when you feel the acid actually eating away at your flesh."
Mr Hussain, from Redhill, Surrey, is backing calls for controls on the sale of corrosive substances such as sulphuric acid, battery acid, and powerful drain cleaners.
James Berry, Conservative MP for Kingston and Surbiton, wants people buying dangerous substances to have to pay by credit or debit card so their details are recorded.
He says anyone buying the most concentrated substances should need a licence.
It follows an acid attack in Southampton, also in September last year, which left Carla Whitlock scarred and blind in one eye.
The Home Office said sulphuric acid was a reportable explosive precursor, meaning sellers must report suspicious purchases to the police.
"We are working with retailers to identify the best means of restricting sales of products with a high acidic content," said a spokesman.
