New plans for multi million pound Elgin link road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New plans for a multi million pound Elgin link road could be lodged this summer after earlier plans were rejected by Moray councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plan for the link between the A96 and Elgin's Edgar Road retail park was turned down by seven votes to six by the planning committee in November.
Officials have set out a new timetable for the road in a submission to the Scottish government.
They say construction could begin in the spring of 2016.
The road could be completed the following year.
The full council had reaffirmed its commitment to the project after the link road was rejected.
It is aimed at relieving congestion in the town.
However many residents opposed the development, on cost and safety grounds.
