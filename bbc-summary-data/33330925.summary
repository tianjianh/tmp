The 80-year-old retired Atomic Weapons Establishment scientist, of The Green in Tadley, has been described by his neighbours as a "wonderful man".
Local residents told the BBC he kept himself very physically fit having undergone heart surgery.
Tadley Town Council Chairman David Leeks said the reaction in the town was one of "pure shock".
He said: "We had a meeting last night and it was mentioned.
"We found it very difficult to believe that someone from Tadley had suffered this way.
"You don't expect something like this to happen in your community.
"Our thoughts go out to his family".
Neighbours said Mr Thompson was a keen walker who was known to do up to 60 press ups a day and loved holidays.
The BBC understands his long-term partner is currently staying with family.
Tadley Town Council will hold a minute's silence outside its offices on Friday.
The family of Mr Thompson issued a statement via Hampshire Constabulary, which stated: "We understand the interest the media has at this time, but we do not wish to be approached by nor speak to any members of the media.
"We ask that you respect our privacy and our wishes at this extremely difficult time."
The police force told the BBC the family have confirmed the death to the Foreign Office, and have been given a family liaison officer.
Twenty-one Britons have been identified as victims, with nine more believed to among the dead, Downing Street said.
