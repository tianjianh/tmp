Tom Biggs: Worcester Warriors lose winger with ankle injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester have been hit by their second major injury inside a week having been told that they face most of the rest of the season without winger Tom Biggs.

The 31-year-old Yorkshireman has been ruled out for "up to three months" with the ankle injury he suffered in Worcester's 32-22 defeat at Wasps.
It comes after scrum-half Jonny Arr was sidelined for "three to four months at least" with a knee injury.
Arr was hurt late on in the 24-20 home defeat by Harlequins on 3 January.
And it now looks like the Warriors could be without their first-choice number nine for the rest of the season.
He was an unexpected absentee for the Wasps game, and it has since emerged that he has suffered a lateral medial knee ligament injury.
Warriors have also been without skipper GJ Van Velze (knee) since November, while flanker Sam Betty and stand-off Tom Heathcote are still to return after concussion.
As for Biggs, head coach Carl Hogg confirmed: "It's a reasonably significant injury. We are hoping he doesn't need surgery, but it could be two to three months by the sound of it."
After completing their disappointing European Challenge Cup campaign with a trip to La Rochelle on Friday, Warriors are due to return to Premiership action at home to Exeter Chiefs on Sunday, 31 January.
Hogg continued: "We are fairly fortunate we have Cooper Vuna fit and healthy, and Bryce Heem has been away in New Zealand getting married. He will return for the Exeter game."
With nine games gone of a league campaign delayed by the Rugby World Cup, Dean Ryan's Worcester still have a battle on to avoid relegation.
They lie 10th, five points clear of bottom club Newcastle.
