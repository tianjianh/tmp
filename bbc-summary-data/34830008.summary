"My daughter was down the street from the Petit Cambodge, the first restaurant attacked," he said.
"I want to thank those who gave her group shelter that night close to the restaurant.
"In the hours since that, she has been able to tell me about the atmosphere in Paris, how frightened people are, but also how resolute they are.
"And today I know that in her boyfriend's circle, one young man was killed in the Bataclan concert hall and in her place of work one friend there has a close friend still missing."

"It can happen to anybody."
Latest updates on the Paris attacks
What we know about the Paris attacks
Another man said he had been on a shuttle bus outside the Stade de France "probably between the second and the third bomb".
"We had no idea that that was all kind of kicking off," he said.
A woman said there was "a sort of eeriness" in the city after the attacks, and that she and her husband had been told to stay indoors for at least 12 hours.
"Our taxi driver, she cried the whole way round. She passed the three restaurants that had been hit. I think when she saw the blood it frightened her and then she saw the bullet holes," the woman said.
Meanwhile, Paris resident Tom McGeehan, who is originally from County Down, said he would not be leaving the city.
One of Mr McGeehan's friends was wounded on Friday night: "I tried my best to stay with the close friends and the people who were affected to try and keep a bit of optimism.
"I think especially coming from a  background of Belfast that we have unfortunately kind of grown accustomed to dealing with extreme violence.
"This isn't enough to make me leave it's just enough to make me really cherish the people that I know here."
Coleraine man John Lynn travelled to Disneyland Paris on Friday night with his wife and children, aged five and two. However, the park has been closed since the attacks.
"How do you explain it to kids? I just basically said there was a pile of bad guys and something had happened in Paris and that's why Disneyland was closed," he said.
"Looking at the hotel car park, there's very few cars about it - I've noticed that there's a lot of British people and Irish people left that are stuck here till their flights go home. But there's probably very few other French people coming here - any that were here have checked out, so it has got a lot quieter.
"Yesterday there wasn't a lot to do and we thought we'd maybe go into Paris, but they [the hotel staff] basically said no, don't, everything is closed.
"At the railway station that comes into the Disney village there were three armed soldiers there on Saturday morning, but it was pretty low-key, it's not like there were soldiers walking about Disneyland."
Former Belfast priest Fr Aidan Troy, who now lives in Paris, said people in the city were offering to do what they could in the wake of the attacks.
He said: "I saw the lines of blood donors who are going to the hospitals and saying: 'You are short of blood, can we give blood?'
"Tourists are going and doing it.
"There has been a tremendous outpouring, almost like saying: 'Evil will not win, good is going to come out on top.'"
Belfast City Hall and other local government buildings in Northern Ireland were lit in the colours of the French national flag on Saturday evening in an act of "solidarity" with the French people.
Some Belfast-based French nationals said  they were "scared" to go back to Paris after the terror attacks.
