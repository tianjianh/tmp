Why not come along, meet and ride Henry the mechanical horse at some of the Official Team GB fan parks during the Rio Olympics?
Germany's Bettina Hoy, riding Designer 10, is second and New Zealander Andrew Nicholson is third on Nereo.
The competition ends of Sunday with the showjumping section.
Burton managed a score of 30.2 in Friday's dressage, with Hoy on 34.5 and Nicholson posting 35.2. Townend scored 38.1.

Australian Burton, who won Olympic bronze in Rio in the team event, is confident Nobilis 18 will perform well in the cross-country.
"The horse is a beautiful mover and today he was really relaxed, which meant I could ride forward and attack the movements," he said.
"It's not easy to feel confident about the course at Burghley, but Nobilis is a blood horse and should cope with the trip."
