After rain forced a delayed start, Lancashire struggled for momentum and posted only 131-7 from their 19 overs.
Wes Durston got Derbyshire's reply off to a flying start with 30 off 15 balls.
New Zealand batsman Hamish Rutherford then eased the visitors to victory with more than five overs to spare, hitting three sixes in his unbeaten 71.
Both sides are back in action in the competition on Friday when Lancashire host Durham, while Derbyshire face Northamptonshire.
