Rangers at Yorkshire Wildlife Park, near Doncaster, had noticed Behanisin was slightly lame on his left foreleg and had a sore shoulder.
He has been receiving laser therapy and treatments from a pulse massage machine from equine chiropractors.
Staff at the park said the giraffe was reacting well to his therapy.

Simon Marsh, animal collection manager at the park, said as giraffes aged physiological complaints were common, just as in people.
"Giraffes can weigh up to a tonne so that is a lot of weight on their frame," he said.
It is also thought the giraffe has arthritis.
Low-level laser therapy is used to treat and soften the muscles to allow Behansin to move more freely and take longer strides.
He also gets regular treatment with a pulse massage machine that stimulates soft tissue, increases blood flow through the muscle and improves joint mobility.
Mr Marsh said: "He loves the attention and always has a very calm, relaxed look when the session is over."
