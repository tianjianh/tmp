Arsenio Hall to sue O'Connor over Prince comments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Comedian Arsenio Hall is suing Sinead O'Connor after she suggested he supplied drugs to Prince.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
O'Connor alleged on Facebook that Hall had been providing drugs to the singer, who died last month, for "decades".
Hall filed a $5m (Â£3.46m) libel suit against O'Connor on Thursday, for damages to his reputation.
The comedian said O'Connor's accusations were "despicable, fabricated lies" and labelled her a "desperate attention-seeker."
O'Connor claimed she had reported Hall to the sheriff's department in the Minneapolis suburbs that is investigating Prince's sudden death.
In one of two Facebook posts about Hall, the Irish singer advised the comedian to "expect their call".
"They are aware you spiked me years ago at Eddie Murphy's house. You best get tidying your man cave," she wrote.
Hall is best known as the former presenter of a popular late-night talk show in the US and as Murphy's co-star in the film Coming to America.
A lawsuit by his lawyers filed in a Los Angeles court stated: "O'Connor is now known perhaps as much for her bizarre, unhinged rants as for her music."
It added the accusations would have been read by "countless people" on Facebook and through subsequent news reports.
He has asked for a jury trial for libel, estimating the damages to his reputation to be "not less than" $5m.
The complaint says the full extent of the damages is "not presently known", and therefore the amount could be amended before or at trial "if deemed necessary by the court".
In the lawsuit, Hall said he has had little contact with O'Connor and questioned her knowledge of Prince's life, noting that she previously admitted a tense relationship with him.
Investigators have not yet released a cause of death for Prince.
