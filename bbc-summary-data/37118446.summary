An explosion ripped through the Low Moor Munitions Company, New Works Road, on 21 August 1916, with the resulting fire triggering further explosions.
The site produced picric acid to colour carpets, but was converted into a munitions factory during World War One.
The exhibition, at Bradford City Hall, contains medals awarded to firefighters and items from a destroyed fire engine.
Six firemen died while trying to battle the fire, which took three days to put out.
About 100 hundred people were injured, 50 homes had to be demolished and a further 2,000 properties were damaged, West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said.
Councillor Geoff Reid, Lord Mayor of Bradford, opened the exhibition and said it was dedicated to the firemen who "put their lives on the line".
"This tragedy is an event in Bradford's history which should not be forgotten," he said.
