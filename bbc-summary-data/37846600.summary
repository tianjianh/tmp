Witnesses reported seeing a car mount the kerb before ploughing into a group of people near a bus stop.
One man said a teenager was "launched into the door of a fast food shop" while a woman was "sent flying".
The car was then seen turning into busy Charles Street, before heading the wrong way down a side road.
A witness who did not want to be named said: "[A car] went on to the pavement coming at massive speed up Halford Street, a one way street."
A black Hyundai was later found abandoned in nearby Bishop Street and two men were spotted fleeing the scene.
