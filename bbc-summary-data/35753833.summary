Get Inspired: FA People's Cup sees Elliott Holdham become star player

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The FA People's Cup regional semi-finals saw 400 teams compete across eight venues on 27-28 February - and for one player it was particularly special.

Elliott Holdham, who has Asperger's syndrome, heard about the competition on social media and was desperate to be involved.
His dad called up the local organisers, who invited them to watch AFC Dunstable in round one of the tournament.
On the day, the team were a player short and the 19-year-old stepped in, scoring six goals and securing a place in the side for the second round.
I am hoping to push onto bigger and better things
Holdham's father, Jason, said: "I'm really proud. Football has helped Elliott grow in confidence and he's been a breath of fresh air for the team."
His son has been a Luton Town supporter since he was six but only began playing football eight months ago.
Due to his condition, Holdham had not found a suitable team to play for, until discovering the FA People's Cup.
AFC Dunstable's manager Josh Spavin said they were "thrilled to find such a great player".
Speaking on BBC Three Counties sports programme with Geoff Doyle and Luke Ashmead, Spavin added that "without Elliott they would have struggled over the weekend".
And, even though AFC Dunstable did not manage to get through to the finals day, Holdham has high hopes for the future.
"I am hoping to push onto bigger and better things," he said.
