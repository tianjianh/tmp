[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chairman of Swansea University Council has defended the time it has taken to deal with complaints about a senior staff member.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prof Nigel Piercy resigned as dean of the School of Management on Friday, citing "differences" with the university.
Some university staff have claimed the department was run as a "dictatorship".
Chair of the university's council Sir Roger Jones said "byzantine" rules were behind delays in dealing with concerns.
Earlier this year, BBC Wales heard from university staff who voiced unhappiness about their treatment at work.
At the same time, it was announced an internal inquiry had been launched.
Past and present members of the school later questioned why the senior management team had not stepped in sooner.
On Saturday, Sir Roger said: "It's extremely difficult to make these changes, particularly when academic freedom is considered to be the big issue."
He added: "The rules and regulations and the statutes are byzantine in their complexity and it takes time to do these things."
The BBC understands Prof Piercy's son, Niall, has been suspended as pro-dean and Prof Marc Clement will take over the as acting head of the school from Monday.
The University and College Union, which represents those working in higher education, has declined to comment.
