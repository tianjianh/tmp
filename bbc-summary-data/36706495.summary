[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The coach of a primary school football team has applied for the England job, saying he is the "perfect candidate" to succeed Roy Hodgson.

As reported in the Daventry Express, Sam Chambers, coach of Weedon Bec Primary School, sent his CV to the FA after England crashed out of Euro 2016.
"I feel like the perfect candidate as I have guided my school... to an unbeaten 2015-16 season," he wrote.
Ladbrokes has made him a 1,000/1 outsider for the job.
Roy Hodgson stood down as England manager after the shock 2-1 defeat to Iceland last week.
Jessica Bridge from the bookmaker said: "Stranger things have happened in the last 12 months, like Leicester City winning the Premier League, so it's not out of the realms of possibility.
"Sam enters the record books as one of the greatest sporting underdogs of all time."
Mr Chambers, who describes himself as a "sports enthusiast", faces stiff competition from current favourites Jurgen Klinsmann and Sam Allardyce, but says he has the passion to be a success in the job.
"I, along with millions across the nation, saw our beloved team fall to the minnows that are Iceland," he wrote in his covering letter to the FA.
"It is my intention, should I be given the opportunity, to re-kindle the enthusiasm of the nation for the round-ball game."
Elaborating on his school's impressive season, Mr Chambers added he had guided his side to an unbeaten campaign - even though they faced "mighty teams such as Woodford Halse CE Primary Academy".
He ends the letter with an optimistic "I look forward to hearing from you all!"
The FA is yet to comment on Mr Chambers' application.
Earlier this year, a seven-year-old boy failed in his quest to become Inverness Caledonian Thistle's new manager, despite a pledge that his headmaster would probably let him leave school early "for important matches and training".
