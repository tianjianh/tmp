Schools in England struggle to recruit heads, says report

Many schools in England are struggling to recruit head teachers, amid increasingly negative attitudes to the job, a report warns.

It is crucial to counter negative views of headship, the Future Leaders Trust report says.
More than a quarter (28%) of existing heads are planning to leave within five years, while younger heads are unwilling to take on the role, it adds.
The government said it was taking steps to address the problem.
The report draws on research conducted jointly with the Times Educational Supplement (TES) last year, which also suggests most heads expect to leave the job within 10 years.
Separate research suggests "a clear decline" in positive perceptions of the role, the report says.
In 2009 a survey by the National College of School Leadership suggested 92% of head teachers believed they had "a great job".
But last year, another survey of senior leaders indicated almost nine in 10 (87%) felt headship was less attractive than it had been five years ago.
And research from the National Governors Association with the TES suggested 43% of 4,383 schools that recruited senior staff in 2015 had struggled to find good candidates.
Headship is "associated with high levels of stress and workload", the report says, while schools in isolated or economically deprived areas find it particularly hard to recruit heads.
"Taking up a headship in a challenging school with a poor Ofsted judgement is seen as a career risk because failure to improve the school quickly may be seen as failure," it says.
"Unsurprisingly, it is disadvantaged students in areas with relatively few opportunities, in schools that must improve, who are most affected by these negative perceptions of headship."
Future Leaders Trust chief executive Heath Monk said the talent was out there "but many people need encouragement to understand they can step up".
"The solution is for existing heads to spot potential leaders in their schools and inspire them about headship," he said.
"That means correcting the negative perceptions about the job and talking up its possibilities."
Ofsted's chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said: "It is incumbent on all leaders to plan for succession and develop potential within their teams."
Another contributor, Prof John Howson, an expert in school recruitment, said headship would not become attractive until "it is accepted that leaders themselves need support and recognition for their work".
A Department for Education spokesman said high quality school leaders were essential to the government's vision "of educational excellence everywhere".
"We are making good progress towards this goal, with Ofsted rating 85% of schools as 'good' or 'outstanding' for leadership and management, as well as a head teacher vacancy rate of just 0.2%, but we are not complacent," he said.
"Our Talented Leaders initiative is placing outstanding head teachers into struggling schools, and the National Teaching Service will place 1,500 teachers and middle leaders in underperforming schools by 2020."
