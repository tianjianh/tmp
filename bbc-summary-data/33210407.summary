The fire, at Devonshire Close, was reported to police at about 23:00 BST on Friday.
Group commander Geoff Somerville said quick reporting by the local community reduced the damage caused.
"The roof of one house was well alight, causing a significant smoke plume which covered a wide area and move into the Westlink [motorway] area," he said.
"We discovered that the cause of the fire was arson and a total of three fire appliances attended and 15 personnel."
