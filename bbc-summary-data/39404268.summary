The crash involving the 6m (20ft) vessel, Loose Cannon, happened in the early hours of Sunday in Cowes Marina.
Police said a 39-year-old man from Waterlooville, held on suspicion of possession and supply of a Class B drug, had been bailed.
A 34-year-old man, from Southsea, and a 39-year-old man, from Petersfield, have been released with no further action.
They were both arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of drugs.
All three men were taken to the island's hospital where they were treated for injuries sustained in the crash.
A two-hour search by a coastguard helicopter and two lifeboats was also carried out for another man who was reported missing from the vessel.
The RNLI said it was called off after the man was later found ashore.
