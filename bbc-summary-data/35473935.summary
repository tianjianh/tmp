Liverpool's Small Cinema has attracted a "hardcore" of fans to watch the movie a dozen times on Tuesday 2 February - the day depicted in the film.
The 1993 classic stars Bill Murray as TV weatherman Phil Connors, who has to relive the same day over and over.
One spectator said: "It's a really good film. It's well-made - it seems to be funnier the second time around."
The event at the 56-seat auditorium started at 06:00 GMT, and is running until the same time on Wednesday with only a 20-minute break between each screening.
People had to pay once to get in and can stay for 24 hours.
The cinema says it is providing tea to keep customers awake.
And according to reports in the United States, the handlers of Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, said he failed to see his shadow which means he has "predicted" an early spring.
Cinema-goers in Liverpool know how he feels.
A small band of the film's most ardent fans has gathered to watch it over and over in a special tribute event.
Half a dozen were at the first showing at 06:00. They remained in their seats for the second showing at 08:00 and intend to see it through to the 12th and final screening at 04:00 tomorrow.
Most of those taking part will watch the film a mere three or four times.
The evening showings are sold out.
Then they do it all over again. And again.
Speaking after four screenings of the film, projectionist Christopher Brown said: "I'm going to keep awake with the steady stream of tea.
"I'm too scared I'd fall asleep in the booth if I had anything stronger.
"We are getting lots of people walking up and staying for a few screenings, which is really lovely."
One fan who intended to go the whole hog told the BBC: "I thought why not? I've got nothing else better to do for the next 24 hours."
