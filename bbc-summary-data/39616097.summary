Scott Brown free to play in Rangers semi-final, with Celtic to contest red card

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic captain Scott Brown will be available for next Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers, with the club planning to appeal against the late red card he received on Sunday.

Brown was sent off for a tackle on Liam Boyce in the 2-2 draw at Ross County.
The offence would trigger a two-match suspension.
However, the Scottish FA informed clubs in advance that all disciplinary hearings for incidents this Easter weekend will take place on 28 April.
Boyce, who converted a controversial 90th-minute penalty, was booked for a tangle with Brown moments before the Celtic skipper's red-card challenge.
When asked if he had any complaints about the red card, Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers said: "No. Scotty has gone in and caught the boy late, but I'd have to see it again.
"Scott has been brilliant this season. He's never once made a challenge like that. He's been aggressive and strong.
"In his defence, the referee was letting a lot go on him. But that was the referee's making. It was a poor end to the game."
Following the semi-final at Hampden, Celtic meet Rangers again, on league duty, at Ibrox on 29 April.
