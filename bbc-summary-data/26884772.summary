Allerdale Council reveals Workington leisure centre design

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The design for a planned Â£9.4m leisure centre and swimming pool in west Cumbria has been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Allerdale Borough Council says it will provide a "modern space" to replace old facilities set to be demolished.
The complex is proposed for Brow Top in Workington town centre, after most respondents to a public consultation last year favoured the site.
But a recent parish poll funded by Workington Town Council saw nearly nine out of 10 voters oppose the plans.
The vote, which took place on 13 March and is not legally binding, had a turnout of 640 votes cast from an electorate of more than 20,000.
Most of the 1,600 people who participated in last year's consultation preferred the Brow Top site, according to Allerdale council.
Forty-six per cent of respondents favoured the inclusion of a family entertainment complex alongside the leisure facilities, for which private investors are being sought.
Allerdale's Moorclose ward councillor, Denis Robertson, has spoken out against the plans, saying the site is on a flood plain and the ground has been contaminated by illegal coal mining.
His ward includes the town's current swimming pool and leisure centre.
Detailed plans will be submitted to the council's development control department on 14 April and will go on show to the public at two open events, on 9 and 10 April.
Councillor Michael Heaslip, executive member for locality services for Allerdale, said the complex would be "modern, user-friendly, energy efficient and will give residents and visitors a fantastic leisure facility".
