[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 2-0 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford chalked up 100 goals for the season in all competitions as they saw off Shrewsbury at the Kassam Stadium to finish eighth in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrews avoided the nine-goal defeat that could have sent them down, with Port Vale's draw at Fleetwood meaning it was the Valiants who occupied the final relegation place.
Two goals in a minute early in the game put the U's in charge.
Centre-half Curtis Nelson ran through on goal from Rob Hall's backheel to hammer past goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler in the 16th minute to open the scoring.
And in the home team's next attack, Hall turned in Chris Maguire's cross from the left to make it 2-0.
The goals came despite Oxford losing both full-backs, Joe Skarz and Christian Ribeiro, to injuries in the first 13 minutes.
Bryn Morris headed wide from a good position as the Shrews tried to respond, and at the start of the second half both Abu Ogogu and Stefan Payne went close.
Kane Hemmings should have made it three as he beat two defenders in a run through on goal only to screw his shot wide from seven yards.
