A man has been jailed for life for the murder of a man outside a Norfolk pub.

Ian Church, 40, was attacked outside the former Bricklayers Arms in Great Yarmouth in 2012 and died two days later.
Stuart Layden, 33, formerly of South Quay in the town, was found guilty at Norwich Crown Court.
He was told he will have to serve almost nine years in prison before being considered for parole.
