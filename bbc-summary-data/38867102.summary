[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The veteran politician died last week aged 84 following a short illness.
His family said in a statement that he wanted his body to be left to the University of Edinburgh for research, followed by a private interment.
A memorial service is due to be held at St Michael's Parish Church in Linlithgow on Friday 24 February at 13:00.
A further service will be held in London at a date yet to be announced.
Mr Dalyell spent 43 years as an MP after being elected to represent West Lothian in 1962.
The Old Etonian baronet became MP for Linlithgow 21 years later and was named Father of the House - the longest continuously serving MP - in 2001.
He became known for his formulation of the "West Lothian Question" about the role of Scottish MPs after the establishment of the Scottish parliament.
Tributes were paid to him from across the political spectrum after his death was announced on 26 January.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called him a "titan of parliamentary scrutiny", while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said he was a "real giant" of Scottish politics.
