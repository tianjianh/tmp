Newry bookie Benedict Boyle to pay £100k over Sunday trading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Armagh bookmaker has been fined £4,500 and ordered to pay back £100,000 for illegally opening his shop for Sunday betting.

Newry Crown Court was told that Benedict Gerard Boyle, 47, of Doyles Villas, Camlough, had been opening on Sundays for two and a half years.
During that time Boyle took bets worth an estimated £250,000.
Boyle pleaded guilty in March this year to three counts of illegal Sunday trading.
The offences occurred on dates between 29 February, 2010 and 18 November, 2012.
A prosecutor told the court that after police in Newry "received intelligence'' in October 2012 that Boyle was opening his Boyle Sports bookmakers shop in the Newry's Francis Street on Sundays, a number of plain-clothed police officers visited his premises on a Sunday and found they were open.
They were able to place bets and received betting slips back.
As a result, a search of the shop was carried out by uniformed officers.
"Police found a substantial amount of betting slips which showed that he had been operating on a Sunday over a period from February 29, 2010 to November 18, 2012," the prosecutor said.
He said police estimated that somewhere in the region of £250,000 of bets had been placed over this period.
Although Boyle pleaded guilty in March, the court was told that sentencing had been adjourned until Wednesday to resolve issues around a Proceeds of Crime application.
The prosecutor told a judge the prosecution were seeking a confiscation order for £100,000 which they say was Boyle's benefit from the illegal Sunday trading.
A defence QC said Boyle had no previous relevant record for such offences and said he had not come to police attention for further offences since these crimes came to light three years ago.
The judge fined Boyle £1,500 on each of the three offences and gave him six months to pay and agreed to make a Proceeds of Crime Order in the sum of £100,000.
Boyle was told by Judge Finnegan QC that he had until March 2016 to pay back the six figure sum which he said was the "benefit of his crimes''.
"If you don't pay it back in that time, there is a default period of two years in prison,'' added the judge.
