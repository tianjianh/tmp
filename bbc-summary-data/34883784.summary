Banking on a Christmas meal: Behind the scenes at a food bank

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With a rise in the use of food banks, more families who feel the pinch will be relying on the donations of others for their Christmas meal this year. BBC News visited a food bank in Reading, which has had to expand to larger premises due to high demand, to find out how it is providing a festive feast for those in need.

At Christmas time, it is hard to ignore the all-pervading lure of mass consumerism.
Shopping streets glitteringly transform into mini tinsel towns, and TV adverts are brimful of dazzling gift ideas and soft focus Christmas table treats.
But for some families in Reading, their Christmas food will come in a donated box.
The Berkshire county town may have been named by the 2015 Good Growth for Cities index as the best place to live and work in the UK but this masks an uncomfortable truth: some 250 households have become destitute enough to need help from the local food bank, Readifood.
The charity's director Malcolm Peirce said: "We live in an incredibly affluent town but that affluence drives people on low incomes into desperate poverty.
"Housing costs, utility costs - food gets somewhere down the chain of that, and we come across people who do just get by, but only just.
"I think there is a huge hidden need out there."
Readifood volunteers work year-round to deliver non-perishable food parcels to families and individuals who have been referred by health workers or Jobcentre staff.
For the Christmas period there is the challenge to serve up a meal that does not need to be refrigerated yet is still festive.
So what does the charity provide?
Readifood co-ordinator Alison Peyton said: "We are looking for special and nice things for Christmas, so we have tins of ham and tins of salmon as a good old traditional Christmas treat.
"The donations we receive are incredible at Christmas time. We have businesses that collect, we have the supermarket collection points and we'll see the nice boxes of biscuits, the nice boxes of crackers, we get Christmas cakes and mince pies."
One of the Christmas parcel recipients is a young single mother from Whitley in Reading who has a baby and a toddler to care for.
She said: "I am lost for words.
"It means less worrying about money and shopping, and that my family has some Christmas things.
"It makes a big difference."
The charity, run by the Christian Faith Group, also started collecting advent calendars last year.
Mrs Peyton said: "That was a mum in Caversham who had this idea to have families receive these calendars.
"She put it out on Facebook and she got some local businesses [involved], then other businesses joined in.
"We had 400 advent calendars donated last year, and we've already seen them arrive."
She added: "It's lovely to think we can give those advent calendars to children who can start to open windows and get the treats and begin to build some excitement.
"We will make sure they all receive a Christmas package with treats and special food - something to give them a bit of hope and a nice feeling at Christmas."
