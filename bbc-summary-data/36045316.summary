[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A letter written by the Queen revealing how she and Prince Philip first fell in love, is to go under the hammer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The letter was written to author Betty Shew by the 21-year-old princess in 1947 - just months before her marriage.
The two-page note describes how the couple met, how they were chased by a photographer in Prince Philip's sports car and danced at London nightclubs.
It is expected to fetch between £800 to £1,200 when it is auctioned in Wiltshire at the end of the month.
The then Princess Elizabeth agreed to share the details of her relationship with the Prince of Greece and Denmark, for a royal wedding souvenir book being written by Mrs Shew.
Written in ink on white paper adorned with the royal crest, the princess recalls how she met Prince Philip at the age of 13, describes his love of fast cars and how the couple danced at nightclubs Ciro's and Quaglino's in London.
Richard Edmonds, from Chippenham Auction Rooms, said it gives a "fascinating glimpse" into the life of the then princess at a "significant time in her life".
"It starts off with when she first remembers meeting Prince Phillip in 1939 and then briefly goes on and talks about - that marriage was inevitable and it all seemed to be mapped out for her," he said.
"Then she quickly goes and talks about some of the days out with him and rides out in his little MG and on one occasion they were chased by a photographer.
"It's actually quite detailed - it's four sides long - but the price of a letter like this is very difficult to predict."
Also included in the sale on 23 April are items of Queen Victoria's intimate apparel including her knickers and nightgown, a life-size waxwork of Queen Victoria which was once displayed in Madame Tussaud's and a life-size replica of her son Prince Edward.
