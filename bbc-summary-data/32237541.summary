[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sabra Dipping Co has recalled 30,000 cases of hummus due to possible contamination with listeria bacteria.

The Food and Drug Administration announced the recall after inspectors discovered the bacteria during random testing at a Michigan retail store.
Listeria is a food-borne organism which can cause fever and nausea in most cases, and people make full recoveries.
But it can be fatal to people with weakened immune systems, and lead to miscarriages among pregnant women.
The national recall applied to Sabras Classic Hummus brand of the blended chickpea snack - five of its 60 products - although no illnesses have so far been reported.
The contamination was discovered on 30 March at a Kroger grocery store in Port Huron, Michigan.
This is the second food recall related to listeria in the US this week.
On Thursday Blue Bell Creameries expanded an earlier recall after an additional three people in Texas were made ill by its products, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.
Three people in Kansas have already died from the same outbreak.
Sabra has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.
