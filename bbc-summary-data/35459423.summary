The 18-year-old has featured once as a late substitute in a League Cup tie for the Scottish champions and signed a three-and-a-half year deal in October.
Thistle have also recruited versatile attacker Antonio German on a contract until the end of the season.
German, 24, began his career with Queens Park Rangers and arrives from a stint in India with Kerala Blasters.
The former Southend United, Yeovil Town and Gillingham player netted six goals in nine appearances in the Indian Premier League.
"I haven't seen Partick play but I bring something different; pace and power and I can play in a variety of positions so hopefully I can show what I can do," said German.
"I haven't been settled at a club. I am just trying to find a home, if that makes sense, and hopefully this could be it."
Meanwhile, Jags striker Chris Duggan, 21, is extending his loan at Queen's Park until the end of the season.
