Coventry Cat Group, which is run entirely by volunteers, can accommodate 100 cats at its centre in Allesley, and in foster homes. However, they say they are now at capacity and turning away stray animals on a daily basis.
Pat Whitehouse, from the charity, said she believed the reasons for the sudden rise in abandoned animals was a combination of hardship and ignorance.
"Most cats aren't intentionally stray, it's just that they are victims of society," she said.
