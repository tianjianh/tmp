Perthshire-based Iain Burnett took gold at the International Chocolate Awards in London for his new velvet truffle - "Caramel with a Hint of Liquorice".
He was the only UK chocolatier to win the accolade in the truffle and praline category this year.
His "Dark Sao Tome" velvet truffle took top spot at the same awards in 2015.
Mr Burnett is based at the Highland Chocolatier in Grandtully, which has been specialising in gourmet chocolate for the past 10 years.
Following his gold award, Mr Burnett said: "I'm really pleased that my new caramelised white velvet truffle has been selected.
"Liquorice is a flavour that sometimes gets a bad press but I've developed a chocolate that uses a gentle hint of liquorice with white chocolate that has been caramelised to complement it.
"The balance of chocolate and spices is combined to create a complex chocolate that is above all, delicious."
