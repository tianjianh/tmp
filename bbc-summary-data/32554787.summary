[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Kerry chef pays £370 for chip shop sauce squirt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A chef frightened staff at a chip shop by squirting tomato ketchup, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mindaugas Knyza, 37, squirted the sauce and threw chips in the Hungry Knight fast food restaurant in Sneem, County Kerry, for 15 minutes.
Knyza pleaded guilty, but avoided a conviction, after agreeing to pay €500 (£370) to a court poor box.
"I ordered chips - I don't know what happened," he said, appearing to shrug his shoulders.
The judge said: "Nobody wants to hire a chef with a conviction - especially for squirting tomato and mustard sauce all over the place."
Police were called to the incident on 20 September, last year.
Knyza, a resident of Sneem Holiday Village, told the court he worked as a chef at a hotel.
The judge said Knyza appeared to be "blasé" about the charge.
He warned him that he should consider making a contribution to the court poor box to avoid a conviction.
The judge adjourned the matter briefly and Knyza decided to consult with his solicitor.
He then offered €500 to the court and this was accepted.
The judge gave him until next October to pay.
