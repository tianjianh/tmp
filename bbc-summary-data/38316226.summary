[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital which forms part of an NHS trust that serves 2.5 million people has been rated "inadequate".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Surgery, diagnostics and outpatient care all received the lowest rating in a review of east London's Whipps Cross University Hospital.
The hospital, run by Barts Health NHS Trust, was placed in special measures last year over care quality concerns.
Trust chief executive Alwen Williams said: "We must tackle all areas where we are still letting patients down."
A Care Quality Commission (CQC) review, which formed the basis of the decision by England's chief inspector of hospitals, raised a number of serious concerns including:
Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, said Whipps Cross "must now focus on these areas as a priority".
"The hospital is moving in the right direction," he added.
Two new operating theatres and a paediatric clinical decisions unit have recently opened at the hospital.
NHS Improvement has been working to improve management at the trust, which serves Tower Hamlets, since it was placed in special measures.
"Barts Health will leave no stone unturned to further improve care," Mr Williams said.
