The Western lowland gorilla was born early, weighing 2lbs 10oz, after her mother showed signs of the potentially dangerous condition pre-eclampsia.
She needed help to breathe on her own, but staff are now "cautiously optimistic" for mother Kera and her baby daughter, who has not yet been named.
There have only been a few gorilla C-sections in the world - most recently at San Diego Safari Park in 2014.
