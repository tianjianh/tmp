Rob Page: Port Vale midfielder Anthony Grant 'not surprised' at interest in manager

Port Vale midfielder Anthony Grant says he is "not surprised" at the reported interest in his manager Rob Page.

Page last week said that there was no truth in reports linking him to the head coach's job at Cardiff City.
He was also again tipped for a return to his former club Sheffield United, prior to another ex-Blade Chris Wilder getting the job - and he is now linked to Wilder's old post at Northampton.
"It's no surprise. He's done very well with a limited budget," said Grant.
"Whether it be someone like Cardiff City or Sheffield United, or whoever it might be, with a big budget, he'd be bound to do well.
"He understands the players inside out," Vale's 28-year-old player of the year told BBC Radio Stoke.
"The players haven't got a bad word to say about him. Even the ones who aren't playing. That says everything about him."
As a player, uncompromising centre-half Page won 41 caps for Wales and made 550 career appearances over 18 years at Watford, Sheffield United, Cardiff City, Coventry City, Huddersfield Town and Chesterfield.
He is halfway through his current two-year contract at Vale Park, having been appointed as successor to Micky Adams, initially as caretaker boss, in September 2014.
He has been in the Potteries for five years, having first been brought in to join the Vale coaching staff in 2011 by Adams.
After being tipped to be relegated at the start of the season, he guided Vale to a top-half finish in League One.
Vale finished 12th, a rise of six places from last season, despite going down to their biggest loss in over two years at home to Walsall on the final day.
