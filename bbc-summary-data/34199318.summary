[SN]TITLE[SN]
Help to Buy scheme hits monthly record in June

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of homes sold under the government's Help to Buy scheme hit a record during the month of June, figures show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some 4,745 new homes were sold under the equity loan part of the scheme, the highest total since it began in April 2013.
Since then, a total of 112,803 mortgages have been arranged under Help to Buy.
The majority of sales - 80% - have been made to first-time buyers.
The two parts of the scheme are running neck-and-neck, with 56,401 homes sold under the mortgage guarantee part.
A similar number - 56,402 - have been sold under the equity loan scheme.
The mortgage guarantee scheme - under which the government promises that a mortgage is repaid - is due to end in December 2016.
The equity loan scheme - under which the government takes a stake of up to 20% in the value of a home - has been extended to 2020.
Both schemes enable buyers to put down a deposit of just 5%.
