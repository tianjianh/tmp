Heritage grants for Carneddau mountains and Holy Island

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans aimed at preserving the heritage of mountains in Snowdonia deemed "at risk" have taken a step forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Carneddau Landscape Partnership has been awarded £198,700 Heritage Lottery funding to help it manage the natural and cultural heritage of the area.
It claims the mountains' archaeology, ecology, peatland and Bronze Age cairns are among the things "under threat".
Funding has also been set aside to improve the heritage of Holy Island, off Anglesey.
The initial funding approval for the Carneddau Landscape Partnership means the seven-year project can now seek the full £1.9m grant.
The project, led by Snowdonia National Park Authority, will cover 81 sq miles (210 sq km) which features Carnedd Llywelyn as its highest peak.
Jonathan Cawley, the national park authority's director of planning and land management, said: "We are truly excited about working on such an important project which will be of enormous benefit to the local communities and to the natural and cultural heritage of the mountains."
Of the funding set aside to improve Holy Island, Anglesey council has been awarded £117,200 to develop plans on behalf of the Tir a Mor Landscape Partnership.
The plans will be presented to the Heritage Lottery Fund at a later date to seek final approval for the full £1.2m grant.
They include projects which celebrate Holy Island's culture and landscape, involving people who live and work there.
Richard Bellamy, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales, said: "Heritage Lottery Fund money works hard to ensure all of our important heritage is looked after.
"But it's not all about grand old buildings, castles and museums. There is natural heritage all around us, especially here in Wales, which is vital to our economy, our livelihoods and our wellbeing."
