[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fairy tales could be 4,000 years older than we'd thought

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Big news about some of your favourite fairy tales as new research suggests they might date back thousands of years earlier than it was originally thought.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Using techniques normally used by biologists, the researchers investigated common links between stories from around the world.
The study found that stories like Beauty and the Beast and Rumpelstiltskin can be traced back around 4,000 years, with one tale originating from the Bronze Age (around 6,000 years ago).
Until now it was thought they they only dated back around 500 years.
We asked you which ones you love and why? Thanks to everyone who sent is their favourite.

In class we are looking at alternative fairy tales. We've been reading Revolting Rhymes by Roald Dahl. Our favourite one is Little Red Riding Hood. It's just like the original but with a different ending. It's really funny.
