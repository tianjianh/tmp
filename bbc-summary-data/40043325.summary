A council community safety team is also carrying out checks around the clock at the Interfloor site at Heathhall.
It comes after a meeting of Dumfries and Galloway's local resilience partnership group at the weekend.
It warned young people who were still entering the building despite repeated warnings that it was an "extremely dangerous playground".
The resilience partnership is made up of bodies including Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue Services, Dumfries and Galloway Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the NHS.
It agreed that patrols of the perimeter of the building should be carried out "day and night".
Fencing has been added to fill in gaps and ground floor windows boarded up.
Children have been continuing to slip into the building despite repeated warnings of the dangers.
Talks are ongoing with the owners of the site to try to make it safe.
Insp Gordon McKnight said: "The site at Interfloor has been fenced off for very good reasons and is clearly a dangerous place to go into.
"I would urge parents to ensure that they highlight this to any children who might think of venturing into the area.
"Police and community safety teams are actively patrolling the area and anyone found in, or attempting to get into the site will be dealt with through the courts where appropriate."
Anyone who sees anything suspicious has been asked to contact police.
