Morecambe boss Jim Bentley has questioned whether the club negotiated the best deal for Tom Barkhuizen when he moved to Preston in January.

He has scored four goals in eight games since his move to the Lilywhites.
Ex-Blackpool player Barkhuizen, 23, had mutually cancelled his deal at the Shrimps but the League Two side did get compensation for the transfer.
"Let's not forget we've sold our best player who is now pulling up trees at Preston," said Bentley.
He told BBC Radio Lancashire: "For me, the people who negotiated that deal could've done better.
"Without going too in depth because he could easily get a move again, there are certain things that I was unhappy with in that department."
