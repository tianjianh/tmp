Addenbrooke's Hospital admits causing woman's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hospital bosses have admitted causing the death of a patient who was sent home and told her deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was a ligament injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joan Hawes, 77, went to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in July thinking her leg pain might be a blood clot.
Medics sent her home with painkillers after diagnosing a ligament injury. The next morning she was found dead.
Coroner Simon Milburn ruled Mrs Hawes died of natural causes as deep vein thrombosis had not been detected.
Mrs Hawes was assessed by a triage nurse when she arrived at the hospital and blood tests were ordered, Huntingdon Coroners' Court heard.
However, during a later examination, she was told the pain in her knee was caused by a ligament injury and the tests were cancelled.
She was discharged with painkillers and advised not to climb stairs.
The coroner heard Mrs Hawes had spent the night downstairs. In the morning she was found unresponsive by her 84-year-old husband Terrence, who called 999.
A paramedic who went to their home confirmed she had died.

Solicitor Amanda Cavanagh said the family received a letter on Tuesday from the trust which accepted "liability and causation in the death of Mrs Hawes".
"The family are understandably deeply distressed at what has happened to Mrs Hawes, an otherwise fit and healthy woman," she said.
"They were looking to the inquest for answers, and in some respects this admission by Addenbrooke's will go some way to provide them."
In a statement after the inquest, a spokesperson for Cambridge University Hospitals said a formal apology had been offered to the family.
"An investigation was carried out to make sure lessons could be learned from what happened to Joan and a detailed action plan has been put in place to improve the way deep vein thrombosis is recognised and treated," the statement said.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that usually develops within a deep leg vein that runs through the muscles of the calf and the thigh.
It is a serious condition and can lead to complications such as a pulmonary embolism.
Symptoms include pain and swelling in one leg, a heavy ache and warm, red skin on the back of the leg below the knee.
If left untreated, about one in 10 people with DVT will develop a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening as it prevents blood reaching the lungs.
Both DVT and pulmonary embolism require urgent investigation and treatment.
Each year, DVT affects about one person in every 1,000 in the UK.
It is most common in the over-40s, as well as with people who have prolonged inactivity, are pregnancy or obese.
