The 55-year-old former Wales international had been at the Gills for three seasons and was caretaker manager when Peter Taylor was sacked in 2014.
"His experience will be invaluable this season," said Bromley boss Neil Smith.
"I have known Steve for over 20 years as both player and a coach. I cannot wait to start working with him," Smith added to the club website.
Lovell began his playing career at Crystal Palace and also had lengthy spells with Millwall and Gillingham.
