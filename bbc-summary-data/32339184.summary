[SN]TITLE[SN]
Facebook to appeal sex offender £20K damages ruling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Facebook is to appeal a High Court ruling that ordered it to pay £20,000 in damages to a convicted sex offender who featured on its site.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph McCloskey, who operated the page, is also to appeal the decision.
In February, a judge found him and Facebook Ireland Limited liable for misuse of private information.
The plaintiff, CG, was convicted in 2007 of a number of sex offences. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and released on licence in 2012.
In 2014, he brought an action seeking damages and an injunction on the basis that Facebook and Mr McCloskey had misused private information, in breach of Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European Court of Human Rights, and were guilty of actionable negligence.
A judge awarded £15,000 against Facebook and Mr McCloskey in respect of the postings on the page.
The judge also awarded £5,000 against Facebook over the postings by the father of one of CG's victims, who operated a separate page.
He also ordered Facebook to close the page Keeping our Kids Safe from Predators 2.
Since the verdict, two of CG's victims have gone to court to sue him.
An injunction was granted to freeze any payouts until those cases are dealt with.
On Wednesday, lawyers for Facebook and Mr McCloskey lodged papers at the Court of Appeal.
The appeals are expected to be mentioned in June.
