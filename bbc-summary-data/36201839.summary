[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The man accused of murdering prison officer Adrian Ismay has been granted bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Alphonsos Robinson appeared at Belfast's High Court for a hearing on Wednesday.
Mr Ismay, who was a father-of-three, died from his injuries eleven days after a bomb exploded under his van in east Belfast in March.
Dissident republicans claimed responsibility for the attack.
On Wednesday, the court was told that Mr Robinson, of Aspen Park in Dunmurry, told the police he knew Mr Ismay.
The court heard they had a "good working relationship" as volunteers for St John's Ambulance.
The judge said while "one has a natural revulsion" to the crime, there was also a "presumption of innocence".
Mr Robinson was granted bail with strict conditions imposed, including electronic tagging and an exclusion order for an area of east Belfast.
The defence told the court there was "no way" that Mr Robinson would jeopardise a trial if released on bail.
