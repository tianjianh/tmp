Paul Cook: Portsmouth manager bemoans lack of consistency

Portsmouth manager Paul Cook says his side's 'consistent inconsistency' has hampered their League Two promotion hopes.

Seventh-place Pompey drew 1-1 at Yeovil on Saturday and travel to Barnet on Tuesday as they look for a first away win in more than two months.
"The reality is we have missed chances to put pressure on the teams above us," Cook told BBC Radio Solent.
"It's the teams below us that are now putting pressure on us."
Portsmouth have lost just twice away from home in the league all season, but sit six points adrift of Oxford in the last automatic promotion place with a game in hand over the U's.
"Our inconsistency this season has so far been our consistency," Cook added. "Other teams in the division are doing stuff they haven't been doing before.
"AFC Wimbledon have won six out of the last seven, Cambridge United under Shaun Derry are putting a good run together.
"All season we have dropped points away from home and at home. But, how can we only lose twice away and not be in a better position?"
Portsmouth will be without Christian Burgess at Barnet, with the central defender suspended for one game after being sent off at Yeovil.
