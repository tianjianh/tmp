Prince George and Princess Charlotte in Canada play day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prince George and Princess Charlotte have played with children of the Canadian military at a rare joint appearance at an official event.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlotte, 16 months, was heard speaking in public for the first time - saying "pop" at the balloons that filled Government House in Victoria.
The residence was transformed into a children's paradise, which included a petting zoo and miniature ponies.
The play day was on day six of the Cambridges' eight-day tour of Canada.
It is the first official trip all four of the family have been on together.

Those who chronicle the lives of the Cambridges now know that balloons are the way to a 16-month-old princess's heart and Charlotte's first public utterance was to use the word "pop".
And for toddler George there was much fun to be had squirting bubbles at his father - even if he is a future king of Canada and the UK.
Considerable column inches are generated from such offerings. The power of the images is considerable.
The children personify the future of the Canadian monarchy in a country that may, one day, chose a different path.
There's no sign, at the moment, of that being the desire of the majority of Canadians.
George and Charlotte, on display, will not become an everyday occurrence.
William and Kate are determined their children grow up in private and not in public.  This party will attract global attention because of its rarity value.

Prince William could be heard saying "are we going to go pop?" to his daughter and then asked her: "Would you like a balloon, Charlotte?"
Charlotte is said to have made everyone in the grounds of Government House - the home of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia -  laugh when she tried to lift up a huge balloon archway that led to the petting zoo.
George appeared excited by the attractions and could not resist squirting Charlotte with bubbles.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were said to be happy that the event had been staged for them and pleased their son and daughter had the opportunity to play with others.
