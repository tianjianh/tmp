A number of men from Northern Ireland who responded to requests to perform sex acts online have been targeted by blackmailers, police have said.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said it was issuing a warning after it received "several local reports of cyber-related blackmail".
Recordings of the sex acts were used by blackmailers who threatened to publish the footage online if they did not pay.
The victims were told to transfer money to an account based in west Africa.
The Belfast Telegraph newspaper has reported that the crimes happened in the Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Antrim areas of County Antrim.
The PSNI posted the warning on its Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus Facebook page.
In the statement, Det Sgt Neil Maxwell said: "In the most recent cases men of various ages have been asked to perform or participate in a sexual act online which is recorded and then used to blackmail the individual with threats to upload the material on to social media platforms.
"Some victims have paid money because they have felt embarrassed and this usually involves a Western Union transfer to an account in the Ivory Coast.
"We want anyone who has been the victim of this type of crime to come forward. Do not feel pressurised into paying money as this is unlikely to resolve the issue," the officer added.
Chief Supt George Clarke told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme that the PSNI are dealing with up to ten reports a month from people being blackmailed online.
