Byron Moore hit the post earlier on for the hosts while AJ Leitch Smith nearly turned home Colin Daniel's cross.
Midfielder Kelly got the winner when he cut in from the left and beat three defenders before firing home.
Bury striker Leon Clarke forced a saved from Jak Alnwick late on but the Shakers have now lost six straight league games away from home.
Bury boss David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"We had a surge at times, second half we had a bit of a surge.
"There's nothing in the game, I'm really disappointed with the goal.
"The boy Kelly has come on the inside track, really unchallenged. It disappoints me that you can win a game on that. We didn't protect each other.
"We looked quite threatening at set-pieces, but still not creating enough chances so I've really got to get my teeth into improving that."
