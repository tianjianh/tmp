Two teams of celebrities will meet on 5 June to raise money for Unicef.
Mourinho will be assisted by Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce, with Soccer Aid co-founder Robbie Williams as coach.
"I want to be the first one to win the Soccer Aid trophy for both teams," said the Portuguese, who coached Rest of the World to a 4-2 win in 2014.
"Sam and I will make a very good partnership and it will be a great feeling for Claudio to finally lose a match."
Ranieri, manager of Premier League leaders Leicester City, added: "It is a great honour that Robbie Williams has asked me to manage the Rest of the World XI and I'm looking forward to helping them defend their title."
