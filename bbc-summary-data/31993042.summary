[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been arrested after a diesel laundering plant was dismantled in County Tyrone on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Customs and police officers found the plant in a shed at premises in Ardboe.
It was capable of producing over one million litres of illicit fuel a year, evading over Â£700,000 in lost duty and taxes, Customs said.
A transit van and nearly four tonnes of toxic waste - the by-product of the laundering process - were removed from the site.
The man is still being questioned and investigations are ongoing.
