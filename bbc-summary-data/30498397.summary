A man from Inverness who admitted stabbing a former friend six times in a frenzied attack at a flat in the city's Diriebught Court has been jailed.

Sean Boyle, 20, repeatedly knifed 25-year-old Sean Pierce on 13 August.
The men had been arguing about Boyle's absence from a job that Mr Pierce had secured for him.
During the assault, Boyle stripped to his waist and pursued his victim down a street before police arrived. He has been sentenced to 40 months in prison.
Boyle, who was jailed at the High Court in Aberdeen, had earlier admitted assaulting Mr Pierce to his severe injury, permanent disfigurement and to the danger of his life.
He was on bail at the time of the offence and has a previous conviction for assault.
