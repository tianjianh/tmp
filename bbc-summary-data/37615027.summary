Milton Keynes Dons 3-3 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matty Taylor's second-half hat-trick earned Bristol Rovers a late draw at MK Dons in a six-goal thriller.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Now without a win in 12 league matches on home soil - a run that dates back to March - the Dons twice held a two-goal lead before Taylor rescued an unlikely point for Rovers.
Dean Bowditch opened the scoring for the hosts after 16 minutes from close range when goalkeeper Kelle Roos spilt a 20-yard strike from Ben Reeves.
Lively winger Ryan Colclough thundered a shot against the crossbar before defender George Williams nodded his first Dons goal via a post in the 24th minute.
Bowditch headed inches wide on the half hour as the hosts went close to making it 3-0.
Taylor threw Rovers a lifeline just 66 seconds after the break with a superb right-foot strike from 20 yards.
Dons' nerves eased again when Reeves cut inside in the 66th minute to restore the two-goal gap.
Rovers' more physical second-half approach left Dons boss Karl Robinson livid on the touchline and his back line finally cracked as Taylor pounced twice from close range in the 87th and 89th minutes.
