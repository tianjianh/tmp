Chancellor's EU funds 'U-turn' welcomed by Máirtín Ó Muilleoir

Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir has welcomed a "U-turn" by the chancellor that lifts a threat to some EU peace and structural funding.

Mr Ó Muilleoir had warned as much as £300m was at risk of being lost.
He said Philip Hammond has "seen sense and will underwrite all letters of offer made between now and when Brexit negotiations are concluded".
Previously, the chancellor's guarantee only covered the period until his Autumn Statement next month.
But, his new position was outlined at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on Monday.
The move has also been welcomed by the Ulster Unionist Party.
Its finance spokesman Philip Smith said: "This will increase confidence levels of businesses and the community and voluntary sector who are reliant on structural and investment funds."
But Mr Ó Muilleoir said the chancellor has made no commitments on what will replace EU funding once Brexit happens, currently due in 2019.
He also said Northern Ireland is facing "economic turbulence" as the government "is cutting our resource budgets by 4% between now and 2020".
"Removing that threat to our budgets would be the single biggest stimulus the British government could provide to ensure we can navigate the choppy economic waters ahead."
