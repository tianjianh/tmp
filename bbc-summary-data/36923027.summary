[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teacher Ronald Burton guilty of abusing former pupils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A retired teacher has been convicted of sexually abusing two pupils at secondary schools in South Lanarkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronald Burton was convicted of lewd and libidinous behaviour towards the first boy, who was aged between 11 and 13, from 1994 until 1996.
The 60-year-old, from East Kilbride, was also convicted of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy in 2014.
At the High Court in Glasgow, sentence on Burton was deferred until September and his bail was continued.
The court heard that Burton had taught maths and had been an assistant principal teacher.
The jury heard that he got to know the first victim around 1994 when he was in first year and later went on to abuse him.
The abuse ended when the boy was around 15.
The victim told the court: "I ended up thinking I was the one in the wrong."
Burton later moved schools and eventually abused a second boy.
The teacher was finally reported to police after the first victim told he felt "worthless" and later confronted Burton.
In his closing speech, prosecutor Paul Kearney described Burton as "highly manipulative" in carrying out "systematic sexual abuse".
Burton had faced other charges including claims he raped the second victim and also tried to hypnotise him, but these were dropped by prosecutors.
