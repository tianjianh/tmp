[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man in court over north Belfast police shooting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 46-year-old man has been remanded in custody charged with attempted murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a gun attack on a police car on Christmas Day in north Belfast. No one was injured.
A police officer told Belfast Magistrates' Court he could connect Matthew McMullan, from Heath Lodge Close in Belfast, to the charges.
The court heard Mr McMullan had spent a number of weeks in Belfast's Mater Hospital under the Mental Health Act ahead of the shooting.
The court also heard his family described him in witness statements acting irrationally, foaming at the mouth, extremely distressed and "like a mad man" on the night of the incident.
The court heard Mr McMullan has no recollection of the shooting on 25 December.
A defence solicitor asked for Mr McMullan to be bailed but to be remanded in hospital for further psychological assessment.
