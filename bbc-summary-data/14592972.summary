The Pallas's cats are the first to be born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland site. In the wild the species are found in Iran, Mongolia and China.
The park has already unveiled other new offspring including young capercaillie and a snowy owl chick.
Grey and fluffy, the kittens will be raised by their parents Beebop and Alula.
The zoological society said Pallas's cats were under threat in the wild and a European Zoo Association captive breeding programme was being managed by Highland Wildlife Park staff.
