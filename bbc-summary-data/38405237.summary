Jones, 39, and Cardiff Blues pair Danny Wilson and Matt Sheratt have been added to Wales' staff for the Pacific Islands tour in June 2017.
Wales head coach and assistant Rob Howley are away with the British and Irish Lions next summer.
"Stephen will obviously get a lot out of it but I think there'll be more going the other way," said Pivac.
Jones played well over 200 matches for Llanelli and Scarlets and returned to west Wales as a backs coach in 2015 after a spell as part of Dai Young's coaching team at Wasps.
Pivac believes he has a future at international level.
"He's been identified as a coach with a lot of potential and someone I believe will be a fine international coach going forward. He's going to be world class," said the New Zealander.
"Wales are talking about playing an attacking game so I think Stephen will be able to add something there. He's taken a lot of his qualities he showed as a player into his coaching."
Jones scored 917 points in 104 appearances for Wales and played fly-half in six Test matches for the British and Irish Lions.
He is now sharing his expertise with Scarlets stand-off Rhys Patchell, a combination Pivac says is key to the team's success.
"The relationship between the two is blossoming and that's great for Welsh rugby going forward," he added.
"Technically Stephen is very very sound, tactically very switched on. We're in a pretty good place as a result of the hard work he's been doing."
