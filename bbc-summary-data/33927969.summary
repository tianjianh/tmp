GAA calls in Croke Park hawk to tackle pigeon pitch invasions

Ireland's biggest sporting organisation has signed up a fearsome new recruit to tackle some unwelcome fowl play at its main stadium in Dublin, Croke Park.

The Gaelic Athletic Association called in a hawk after pigeons perched on the pitch during recent showpiece matches.
Pigeons were an almost permanent fixture on the field during the All-Ireland football quarter-finals between Monaghan and Tyrone on 8 August.
But after the hawk's visit, they stayed offside during games.
The GAA's head of media, Alan Milton, said pigeons can often pose problems at Croke Park at this time of year, but they decided to take action after the birds began to stay on the pitch, even during play.
Mr Milton described this as "unusual" behaviour.
GAA pundit Joe Brolly, who was a spectator at the match between Monaghan and Tyrone, shared a photo of the pitch pests on social media.
Mr Brolly said the pigeons "simply moved around the pitch" for most of the game.
"Safest place in Croke Park during a Monaghan-Tyrone match," he tweeted from his stadium seat.
Many GAA fans may even be envious of the pigeons' free, bird's eye view of the action, but it appears it is not the football but fast food that is attracting the birds.
"We are putting grass seed down on a continuous basis and they like to drop in for a treat. They obviously find it very tasty,"  the stadium's director, Peter McKenna, told the  Irish Independent newspaper.
"They are a nuisance at any time, let alone on match days."
The stadium director said pigeons were getting "used to the various tricks" that GAA staff used to deter them, so they had to change their approach.
On Monday, Mr Milton told the BBC there had been no repeat of the pitch invasion during weekend matches at Croke Park.
He said he believed the introduction of the hawk had played a part, but he put it down to a "combination of factors".
Less seeding would make the stadium less attractive to the birds, he added.
The GAA is not the first sporting body to use hawks to frighten off pigeons and seagulls ahead of major tournaments.
In London, an American Harris Hawk called Rufus has been deployed to patrol the skies above Wimbledon during the annual tennis championships.
In Wales, the Millennium Stadium once employed the services of a resident hawk, called Dad and in Scotland, a team feathered guards was recruited to deter pigeons from taking up resident at parliament buildings.
It is also not the first time the GAA has called in a hawk to settle scores at Croke Park.
In April 2013, the association introduced its Hawkeye detection system to assist referring decisions.
The technology tracks the ball's trajectory over goal posts, to remove any ambiguity over whether a point was scored or missed.
It is hoped the use of real hawks will mean Croke Park becomes a no-fly zone for pigeon pitch invaders.
