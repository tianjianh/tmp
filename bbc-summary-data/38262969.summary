Troubles killings: Police deny soldier 'witch hunt'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The PSNI has rebutted claims retired British soldiers are victims of a "witch-hunt" by police investigating Troubles killings.

A number of reports in recent days have claimed a new investigation has been launched into 302 killings by soldiers.
The PSNI has told the BBC there is no new investigation.
It was announced three years ago that deaths caused by the army were to re-examined as well as all of the other killings during the Troubles.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton, who leads the PSNI's Legacy Investigation Branch said: "There is no witch hunt, there is no specific unit looking at the army, there is no specific probe into killings by the army.
"I have a statutory responsibility, under UK law, to make sure there are effective investigations into all of the 3,200 deaths during the Troubles."
The re-examination of killings during the Troubles began a decade ago, when a specialist police unit called the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) was established.
The team was disbanded three years ago after an inspection report was highly critical of the standard of its investigations.
A report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary published in July 2013 was particularly critical of the way it handled deaths attributed to the army.
It said killings where the state was involved were investigated with "less rigour" than others.
The inspectors also said the HET's approach to cases involving the state was inconsistent with the European Convention on Human Rights.
In response to that report, the PSNI announced publically in July 2013 that it would re-examine military cases to ensure the quality of the review reached the required standard.
In a statement Mr Hamilton said: "Between 1 January, 1969, and 1 March, 2004, there were more than 3,200 homicides in Northern Ireland.
"The review of all these cases and, where investigative opportunities are identified, the further investigation of them, is the responsibility of the PSNI's Legacy Investigation Branch.
"There is no new single probe or bespoke inquiry into deaths attributed to the British Army. All Troubles related deaths will be reviewed by LIB using the Case Sequencing Model which does not prioritise military cases. This is not a new decision."
Speaking to journalists at Westminster on Friday, a spokesman for the Prime Minister was asked if Theresa May was in favour of re-opening investigations in to all military killings in Northern Ireland.
The spokesperson replied: "Not sure why there is a flurry of interest."
"This has gone on since the HMIC report in 2013. It was up to the PSNI to re-examine all military cases, it's a matter for them."
The spokesman also pointed out that a proposed new Historical Investigations Unit will re-examine all killings "across the board", and that "90 per cent of the killings were at the hands of terrorists."
