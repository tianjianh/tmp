Nancy 0-1 Nice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nice overcame the absence of the injured Mario Balotelli to win 1-0 at Nancy and return to the top of Ligue 1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Balottelli, who has scored four times in two league games since signing from Liverpool in August, was absent with an adductor muscle problem.
But a second-half strike from Alassane Plea extended Nice's unbeaten start and took them back above Monaco.
"To have 17 points after seven matches is magnificent. We are all happy," said coach Lucien Favre.
