Carál Ní Chuilín was speaking during a visit to the construction site at Glenfada Park in Londonderry's Bogside.
Building work began last summer and the new money is in addition to funds of £2.4m.
The museum deals directly with the Northern Ireland Troubles and is close to where the events of Bloody Sunday took place in the city.
On 30 January 1972, a civil rights march in Derry ended with the shooting dead of 13 people by the Army.
The Saville Report, published on 15 June 2010, was heavily critical of the Army and found that soldiers fired the first shot.
Speaking before Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "deeply sorry" and that the findings of the report were "shocking".
The new building is due to be finished and ready by June 2016.
