David Brickwood murder: Northampton silence 'spineless' says son

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The son of an elderly man murdered in his home has used the first anniversary of his death to accuse people of being "gutless and spineless" for not helping to identify his killers.

David Brickwood, 74, was stabbed five times on 26 September 2015 in a "violent and dreadful" attack at his Northampton home. He died in hospital.
"Northampton knows who did this," Gary Brickwood said. "Dad was one of their own. I can't believe they'd let it go."
No-one has been charged.
Mr Brickwood - a grandfather and father to sons Gary, Dale and Nathan - died after being attacked in his home in Lindsay Avenue, Abington, in the early hours of the morning.
Gary, the eldest son, went to the house after being told of his father's death by his brother Dale.
He said: "I saw all the blood on the stairs. I'll never forget it.
"I asked the cop, 'Is my dad dead?' He hung his head and said, 'Yes'."
A scrap metal dealer, Mr Brickwood was known to keep money in his home and Gary maintains this was the motive.
He said: "I don't think they meant to murder dad, but this was planned. He was watched. This was set up."
A BBC Crimewatch reconstruction showed one or more people breaking in, confronting Mr Brickwood and stabbing him before leaving with cash and jewellery.
Dale, who identified the body, said: "Seeing my poor dad dead, and seeing wounds on his head, then having to ring my brothers and tell them Dad's been murdered, the screams down the phone... I will never forget."
One year later the family is still searching for answers.
Gary added: "I saw Dad several times the day before he died, but I ask myself, 'Why didn't I stop by just one more time?'"
"I'm driven by grief and anger.
"People know who did this, but they're afraid to speak. I'm not.
"I go to the cemetery twice a day, but I can't mourn.
"Our dad was Abington and there are people in Northampton who know who did this - they're gutless and spineless."
He added: "I really believed they would come together to get justice for our father."
The family will hold a candlelit vigil on Monday.
Police are also expected to re-appeal for information.
