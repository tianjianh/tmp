Great Britain's 2008 4x400m women's relay team set to get Olympic bronzes

Great Britain's 2008 women's 4x400m relay team are set to be upgraded to Olympic bronze medallists as a result of retrospective drug tests.

Belarus' Sviatlana Usovich tested positive when her samples were reanalysed and, as a result, the whole of her team will be disqualified.
The GB quartet - Christine Ohuruogu, Kelly Sotherton, Marilyn Okoro and Nicola Sanders - finished fifth.
They were promoted to fourth in August, when Russia were disqualified.
That followed Anastasiya Kapachinskaya testing positive for banned steroids when her samples were reanalysed.
Sotherton, who won heptathlon bronze in Athens in 2004, told BBC Sport she was experiencing "lots of different emotions".
"Ultimately, I'm happy, but I just wish at the time I had an opportunity to be on the podium," she said.
"I feel like I've lost eight years of calling myself a double Olympic medallist. There could have been more sponsorship deals going into London 2012 for all of us, more bonuses, a lot more adulation.
"It's not just the athletes who lose out, it's maybe the athletes' families, support staff and the sport, which relies on people to win medals to gain funding from UK Sport."
Sotherton said she did not think cheating would ever cease.
She added: "It doesn't matter what measures you have in place. Maybe criminalising people who cheat in sport might be more of a deterrent, but that probably still won't stop people."
British javelin thrower Goldie Sayers and GB's men's 4x400m team have already been promoted to 2008 Olympic bronze medallists as a result of doping disqualifications.
Usovich, an 800m runner who competed in the relay final, tested positive for the prohibited steroid dehydrochlormethyltestosterone (turinabol).
