Six Nations: Manu Tuilagi named in England squad to play Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manu Tuilagi returns to England's matchday squad to face Wales in the Six Nations at Twickenham on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Leicester centre, 24, has not played for England since June 2014 because of a groin injury and disciplinary issues.
He replaces Alex Goode in the 23-man squad and is likely to start on the bench, while Northampton prop Kieran Brookes has also been included.
Head coach Eddie Jones will name his starting XV on Thursday.
Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie replaces Jamie George, who suffered an arm injury in training last Thursday.
Brookes has been named in place of club team-mate Paul Hill for the game between the two unbeaten countries in this season's competition.
Tuilagi has scored 11 tries in 25 England appearances, but his international career has been disrupted by injury and disciplinary problems.
He was left out of the World Cup squad last year after admitting assaulting police officers in April 2015, an offence which he denied in September.
Named in England's original 33-man training squad to face Wales, he was released to play for Leicester last weekend.
Tuilagi scored his first Premiership try for almost two years as Leicester beat Exeter 31-27.
England flanker James Haskell said: "He is a threat and a very special player. I don't often look at people and think 'I wish I had some of his genes'. He is pace, power and strength personified.
"He will have an impact, he always does. I've played with him against some of the best teams in the world and he causes everybody trouble.
"Even if he has a bad day, someone will still get taken down or he'll run through someone. Very few players have the ability to do that.
"He was obviously sorely missed at the World Cup. Whenever he is not involved in the game he is missed."
England are one point clear of Wales at the top of the Six Nations table after winning their first three games.
