The music festival, staged in Dumfries and Galloway, was cancelled this year but was due to return in 2017.
Its co-founder Jamie Gilroy died following a firearm incident in 2014.
A statement on the festival's Facebook page said: "After much thought and consideration Patsy Gilroy and Jennie Camm have decided that the Wickerman Festival will not be continuing."
It added: "Since it's creation by Jamie Gilroy, Founding Director, the festival has provided us all with an eclectic mix of memories.
"It's these that we wish people to look back on and remember. Thank you all for your loyal support over the years and please feel free to post your favourite moments for all of us to enjoy."
2015 was the 14th edition of the event held at East Kirkcarswell Farm near Dundrennan.
The festival is famous for hosting an eclectic line up of musicians and its annual Saturday night climax - the torching of a wicker effigy.
Acts to have performed at the event over the years include Fun Lovin' Criminals, Primal Scream, Dizzee Rascal, The Proclaimers, Lulu, The Waterboys, The Human League, Shed Seven and the Charlatans.
