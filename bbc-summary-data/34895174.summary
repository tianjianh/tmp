Vardy equalled Ruud van Nistelrooy's record in Saturday's 3-0 win at Newcastle, taking Leicester City to the top of the Premier League table.
"There's a lot of hard work gone into it and long may it continue," Vardy told the BBC.
"Hopefully I'll keep scoring the goals to get Leicester points."
The all-time record for the English top flight in goals is held by Sheffield United's Jimmy Dunne who scored in 12 consecutive games in the 1931-32 season of the old First Division.
