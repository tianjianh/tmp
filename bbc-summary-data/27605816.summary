[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rare black lemur, which is classed as an endangered species, has been born at an East Sussex zoo.

The baby, which is yet to be named, was born at Drusillas Park in Alfriston to parents Lotfi and Clementine.
The pair have been at the zoo since  2009 as part of the European Endangered Species Programme.
Black lemurs are native to Madagascar and are vulnerable due to hunting and deforestation.
Clementine and Lotfi came to Drusillas from zoos in Portugal and Tunisia.
A Drusillas spokeswoman said they could not tell yet if the baby was male or female but that it would become clear when their markings and colourings appeared.
She said: "Males are all black with striking orange eyes, whereas females are brown with long white ear tufts.
"Once this has been established, the zoo team will get on with the very important business of naming their beautiful little lemur."
