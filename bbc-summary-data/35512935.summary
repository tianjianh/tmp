Christie, 25, finished in two minutes 41.20 seconds ahead of South Korean pair Choi Min-jeong and Alang Kim.
Only Choi and compatriot Shim Suk-hee had previously claimed gold in 1500m World Cup events this season.
Christie is continuing the good form that saw her win the overall European Championships short track speed skating title in Sochi in January.
"I'm thrilled and shocked with the outcome for the 1500m as this isn't my strongest distance," Christie said.
"That's the first time in my career I've beat Choi Min-jeong; it won't be the last. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow and the 500m and feel I'm in good form."
The Scot has also qualified for the 500m quarter-finals on Sunday with Britain's Charlotte Gilmartin.
GB head coach Nicky Gooch said: "I am really pleased with Elise's performance. She skated with an improved race strategy against the Korean who's not been beaten at this distance all year. Things are on track and as planned for the end of the season."
