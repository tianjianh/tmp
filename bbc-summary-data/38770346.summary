Goss, 21, did not make a senior appearance at United but was named on the bench for a Premier League game against Watford in November 2015.
The Germany-born player joined United from Exeter City in the summer of 2012.
"I feel I am ready to play first-team football," Goss told BBC Sport. "I am buzzing it is all done."
He added: "It was a tough decision because I still had time on my contract but I felt the time was right to get out there and show everyone what I can do. Manchester United wanted to loan me out.
"Hopefully I can settle down in London quickly and start to play."
