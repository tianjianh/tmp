The 24-year-old came through the club's academy and has made 82 appearances for the south-west London club.
"Rob is the youngest of our three senior hookers, but his potential is huge," Quins director of rugby Conor O'Shea told the club website.
"He is tough and abrasive, has improved his set piece massively and his play in the loose is uncompromising."
Harlequins have not disclosed the length of Buchanan's new contract at the Twickenham Stoop.
