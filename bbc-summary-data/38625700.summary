The 14-1 shot triumphed by six lengths under Derek Fox from Goodtoknow, with Shotgun Paddy Third and Houblon Des Obeaux in fourth.
Russell may now aim her winner at the Grand National at Aintree in April.
Modus (7-1), ridden by Barry Geraghty, gave trainer Paul Nicholls his third winner of Kempton's Lanzarote Hurdle in 10 years.
Meanwhile, Ben Pauling's novice hurdler Willoughby Court caught the eye with an impressive victory at Warwick.
