European football: Five things you may have missed

Juventus, who won one of their first six Serie A games, went six points clear at the top of the table as nearest rivals Napoli lost, while Paris St-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic warmed up for Manchester City in the Champions League by scoring a hat-trick.
And in the Netherlands, Ajax great Johan Cruyff was honoured by his former club in their first game since his death last month.
But what else happened around Europe this weekend? BBC Sport rounds up the stories you may have missed.
There has been no shortage of English managers doing well in Sweden. England boss Roy Hodgson's early managerial career was spent in charge of several clubs there including Malmo. Before him Bobby Houghton enjoyed a successful spell with Malmo, leading them to the 1979 European Cup final.
As another domestic season gets under way in the Allsvenskan - Sweden's top flight - all eyes are on a Solihull-born former Stoke City and West Brom defender who is making a name for himself in a town, a six-hour drive north of Stockholm, famous for hosting World Championships in winter sports.
Graham Potter is 40 yet he has guided Ostersunds FK from the fourth tier to the top flight of Swedish football in just five years.
When he took charge the club was getting gates of 500. At the end of last season they were attracting 6,500.
On Monday they visit Hammarby in their opening game of the season.
"We've got to keep translating positive, attacking football into results," Potter told the Guardian. "It's going to be difficult but this is an historic period for the club - it's nice to be part of it."
Ajax legend Johan Cruyff was remembered by his former club before and during a 3-0 win over PEC Zwolle, which fittingly lifted them back to the top of the Dutch league.
As a player, Cruyff inspired Ajax to three European Cups and shared in eight league titles, before leading the Amsterdam club to the 1987 European Cup Winners' Cup as manager.
Fans paid tribute to the former Netherlands international, who died on 24 March at the age of 68, by walking from Ajax's former home to the Amsterdam Arena where they now play.
The match against Zwolle was then halted for a minute's applause in the 14th-minute, in reference to the shirt worn by the three-time world footballer of the year.
Around 150 former Ajax players attended the game, including Cruyff's son Jordi, who was presented with a number 14 shirt by current captain Davy Klaassen.
It's not often Manuel Neuer is beaten three times in one game particularly when he is representing the world champions.
Yet seven days after England's 3-2 comeback win over Germany in Berlin, normal service was resumed with Neuer back to doing what he does best - keeping clean sheets.
The former Schalke stopper, 30, helped Bayern to a 1-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt and in doing so reached 150 Bundesliga clean sheets in his 311th match.
Only Oliver Reck on 172 matches and Oliver Kahn on 196 boast more games without conceding a goal.
The celebrations continued after the final whistle for Neuer. The International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS) presented him with the World's Best Goalkeeper award for the third time in a row.
When Suso chose to join Liverpool rather than Real Madrid, the Reds must have thought they were landing some prospect.
The young Spaniard arrived from Cadiz and on his 17th birthday in 2010 signed a first professional contract at Anfield.
Sadly, that was not to prove the start of a glittering career on Merseyside as the midfielder was to make just 21 first-team appearances, scoring once in a League Cup tie against Middlesbrough, before joining AC Milan in January, 2015.
Twelve months on, he was on the move again with a loan move to Serie A rivals Genoa,  where the Spain Under-21 international has been a regular.
And finally this weekend came his moment in the sun as Suso claimed the first hat-trick of his career, scoring three of Genoa's goals in a 4-0 win over Frosinone to enhance his prospects of a permanent deal.
It's been an unhappy return to Ligue 1 for Troyes and the team embarrassed 9-0 in front of their own supporters by Paris St-Germain three weeks ago have finally been put out of their misery.
Promoted as champions of Ligue 2, the club from the Champagne region of northern France has had little to celebrate since.
They had to wait until their 22nd game before registering a top-flight win - 3-1 away to Lille - while Troyes' season tickets holders have had next to nothing to cheer after failing to secure a home victory all season.
So it was fitting the result that confirmed their relegation came at home - a 90th minute goal by Charles Diers earning Angers a 1-0 win to leave their opponents 19 points from safety with six games remaining.
Only Arles-Avignon, relegated after 31 games in 2010-2011, have been relegated earlier in a 20-club Ligue 1.
