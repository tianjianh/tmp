[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The water level of Upper Lough Erne in County Fermanagh has risen by 2in (5cm) over the last 24 hours following further rainfall in the area.

The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said the water level was now 157ft 10in (48.1m).
An emergency number has been set up by Fermanagh and Omagh District Council for anyone affected. It is 07711 388 566.
Callers will have their details taken and be advised of assistance.
The council said Red Cross Neighbourhood Link volunteers will go out to those affected by road closures and who "cannot make essential journeys".
It said it was "co-ordinating the multi agency response to the current flooding emergency".
It said it was working with the Red Cross, Western Health & Social Care Trust, Rivers Agency, and Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service to "support those directly affected and address their immediate needs".
At least 19 roads in the county are closed, as flooding continues to affect parts of Northern Ireland in the wake of Storm Desmond at the weekend.
The Rivers Agency said prolonged rainfall meant there was saturated ground and high water levels in lakes and rivers.
On Wednesday, its chief executive, David Porter, said that they were monitoring the situation.
