The male pointer crossbreed was discovered in Dundonald Street by a member  of the public putting out rubbish.
The Scottish SPCA, who called the act "unthinkably cruel" said the animal was also dehydrated and unable to stand.
The dog, which had a black bag wrapped around it, was taken to a vet, who made the decision to put it to sleep.
Chief inspector John Carle, of the animal welfare charity said: "The dog was estimated to be between 10 and 12 years old so we have to consider that he may have been abandoned due to his age, which is unthinkably cruel.
"This poor dog would have been absolutely terrified and was suffering a great deal when he was found."
The dog was discovered on the morning of 15 April at the bottom of a large metal bin.
Mr Carle said: "We think it's possible he was put into the bin late on Thursday night or in the early hours of Friday morning when it was dark.
"He was wearing a black nylon collar and had a black bag wrapped around his body from his waist down, but we don't know if he was fully inside the bag when he was dumped."
Abandoning an animal and causing unnecessary suffering are offences under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.
Mr Carle said:  "We are currently checking whether there is any CCTV nearby and we are appealing to anyone with information about this despicable act to help us with our investigation.
"If anyone knows of a person in the local area who recently owned a dog matching this description we would urge them to contact us."
