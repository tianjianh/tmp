The 30-year-old ex-RC Lens player spent three seasons with Venlo, including one top-flight Eredivisie campaign.
He previously had spells with Willem II and AZ Alkmaar.
"I wanted another goalkeeper, alongside David Stockdale and Casper Ankergren to compete for the first-team slot," boss Chris Hughton told the club website.
"Like all our other recruits this summer, Niki's got plenty of top-flight experience, including games at international level.
"Having already played in France and Holland, he is now keen to prove himself in English football."
