[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brazil judge blocks Lula appointment to government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Brazilian judge has blocked the appointment of ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as chief of staff to his successor, Dilma Rousseff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A federal judge issued an injunction saying there was a risk a federal judicial investigation could be derailed if Lula was a minister.
In Brazil, cabinet members can only be investigated by the Supreme Court, not by federal courts.
Lula is under investigation in connection with a corruption scandal.
The government said it would appeal against the decision.
Prosecutors filed charges against Lula last week accusing him of money laundering and fraud, which he has denied.
Lula's nomination as chief of staff has divided Brazilians.
Some said it was a move to shield him from prosecution while others welcomed his return to active politics.
Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony, groups of supporters and opponents of the government clashes outside the presidential palace.
The ceremony itself was interrupted by a protester who cried "Shame!"
The protester was drowned out by supporters of the governing Workers' Party, who shouted pro-government slogans and Lula's name.
