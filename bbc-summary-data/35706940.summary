We celebrated World Book Day yesterday because it was Dr. Seuss's birthday!  We call it Read Across America Day.  We took part in several Dr. Seuss activities, we had mystery readers, which included Marines and the local university's basketball players, and in the afternoon we "Dropped Everything and Read". It was great fun! (Miss Marsh's 4th Grade Class, Union Elementary School in North Carolina, USA)
