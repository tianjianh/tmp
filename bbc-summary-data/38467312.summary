She posted a poem on the social media site Reddit to say that her boyfriend, Alexis Ohanian, had asked her to marry him.
She said he proposed to her in Rome, where they first met - and she said yes.
Serena won her seventh Wimbledon title this year, taking her to 22 Grand Slam titles overall.
Alexis is the co-founder of Reddit and started it in 2005, with his friend from college.
