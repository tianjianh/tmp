Southport and Ormskirk hospital chief sacked for gross misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of a hospital trust has been sacked for gross misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Parry was suspended by Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust  on full pay last year following complaints from whistleblowers.
The trust said a disciplinary hearing reviewed 21 allegations of misconduct and found evidence on 11 counts, seven of which amounted to gross misconduct.
The nature of the allegations was not disclosed and the trust said Mr Parry could appeal against the decision.
Trust chair, Sue Musson, said: "I want to acknowledge the bravery of the individuals who came forward and spoke out about their concerns."
Three other members of staff were suspended along with Mr Parry.
The director of human resources and the chief operating officer have since left, while deputy director of performance, Richard McCarthy, was cleared of all allegations.
Southport MP John Pugh, who had asked Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to investigate the suspensions, said he was "perplexed as to how such a clear cut outcome has taken such a long time to emerge".
"The sad reality is that this prolonged process has cost the hospital millions and that has to have an impact on services to the public," he added.
Mrs Musson said she would be taking up a new post as chair of Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in January.
She said: "The end of my current term of office coincides with the completion of the disciplinary investigations.
"Therefore this feels like an appropriate juncture for me to move on."
