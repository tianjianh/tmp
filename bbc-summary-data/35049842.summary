[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Body-mounted cameras worn by police officers in parts of Dumfries and Galloway have been withdrawn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers in Dumfries and Annan used the technology as part of a trial earlier this year.
They were able to activate the credit card-sized devices to record specific incidents.
A Police Scotland spokesman said the cameras were withdrawn in November because they were "not considered fit for purpose".
Police officers had hoped to use the cameras to combat late-night violence and youth disorder.
However the force spokesman said only a "small number" of officers used the equipment for a "few weeks".
He added that the cameras were "legacy equipment" which were formerly used by another department.
"Police Scotland is aware of the advantages of body worn cameras and is currently looking to see how these can be introduced as part of a national strategy, which is still being developed," he said.
