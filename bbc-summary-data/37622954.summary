[SN]TITLE[SN]
Theft of defibrillators at Newtonhill investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two defibrillators have been stolen from an Aberdeenshire village.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is thought the community-owned equipment - used on people in cardiac arrest - was taken from Newtonhill between 26 September and 10 October.
One was next to a cash machine at Tesco in Newtonhill Road, and the other was close to the pharmacy at Old Mill Road.
Police Scotland said it was a "reckless act" that had the potential to cause death, through misuse or by the equipment not being available.
PC Marc Camus said: "I know how much time and effort went into the fund-raising to obtain these crucial life-saving devices."
