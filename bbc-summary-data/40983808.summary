[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 4-1 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two rare goals from Alex Woodyard propelled Lincoln to a comfortable victory over 10-man Carlisle in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Woodyard, who scored just one goal for the club last season, fired Danny Cowley's side in front with a sublime curling effort.
Carlisle looked more threatening at the start of the second half, but it was Woodyard who scored the crucial second goal for the Imps, the former Braintree man slotting home after exchanging passes with Matt Rhead.
Rhead scored Lincoln's third goal from the spot in the 67th minute, strike partner Matt Green winning the penalty after being hauled down by Tom Parkes, who was sent off after receiving his second booking.
Reggie Lambe pulled a goal back for the Cumbrians, but substitute Billy Knott restored City's three-goal lead late on.
