[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lesley Garrett concert in aid of Epworth church repairs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A concert held by opera singer Lesley Garrett has raised Â£5,000 to help repair a church in North Lincolnshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The soprano has close connections to St Andrew's Church in Epworth and performed there on Saturday night.
Penny Birks, church warden and treasurer, said the church was "very grateful" to Garrett for her support.
The 230 tickets for the show sold out within hours. The money raised will go towards restoration work on the historic bells and organ.
Mrs Birks said it was the second time Garrett had helped out the church, having staged a concert there some 18 years ago.
Speaking ahead of the concert, Garrett said: "The acoustics are fantastic, that's the first thing I noticed when I came in."
Cash raised from the concert will boost a Â£44,000 lottery grant given to the church last month towards work on the bells and organ, which will cost a total of Â£48,637.
The church said little work had been done on the bells since they were installed eight years ago, and they were showing signs of distress.
