The latest incident occurred on 23 February, when a man was pushed into the Grand Union Canal near Alfred Road, Westbourne Park.
He suffered cuts and bruises and was helped out of the water by passers-by.
The five other incidents took place nearby, and the cyclists targeted were all men in their 30s and 40s.
The cases being treated as related with the attack on 23 February happened:
The suspects are described as black males in their late teens or early 20s.
Appealing for information, Inspector Anna Brennan, head of the Safer Neighbourhoods team in Westminster, said: "These incidents have been very unpleasant for the victims.
"They may have not suffered particularly serious injuries, but have been left frightened and highly traumatised by what has happened to them."
She added: "Pushing strangers into a canal is not funny, and could have very serious consequences."
The Met has increased patrols along the canal by uniformed officers.
