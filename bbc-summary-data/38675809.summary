[SN]TITLE[SN]
£23.8m Rhyl Catholic school reorganisation plans considered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to reorganise Catholic school provision in Rhyl are set to go out to consultation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposals would see Ysgol Mair and Blessed Edward Jones High School close, with a £23.8m new school opening on the site in September 2019.
Bishop of Wrexham, the Right Reverend Peter Brignall said the proposal was an "exciting venture".
Denbighshire Council will be asked to move forward with the consultation at a meeting on 24 January.
If the council's cabinet agrees, the consultation would take place from between February and March.
