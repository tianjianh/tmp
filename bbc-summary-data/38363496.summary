Vincent Nagle, 44, died after being hit by a lorry, leaving hundreds of drivers stranded on the motorway near Trowell services.
Officers said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation into all three incidents.
Mr Paton, who raised the alarm about his mother, was helped by a number of people in Borrowash.
Taz Daley, a tattooist at Equinox Tattoo in Nottingham Road, was one of the first people to speak to him.
Mr Daley said: "He had been shot twice with a nail gun.
"He was extensively cut, he'd lost a lot of blood. He had a couple of puncture wounds under his neck. He had one in his arm. It was horrific.
"He was conscious throughout, that was the amazing thing.
"We just tried to keep him talking. Kept asking his name, where he lived, how old he was, anything repetitive just to keep him awake, keep him calm until the paramedics got there."
Mrs Nagle's father, Martin Paton, said the family were "devastated" by her death.
He said: "We believe this was a tragic incident for everyone involved and their families.
"We don't want to apportion any blame and wish to be left alone to grieve as a family."
