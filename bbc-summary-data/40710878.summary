JP Duminy: South Africa release batsman halfway through England series

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Africa have released batsman JP Duminy from their squad halfway through their four-Test series in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old, who made his debut in 2008 and has played 46 Tests, was dropped following the Proteas' first-Test defeat at Lord's.
The tourists levelled the series by winning the second Test at Trent Bridge by 340 runs.
Duminy has scored only 121 runs in his past eight innings and made just 17 in his two innings against England.
Uncapped right-hander Aiden Markram will remain with the squad as batting cover.
