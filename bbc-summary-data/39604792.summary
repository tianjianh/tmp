[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 1-2 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield set an unwanted club record after being beaten at home by Charlton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The already-relegated club slumped to a 26th League One defeat of the season through goals from Jake Forster-Caskey and Ricky Holmes.
Reece Mitchell replied in stoppage time for bottom-placed Chesterfield before Forster-Caskey had a penalty saved.
Chesterfield needed a fine save by Thorsten Stuckmann in the 16th minute to keep out a Holmes free-kick from just outside the box.
Joe Rowley almost gave Chesterfield the lead in the 35th minute but two minutes later, Charlton scored when Forster-Caskey was given too much time to fire a 20-yard shot into the bottom-left corner.
Chesterfield should have equalised in the 47th minute when Kristian Dennis robbed Ezri Konsa but blazed over from 12 yards and Charlton took advantage when Holmes' free-kick was deflected past Stuckmann in the 57th minute.
Dennis rattled the bar in the 74th minute and Mitchell converted a rebound before Forster-Caskey's last-gasp penalty was saved after he was fouled by Jon Nolan.
