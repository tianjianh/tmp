Sixteen-year-old Ali, who is now living in Peterborough, has also explained to BBC South Today reporter Emma Vardy why he was forced to leave his family behind in a bid to flee the Taliban.
There are currently more than 4,000 asylum seeking children in the care of councils in England.
Dorset's Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill has called on border force to review its security at Poole Port where it is believed Ali made it to England from Cherbourg.
