[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Wales Police called 57 times over paranormal fears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Wales Police was called 57 times in the last five years to reports of witches, ghosts, zombies, vampires and aliens, figures show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were contacted 22 times about extraterrestrials, 21 times about ghosts and 10 times about witches between 2010 and 2015.
They were also called twice for zombies and twice for vampires, the force disclosed following a Freedom of Information request.
It said no arrests were made.
Of the 57 calls, police attended 38 incidents, mainly because of concern for people's safety or to address suspicious activity.
Hotspots for calls about paranormal activity included Wrexham, Bangor, Rhyl and Dolgellau.
Dia Chakravarty, political director at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said it was important for people not to call the police on matters unless they were serious.
"Not only do we waste our own tax money, but we also take precious resources away from the very serious work of fighting real crime," she said.
"The police force needs to exercise common sense when deciding which calls to take seriously because, for example, of mental health issues, but we as taxpayers need to be more responsible too."
