Six Nations 2016: Scotland can win last three matches - Bennett

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Centre Mark Bennett is confident Scotland can end their nine-game Six Nations losing run and win their final three games of this year's tournament.

The Scots head to Italy aiming for a first championship victory since they won in Rome, 21-20, in February 2014.
"The belief is still there amongst the squad," said Bennett, 23.
"We all know we can go on and win the next three games. There is no reason why we can't. It is just about taking that first step."
After Saturday's match in Rome, Scotland host France on Sunday, 13 March before completing their campaign away to Ireland on the final day of the championship, 19 March.
They have only ever won three matches in a single Six Nations campaign once, back in 2006, and have not beaten France in their last 10 meetings since that year.
Scotland have won five of their last six meetings with Italy, including home and away victories in warm-up Tests before last year's World Cup, but have lost on five of their eight Six Nations visits to Rome.
Head coach Vern Cotter is set to make several changes after the 27-23 defeat by Wales when he confirms his match-day squad on Thursday.
Glasgow flanker Ryan Wilson could return after being omitted from the initial Six Nations squad, while Harlequins wing Tim Visser and Glasgow centre Peter Horne are also in contention after recovering from injury problems.
Full-back Stuart Hogg (back) and wing Tommy Seymour (ankle) are set to be passed fit after suffering knocks in Cardiff, while Duncan Taylor could retain the number 12 jersey ahead of fit-again Matt Scott after a strong outing against Wales.
"He [Taylor] was very easy to play alongside," added Bennett, still searching for his first Six Nations victory after seven attempts.
"He is very vocal so he makes my job a lot easier when you know exactly what he is doing.
"I also think the fact he is very relaxed as a person helps, so he is quite a calming influence to be around."
