Plymouth Hoe remembrance garden 'planted' with forget-me-nots

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One thousand handmade forget-me-not flowers have been planted on Plymouth Hoe as a remembrance garden.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Luke's Hospice have put on the display to give the "local community the chance to remember a loved one in a very unique way".
The plastic flowers will be on display until the end of May before they are sold.
Angela Rippon OBE officially opened the garden and said it was a "great pleasure".
She said: "This is a wonderfully graphic way of reminding people of those individuals in our lives that have been important to us people who we really do want to continue to remember".
The flowers were created by the Theatre Royal Plymouth's TR2 workshops, who were also responsible for the sculpture design for the recent London Poppy Appeal.
Seb Soper, head of project development at the theatre, said: "Housed on a steal rod each flower is individually handcrafted whilst hot and therefore each flower is distinctly different."
