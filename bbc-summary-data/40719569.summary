John Hesp, 64, made it to the final table at the World Series of Poker (WSOP), in Las Vegas, and won $2.6m (£2m) by finishing fourth.
He said was trying to persuade organisers to bring the competition to the resort next year.
Mr Hesp said it was the next item on his bucket list.
Mr Hesp's progress captivated the poker world, with many of the game's biggest names rooting for him.
The semi-retired businessman, who paid $10,000 (£7,000) to enter the tournament, won admirers for his colourful dress sense and cheerful demeanour at the table.
Mr Hesp, who runs a caravan centre in Bridlington, said he entered the competition because he "just wanted to play some poker with some professionals".
He hoped his success would have some sway in convincing organisers to consider his request.
So, what could visitors to the resort expect, and how does it compare to Vegas?
