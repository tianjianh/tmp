Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton's brother-in-law has been arrested in California on suspicion of drink driving, according to reports.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roger Clinton, 59, was released from Redondo Beach jail after paying $15,000 (Â£10,000; â‚¬13,000) bail, police said.
Mr Clinton is scheduled to appear in court on 2 September.
According to Redondo Beach police, officers pulled over Mr Clinton after receiving a phone call about someone driving in an erratic manner.
He was taken to Redondo Beach jail where he refused all chemical tests, police said.
It is not the first time Mr Clinton has been a source of embarrassment to his brother and sister-in-law.
He was arrested for drink driving in 2001. He was pardoned in the same year by his brother on his last day in office as president, for a 1980s drug conviction.
The timing of his latest arrest is inconvenient for Mrs Clinton, who is campaigning in California ahead of the state's primary on Tuesday.
The former secretary of state is likely to become the Democratic presidential nominee and compete with Republican Donald Trump for the White House later this year.
