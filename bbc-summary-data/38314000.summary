Murtaza Ahmady, who is now six made the headlines back in February when he was pictured wearing a Lionel Messi shirt which he'd made himself out of a bin bag.
Messi heard about it and arranged through UNICEF for a signed shirt to be sent to him.
Murtaza was invited to walk onto the pitch with his hero, took part in the team photograph and placed the ball on the centre spot before kick-off. He was so pleased to meet his hero that he didn't want to leave his side.
