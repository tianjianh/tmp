Kleyo De Abreu, 23, was killed at about 15:00 BST on Tuesday in Lanjaron, Granada, according to the Guardia Civil.
Her aunt had been watching her take part in the jump from the Tablate Bridge "when the tragedy occurred", a police spokesman said.
Ms De Abreu, an aspiring fashion student from Brixton, has been praised by her family as "sweet and caring".
Confirming the death, the Foreign Office said: "We are liaising with the Spanish authorities and have contacted the family to offer support at this difficult time."
Ms De Abreu had been visiting her aunts and cousins in southern Spain after travelling in Morocco.
Her father, Bernard Atwell, said relatives were in shock at the news of her death.
He described her as "sweet, caring, bubbly and focused".
Mr Atwell stressed: "My daughter is gone and nothing is going to bring her back, but I have spoken to the family and we are all on the same page - we don't want something like this to happen again."
A spokesman for the Guardia Civil said: "Although it is too early to draw any conclusions about the circumstances of the death, one of the lines of inquiry is that there was a miscalculation with the rope."
At the site, there are two bridges. One is a modern bridge from which the bungee jumps are launched, with an ancient Roman bridge underneath.
It is believed Ms De Abreu hit the lower bridge, causing fatal injuries, when she jumped from above.
The Guardia Civil is trying to ascertain whether or not her jump was arranged by an adventure sports company.
Tablate Bridge has a drop of 80m (262ft) and is a popular bungee jumping site used by several adventure sports firms.
Bungee jumpers fall for about 20m (66ft) and swing underneath the bridge, with a first jump offered for about 35 euros (Â£25).
