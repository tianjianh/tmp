England paceman Steven Finn led the way with four top-order wickets as Middlesex edged out Glamorgan by 16 runs in the One-Day Cup at Radlett.

But Colin Ingram's fine all-round display with 4-39 and 53 almost won the match for the visitors.
James Franklin (54) and Dawid Malan (50) helped Middlesex to 243 all out.
Glamorgan fought back from Finn's burst but Ryan Higgins (3-32) took key wickets at the death for Middlesex as the visitors were bowled out for 227.
The result keeps alive Middlesex's outside hopes of reaching the quarter-finals, while Glamorgan are out of contention.
The Welsh county started their chase of 244 to win in positive mood, with David Lloyd scoring 48 as they reached 104-1.
Finn reduced them to 109-5 to show his importance to Middlesex after returning from international duties.
Ingram then led the fightback as he continued his excellent form, but he was eventually ninth out caught on the boundary off Higgins.
Earlier, Middlesex suffered a similar mid-innings stumble after Malan's half-century appeared to have them heading for a big total on the picturesque club ground.
Ingram's career-best performance with his leg-breaks caused the damage, but Franklin gathered what proved to be crucial runs from the lower order, with help from Toby Roland-Jones (22) and Tom Helm (25).
Middlesex fast bowler Steven Finn told BBC Radio London: "As the day went on the wicket got better, it was a bit tacky upfront and hard to score, we felt were a little bit under-par (with our total) and had to come out and take wickets, that was our aim and luckily we did that.
"I've felt in good rhythm the whole time (in the competition), in the two games I got hit around a bit I still felt good, and I felt like something like that (spell against Glamorgan) was around the corner, I had to stick to my guns.
"I think we've played good cricket, but we've missed key moments at Canterbury and against Gloucestershire, here we kept our foot on Glamorgan's throats."
Glamorgan coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport: "We probably conceded 20 more runs than we should have and that's largely down to our fielding, we gave them those extra runs.
"Then from the batting perspective we had a cluster of wickets in the middle, we lost four wickets for five runs which put us back in a mess.
"Fair play to Colin again and Chris Cooke who got us back in the game, but often we analyse batting and bowling as to where the game was won and lost, here it was in our fielding."
