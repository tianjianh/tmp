Susie, a 12-year-old collie and Jilly, a 10-year-old cairn terrier, were taken in by Snowdonia Animal Sanctuary after 72-year-old Jennifer Taylor was killed in a crash near Betws-Y-Coed.
Sanctuary owner Anne de Berry said the dogs were moved to a "brilliant" new home on Tuesday.
"They have a new mum and dad. It's fantastic," she said.
"[The new owners] had a dog which had to be put down a month ago due to old age.
"One of our volunteers went to do the home check this morning and text me: 'Brilliant'. It's a brilliant home."
The dogs' owner Mrs Taylor lived in Dolgarrog.
She was the passenger on a BMW bike when it collided with a Nissan Qashqai on the A470 close to Waterloo Bridge in the town on 4 October.
