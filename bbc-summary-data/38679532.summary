[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hidayet Ozden, 53, repeatedly punched Shahzad Shah at the Mirchi Indian takeaway in Mintlaw over a tandoori chicken query.
First offender Ozden, of Falkirk, admitted culpable homicide after Mr Shah, 56, died in April.
He was jailed for 32 months at the High Court in Glasgow.
A court previously heard the attack happened amid what was described as "simmering tension".
Ozden attacked father-of-three Mr Shah as the cook queried whether the spiced meat was to be on the bone or not, and told him they needed to call the customer.
Other workers managed to restrain Ozden, before realising Mr Shah had started to go limp.
He was originally charged with murder but admitted culpable homicide.
Mr Shah was suffering from a serious undiagnosed heart condition at the time of the incident.
Judge Graham Buchanan told Ozden: "I take account of the fact it is accepted by the Crown that you did not intend to kill Mr Shah.
"He died of a very serious heart condition, of which you were unaware. He could have died at any point if placed in a stressful situation.
"Mr Shah was a close friend and business colleague of yours for many years. I accept you were subject to a degree of provocation by Mr Shah.
"Mr Shah suffered a fractured cheekbone and a small bone in his neck was also broken. None of the injuries inflicted contributed directly to his death.
"However, a man has lost his life and his family has been left devastated."
Defence QC Ian Duguid said: "Mr Ozden has never tried to minimise his involvement in his friend's death. He wants to express his regret to Mr Shah's family."
Det Insp Brian Geddes, of Police Scotland, said: "The actions of Hidayet Ozden caused the death of Shahzad Shah.
"Shahzad Shah was subjected to a prolonged and sustained assault at the hands of Ozden, and was not able to defend himself due to the stark difference in their physical statures.
"Our thoughts are with his family and those who were closest to him."
