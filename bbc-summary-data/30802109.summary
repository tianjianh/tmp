About 60 firefighters have been tackling a fire in a restaurant kitchen in Manchester city centre.

Flames and smoke were seen coming out of the building, which houses three restaurants, in Albert Square at about 13:00 GMT.
Investigations were carried out to make sure the fire had not spread to the other restaurants' kitchens that share the same extraction duct.
A Greater Manchester Fire spokesman said the response had been scaled down.
Station Manager Gary Jarvis urged people to stay away from the area.
"It is a busy part of Manchester, as it's at the heart of the city, but because we have quite a bit of smoke issuing from the roof, we would encourage people to avoid the area if possible and to keep their windows closed."
