Tottenham defender Ben Davies believes his former club Swansea City can avoid Premier League relegation.

Swansea slipped back into the bottom three after Spurs' late comeback earned a 3-1 win at the Liberty Stadium.
The win keeps alive Tottenham's title hopes as they trail leaders Chelsea by seven points with seven games to play.
"It was a very tough game, Swansea were very organised and they made it very difficult for us," Davies told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
He continued: "It is always nice coming back to the Liberty. I got a great reception from the fans, Swansea is a great club and hopefully they can do enough to stay up this year.
"On the performance against us, they are a tough side to play against.

"They are very organised, they have good players who can get goals out of nothing, so with a few important games coming up, it would be nice if they can get a few wins.
"But when you've got someone like Dele Alli in your team, or Christian Eriksen, they can create something out of nothing and it paid off for us in the end."
Davies feels his former Tottenham team-mate Tom Carroll, a January signing for the Swans who left White Hart Lane after 16 years as a Spur, could be key to the survival hopes of Paul Clement's side.
"Tom is an excellent technical player, he has a lovely left foot and he can create something out of nothing," he said.
"His touch and ball control is some of the best that I have seen, so if they can get him the ball, chances will come."
Davies says Tottenham will not give up on catching Premier League leaders Chelsea, who they also face in an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley.
"There is always a chance [of catching them] and we've just got to keep picking up three points every time we go out on to the pitch," he said.

"It is not going to be easy, but if we can grind out results like we have been doing, then great.
"There is always a chance; we go into every game aiming for three points. If Chelsea do slip up, we have to be in a position to catch them.
"We are trying to win every game and games like the Swansea one give us more belief."
Davies says Spurs are well placed to challenge in future seasons, even if they do not manage to overhaul Chelsea.
"You would like to think so," he replied, when asked if Tottenham can become regular title contenders.
"There is a good group of players here and a couple of years left in many of us. Our aim is to kick on every year.
"It is always about maintaining high standards here and that's what we are all trying to do."
