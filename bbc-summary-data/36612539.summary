Southampton: Ex-Man City boss Manuel Pellegrini out of running for job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southampton will not appoint former Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini as their new manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 62-year-old Chilean was keen on the move but the club are looking at other options to replace Ronald Koeman.
Frenchman Claude Puel, 54, is reportedly the favourite to take over after leaving French Ligue 1 side Nice at the end of last season.
Dutchman Koeman left to join Everton earlier this month after two campaigns at St Mary's.
United States head coach Jurgen Klinsmann is also not being considered despite being linked with the job.
Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe, former Manchester United manager David Moyes and ex-Ajax head coach Frank de Boer are all out of the running too.
Southampton are looking to appoint their new boss by the time players report for pre-season training next week.
