[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A professional footballer has denied committing five sex offences against a 14-year-old girl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oldham Athletic midfielder Jack Tuohy, 19, pleaded not guilty at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court on Thursday to five offences alleged to have been committed last October.
The player, of Lower Dingle, Oldham, was suspended by the club after he was charged with the offences in May.
He will face a four-day trial at the same court on 20 February next year.
The prosecution outlined two charges of engaging in sexual activity with a child, two of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one of meeting with a child following sexual grooming.
Judge Mark Savill granted bail to the player, who had been on loan to non-league Ramsbottom United, on condition that he does not contact prosecution witnesses.
