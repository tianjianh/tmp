[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carbisdale Castle art collection sold for £1m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sculptures from what was once one of Scotland's most spectacular youth hostels have been sold for more than £1m at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There had been some opposition to the sale of the Carbisdale Collection.
Carbisdale Castle, near Ardgay in Sutherland, and its artworks were gifted to the Scottish Youth Hostels Association almost 70 years ago.
The association is also in the process of selling the castle to a developer which plans to turn it into a hotel.
Money raised through the sales of the art and the castle will be invested in the SYHA's network of hostels.
The sale of the Carbisdale Collection helped auctioneer Sotheby's achieve its highest ever total for a sale of 19th and 20th Century sculptures, with a figure of £2.3m.
The white marble sculptures from the 1800s included Andromeda by Florentine sculptor Pasquale Romanelli and Nymph at the Stream by Scottish artist David Watson Stevenson.
It was the first time in more than a century that they had been put on the market.
The castle, which overlooks the Kyle of Sutherland, was shut as a hostel after suffering frost damage.
The Dowager Duchess of Sutherland had Carbisdale Castle built between 1907 and 1917 following the death of her husband, George Granville William Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Third Duke of Sutherland.
Lady Mary was the duke's second wife and after he died she became embroiled in a legal dispute over his will with her stepson, the fourth Duke of Sutherland.
When the row was settled the duchess used her inheritance to have Carbisdale constructed.
