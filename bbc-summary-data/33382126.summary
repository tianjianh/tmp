[SN]TITLE[SN]
Findhorn beach hut campaigners plan court action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners against plans to build a row of 30 colourful beach huts on a stretch of shoreline in Moray hope to take their fight to the Court of Session.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moray Council approved the proposals for Findhorn in May.
Planning officers had recommended refusal, warning the huts could harm the beach's character. There were also 175 letters of objection, mainly from local residents.
Objectors are taking legal advice.
They ultimately hope to secure a judicial review.
Council development officers had said the huts could significantly enhance the area's tourism appeal.
The plans were approved by eight votes to six.
