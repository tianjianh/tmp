In a double signing, the managerless League One side have also signed young midfielder Callum Guy on loan from Championship club Derby County.
Guy, 20, and Eagles, 31, who has been released by Accrington, are both at Vale Park until the end of the season.
Eagles shone for Vale's reserves as a trialist at Bradford on Monday, making three of the goals in a 4-0 win.
The pair are the first signings made by caretaker manager Michael Brown, who took over on Boxing Day following the resignation of Bruno Ribeiro.
Meanwhile, Vale have ended defender Sam Hart's season-long loan from Liverpool.
Hart, 20, returns to his parent club having made nine League One starts in his overall tally of 16 appearances.
