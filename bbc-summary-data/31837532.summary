Other celebrities to descend on the seaside town for the service included Tony Hadley and bandmate Steve Norman and hairdresser Nicky Clarke.
Visage's big hit Fade To Grey played as Strange's coffin was taken into church.

Tony Hadley said Strange's death marked the end of an era.
"He was a lovely, lovely guy," he said.
Martin Fry, frontman of 80s band ABC, said Strange had been a long time friend.
"Steve had an incredible sense of humour. I miss him, I miss him already," he said.
"It's a sad day but a chance to pay my respects to a guy I hope will be remembered for a long time."
Jayce Lewis, a friend of the the singer, said: "The family have decided that the funeral should be a celebration of Steve's life and the funeral will be open to the public."
