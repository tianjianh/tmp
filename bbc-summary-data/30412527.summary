[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scott Ellis jailed for murdering Jane Bartholomew

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who bought a "killing kit" containing a hammer, spade, ropes and plastic bags and bludgeoned his ex-girlfriend to death has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Ellis, "brutally executed" Jane Bartholomew at her house in Martlesham Heath, Ipswich Crown Court heard.
Her body was found by their daughter when she returned home from school.
Ellis, who had a personality disorder which was said to make him lose control, will serve a minimum of 22 years.
Ms Bartholomew, 39, who had three children with Ellis, died as a result of receiving 20 blows from a hammer.
They had lived together in Melton but sold their flat 10 years ago and then lived apart while their relationship continued, the court was told.
The jury heard Ellis, 42, of Tunstall, had been told by Ms Bartholomew earlier in the year that unless he got a job and started to be a "proper dad" then the relationship would be over.
Their relationship ended shortly before Ms Bartholomew was killed  in June, the court heard.
The prosecution said Ellis had told friends he had thought about killing her and went on to buy a "killing kit" containing a hammer, a spade, nylon ropes and plastic bags.
He let himself into her home while she was taking their two youngest daughters to primary school, and then waited for her.
After killing Ms Bartholomew, Ellis tied her up, put plastic bags over her feet and head and then left.
Her body was found by their oldest daughter.
Speaking after the sentencing, Det Insp Kevin Hayward said it was a "terrible tragedy".
"Jane had been hit around the head around 20 times and she had also sustained injuries to her arms and hands, suggesting that she had put up a defensive fight against Ellis," he said.
"It would appear that this was a murder fuelled by rejection and jealousy that Jane wanted to move on with her life."
