[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salford marked an emotional night at the AJ Bell Stadium with a sixth straight win as they thrashed a Catalans side without a head coach.

In a game where the Red Devils offered free entry but asked for donations to support families of the Manchester attack, they led 28-0 at the break.
Gaz O'Brien, Josh Jones, Kris Welham, Niall Evalds and Ryan Lannon crossed for Salford in the first half.
Kris Brining, Robert Lui, Olsi Krasniqi and Mark Flanagan added further scores.
Vincent Duport and Fouad Yaha tries were Catalans' only points as they slumped to their six straight defeat in all competitions.
Both teams spent time a man down in the first 40 minutes as Catalans' Remi Casty and Salford forward James Hasson, on his debut, were both sent to the sin bin.
Ian Watson's side last suffered defeat in the reverse fixture in Perpignan in April when they lost 38-6 but have now won 11 of their last 12 games to stay second, and it was the first time they had beaten Catalans at home since 2015.
It was the Dragons' first match since the departure of head coach Laurent Frayssinous in midweek but they offered little threat at AJ Bell Stadium.
Salford head coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It was a great performance. We spoke this week about being a better team and improving on what we've done.
"We always felt if we did our job in the middle we could get them on the edge.
"It was important for us to put on a performance like that, and put on a show, with everything that has gone on to support everything.
"People talk about it [the Manchester attack] and people discuss it but the big thing for us was we had to focus on our performance."
Catalans assistant coach Michael Monaghan:
"The scoreboard doesn't look pretty. It's never enjoyable to be on the end of a score line like that.
"As coaches we need to take the score out of it and look at what we did on the field. I thought our young kids showed some promise but there are some things we can move forward with.
"There is plenty of stuff we need to work on and we can't feel sorry for ourselves. We have got to get back to work quickly because we have got another game on Monday.
"We had a fair challenge today against a team near the top of the table."
