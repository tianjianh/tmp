Joe Hart: England mistakes left goalkeeper 'gutted' in 'difficult summer'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England goalkeeper Joe Hart says he was left "gutted" by his "difficult summer" of football.

Hart, 29, was at fault in England's Euro 2016 last-16 defeat by Iceland, and has since been sent to Torino on loan by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola.
However, he made a series of saves as England won a point in Tuesday's 2018 World Cup qualifier against Slovenia.
"I am gutted about how the summer went but it has gone now," he said.
Hart has made 66 appearances for England, but had his position questioned following the Iceland mistake and an error that allowed Wales forward Gareth Bale to score a long-range free-kick in the same tournament.
Guardiola unexpectedly replaced Hart as his number one goalkeeper, signing Claudio Bravo from Barcelona, with the Englishman heading to Serie A.
"I would have loved to have saved the two shots that I should have saved [during Euro 2016] but they are gone," Hart said.
"I am going to try and rectify that by being in a good place. Football moves quickly. You have to move on. You have got to keep fighting."
