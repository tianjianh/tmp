Scott Williams is preferred at centre to Jamie Roberts, who is on the bench, while Dan Biggar will partner Webb at half-back.
The Ospreys scrum-half missed the autumn Tests against Argentina, Japan and South Africa after injuring a knee against Australia on 5 November.
Lock Alun Wyn Jones leads the team for the first time since taking over from Warburton as skipper.
None of the uncapped players in the extended squad have made the match day 23, with interim coach Rob Howley saying it was important to start the tournament with a win.
In fact Howley's starting XV averages more than 45 caps a man.
"We've gone with a lot of experience with 10 out the XV who started against South Africa," he said.
"It's important to start well hence the selection you see.
"We've been there as coaches and some of the players have - 2009 comes to mind - when we made a number of changes and given opportunities but we just feel for the start of the campaign we want to start well.
"We believe the Six Nations is going to be about momentum and we wanted to pick a rather experienced team to start the tournament."
Meanwhile Italy coach, Conor O'Shea, has made five changes from the team that beat South Africa in November for the Wales clash.
There are no uncapped players in the Italian squad as captain Sergio Parisse returns to lead the side and win his 122nd Test cap.
