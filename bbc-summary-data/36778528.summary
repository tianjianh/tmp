County Championship: Adam Lyth hits century for Yorkshire against Surrey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth made his third century of the season as the defending champions replied solidly to Surrey's 267 all out at the Oval.

Lyth hit two sixes and 13 fours in his 116 not out and shared a third-wicket stand of 150 with skipper Andrew Gale.
Gale's 61 was his highest score of the season, but he fell to Tom Curran as his side closed on 207-3, 60 behind.
Earlier on day three, Sam Curran (59*) and Steven Davies (56) helped Surrey add 103 to their overnight 164-5.
With the best part of four sessions lost to rain on the first two days, a draw is now the most likely result, but having begun the game in fifth place, Yorkshire will have set their sights on reaching 400 to ensure they leave the Oval with maximum bonus points.
After Davies and the younger Curran added 75 for the seventh wicket, Surrey lost their last four for 28 in the space of 10 overs.
Alex Lees departed in the eighth over of Yorkshire's innings and Jack Leaning followed for a duck when he chopped Stuart Meaker's first delivery into his stumps.
Lyth, though, was unperturbed as he progressed to three figures off 159 balls and partner Gale, who started the match averaging only 17.93, grew in confidence to reach his first half-century of the summer before he was caught behind.
Surrey all-rounder Sam Curran told BBC Radio London:
"It was nice to finally get back into the side after school and stuff, to get some time in the middle.
"They showed they are one of the top teams in the division and I had a good battle with Adil Rashid, a good spinner, he really made me work on my feet.
"It's been frustrating. Both teams wanted four days (of play) because we're both looking for wins.
"Tomorrow we're going to have to come in quite hard with the ball, see how many wickets we can take in the first session and see where we can take it from there."
