The 41-year-old Labour MP was killed in her home village near Leeds on Thursday.
Oxfam had already been planning to record a live album to raise money to support their work with refugees.
The charity, which the Batley and Spen MP used to work for, has now announced it will release Stand As One - Live at Glastonbury 2016 in her memory.
When the album was first announced, the festival's co-organiser Emily Eavis said: "The scale of the refugee crisis is so huge we simply had to do something.
"We want people who are far from home and frightened to know we are doing whatever we can to help."
In a statement, Glastonbury headliners Coldplay said: "Right now there are more refugees in the world than at any other time in recent history. They could be us and we could be them."
Laura Mvula, Jack Garratt, The 1975, Editors, Years & Years, Fatboy Slim, Wolf Alice and Chvrches will also appear on the album.
Oxfam said proceeds from Stand As One - Live at Glastonbury 2016 will fund the charity's work with people forced to flee conflict, disaster and poverty.
The album will be released on 11 July.
