The prince met Nathan and Sarah Dunford and their four children outside 54 Peverell Avenue East, in Poundbury.
The prince also officially opened the Poundbury Cancer Institute in the town and met staff.
The institute's aim is to help identify the most effective treatment for individual cancer patients.

The development aims to combine social and private housing with work and leisure facilities to create a "walkable community".
