The 17-year-old, who was last seen at Didcot Railway station on 3 December last year, was remembered at a gathering in the town at 19:00 GMT.
Jayden's former boyfriend Ben Blakeley, 22, from Reading, was sentenced to life for her murder, in July this year.
Blakeley was told to serve a minimum of 20 years for murdering Jayden and burying her in his uncle's grave.
Jayden's body was discovered in the grave of Alan Kennedy in the cemetery of All Saints' Church, Didcot, Oxfordshire, on 18 December.
She was believed to be pregnant with Blakeley's child, but tests have never fully confirmed this.
Blakeley's brother Jake, of Venners Water, Didcot, was accused of preventing the lawful burial of Jayden, which he denied, and his retrial is set for 19 January after jurors failed to reach a verdict.
