Bradford City 1-0 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Clarke scored the only goal following a long throw as Bradford edged out Swindon to make it six wins from seven games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He headed goalwards after the ball was allowed to bounce and keeper Tyrell Bedford's efforts to keep the ball out were ruled in vain by the linesman.
Swindon's Jermaine Hylton stung the palms of Ben Williams from 20 yards.
But Bradford rise to third, six points off the automatic promotion places, with five games left to play.
