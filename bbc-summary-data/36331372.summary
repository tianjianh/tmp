New appeal in Flintshire OAP's 20-year caravan battle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 20-year battle by a Flintshire woman to stay in a mobile home is the subject of a new Welsh Government appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beryl Larkin, 72, has been fighting to remain in the caravan on land at Treuddyn near Mold.
Last year, a move to demolish her home was called off when the pensioner was taken ill as the bulldozers arrived.
She has now submitted another appeal to government inspectors after Flintshire council rejected a new planning application for the mobile home.
"Our client did put in a further planning application in relation to her continued occupation at Bwthyn Celyn, " said her solicitor, Phillip Lloyd Jones.
"As you will appreciate, the local authority refused the application.
"Our client submitted a written appeal and we anticipate that the appeal will be imminent, possibly within the next two or three months, if not before."
Mrs Larkin was originally told she must leave the site in 2013, following two prosecutions for failing to comply with enforcement notices demanding her caravan was moved.
After the eviction was called off last May, the former nurse asked the council to consider another "personal" planning bid for her to stay.
But the application for a static caravan for permanent residential use, retention of septic tank, ancillary building, LPG tank and access track was refused again.
The matter will now set to be decided by the Welsh Government's' Planning Inspectorate.
