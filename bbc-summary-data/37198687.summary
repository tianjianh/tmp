[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Goodwin, 51, of St Saviours Road, St Helier, Jersey, illicitly transferred the money between 2006 and 2011 through several jurisdictions, including the UK and Jersey.
He had pleaded guilty to several counts relating to money trafficking and tax evasion at Jersey's Royal Court.
He was also fined £2,000 and had assets of £214,237 confiscated on Thursday.
Goodwin was sentenced for two counts of income tax fraud, one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice and a fourth count of converting, transferring or removing proceeds of drug trafficking from the jurisdiction.
A spokeswoman for States of Jersey Police said: "He deliberately sought to remain under the radar, in terms of declared earnings to government departments, and evade any suspicious activity that is reported through the banking mechanisms."
Police said "cash packages" were intercepted in 2011 by Jersey Customs and Immigration Services which led to an investigation being launched through the Joint Financial Crimes Unit.
