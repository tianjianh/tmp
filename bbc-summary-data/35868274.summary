They were killed when their car left a pier in Buncrana in County Donegal, and entered Lough Swilly on Sunday.
The victims were Ruth Daniels, 57, her daughter Jodie Lee Daniels, 14, Sean McGrotty, 49, and his sons Mark, 12, and Evan, eight.
A baby girl who was in the car was rescued shortly before it sank.
The condolence books opened on Monday night at St Joseph's Church in Galliagh and Holy Family Church in Ballymagroarty.
The funerals of the victims will take place in Derry on Thursday.
On Monday, Jim, a brother of Sean McGrotty said the deaths had "devastated the whole family".
"We are now totally in shock and dismay," he said.
"I don't know how we're going to come back from this."
He added that a man, Davitt Walsh, who saved four-month-old Rionaghac-Ann McGrotty was "a hero in this family's eyes".
Mr Walsh jumped into the lough and swam to the family in their car, bringing Rionaghac-Ann back to safety.
He said he felt "terrible" he could not do more for the family after seeing their distress as they tried to escape from the sinking car.
