Paul Lyons and Toni Ackerman subjected the man to a two-hour ordeal, including burning him with an iron.
They then disconnected his phone and locked him in his home in Thurcroft to stop him getting help following the attack in October.
Lyons, 47, from Denaby, and Ackerman, 35, from Doncaster were convicted of robbery and attempted murder.

Sheffield Crown Court heard Lyons and Ackerman had befriended the 55-year-old man before launching their "vicious" attack.
Police discovered the victim locked inside his house and covered in blood after being called to the property at about 21:45 GMT on 27 October.
Lyons and Ackerman were later arrested after they were seen covered in blood and carrying the man's television.
Det Con Janelle Dexter-Lowe said: "This was a vicious, targeted attack on a vulnerable and defenceless man carried out by two evil individuals.
"The man was effectively tortured in his own home for up to two hours, during which time he was punched, stamped on, stabbed and burnt with an iron.
"He was also dragged around the house while Lyons and Ackerman ransacked his home, looking for valuables before locking him in."
She said the victim was recovering from the ordeal, adding: "I hope that today's sentence will give him some comfort and contribute to his recovery."
