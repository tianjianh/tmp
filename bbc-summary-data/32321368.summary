Philip Lamey: Former dental consultant has decision over register removal quashed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former consultant at the Royal Victoria Hospital's School of Dentistry has had a decision to strike him from the dental register quashed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2014, the General Dental Council (GDC) found Prof Philip Lamey guilty of more than 100 charges of misconduct and removed him from the register.
It has now emerged that the High Court quashed the sanction at the end of March.
However, it ordered he remain suspended until a review of the case in August.
The court found there had been errors in the GDC's original decision.
Prof Lamey is still not permitted to practice dentistry, according to the council.
