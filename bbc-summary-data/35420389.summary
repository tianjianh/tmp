[SN]TITLE[SN]
Venue change for Derry's league opener against Fermanagh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry's opening Football League game against Fermanagh on Sunday has been switched to Celtic Park (14:15 GMT).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Division Two fixture has been moved due to a waterlogged pitch at Owenbeg.
Derry were relegated from Division One last season and will be hoping for a strong league run under new manager Damian Barton, whose side lost Saturday's McKenna Cup final to Tyrone.
Fermanagh were promoted from Division Three last year and went on to reach the All-Ireland SFC quarter-finals.
