[SN]TITLE[SN]
Manx politician moves to reform Tynwald's upper chamber

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A politician has been given permission to introduce a private member's bill to reform the way in which members of the Manx Legislative Council are elected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It could see members of the Legislative Council (MLCs) elected directly by the Manx public, the same as Members of the House of Keys (MHKs), from 2018.
Council members are currently appointed by the House of Keys.
Politicians voted almost unanimously in favour of granting Onchan MHK Peter Karran permission to pursue his bill.
Several attempts have already been made to reform the Legislative Council but none have been successful.
The Legislative Council is the upper branch of the Manx parliament.
The Council, which primarily acts as a revising chamber for bills, includes eight elected members, the President of Tynwald, the Bishop of Sodor and Man and the Attorney General.
Mr Karran's proposed bill could also see MLCs banned from becoming ministers or members of government departments.
A special sitting of the House of Keys will be held next month to elect replacements for the four seats on the Council which become vacant on Saturday.
