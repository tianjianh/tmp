[SN]TITLE[SN]
Poole Harbour Salterns Marina revised hotel plans approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Revised Â£100m plans for a multi-storey hotel and block of flats overlooking Poole Harbour have been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Previous proposals for a 65-bed hotel and 75 homes at Salterns Marina were approved in April last year.
However, revised plans for a six-storey, 75-bed hotel and spa, and seven-storey building with 54 homes have now been given the go-ahead.
The development on the 200m (650ft) quay includes demolishing the existing two-storey Salterns Hotel.
New offices, restaurants, parking, marina changing rooms and showers, and a bar and gym for residents will also be created in the harbour overlooking Brownsea Island.
A new quay wall will also be built around the development.
The previous scheme was met with more than 100 objections from residents who said it would be "dominant and overbearing" and ruin views.
Other concerns included increased traffic.
