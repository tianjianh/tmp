League Two side Grimsby Town have appointed Russell Slade as their manager for a second time.

The 56-year-old replaces Marcus Bignot, after the former QPR defender was sacked on Monday having spent just five months in charge.
Slade spent two seasons with the Mariners from May 2004 until May 2006 before leaving for Yeovil.
"There's no doubt that this club is big enough to be playing in the level above," he said.
Grimsby are Slade's third team this season after spells with League One sides Charlton and Coventry.
He will be assisted at Blundell Park by former Grimsby player and coach Paul Wilkinson.
Slade led Town to the League Two play-off final during the 2005-06 campaign, which they lost 1-0 to Cheltenham, and he joined the Glovers shortly after.
"It was a welcome return, I'm delighted to be back. Let's hope this time we can improve on last time," he added.
"I think I've got the experience to make tough decisions. But it is an opportunity and a challenge for the players to impress."
Bignot, 42, was sacked on Monday despite a 3-1 win over play-off hopefuls Blackpool on Saturday, with the club saying "there remains a strong ambition to build on last season's promotion".
He had joined the club from Solihull Moors in November after Paul Hurst left for League One Shrewsbury.
The Mariners are 14th in League Two, seven points off the play-offs with five games to play.
