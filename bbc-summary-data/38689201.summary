Omar Elabdellaoui: Hull City sign right-back on loan from Olympiakos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City have signed right-back Omar Elabdellaoui on loan until the end of the season from boss Marco Silva's old club Olympiakos.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old Norway international played under the new Tigers manager last season for the Greek champions.
Elabdellaoui had a spell at Manchester City as a teenager but did not make a first-team appearance.
He went on loan to Stromsgodset and Feyenoord before moves to Eintracht Braunschweig and then Olympiakos.
He is Silva's third signing, following Everton striker Oumar Niasse on loan until the end of the season and Porto midfielder Evandro for an undisclosed fee.
Hull are 18th in the Premier League, although only in the relegation zone on goal difference.
