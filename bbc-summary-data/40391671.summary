Kieran Maxwell, 18, from Heighington, County Durham, was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma six years ago and lost part of his left leg.
In 2012, he stumbled to the ground and dropped the torch in Bishop Auckland, but carried on after being helped up.
On the Kieran Maxwell Legacy Facebook page, his mum Nicola said at 05:26 BST on Friday he "gained his wings".
She said: "This is Kieran's mam and its with a heavy heart that I write this post.
"He passed peaceful in his sleep. We are going to be continuing Kieran's wish of providing research into Ewing's Sarcoma through his charity.
"I want to thank you all for the support you gave my boy while he was alive."
Kieran took up gymnastics to help with his rehabilitation when learning to walk again and in the space of one year he qualified for the NDP National Championships.
A keen athlete, he also went on to take part in the mini Great North Run during his chemotherapy treatment.
In October 2016, the athlete learnt his cancer was terminal.
The teenager set up the Kieran Maxwell Legacy charity in the hope of funding a researcher to look into the rare form of bone cancer.
He said his "final wish in life" was to raise enough money so what had happened to him "didn't happen to any other child".
