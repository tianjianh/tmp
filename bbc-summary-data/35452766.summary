Police said four people were shot, one fatally, and one other stabbed at the Denver Coliseum just before 13:00 (20:00 GMT).
The venue was hosting the Colorado Motorcycle Expo, one of the largest events of its kind in the US.
Three people suffered other injuries, possibly in a fight, police said.
Denver Police chief Robert White told a press conference the clashes took place between rival motorcycle gangs, but he would not name the groups suspected of being involved.
One "person of interest" was being interviewed, but no-one had been arrested, he said.
In May 2015, a shoot-out between rival bike gangs in Waco, Texas, killed nine people and led to more than 170 arrests.
The motorcycle show, which was allowed to continue for four hours after the shootout, has been cancelled on Sunday.
