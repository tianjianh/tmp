[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US has now charged some 40 individuals and entities following an investigation into corruption in football's world governing body Fifa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sixteen new officials were charged by the US Department of Justice on 3 December.
This is in addition to the 14 people - nine Fifa officials and five corporate executives - indicted on corruption charges at the end of May, some of whom have now been convicted.
Several other individuals and entities have pleaded guilty and have been convicted.
Here we take a closer look at some of those who have faced charges that include racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies.
Seventy-two-year-old Jack Warner from Trinidad and Tobago was a member of Fifa's executive committee from 1983 to 2011, when he resigned amid allegations he had bribed Caribbean associates.
At the time he said he had been "hung out to dry", insisting that the giving of gifts had been part of Fifa culture during his 30 years in the organisation.
He was also president of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) until 2011.
After he resigned, Fifa dropped its inquiry into whether he was involved in any corruption. Mr Warner returned to Trinidad and Tobago, where he became minister of security.
He resigned from the post in 2013 when a Concacaf ethics panel accused him of enriching himself through fraud.
He was arrested at the request of the US authorities in Trinidad on 27 May and faces extradition proceedings. He was bailed after surrendering his passport.
Fifa's ethics committee has banned him from football activities for life.
Jeffrey Webb, 51, from the Cayman Islands, was a Concacaf president and one of seven Fifa vice-presidents.
He succeeded Jack Warner in both posts.
He is also a former member of Fifa's Transparency and Compliance Committee.
He enjoyed the backing of Fifa president Sepp Blatter, 77, who singled him out as his possible successor to head Fifa.
Webb was one of seven men arrested in Zurich, Switzerland, on 27 May.
He pleaded guilty in November to racketeering conspiracy, three counts of wire fraud conspiracy and three counts of money laundering conspiracy.
He has agreed to forfeit more than $6.7m (Â£4.4m).
Mr Li, a Costa Rican of Chinese origin, is the president of the Costa Rican Football Federation.
He was elected to Fifa's executive committee but was arrested and indicted in Switzerland in May, two days before he was due to take up the post.
Mr Li was voted Personality of the Year 2014 in Costa Rica after the national football team stunned its rivals by reaching the quarter-finals in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
On becoming president of the Costa Rican Football Federation, he said: "There's no Arab sheikh who can buy tickets to the kind of events us leaders of world football have access to."
He is charged with racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy and money laundering.
Mr Li agreed to extradition from Switzerland to the US in December.
He has pleaded not guilty in New York to 19 charges.
Jose Maria Marin, 83, was president of the Brazilian Football Confederation from March 2012 to April 2015. He is a former football player turned politician.
He has been at the centre of controversy before.
When he took over as president of the Brazilian Football Confederation in 2012, journalists questioned him about a video which had emerged from a medal ceremony at a youth football tournament in Sao Paulo.
The video appears to show Mr Marin pocketing a medal which should have been given to one of the winning players.
He dismissed the allegation as "a joke". "The medal was provided courtesy of the Paulista Football Federation," he added.
Mr Marin was arrested in Switzerland in May.
He was extradited to the United States and pleaded not guilty on 3 November to charges of racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.
Eugenio Figueredo was born in Uruguay in 1932.
He is a former president of the South American Football Confederation and member of Fifa's executive committee.
He played for the Uruguayan club Huracan Buceo.
In 1997 he was named president of the Uruguayan Football Association.
He served for 10 years as vice-president of Conmebol, the highest authority in South American football.marin
In 2013, he replaced Nicolas Leoz as Conmebol president after Mr Leoz was accused of involvement in a bribery scandal.
Mr Figueredo held the post until August 2014.
He was arrested in Switzerland and contested attempts to extradite him to the US.
In December he agreed to be extradited to Uruguay, where he faces an investigation into alleged abuse of office.
Rafael Esquivel has been the president of the Venezuelan Football Federation since 1988.
He is also an executive member of Conmebol.
Born in Spain in 1946, his parents moved to Venezuela when he was four years old to escape the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.
Venezuelan players have described him as someone who is "pushy with a strong personality".
A former captain of the national squad said that there "was no friendship or camaraderie" between officials and players under Mr Esquivel's leadership.
Mr Esquivel was arrested in Switzerland and is contesting attempts to extradite him to the US.
Mr Rocha, 64, is currently a development officer with Fifa, tasked with introducing new football projects around the world.
Before taking up a position with Fifa in late 2012, he served for more than 20 years as president of the football federation in his native Nicaragua, and has acted as the president of the Central American Football Union.
He also served as the head of Nicaragua's Olympic committee, and took the team to the 2008 Games in Beijing.
Late last year, Mr Rocha denied meeting a company whose head was imprisoned for trying to fix matches in central America.
The company paid for Nicaragua's under-20 football team to travel to a tournament.
Mr Rocha was arrested in Switzerland and is contesting attempts to extradite him to the US.
A British citizen, Mr Takkas is closely linked to Jeffrey Webb, and worked as an attache to the Concacaf president.
Mr Takkas, 58, also worked alongside Webb in the Cayman Islands, as general secretary of its football association.
He was arrested in Switzerland and is contesting attempts to extradite him to the US.
Nicolas Leoz, 87, resigned from Fifa's powerful executive committee on "health and personal" grounds in 2013.
In November 2010, the Paraguayan official was accused by the BBC's Panorama programme of taking bribes in the 1990s from the now defunct sports rights agency ISL.
In 2011, former English Football Association chairman Lord Triesman alleged that Mr Leoz had asked for a knighthood in return for supporting England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup.
Mr Leoz denied both allegations and Fifa later cleared him of demanding a knighthood.
It was later reported that one of Mr Leoz's aides proposed to the England 2018 bid team that Mr Leoz could be tempted into visiting Britain if the FA Cup was renamed in his honour.
He is under house arrest in Paraguay.
Mr Hawit, 64, is interim president for North, Central America and Caribbean (Concacaf) football, succeeding Jeffrey Webb in May, and is a Fifa executive committee member and vice president.
He was arrested in a dawn raid on a luxury hotel in Zurich, Switzerland, on 3 December.
The Swiss justice ministry said Mr Hawit, a Honduran national, was suspected of taking millions of dollars in bribes in return for selling marketing rights for regional tournaments and World Cup qualifying matches.
In January 2016, he agreed to be extradited to the US.
Honduran ex-president Rafael Callejas, a member of Fifa's TV and marketing committee, said: "He assured and guaranteed that he was not involved in anything illicit."
Mr Callejas later also appeared on the list of those newly indicted. He has pleaded not guilty in New York to bribery charges.
Juan Angel Napout, 57, is a Fifa executive committee member, having succeeded Eugenio Figueredo. He is also a Fifa vice-president.
He was president of Conmebol, overseeing football in the South American confederation, until his resignation on 11 December 2015.
Mr Napout was president of the Paraguayan Football Association from 2007 to 2014.
He was arrested at the same time and location as Mr Hawit.
He was extradited from Switzerland, and in December pleaded not guilty in New York to charges of racketeering, conspiracy and wire fraud. He was released on $20m bail.
Born in 1964, Argentine Alejandro Burzaco is president of sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias.
The US Department of Justice alleged that Mr Burzaco conspired to win and keep hold of lucrative media rights contracts from regional football federations by paying up to $110m (Â£72m) in bribes.
Mr Burzaco, who also has Italian citizenship, gave himself up at a police station in Bolzano, near Italy's northern border with Switzerland, on 9 June.
He later pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy.
US prosecutors accuse Argentines Hugo Jinkis, 70, and his son Mariano, 40, of paying bribes to win and keep media rights contracts from regional football federations.
They own a sports company called Full Play, which is based in Argentina.
The US is seeking their extradition.
Born in 1971, Aaron Davidson is the president of Traffic Sports USA, a football event company that has previously managed Concacaf matches.
He is accused of paying bribes to secure marketing rights to football tournaments.
On paying bribes, he was allegedly recorded telling a co-conspirator: "Is it illegal? It is illegal. Within the big picture of things, a company that has worked in this industry for 30 years, is it bad? It is bad."
He pleaded not guilty in a New York court on 29 May on charges including racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering, and was released on bail.
