Rio de Janeiro celebrates its official Dia do Garis - which means Day of the Street Cleaners - on 16 May each year.
This year they had a parade where they sang, played instruments and danced to samba music around the streets of the Brazilian city.
They even took selfies with fans.
On the Dia do Garis, Rio de Janeiro plays tribute to its 15,000 street cleaners who stand out in their orange overalls.
Sorriso, who you can watch dancing in this video, even strutted his stuff in the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
