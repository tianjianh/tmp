James, 29, who presents the drive-time show, studied drama and had a number of shows on the students' union radio station before rising to fame.
The DJ, who is covering Radio 1's Big Weekend in Norwich this bank holiday, said he was "completely honoured".
Father Ted co-writer Graham Linehan and broadcaster Dame Jenni Murray are also receiving degrees.
James said: "My affair with UEA continues - it really is wonderful and I'm completely honoured to be given this.
"I spent a very happy three years there and it's the place where I fell in love with drama and radio, so it's very special to me.
"As soon as the ceremony is over, I'll set about officially changing my name on all credit cards, mortgage documents and, most importantly, the Radio 1 website."
James and Linehan will receive an Honorary Doctorate of Letters at a ceremony in Norwich in July, with BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour presenter Murray being given an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law.
Other names being recognised for their distinguished careers include comedian Arthur Smith, author Erica Wagner, actor Samuel West and the Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James.
