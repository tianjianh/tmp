Garda smear allegations to be investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish government has appointed a former high court judge to review allegations the Garda Commissioner was aware of a smear campaign against a whistleblower in the force.

The claim concerns Noírín O'Sullivan's time as deputy commissioner.
Ms O'Sullivan said she was "not privy to" - nor had she approved - any action to target any officer.
Mr Justice Iarlaith O'Neill has six weeks to report back and recommend whether a further enquiry is needed.
Announcing the judge's appointment, the justice minister said police had to be held to the very highest standards.
"This involves ensuring that allegations of wrongdoing are dealt with properly and the persons making those allegations are fully protected and respected," said Frances Fitzgerald.
"On conclusion of the review I will consider what further steps may be necessary. "
The whistleblower, Sgt Maurice McCabe, alleged that certain people had their driving penalty points wiped.
He was one of two Garda (police) sergeants who made such allegations.
Two years ago, the former Garda commissioner, Martin Callinan, resigned as head of the force following a controversy over how the two sergeants who made the allegations were treated.
Since then a senior officer, using legislation that protects whistleblowers, claimed he was authorised to brief against one of the sergeants, Mr McCabe, and that Ms O'Sullivan was aware of this.
This week the Dail (Irish parliament) heard that unless she steps aside from her post for the duration of an enquiry, the fresh whistleblower may not co-operate with the investigation.
The justice minister said earlier that because "no findings of wrongdoing of any kind have been made against the Garda commissioner", she believed Ms O'Sullivan was "entitled to our confidence".
