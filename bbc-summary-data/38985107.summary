Plans for a sculpture in Hull featuring thousands of handmade ceramic poppies commemorating those who died in World War One have emerged.

A planning application for the Weeping Window was submitted last month.
If approved, it will go on display on 25 March for seven weeks replacing the turbine blade artwork.
The full poppy installation, named Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, attracted over five million visitors to the Tower of London in 2014.

In this latest display, almost 6,000 ceramic poppies would "pour" from a window of the Maritime Museum in Queen Victoria Square.
The building, formerly the Dock Offices, tells the history of the city's mariners.
The project has been backed by Historic England, which said in a letter that the museum offered "a great location for such a poignant art installation" which would "encourage people to look up and appreciate the structure in addition to the art work".
The site was chosen to highlight sacrifices made by the Merchant and Royal Navies, Hull City Council said.
Much of Hull's fishing fleet was requisitioned for mine-sweeping and many fishermen helped the war effort.
Each poppy in the original piece, by Artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper, represented one death in the British forces.
