Unclaimed teddy bears found on First Great Western trains are be donated to children's charities following an unsuccessful campaign to reunite them with their owners.

The firm launched its campaign last November, but has so far been unable to reunite a single toy with its owner.
There are currently more than 40 soft toys in its lost property.
A spokesman said some would be donated to charity if not claimed within the next three months.
The toys were all found travelling on the First Great Western network, which covers the Thames Valley, Hampshire, London, Dorset, Sussex, Wiltshire, Somerset, Avon, Gloucestershire, Hereford, Worcestershire, Devon, Cornwall and South Wales.
A spokesman for the firm said it receives about 15 lost toys every three months.
As well as bears, he said there was a "huge range" of different cuddly animals including monkeys, rabbits, a hedgehog, penguin and lion.
He said toys found towards the start of the campaign would be washed and sent to children's charities if they remained unclaimed in November.
The train company, which originally hoped to return the toys to their owners in time for Christmas, had used mug shots of the toys on its website and posters but has now also photographed some against a beach backdrop for summer.
The train company's website enables people to submit a search for a teddy, even if they are unable to remember exactly where it was lost.
