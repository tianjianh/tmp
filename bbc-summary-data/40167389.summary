Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn hopes to give Katie Taylor her American debut as a pro fighter in New York in July.

Hearn is trying to line up a spot for Taylor on the undercard of Mikey Garcia's clash with four-time world champion Adrien Broner on 28 July.
Taylor stopped German Nina Meinke in a world title eliminator at Wembley Stadium in April and is expected to fight for a world title in the autumn.
Ireland's former Olympic champion has won all five bouts since turning pro.
Unbeaten Belfast boxer Ryan Burnett, who is also in Hearn's Matchroom Boxing stable, will fight champion Lee Haskins for the IBF world bantamweight title at the SSE Arena on Saturday.
It is a first crack at a world belt for the 24-year-old Burnett, whose one hundred per cent record in 16 pro contests has already earned him British and WBC International titles.
