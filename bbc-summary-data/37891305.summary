Having beaten City to win the League Cup in June, Hibs took the lead with Lisa Robertson's looping header.
Hayley Lauder levelled in the second half, with goalkeeper Jenna Fife unable to keep out her curling shot.
Neither side could find an extra-time goal and Hibs recovered from Robertson's opening miss from the spot to prevail 6-5 in the shootout.
Fife saved from Lauder and Sam Kerr was the unlucky player to fire over the crossbar for City.
Hibs were the brighter side in the first half and were rewarded for their enterprise when Robertson nodded them in front on 23 minutes.
Clare Shine went close with a second-half header for City, while Hibs midfielder Lucy Graham was inches wide with a great header from just inside the box.
With City seeing more of the ball, a defensive mix-up allowed Lauder to surge into the penalty area from the right and take aim for the opposite corner.
Fife got a hand to the shot but failed to push it away.
Shine scooped a volley wide before a stoppage-time scare for City as Nicola Docherty hooked the ball off her goal-line.
Hibs threatened from a series of corners in the first half of extra-time and City's Sarah Crilly skewed a first-time shot wide from near the penalty spot in the second period.
City celebrated a 10th successive league title last month, beating Hibs three times along the way, but their closest rivals stopped them making it six Scottish Cup wins in a row.
Robertson ballooned the first penalty attempt over the bar, but her team-mates responded with six successful strikes, Joelle Murray converting the last before Kerr's miss.
Hibernian captain Joelle Murray: "I'm so proud of the team. It's been an amazing season, two cups and playing in the Champions League.
"Hopefully we can keep the team together and build again for next time."
Hibernian goalkeeper Jenna Fife: "We want to push on for next season. We're capable of a treble."
