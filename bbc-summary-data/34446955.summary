Geller, 68, who became famous for bending spoons, said he planned to leave the UK to return to his native Israel.
The red steel statue in the shape of a bent spoon has been placed on a large tree stump in Sonning.
Uri Geller said: "It will be photographed a million times."
The statue, made by artist-blacksmith Paul Wells, is sited opposite the home of actor George Clooney and his wife Amal, who recently moved to Sonning.
