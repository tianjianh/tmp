The 18-year-old left-hander has made six first-class appearances for Northants, his most recent coming in April against Loughborough MCCU.
He also made his List A debut against New Zealand in 2014, aged 15.
The orthodox spinner was also included in the squad for Tuesday's One-Day Cup washout against Nottinghamshire.
"It's great news to have Saif Zaib sign his first professional contract," Northamptonshire's head coach David Ripley said.
"He has already shown his ability in the first team and he is continuing to develop as a person and as a cricketer."
