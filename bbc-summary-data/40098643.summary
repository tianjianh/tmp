[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are likely to apply for extra powers to stop and search people at this weekend's Champions League final.

About 170,000 people are expected in Cardiff over four days around the match between Real Madrid and Juventus.
South Wales Police's Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis said the force could invoke temporary powers allowing officers to search anyone without the usual reasonable grounds.
He described safety and security at the event as "our absolute aim".
He added: "We have powers to stop and search every day of the week and we will be utilising these, but we can also apply for extra powers to allow us to stop and search specifically in an area which we may apply for and use this weekend."
These powers, which must be approved by a senior officer, allow random searches if serious violence may take place in a specific area.
Streets immediately surrounding the National Stadium of Wales will be off limits for anyone without a match ticket on Saturday and no bags will be allowed in the stadium.
Real Madrid and Juventus fans have two different bag drops and their belongings will be held in articulated lorries.
ACC Lewis advised against attempting to drive into the capital on match day due to additional security barriers preventing vehicles from getting into the centre.
Over 24 hours on Saturday there will be 2,000 deployments of police officers throughout the city.
Between Thursday and Sunday, when the festival around the match runs, there will be 6,500 deployments, including 550 armed officers.
ACC Lewis said the Champions League "even trumps Nato" in terms of the impact on the city.
