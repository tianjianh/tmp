Black Grape, Eddi Reader, The Beat and the Bay City Rollers will perform at the event which runs until 30 January.
The annual Burns Carnival returns on Sunday, when thousands of people are expected to take to the streets in celebration of the Bard.
Many of the events will be held in the specially-constructed Spiegeltent in the town's Loreburn Street car park.
Artistic director Graham Main said: "It's going to be a vintage year with so many great shows packed into nine days.
"Something that makes the festival really special is that we get big names coming from all over the country, and far beyond, because they love being part of a celebration which is about Burns, Scotland and all that's best about life."
Other shows in the line-up include Inner Mongolian musicians Anda Union, Irish vocalist Camille O'Sullivan, comedian Andrew Maxwell and the Treacherous Orchestra.
The festival is held at venues across Dumfries.
