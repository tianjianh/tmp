[SN]TITLE[SN]
Denbighshire taxi drivers to be trained to spot abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Taxi drivers in Denbighshire will have to complete mandatory training in a bid to help spot child sexual exploitation, after the council agreed the plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The authority made the move after looking at the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal inquiry, which said taxi drivers had played a "prominent role" in the abuse.
The training will be for drivers of taxis and private-hire vehicles.
About 300 drivers in neighbouring Conwy county have completed a similar course.
Graham Boase, Denbighshire council's head of planning and public protection, said the training supported the authority's commitment to protecting vulnerable people.
