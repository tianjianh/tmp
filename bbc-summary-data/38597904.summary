Norman Rimmington, also known as "Rimmo", signed with Barnsley in 1945, earning £3 a week as a goalkeeper.
He worked for the football club in many roles after he hung up his gloves, including coach, assistant manager, groundsman, physio and kit man.
Fans of the club applauded as the funeral procession passed the Tykes' Oakwell stadium.
Mr Rimmington, who was born in Staincross, was described by the club as a "fearless" keeper who made 27 appearances for the side, before moving to Hartlepool United in 1947.
The goalkeeper, who also worked as a pit fitter and a mechanic, returned to the South Yorkshire side in 1952 and never left.
He died in late December aged 93.
Family members, friends, colleagues and former team-mates attended a service at All Saints Church, Darton, followed by a ceremony at Barnsley Crematorium.
In an interview with BBC Sport, Mr Rimmington said he "used to get some stick as a goalkeeper" during his playing days.
"They could knock you into back of net and it were a goal; it's not the same game," he said.
"Now they go down as if they've been shot and there's nothing wrong with them."
Shortly before his death, he was informed he had been awarded the British Empire Medal for services to football.
Discussing his deep connection with the club, he said: "I were born in Barnsley, brought up in Barnsley and played at Barnsley.
"I love the club and everything I've done here."
In a statement, the club said: "Rimmo was a true club legend and a man who represented the club with the upmost pride and dedication throughout his life."
