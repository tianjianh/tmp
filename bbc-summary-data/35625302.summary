The actor and model Gal Gadot, who will star in the upcoming Wonder Woman movie, was photographed at the set earlier.
The London landmark was festooned with union jacks, while actors in period costume and antique cars could be seen.
Roads around the square were closed off during the filming, with buses diverted, Transport for London said.
