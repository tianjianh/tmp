A rare copy of the comic Viz has sold at auction for £900 - raising more than 22 times its estimated price.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A fourth edition of irreverent, adult-themed magazine was one of a number of comics to go under the hammer at Anderson and Garland in Northumberland.
These included editions of Viz, Dandy and Hotspur which went for a total of £13,458 - double the pre-sale estimate.
Viz was the brainchild of Chris Donald, who set it up in 1979 in his bedroom whilst living with his parents.
Originally photocopied and distributed among the then-teenager's friends, by 1989 sales had reached one million.
The fourth edition, dated October 1980, had been listed with a guide price of £20-40.
Fred Wyrley Birch, from Anderson and Garland, said: "We have sold first edition copies of Viz in the past for less than this fourth edition made."
