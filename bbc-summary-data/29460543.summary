The 20-year-old came through the academy system at the Premier League club and is a regular member of their Under-21 squad.
He is available to make his Football League debut for the Glovers in Saturday's game against MK Dons.
"We've got strikers but no-one has really hit that bit of form yet," boss Gary Johnson told BBC Somerset.
"I know they've got high hopes for him. He's got electric pace and a good goal-scoring record.
"This is his first loan, so we're taking a bit of a chance but I think he's ready."
