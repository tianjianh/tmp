[SN]TITLE[SN]
Does China's Winter Olympics song sound like Frozen?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The official song for the Beijing Winter Olympics has come under criticism online for sounding rather like a hit song from Disney's musical, Frozen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was announced on Friday that Beijing would host the 2022 Winter Olympics despite the city's lack of snow.
No-one was available for comment at either the Beijing Games' organising committee or Disney.
But just how similar are the two songs?
Judge for yourself: have a listen to China's Olympic song 'The Snow and Ice Dance', and Frozen's 'Let It Go'.
