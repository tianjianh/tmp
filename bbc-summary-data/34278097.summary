The Livingston-based firm, which focuses on upper limb prosthetic technologies, opened its latest Touch Life Centre in Heidelberg, Germany.
Touch said the facility complemented its existing centres of excellence in Hilliard, Ohio, and Livingston.
The centre will offer customer support operations for other European markets.
Touch chief executive Ian Stevens said: "We recognise the importance of education and training to clinicians when delivering optimal outcomes for the community of i-limb wearers.
"We intend that this well-equipped and highly professional facility, utilising our recently revised teaching methods and online learning modules, will be a very useful clinical resource for all our customers."
Earlier this year a nine-year-old boy was fitted with an i-limb quantum, a "bionic" hand designed by Touch Bionics.
Josh Cathcart, from Dalgety Bay in Fife, was thought to be the youngest person in the world to receive such technology.
