[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour MSP James Kelly censured over Alex Salmond complaint

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour MSP James Kelly has been censured for breaching Holyrood's Code of Conduct when he told the press he had made a formal complaint against Alex Salmond.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Kelly contacted the Commission for Ethical Standards in Public Life claiming Mr Salmond failed to declare earnings from newspaper columns.
He also issued a media release revealing details of the complaint.
The commissioner dismissed the claim as "not relevant" and "inadmissible".
Mr Salmond, the former first minister and SNP leader, then complained to the commissioner that Mr Kelly had breached the Code of Conduct by revealing the action to the media.
Holyrood's Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee has now agreed with the commissioner that Mr Kelly's actions amounted to a breach.
But committee convener Stewart Stevenson said it did "not consider that the breach in question justifies any sanctions being imposed on James Kelly".
Mr Stevenson said: "In reaching the decision on sanctions, the committee was mindful of the fact that James Kelly acknowledged that he had breached the code and stated that it was an inadvertent breach.
"Furthermore, he took personal responsibility for the breach and apologised for it."
Mr Stevenson added: "The committee takes all breaches of the code seriously. The rule covering disclosure is important because it allows investigations by the commissioner and the committee to be concluded in the absence of external partisan comment.
"The committee condemns, in particular, any breaches which risk causing reputational damage to another member in advance of a proper investigation."
