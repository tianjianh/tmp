After exiting the Irish Cup at the start of April, the Crues recovered with five straight league wins to retain the Irish Premiership title.
Whyte scored in decisive victories over Linfield and Cliftonvillle.
Baxter said Whyte was "unplayable and his displays were a welcome lift in the final stages of the campaign".
The Crusaders manager praised the spirit of his side, commending their mean defence which kept 20 clean sheets in 38 matches throughout the season.
On picking up his award, Whyte admitted that "it's true when they say your second year is the hardest and at one point my confidence was low, but getting games and getting goals certainly raised it".
