Dr Helen Nicoll, 53, was pronounced dead at the house in Frog End, Great Wilbraham, Cambridgeshire on 5 June.
Her husband Stephen Nicoll, 53, was arrested on suspicion of murder before being released with no further action.
The opening of an inquest into her death heard the cause of her death was compression of the neck consistent with hanging.
Opening and adjourning the inquest into Dr Nicoll's death, coroner David Morris said Mr Nicoll had discovered his wife hanging from a banister with what looked like a ski jacket belt around her neck.
'Devastating loss'
He had cut her body down.
Mr Morris said he was satisfied there was no third party involvement in her death.
Further toxicology tests were ordered "with reference to alcohol" and a full inquest was scheduled for 20 August.
Cambridgeshire Police were called to reports of a sudden death at the couple's home at about 06:30 BST.
A post-mortem examination on Monday revealed Mrs Nicoll died from asphyxiation.
Mr Nicoll has said his wife had "taken her own life" and spoke of his family's "devastating loss".
The couple had three children and worked together in their clinic in Hurst Park, Cambridge while Mr Nicoll also practises in London's Harley Street.
