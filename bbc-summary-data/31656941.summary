Science Vale expansion includes Didcot Power Station redevelopment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals to expand one of the UK's major science hubs include redeveloping the land around Didcot Power Station.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Science Vale incorporates Harwell Campus, Culham Science Centre, and Milton Park in south Oxfordshire.
The Science Vale Area Action Plan intends to regenerate "large brownfield sites, such as the former power station site at Didcot A to provide an opportunity to help improve Didcot".
Plans include 20,000 new jobs and 20,000 homes by 2031.
The site of the former Didcot A power station, which was demolished in 2014, has been identified as a "key site" for growth.
Other "strategic" sites include Crab Hill, Grove Airfield, Monks Farm, Valley Park, Milton Heights, and east of Sutton Courtenay.
The planning policy document was jointly prepared by South Oxfordshire District Council and Vale of White Horse District Council.
The authorities outline a vision of "diverse, high quality, attractive housing developments" as part of the expansion.
However, they aim to protect the "distinctive character and heritage of Science Vale's market towns, villages and countryside".
Science Vale is home to major scientific projects such as the national synchrotron Diamond Light Source.
The goal is to fill many of the jobs required in the research and development sectors, including space, life sciences, advanced engineering and cryogenics, via local recruitment.
The first Oxfordshire University Technical College opens in Didcot in September.
A series of public consultations are being held until 17 April.
