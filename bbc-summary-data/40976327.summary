Magistrates told him they appreciated his guilty plea and the fact he had co-operated with police when arrested.
Milner, who represented himself in court, said he believed he had about four pints.
His cart had scratched a man's car in the car park of the Swan Hotel and the two men were exchanging details when a police officer noticed the defendant appeared to be drunk.
