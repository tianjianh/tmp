"He sat down during the song and then walked off behind the drum set," Kevin Phalon, an audience member, told NBC News.
"After that, you could see a whole bunch of backstage people run off to the left side of the stage."

"He is stable right now, with family and is under the best care," it said.
Alice Cooper also tweeted his thanks to "everyone asking about our brother @JoePerry".
