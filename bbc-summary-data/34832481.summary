The company described the new platform as its most significant product launch since HD and "a new way to watch TV".
The package will comprise a set-top box and a "super premium package" and will be separate from Sky's Now TV on-demand service.
Experts questioned what it would cost as Sky has not revealed pricing for the product.
Sky's Andrew Olson told Rory Cellan-Jones that it was a new "premium" offering.
