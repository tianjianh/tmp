Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali has agreed to perform in the Indian capital Delhi after his concert in Mumbai was cancelled following protests by the right-wing Hindu party Shiv Sena.

Ali has accepted an invitation to perform in December, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.
The Shiv Sena had threatened to disrupt Ali's Mumbai concert on Friday.
The party said it would not allow any artiste from Pakistan to perform until the situation in Kashmir has improved.
India and Pakistan have recently accused each other of unprovoked firing along the disputed border.
A ceasefire agreed in 2003 remains in place, but the neighbours often accuse each other of violating it.
Mumbai is the the capital of western Maharashtra state, where the Hindu nationalist BJP rules in coalition with the Shiv Sena.
A recent assurance by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis that Ali was welcome to perform in Mumbai and that his government would give him "full protection" did not deter his ally from opposing the concert.
Soon after the concert was cancelled, a minister from Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party said the Shiv Sena action insulted not only Ali, but also Indian ghazal singer Jagjit Singh.
Ali's concert was to be a tribute to Jagjit Singh on the event of his fourth death anniversary.
Ghulam Ali is popular in India and recently performed at a Hindu temple in the ancient city of Varanasi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said he is a fan.
