The dogs can help to open doors, collect post and use a pedestrian crossing where their owners might have problems.
They also provide emotional support and friendship for owners like eight-year-old Phoebe.
Phoebe has autism, a condition that affects the way you communicate and make sense of the world around you.
She used to get very nervous and confused in busy places like supermarkets, where there are lots of people, but her special dog CJ helped her to feel calmer and more relaxed.
Ricky has been finding out more about these very special dogs...
