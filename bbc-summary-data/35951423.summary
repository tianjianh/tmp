Secret Brief wins Lincoln Handicap at Doncaster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Secret Brief (12-1) put in a late charge to give the powerful Godolphin stable victory in the Lincoln Handicap at Doncaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The horse, trained by Charlie Appleby and ridden by William Buick, spent the winter in Dubai.
And he showed great determination to get past Ryan Moore and Bravo Zolo (12-1) to win by a neck in the first big handicap of the Flat season.
Battle Of Marathon (50-1) grabbed third, ahead of Birdman (14-1).
Buick said: "It's a great race to win. I've got to give credit to the whole team at home - they've done a fantastic job with him so thanks to them.
"His last run in Dubai was good and we are just getting to know him and I think he'll improve for a better surface."
"This was a significant result for Godolphin, whose structure has been overhauled by Sheikh Mohammed in an attempt to be more effective in the battle of Flat racing's superpowers, against the likes of Coolmore and Juddmonte - a battle in which it has sometimes seemed to underachieve.
"OK, for all its history, the Lincoln is a handicap, so not really the type of race for which the Sheikh assembled his blue-bloods. But having made a big statement of intent for 2016, this will put a confident spring in the Godolphin step. Now, will it stay there?"
