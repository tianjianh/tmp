Stirling-based infrastructure and construction group Robertson said pre-tax profits climbed 81% to £21.4m in the year to March.
It also reported record turnover of £453m.
Robertson said there had been "continued and sustainable" growth across its 19 operating companies.
Construction and house building were among several businesses to perform particularly well.
It also expanded its offering in building services, civil engineering and rendering and roofing.
Robertson, which was founded in Elgin, currently employs nearly 2,000 people across the UK, having increased employee numbers by more than 600 in the past 18 months.
It expects its headcount to grow by a further 5% in the year ahead.
Group turnover in England has grown to a record level of £100m as part of the company's ongoing regional growth strategy.
Robertson said it had seen "major success" in the growth of its Partnership Homes business, which had now secured contracts to deliver over 2,500 homes over the next five years in Scotland.
Robertson Homes also reported growth in private housing development, increasing the number of units sold in the year by 65%.
It has started new developments in Dunbar, Strathaven and Mid Calder in Central Scotland and is currently operating on eight live sites.
Chairman Bill Robertson said: "We are delighted with the continued progress across all of our 19 operating companies.
"The group has now started delivering on its new five-year strategic plan with a strong focus on sustainability, innovation and productivity.
"The continued success of the group will be based on generating sustainable and appropriate margins for any work undertaken."
