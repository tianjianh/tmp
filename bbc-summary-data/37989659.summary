The player from second division women's side Torrelodones went to police after noticing that someone tried to sneak a mobile phone through a window.
Torrelodones had just played against Atletico at the team's Ciudad Deportiva complex outside Madrid.

They have opened an internal investigation and say that the club made themselves available to help the player the moment she raised her concerns.
