Increase in university students 'working to fund studies'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of university students working to help fund their studies has risen sharply, a survey has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 77% of students work, up from 59% last year, the study of 4,642 students by insurance firm Endsleigh and the National Union of Students suggested.
It found that students earned an average of £412 a month, with women earning 36% less than men.
Most said they worked part-time, but 14% said they held down full-time jobs during term-time, holidays or both.
More than half (56%) of those with a job said they worked because they had under-estimated the expense of university, especially the cost of accommodation.
A large majority (87%) said developing additional skills and enhancing their CV were also important reasons for working whilst studying.
The online survey of 4,642 university students also found:
Despite the increase in the number of students with jobs, dependence on other sources of finance has not decreased, the survey suggested.
Just over half of students (53%) said they depended on their parents to help them through university.
Meanwhile 74% said they relied on a student loan as a main source of income, up from 67% last year and 60% in 2013.

Universities in England are currently allowed to charge up to £9,000 a year in tuition fees, with repayments to begin once students graduate and earn more than £21,000 a year.
To cover rent, food, travel and any other living costs, students can borrow up to £5,555 outside London and £7,751 for students in London.
In Scotland there are no fees for Scottish students, whilst in Wales the annual fee cap for Welsh students is £3,810. In Northern Ireland, fees for students from Northern Ireland are capped at  £3,805.
