The victim, in his 20s, was attacked at the junction of Thomas Lane and Thingwall Avenue in Knotty Ash at 17:20 BST on Thursday.
Merseyside Police's organised crime unit are investigating what it described as the "coming together" of two groups.
The shot man is hospital with non life-threatening injuries, police said.
Officers are trying to trace the gunman who fled on foot after the incident.
Det Ch Insp Neil Shaw described it was a "brazen attack" that showed "complete disregard" for "everyone else on the playing field and for everyone who lives nearby".
"We believe this was a deliberate and targeted attack carried out in front of two rival groups of people on the playing fields."
He said anybody with information about the incident should contact police.
