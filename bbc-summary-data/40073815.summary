Derbyshire v Leicestershire: Match drawn after huge first-innings totals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derbyshire and Leicestershire both took 11 points after a flat pitch and huge first-innings totals resulted in a draw in County Championship Division Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In reply to Leicestershire's 619, the hosts' Billy Godleman and Shiv Thakor responded with hundreds on day three.
Derbyshire added just one run to their overnight second-innings total to post 533, before Harry Dearden made 78 as the Foxes declared on 217-3.
That left Derbyshire 303 to chase, but a draw was agreed after just 10 overs.
The hosts began the fourth day on 532-8, but Clint McKay (3-78) dismissed Rob Hemmings and Zak Chappell (4-108) had Tony Palladino caught behind to end the innings swiftly.
Dearden and Paul Horton (56) then put on an opening stand of 125 to help set up a declaration, but after Derbyshire openers Ben Slater (28 not out) and Billy Godleman reached 42-0, the captains shook hands for a draw.
Neither side has won a Championship match in 2017.
