A Bayern Munich fans' group is planning a protest during the Champions League game against Arsenal over the cost of the Gunners' away tickets.

FC Bayern Worldwide says it will not enter the Emirates for the first five minutes of next week's match because of the "excessive" £64 ticket price.
It comes as the BBC released the Price of Football study, which analyses costs at 227 clubs across Britain and Europe.
In response, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said it is "his job to provide value".
The BBC's study found the Gunners have the most expensive match-day ticket in the Premier League at £97, while their away tickets in the league are priced between £26 and £64.
Bayern Munich's cheapest season ticket in the Bundesliga is £140.
"There's a concerted effort at board meetings to block increases and in seven of the last 10 years there haven't been increases in ticket prices," added Wenger, who was speaking before his side's Premier League game with Watford on Saturday.
"There is a will to make tickets affordable.
"Is football more expensive? Yes, but on a Saturday or Sunday if you want to go to rugby you will see the tickets are expensive there as well. It is maybe part of professionalism and a modern society."
In a statement on Facebook, FC Bayern Worldwide claimed the cost of an away ticket, for the Group F game on 20 October, would rise to more than 100 euros (£74) once fees and postage were added.
An Arsenal spokesman confirmed that fans will not be prevented from voicing their opinions, but added: "We would like to point out that 50% of our general admission tickets throughout the season are priced £40 or below. Also, we would like to stress that German football receives significant government funding, which is not the case in England."
Earlier this month, the Football Supporters' Federation co-ordinated protests at all 20 Premier League clubs and 10 Championship teams, to call for a £20 cap on away ticket prices.
