Ally Gilchrist has undergone a third operation on a pelvis/groin problem and Michael Coulson is still out.
Celtic trio Moussa Dembele, Stuart Armstrong and Leigh Griffiths have returned to light training after missing the last two matches.
Tom Rogic is also nearing a comeback after sitting out eight games with an ankle problem.
January signing Eboue Kouassi is still not ready to make his debut.
Celtic battled to a 1-0 victory over the Saints on 25 January, equalling the Lisbon Lions' 26-game unbeaten domestic record.
The sides' only other meeting this season came at McDiarmid Park in August, and ended 4-2 in the champions' favour.
However, St Johnstone are the last team to beat Celtic in domestic football, with a 2-1 in Perth during May.
Brendan Rodgers' side are 25 points clear at the Premiership summit, while Saints are bidding to keep pace with fourth-placed Hearts, with whom they are level on points.
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "It's three points. That's how we see it. Whatever team is the first to beat them will get the plaudits for doing it but it is not a motivation.
"It is not something we will be using (as motivation). Ultimately we look at every game as having three points available, one available or none, but we try to go for three points, that is all we are focused on."
Celtic assistant manager Chris Davies: "We don't talk about the record. The motivation to be at a club like this, to play, to perform, is what we focus on. Never have we sat and spoke about the record. We try to work hard every day and be the best that we can be.
"Winning the title as quickly as possible would be great, but it is not something we think about or focus on.
"It is just, 'Win the next game'. It will be a very tough game at the weekend."
