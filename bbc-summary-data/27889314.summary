[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up to 325 turbines will be installed as part of the East Anglia One wind farm, which will be 27 miles (43km) off the Suffolk coast.
Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it could "inject millions of pounds into the local and national economies".
About 2,900 jobs are expected to be created as part of the scheme.
Mr Davey said: "East Anglia and the rest of the UK have a lot to gain from this development.
"Making the most of Britain's home grown energy is crucial in creating job and business opportunities, getting the best deal for customers and reducing our reliance on foreign imports."
The wind farm would be significantly larger than the London Array, off the Kent coast, which is currently the largest offshore wind farm in the world.
