RSPCA inspector Claire Fisher said the dog had the worst case of matting she had seen in 12 years.
The pet was also underweight and malnourished because the matting had made it hard for him to bend down to eat.
Tiernan was also given a six-month community order and a three-week curfew between 22:00 GMT and 08:00.
