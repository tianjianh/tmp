Newport Gwent Dragons number eight Ed Jackson has undergone shoulder surgery and faces a spell on the sidelines.

The Bath-born player, 28, has made 36 appearances for the Dragons since joining from Wasps in 2015.
He is in his second season and signed a contract extension in December 2016.
Dragons forwards coach Ceri Jones said: "It's a big blow. Eddie has been excellent all year for us, he has really stepped up to the mark and will be a big loss."
However, Jones says Jackson's misfortune can be a chance for others to thrive.
"We are very fortunate to have the likes of Ollie Griffiths, Harrison Keddie, James Thomas who can come into the back-row," said Jackson.
"Harri has shown glimpses of what he can do all season and there's definitely a player there, so this is an opportunity."
Dragons travel to Munster in the Pro12 on Friday.
