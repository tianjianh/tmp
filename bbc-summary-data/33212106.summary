Uplands School in Swindon provides education for children with special needs between the ages of 11 and 19.
It won awards for both the alternative provision school of the year and the overall school of the year.
Royal Wootton Bassett Academy was nominated in the secondary school category but missed out on the top prize.
Judges, who included writer Anthony Horowitz and Colin Bell, chief executive of the Council of British International Schools, said achievement at the school was "well above" national expectations.
"It's just a delight to come across such a fantastic school," judges said.
The TES (formerly Times Education Supplement) school awards are in their seventh year. Winners were announced on Friday.
The awards have 17 categories, including primary school, secondary school, head teacher and healthy school of the year.
