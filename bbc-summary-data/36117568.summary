Carl Frampton has agreed to a showdown with world featherweight champion Leo Santa Cruz in the summer, according to the Belfast boxer's management team.

On Friday night, Cyclone Promotions boss Barry McGuigan revealed on Twitter that they had signed up for the fight, which will take place in New York.
Frampton is aiming to become the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at different weights.
In February, he beat Scott Quigg in a super-bantamweight unification bout.
It saw the 29-year-old add the WBA belt to the IBF title he already held.
However, he was later stripped of the WBA crown because he did not agree to a defence against mandatory challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux.
On the same night as the Frampton v Quigg clash in Manchester, Santa Cruz defended his WBA featherweight title against Spain's Kiko Martinez.
Mexican Santa Cruz, 27, is a three-weight world champion and is undefeated in his 33 professional contests.
