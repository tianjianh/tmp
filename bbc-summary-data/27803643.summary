[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thirty-nine jockeys have been cautioned after being found guilty of misconduct following the chaotic start to the 2014 Grand National at Aintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The riders were charged with a breach of racing rules for lining up at the beginning of the race before being given permission by the starter.
The cautions were handed out by a disciplinary panel convened by the British Horseracing Authority.
Pineau De Re, ridden by Leighton Aspell, won the 167th National.
On the first attempt to get the race under way, assistant starter Simon McNeill was knocked over by one of the runners as it approached the start line. He was not badly hurt.
During the hearing, race starter Hugh Barclay agreed with QC Graeme McPherson, who was representing the jockeys, that riders are routinely "trusted to sort themselves out and line up" after a warning given 30 seconds before the race.
McNeill, a former jockey, disputed whether the warning had actually been given, but the panel judged that the jockeys had "lined up before being instructed to do so".
Tim Charlton, chairing the BHA panel, said: "We recognise the primary problems which occurred were from actions that were not theirs."
