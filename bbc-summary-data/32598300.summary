Hearings planned for Sheerwater demolition estate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Public hearings are to be held next month as part of an inquiry into the Sheerwater regeneration scheme where 600 homes could be demolished.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An independent panel was set up earlier this year after residents on the Surrey estate called for an investigation into processes by Woking council.
More than 1,200 people had signed a petition opposing the demolition of homes.
The local authority has said hearings will take place from 1 to 4 June.
People who want to give evidence, and have not been invited, need to express their interest by 18 May.
The panel is hearing evidence from residents and businesses on the estate, as well as developers, the regeneration team, councillors and council officers.
It is investigating actions taken by the council, but is not considering the merits of the overall scheme.
Residents opposing the plans have described them as not regeneration but a complete rebuild of Sheerwater, which they said was not what they wanted or expected.
The estate was originally built after World War Two, to house families that relocated from London.
Residents have been promised new housing, a retail centre, leisure centre, sports facilities, park, public square, community facilities and better transport links, under the regeneration plans.
