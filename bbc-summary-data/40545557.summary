[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Scott Brown is a doubt for Celtic's Champions League first-round qualifier against Linfield after limping off injured during their pre-season thrashing of Shamrock Rovers.

The midfielder lasted just 32 minutes of the 9-0 triumph in Dublin.
Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers revealed Brown's Achilles had troubled him.
"[His Achilles] was a little bit sore and we just need to assess that over the next couple of days," Rodgers told Celtic TV. "Nothing too serious."
The Scottish champions are already without centre-back Dedryck Boyata for up to three months due to ruptured knee ligaments.
Striker Moussa Dembele made his first appearance since injuring his hamstring in the Scottish Cup semi-final in April, and scored one of Celtic's nine goals. New signing Jonny Hayes also found the net.
Rodgers' men begin their European campaign against Linfield in Belfast on Friday.
