[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 1-1 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Billy Waters rescued a point for Cheltenham against Leyton Orient in their first game back in the English Football League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Orient took the lead in the third minute through Gavin Massey but Waters responded with 14 minutes left to earn a 1-1 draw.
Massey, on his debut, turned in Sandro Semedo's cross at the far post to give the visitors the perfect start to the campaign.
Cheltenham were unsettled by the early setback and Orient continued to dominate, with Semedo firing wide after a clever set-piece routine flummoxed the home defence.
A shot from Danny Whitehead was easily saved by Alex Cisak as Cheltenham improved as the half wore on.
On-loan Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths saved well from Massey in the 54th minute but Cheltenham then had some pressure of their own, with Dan Holman missing from close range after Harry Pell flicked on a long throw from Daniel O'Shaughnessy.
O'Shaughnessy forced a good save from Cisak after Whitehead's free-kick, but Orient kept Cheltenham out until the 76th minute.
Amari Morgan-Smith fed Whitehead on the left and his cross was touched in by Waters.
