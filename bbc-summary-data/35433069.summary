[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charminster wind turbine proposals rejected by council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals for six wind turbines near Charminster have been rejected by the district council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Residents had previously criticised the plans and a report to West Dorset District Council said they would bring "significant harm" to the area.
The application had been submitted by Broadview Energy Ltd.
It was for six turbines up to 70m (230ft) in height in a seven hectare site to the north west of the B3143 at Slyer's Lane near Charminster.
The council, which was recommended to refuse the application, received 2,648 objections and 678 letters of support.
Stinsford Parish Council objected as it would have "an adverse impact on the natural environment "and would be a "visual intrusion".
A report to West Dorset council said: "The proposed development in this case would result in significant harm to the setting of the Dorset Area of Outstanding Beauty, eroding its character, natural beauty and the special qualities."
