[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bridge of Carr's 300th anniversary to be marked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Events are to be held to mark the 300th anniversary of the construction of what is thought to be the oldest bridge in the Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bridge of Carr at Carrbridge in the Cairngorms is also known as the coffin bridge due to its use by funeral parties to cross the Dulnain river.
The local community is to hold a programme of events from 19-21 May.
An exhibition of historic artefacts, a family ceilidh and live entertainment are planned.
The arching stone bridge was built between May and November 1717.
Among the reasons for its construction was the Dulnain had frequently been in spate in previous years.
In the 1690s, deaths in the area rose because of famine. Mourners were prevented from reaching funerals at the Church of Duthil when the river was swollen.
The bridge was built by John Niccelsone, a mason from Ballindaloch in Moray, at the behest of local landowner Brigadier-General Alexander Grant of Grant.
Its parapets and side walls were badly damaged in the 18th Century and again in a flood in 1829.
