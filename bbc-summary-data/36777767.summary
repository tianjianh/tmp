[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England and Wasps flanker James Haskell could be out for up to six months with a foot injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old, who requires reconstructive surgery on his big toe, is likely to miss England's autumn international series.
The injury forced Haskell out of the third Test against Australia in June as Eddie Jones' side completed a 3-0 series whitewash.
Haskell, who has 70 caps, was named man of the series.
"We're all really disappointed for James and we are all wishing him a speedy recovery," said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young.
"James' performances with England, both in the 3-0 series win over Australia and in England's Six Nations Grand Slam success, have been hugely impressive.
"Everyone at Wasps knows how hard James works to make those performances happen, and we know he'll be working just as hard to come back in the best shape possible."
