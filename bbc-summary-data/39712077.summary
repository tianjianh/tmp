[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welshman's dog shaved bald in Chinese language mix-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Welshman living in China had his dog shaved practically bald at a grooming salon after a language mix-up.

Leigh Simmons, 27, and wife Kat, from Quakers Yard near Merthyr Tydfil, live in Shenzhen.
He took German Shepherd cross Seren for a trim, but he does not speak Mandarin and the groomer did not speak English.
He mimed a shaving motion and made a buzzing sound which saw Seren left with a mane, a bushy tip on her tail and fluffy paws - but bald everywhere else.
Mr Simmons wanted to get Seren trimmed ahead of the summer and, after his charades-like display, was told by the groomer to return later that day.
He said: "I came back and saw the dog and just started laughing hysterically. I could barely stand up, I was laughing so much.
"The poor women working there were so confused. Everyone in China has a poodle. Lots of them have this style."
Mr Simmons, a teacher, paid just under Â£10 for Seren's drastic haircut. He and his wife adopted the dog after seeing it wandering the streets as a stray.
