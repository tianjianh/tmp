Kyel Reid put the Bantams in front after 13 minutes when he latched on to a pass from Billy Clarke and fired an angled shot into the far corner.
Bradford doubled their lead when keeper Jon McLaughlin parried Clarke's shot to Reece Burke, who slotted home.
Tony McMahon had a 79th-minute penalty saved by Burton's McLaughlin when Shane Cansdell-Sherriff handled in the area.
Burton, who remain four points clear of second-placed Wigan Athletic at the top of League One, came close to finding a consolation when John Mousinho volleyed Calum Butcher's header off target.
The result means Bradford move level on points with sixth-placed Barnsley and lie outside the play-off places on goal difference.
Burton Albion manager Nigel Cliough told BBC Radio Derby:

"I thought the 20 minute-spell after they scored the first goal was the crucial part.
"After that I thought we came back in to it well by the end of the first half and the second half was pretty even.
"The first goal is always crucial and we've given it away again. It was incredibly disappointing from our point of view. We've done it too many times lately."
