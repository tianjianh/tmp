Road tunnels through Birmingham city centre will be closed overnight for five weeks for "remedial works" and "structural inspections", the council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A38 St Chad's and Queensway tunnels will be closed from 22:00 GMT until 06:00 GMT from 1 April until 8 May.
Contractors Amey said the work should "minimise the number of future closures".
The tunnels were completely closed for renovation work in 2013 and 2014.
Birmingham City Council said its traffic management plans during the closures have been coordinated with the current works on Paradise Circus and the M6 Junction 6.
There will be a break in the closures on the evening of Saturday 2 May to allow for preparations for the Great Birmingham 10k Run, the council said.
The tunnels were officially opened by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh in April 1971.
