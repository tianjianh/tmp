SAS selections inquest: Soldiers' willpower 'key' in deaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A soldier who assessed candidates on an SAS selection exercise said their will to complete the march was a "key factor" in their deaths.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, of Conwy county, died on a Brecon Beacons march on one of the hottest days of 2013.
L/Cpl Edward Maher and Cpl James Dunsby also died after collapsing while attempting the same exercise.
Soldier 1B also said training prior to the test "may not have been good enough".
"I think one of the key factors would have been the determination and the willpower of James, Edward and Craig to successfully complete the march," soldier 1B said.
When asked why a logbook entry said an ambulance was called for L/Cpl Roberts at 15:40 BST but later altered to 16:00 - a time confirmed by ambulance control - soldier 1B said there was "no rhyme or reason as to why that would have been changed".
Soldier 1B said he was unaware of official MoD risk assessment documentation which gives guidance on control measures in relation to heat illness.
But he argued asking soldiers for positions on a map was an appropriate way of checking if they were suffering from dizziness or confusion - signs of heat illness.
"Having taken students through nine courses, I would argue that it is very difficult to plot a six figure grid reference on a map with a compass and then plot another six figure grid reference... I would argue it is very difficult if not impossible... if you're suffering the symptoms."
The coroner, Louise Hunt, put it to him that another soldier, 2P, presented heat illness signs to him that day, but he was allowed to continue.
"Not a chance," 1B replied.
"To put it into context, if a person presents themselves with those signs and symptoms I would not have sent him on.
"He would have had to have pointed to his next checkpoint with the corner of his compassâ€¦ then filled his water bottles.
"He never presented his symptoms to me."
The coroner said: "But to be fair, 1B, you can't remember him, so how can you be sure? I'm putting it to you that simply didn't do the assessment fully enough."
He replied: "I accept what you're saying, but I disagree. I would have done the assessment fully enough.
"Yes, they're going to present themselves tired because they have a 60lb bergen on. Yes, they are going to be sweatingâ€¦ but if someone is suffering from confusion they are not going to be able to pass that [heat illness] test.
"I say that having taken 600 students through this course in the last nine courses."
The inquest continues.
