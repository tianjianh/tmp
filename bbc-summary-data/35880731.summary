Brussels' International Fantastic Film Festival (BIFFF) is to go ahead despite Tuesday's terror attacks.

The future of the festival had been in doubt following two blasts at Zaventem airport and Maalbeek metro station.
But BIFFF has now tweeted: "Let horror only be on screen! The festival will take place starting next week."
The festival will open on 29 March as planned with a screening of Lily James and Sam Riley comedy horror Pride And Prejudice And Zombies.
BIFFF's main venue, the Bozar Centre For Fine Arts, is close to Brussels' main train station and 20 minutes walk from Maalbeek station.
The centre also posted a message on its website featuring the Belgian flag saying: "Bozar, as an arts centre that is open to everyone, attaches great importance to its fundamental values, that's why we are open since this morning. A big welcome."
Speaking before the announcement, BIFFF festival director Guy Delmote told Screen Daily if the festival had to be cancelled this year it would face an uncertain future.
"It could be the end of the festival, if we stop," he said. "If it doesn't happen this year it is going to be hard, [given] all the money we've spent already."
A number of cinemas and cultural buildings were closed on Tuesday after the attacks as the city went into lockdown.
The Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium remained closed on Wednesday, as was the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and the Royal Museums for Art and History.
The Comic Museum is one of those that is open.
