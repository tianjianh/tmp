Michelin said the £20m investment in two production lines would also "provide improved working conditions".
The plant on Campbell Road, which has 1,000 workers, opened in 1927 and is the UK headquarters for the French company.
The funding has been supported by the government under the Grant for Business Investment.
Michelin's new Remix truck tyre retreading operation at the site was visited by Business Minister Mark Prisk.
He said: "This investment is helping to protect over 400 skilled jobs."
