The 28-year-old centre-half was released by the Robins at the end of last season, having signed on at Ashton Gate in 2006.
Fontaine's arrival coincides with the departure of defender Michael Nelson, who has joined Cambridge United.
The 34-year-old joined Hibs 12 months ago from Bradford City and played in the club's last two matches.
Fontaine, who played in Scotland previously on loan to Kilmarnock from Fulham in 2005, is available to face Dumbarton in the League Cup on Tuesday evening.
While at Craven Cottage, he was also farmed out to Yeovil Town and Bristol City.
That latter switch led to permanent transfer and he went on to make 279 appearances for the Robins.
However, he spent five games back on loan from the English League One club to Yeovil last season as the Glovers were relegated from the Championship.
"Liam is a real quality signing, who will undoubtedly add a huge amount to the squad and further strengthen our defence," said Easter Road manager Alan Stubbs.
"We did our homework on him - both as a player and as a person - and he ticked all the right boxes and he has immediately bought into what we're trying to achieve at the club."
Nelson, previously of Norwich, Scunthorpe and Kilmarnock made 39 appearances for Hibs and scored three goals for the club.
