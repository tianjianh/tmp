Events on 26 March include a civic procession through the city, an address by the Lord Mayor and a special service at York Minster.
The remains of the king were found beneath a Leicester car park in 2012. He will be reinterred in the city's cathedral on 26 March.
Descendants of his family lost a legal challenge to have him reburied in York.
