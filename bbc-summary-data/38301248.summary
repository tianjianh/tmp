Venezuelans mock 'useless' banknote

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Venezuelans have been trying to think of uses for their highest-denomination banknote, the 100-bolivar bill, after President Nicolas Maduro announced it would be taken out of circulation within 72 hours.

After that time, during which Venezuelans will be able to deposit them into their account or exchange them for different notes or coins, the banknotes will no longer be legal tender.
While people will be given a 10-day grace period in which they can exchange the bills at the central bank, many fear that long queues and the sheer number of 100-bolivar notes in circulation - six billion -  will make it impossible for everyone to do so.
Twitter user @RPolicial imagined what his trip to the bank would look like.
Many suggested alternative uses for the bills. One of the most popular ones was using the notes as toilet paper, which has been scarce amid the chronic shortages of basic goods Venezuela is experiencing.
Satirical website La Patilla joked that they could be used instead of candles on the Christmas tree and set alight.
Others suggested using the bills to play Monopoly.
Some compared the short time span people have been given to exchange the notes with the film Saw (Spanish title: Juegos Macabros, or Macabre Games) in which the two protagonists have been trapped by a sadistic serial killer and must complete a perverse puzzle to survive.
