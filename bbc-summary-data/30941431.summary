Dominic Iorfa: Wolves defender proud to have his own song

Teenage Wolves defender Dominic Iorfa says hearing his own fans' terrace chant has been the highlight of his first-team breakthrough at Molineux over the last two months.

The 19-year-old right-back has not missed a minute's action since being handed his Wolves debut on 6 December.
"Making my debut was one thing," he told BBC WM 95.6. "But having the fans chant my name - I couldn't believe it.
"We were at Fulham. I heard the fans chant and I thought 'Is that my name?'"
He joked: "I always dreamed of having my own chant but didn't think it would happen so soon."
The highly-rated England Under-20 international admits that his rise to prominence has been rapid, significantly aided by his development on loan under Mike Jackson at Shrewsbury over the final seven weeks of last season.
Shrewsbury were bound for relegation to League Two, but Iorfa learnt a lot, playing in the then unaccustomed role of right-back, having come through Wolves' system as a central defender.
"I've been playing centre-back longer," he said. "But, when I went on loan to Shrewsbury, it was at right-back and it was a big step for me. You don't realise the tempo of it and playing in front of fans too. That helped me when I got my chance at Wolves."
Iorfa could not have picked a more dramatic match in which to make his Wolves debut, a 2-1 home defeat by Bournemouth, in which Wolves lost following a controversial red card, later overturned, to Iorfa's team-mate Rajiv van La Parra.
"I'd been training with the first team all season and to actually make my debut without going on the bench first was a surprise. But the manager has shown great faith in me," he added.
Since that defeat, Wolves have turned the corner, having not lost in the league since - and only on penalties in the FA Cup third-round replay with Fulham.
And the son of a Nigerian international, also called Dominic Iorfa, is now glad he made the move from his native Essex.
"I was playing for Southend at 15 when Wolves saw me and offered me a trial," he said. "My dad had played all over the world and he wanted me to sign here as he thought I'd have better opportunities.
"I like to get forward and I think I'm getting better at it. And the team are doing well, which makes it even better."
