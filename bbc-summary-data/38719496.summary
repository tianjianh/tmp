Teenagers to stand trial over Paisley murder bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four teenagers are to stand trial accused of trying to kill a man in a street attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two girls, aged 15 and 16, and two boys, aged 15 and 17, allegedly attempted to murder Gordon Friel in Forbes Place, Paisley, on 24 September.
A 13-year-old boy also faces a charge in connection with the attack.
Lawyers for the five - who cannot be named for legal reasons - pled not guilty on their behalf at the High Court in Glasgow.
The attempted murder charge against the four, aged between 15 and 17, includes claims Mr Friel was repeatedly punched, kicked and stamped upon.
Prosecutors further allege he had his head struck off a wall knocking him unconscious.
The 13 year-old is then said to have spat on Mr Friel as he lay on the ground.
The four charged with the murder bid, face a separate accusation of racially aggravated harassment towards Yao Yao and Yan Zhou in Paisley on the same day.
The 17-year-old boy is then accused of damaging property in the street.
The group - along with the 13 year-old - are also alleged to have acted in a threatening and abusive manner.
Judge Lord Burns set a trial due to start in June. The case could last up to 10 days.
