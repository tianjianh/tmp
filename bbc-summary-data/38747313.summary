[SN]TITLE[SN]
Historic sex case: Boy was 'bribed with sweets'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher at a residential approved school for boys "bribed" a pupil with sweets to keep him quiet about sex attacks, a trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dennis Young, 90, of Burton Stone Lane, York, denies committing the offences while teaching at Skegby Hall near Mansfield almost 60 years ago.
Nottingham Crown Court was told the abuse began in the 1950s when the pupil was 10 years old.
Mr Young denies seven charges of indecently assaulting a child under 14.
In a police video interview shown in court, the alleged victim said he was threatened and told that if he said anything he would be sent to a borstal.
He also said when he complained to the school's head he was told "not to be a silly boy".
When asked why he had taken so long to come forward, he replied: "To get it off my chest, I'm ashamed, I feel guilty as though it's my fault."
The trial continues.
