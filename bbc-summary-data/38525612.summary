Relatives of Nye Frankie Newman, from Guildford, said they were "overwhelmed by the outpouring of emotion and wonderful tributes".
The 17-year-old's parkour and free-running group said he was an "inspiration to the worldwide community".
It said the train accident on 1 January was not "due to practising the sport".
The cause of Mr Newman's death is not yet known.
His social media accounts show him leaping between buildings in Hong Kong and somersaulting on the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.
A statement from Nye's family said they were "heartbroken" by his death.
"Nye's was an extraordinary young life which touched so many. We have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of emotion and wonderful tributes to Nye that have been made on social media and to us as a family," they said.
All Hallows Catholic School, in Farnham, Surrey, said: "Nye was a warm, well-loved and popular member of our school community. He was a bubbly and energetic young man, always smiling with a positive attitude towards everything he did.
"He was involved in various school events, his talent was clear to be seen in his contribution to music within the school. He was a drummer, a beat boxer, a rapper and was involved in the Junior Jazz Band.
"His excellent sporting ability was evident throughout his time at All Hallows.
His parkour group, Brewman, has organised a "remembrance jam" for his friends to "get together and train for the day" in Guildford town centre on 4 March.
