[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forfar Athletic 1-1 Cowdenbeath

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals in the first four minutes saw Cowdenbeath and Forfar share the points at Station Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andy Ryan fired Forfar in front with a left-foot shot but the lead proved short-lived as Greig Spence ended his six-match goal drought.
Forfar looked the most threatening in the second half but Ryan struck a post and Gavin Swankie was twice denied by Cowdenbeath goalkeeper Grant Adam.
The draw keeps Cowdenbeath above Forfar in the table.
