Dying man's Nigerian brother gets UK visa for bone marrow op

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who needs a bone marrow transplant will now be able to get it from his Nigerian brother after the Home Office has lifted his visa ban.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isaac Aganozor, a caretaker at a top London school, has leukaemia.
His brother Patrick, who lives in Nigeria, had his first visa request refused as the Home Office thought he would try to stay in the UK.
The decision was overturned when a new visa request made it clear that Dulwich College would sponsor him.
The college, where Mr Aganozor works, said it would pay his brother's Â£1,500 return flight and offer him a place to stay.
Mr Aganozor, of Sydenham Hill, south-east London, is on his fifth cycle of chemotherapy.
Searches on the transplant register had failed to find a match.
The initial refusal letter from the British High Commission in Lagos had said Patrick did not meet the economic requirements as he earned Â£69 a month as a tricycle courier.
It said it had to take into account his personal socio-economic circumstances, adding: "Given your limited economic circumstances in Nigeria I am not satisfied that these provide you with an incentive to leave the UK at the end of your stay as claimed."
Mr Aganozor's MP Helen Hayes said the u-turn was "great news".
She said it took a "huge amount of campaigning and lobbying", which involved her contacting the minister responsible James Brokenshire, who took a personal interest in the case.
The Labour MP for Dulwich and West Norwood added the Home Office then made arrangements for the application to be dealt with quickly.
The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases.
