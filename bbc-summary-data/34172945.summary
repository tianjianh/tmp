[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to demolish an art deco cinema in Gwynedd have been given the go-ahead despite more than 300 objections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwynedd council voted to demolish Porthmadog's Coliseum, which developers said was in a poor state, to allow the site to be renovated.
Councillors also urged the applicants to consider further discussion with the community first.
More than 300 people objected to the proposals, with some saying it should be given listed building protection.
Developers said the cinema, which closed in 2011, needed to be flattened.
A council report said experts had ruled out giving the building protected status despite it being of some "historic interest".
