The O's were relegated from League One after finishing the season with a seven-game winless run.
"Season's finished, there's no more games, yet we're in training Mon/Tues/Wed/Thurs till the 24th May," Orient forward Shaun Batt tweeted.
The east London club have declined to comment.
Orient reached the League One play-off final last season but endured a difficult campaign after being taken over by Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti last summer.
The O's had four different managers over the course of the season and were relegated to League Two on the final day after a 2-2 draw at Swindon, dropping into the bottom tier for the first time since 2006.
Manager Fabio Liverani, who was appointed in December, still has two years left on his contract at the Matchroom Stadium and has stated his desire to remain with the club.
Tweeting about the extra training on Monday afternoon, Batt added: "No Family Holidays This Year Boys".
Centre-back Mathieu Baudry also posted about the extra training on Twitter last week, with a hint of sarcasm, saying: "Really looking forward to double training sessions next week."
Both Batt and Baudry were part of the Orient side which was beaten on penalties by Rotherham in the play-off final last May.
