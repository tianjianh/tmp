Ofcom has launched an investigation into ITV2's show Dapper Laughs: On The Pull.

The media regulator told Newsbeat it's looking at whether "repeated use of sexual references in this comedy series met generally accepted standards".
Last week Daniel O'Reilly, the comedian behind Dapper Laughs, said he was killing off the character.
It was after his jokes about rape and homeless people caused offence and ITV said there would be no second series.
Earlier this month Cardiff University students successfully petitioned for the cancellation of his show at their student union.
The union said Dapper Laughs was banned after students complained that he "trivialised rape, unprotected sex and dehumanising of women."
Vine star O'Reilly, whose full 12 date 2015 UK tour has now been scrapped, told BBC Newsnight that the controversy had "wrecked my life" adding it was a type of comedy he "shouldn't have been doing".
Ahead of his Newsnight appearance, the comedian posted an online statement which read: "I would like to say sorry to those people who I may have upset with my recent comments.
"I assure them that was not my intention."
Ofcom also said it has received a total of 99 complaints "in a similar vein" to their investigation about the show since it first aired.
A spokesperson referred to rule 2.3 of the Broadcasting Code which states: "In applying generally accepted standards broadcasters must ensure that material which may cause offence is justified by the context.
"Such material may include, but is not limited to, offensive language, violence, sex, sexual violence, humiliation, distress, violation of human dignity, discriminatory treatment or language.
"Appropriate information should also be broadcast where it would assist in avoiding or minimising offence."
Following the original online criticism ahead of Ofcom's investigation, an ITV spokesperson told Newsbeat: "Dapper Laughs: On The Pull features an established internet comedy character created by Daniel O'Reilly.
"ITV2 commissioned a show in which this character is placed within a recognisable TV format, a dating advice show.
"Comedy is subjective and we realise the content of the show might not be to everyone's taste.
"We regret that any of our viewers were offended. However, as with all of our shows, the series content was carefully considered, complied and deemed suitable for broadcast."
