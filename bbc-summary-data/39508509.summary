Lego Man is the brainchild of De Montfort University media student Hugh Beaumont who has used him to show-off more than a dozen of the city's sights.
The figure has visited the National Space Centre, Richard III centre and Abbey Park as part of the project.
"I thought it was a cool way to show off Leicester's sites online...," Mr Beaumont said.
The appearances are part of his university project looking at using social media to promote Leicester.
He added: "I am amazed that this has taken off in the way it has.  I really was not expecting it.
"The deadline line for the course is tomorrow, but it's been so much fun I think I'll continue with Leicester Lego Man."
"I have a friend who works at Leicester City Football Club and so I might contact them to see if I can get a photo at the ground.  It's really exciting," Mr Beaumont said.
