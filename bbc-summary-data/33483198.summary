Almost 10,000 people have signed a petition in protest at a Glasgow hospital being renamed after the Queen.

The Govan hospital was originally known as the South Glasgow University Hospital and renamed the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital after being officially opened by the monarch.
PhD student John Beattie, 32, who started the petition, described the new name as "an affront to our democracy".
NHS Glasgow and Clyde said receiving the royal title was "an honour".
The 1,109-bed facility was built on the site of Southern General is one of the largest acute hospitals in the UK and started taking patients in April.
In text appearing alongside the online petition Mr Beattie writes: "We call on the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board to change the name of the new South Glasgow hospital.
"Naming the new hospital after a monarch is an affront to our democracy. The fundamental principle of democracy is the equality of all people.
"Considering the fundamental principle of monarchy is superiority of the monarch and their family over everyone else in society, we feel the naming of a public building after such a person is unacceptable."
On Monday the PhD student told Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme that he decided to start the petition after voicing his annoyance on social media that the hospital had been named after "such an unworthy person", and found that others agreed with him.
He said: "There is already a spinal injuries unit called the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and they've called this the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
"If you go all across Britain there are hospitals in London, Birmingham, Norfolk, and even all over the Commonwealth, so why do we need another one?"
Within two days the petition had garnered around 5,500 signatures. By Friday afternoon it was 500 short of the 10,000 name target.
He and others who have signed the petition are now calling for the hospital to be renamed after a prominent figure from science and politics, with Nobel Prize winner Alexander Fleming and Scottish political activist Mary Barbour among the most popular suggestions.
Mr Beattie said that while his campaign had not been positively received by all, the support the petition had received had far outweighed the negative comments.
He now plans to put the petition to his local MP in the hope that it will be passed on to the health secretary. The next stage, after that, will be to take his cause to the Scottish government directly.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the health board responsible for the Govan hospital, said: "It was an honour for our staff and patients to have the Queen officially open three magnificent new healthcare facilities which will benefit not only the people of Glasgow but the people of Scotland.
"It is also a privilege to be given the honour of royal title for these magnificent new buildings."
