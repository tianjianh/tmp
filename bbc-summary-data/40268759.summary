World Cricket League: Scotland fall to Namibia at the Grange

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Namibia exacted revenge for Monday's defeat as they triumphed by 50 runs over Scotland in their World Cricket League match at Edinburgh's Grange.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephan Baard and Craig Williams were the principal scorers for the visitors as they posted a total of 324 runs.
The Scots' response in the 50-over game was spearheaded by Kyle Coetzer, with 112 runs, and Richie Berrington's 61.
But Namibia ground Scotland down for their first win in the competition since they beat Hong Kong in May 2015.
Openers Baard (78) and Zane Green (61) both made half-centuries, while Williams finished unbeaten following a rapid 69.
After seeing Matthew Cross (21) out off Christi Viljoen's first ball and Calum MacLeod following just two deliveries later for a duck, Scotland were left 42 for two in the eighth over.
Berrington, who had made his highest one-day international score of 110 in the last match, helped steady the ship alongside Coetzer before the players briefly went off for a rain break just after 17:00, with Scotland having moved on to 158 without further loss.
However, Berrington went for 61 swiftly after the restart when trapped lbw by Bernard Scholtz in the 30th over, with Namibia picking up regular wickets as Coetzer brought up his century and was then caught on the boundary for 112.
With 10 matches played, Scotland sit third in the World Cricket League, behind the Netherlands and Papua New Guinea.
Namibia's win lifts them off the foot of the table above United Arab Emirates as they try to avoid relegation to WCL Division Two.
