New Zealand pair Malakai Fekitoa and Sam Cane will face disciplinary hearings on Tuesday after being cited following the 21-9 win over Ireland.

Both were cited for "allegedly dangerous tackles" in Saturday's win.
Cane, who will miss Saturday's game against France because of injury, has been reported for the high tackle which ended Robbie Henshaw's game early on.
Fekitoa, who scored two tries in Dublin, has been cited for a high tackle on Simon Zebo after half-time.
Flanker Cane's shoulder appeared to connect with Henshaw's neck region and led to the Ireland centre being taken off after only 10 minutes with his neck in a brace.
Referee Jaco Peyper opted to only award a penalty, while Cane was forced to leave the field shortly afterwards with an ankle injury which will rule him out of the Stade de France contest.
Fekitoa was sin-binned for his high challenge on Zebo early in the second half but returned to score New Zealand's clinching third try in the 65th minute.
Sunday's statement from the autumn internationals disciplinary authorities said both players had been cited for "allegedly tackling an opponent dangerously".
Prior to the autumn Tests, World Rugby warned "reckless contact" with a player's head could result in red cards, leading to the expectation that referees would be more stringent when it came to high tackles.
With New Zealand players making several other dubious challenges in addition to those of Cane and Fekitoa, Ireland coach Joe Schmidt was asked about the All Blacks' physicality following the game, but opted to keep his own counsel on the issue.
"We don't control that," the New Zealand-born Ireland coach told RTE.
"We've just got to forge ahead with who we had left once once those guys had been knocked around. That's all we can do."
