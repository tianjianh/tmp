[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dries Mertens and Romelu Lukaku struck twice each, with Thomas Meunier, Eden Hazard and Yannick Carrasco on target and Ragnar Klavan scoring an own goal.
Of concern to Chelsea, however, will be the sight of their playmaker Hazard leaving the field in the 74th minute with what appeared to be a knee injury.
Henri Anier, who made it 3-1, scored Estonia's goal.
The striker became the first player to score against the Red Devils in this qualifying campaign.
Roberto Martinez's team have won all four of their group games, scoring 21 goals.
