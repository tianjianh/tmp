Concerns have been raised over a rise in air gun shootings of swans ahead of the annual census of the mute swan population on the River Thames.

The Queen's Swan Marker, David Barber, said there had been a "continuing increase" in numbers of the birds being killed in shootings.
Dozens of birds are thought to have been targeted in the past year.
The four-day swan census starts in Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey and Windsor in Berkshire on 20 July.
David Barber said the birds were easy targets.
"These senseless shootings cause horrific injuries and often death, with the injured swans and cygnets sometimes taking days or even weeks to die if they are not discovered soon after being shot," he said.
The census dates back to the 12th Century and sees the mute swans on the river rounded up, marked, weighed, health checked and then released.
This year's "swan upping" will end at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, on 24 July.
Swans are protected birds. The Crown retains the right to ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water.
Killing or injuring them is punishable by a six-month prison term and/or a fine up to Â£5,000.
