Transport for London and the London mayor have produced an interactive map showing where road traffic collisions have occurred in London since 2005.

The map is part of efforts to improve road safety awareness and reduce the number of casualties in the capital.
The latest available data shows there were 1,597 road collisions in Westminster in 2014, higher than any other borough.
The small borough of the City of London had the fewest incidents.
A total of 25,992 road traffic collisions involving personal injury within Greater London were reported to the Metropolitan and City of London Police during 2014 - a 13% increase compared with 2013.

Transport for London routinely releases information about road casualties and collisions in London, but this is the first application which allows people to zoom in on specific roads to see how many accidents have occurred there.
The map also shows when the incidents occurred and how severe they were.
It was produced using data held by the Metropolitan Police and TfL.
Isabel Dedring, deputy mayor for transport, said: "The map is part and parcel of our drive to improve road safety awareness and complements ongoing work to overhaul and improve London's key roads and junctions."
Figures released in June focusing on road casualties showed they rose by 13% in 2014 compared with 2013, but fatal injuries decreased by four per cent and serious injuries went down by seven per cent.
TfL is overseeing a number of schemes as part of the "safe streets for London" plan, including partially segregated cycle lanes, road safety and cycle training and the design of safer construction vehicles in order to reduce driver blind spots.
