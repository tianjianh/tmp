A power cut interrupted the World Cup qualifying match between Venezuela and Brazil in the Venezuelan city of Merida on Tuesday night.

Brazil were leading 2-0 when the floodlights suddenly went dark in the 74th minute of play.
The match had to be stopped for 22 minutes until some of the lighting went back on.
During the blackout, some Venezuelan fans chanted anti-government slogans and called for a recall referendum.
Officials have not said what the cause of the power cut at the Metropolitan Stadium in Merida was.
Earlier this year, power in much of Venezuela was rationed when a drought at the country's main hydroelectric power plant caused shortages.

The rationing has since been lifted, but blackouts do still occur.
During the 22-minute pause in play, Venezuelans in the stadium could be heard chanting "Maduro out" and "recall referendum".
The chants came just hours before planned anti-government protests in which the opposition wants to call for a referendum to oust President Nicolas Maduro.
The opposition says the government is leaning on the electoral authorities to delay the referendum.

The timing of the referendum is key as it could decide whether the governing PSUV party could be removed from office or not.
If the referendum were to be held before 10 January 2017 - which marks four years since Mr Maduro came to office - and go against the president, new elections would be triggered.
If, however, the referendum is held after that date and if it were to go against the president, the vice-president would serve out Mr Maduro's term.
In order for the recall referendum to go ahead, the opposition will have to collect signatures from 20% of registered voters.
The electoral authorities have set aside three days, from 26 to 28 October, for the opposition to gather the signatures.
After play resumed, Brazil stayed in the lead and the match ended with a 2-0 victory for the visitors.
