A St Patrick's Day strike by staff who work on the Luas - Dublin's tram system - has been cancelled after a partial breakthrough in a pay dispute.

The dispute has been going on for some time and previous strikes have caused disruption for thousands of passengers.
Thursday's cancelled strike would have inconvenienced thousands more who are expected to travel into the city to celebrate the national holiday.
Broadcaster RTÃ‰ said staff from three out of four grades accepted pay offers.
Luas workers will be balloted on the latest proposals next week, but sufficient agreement was reached to avoid the 17 March strike.
The breakthrough followed lengthy, overnight talks between Transdev - the private company that operates the Luas - and workers' representatives from the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (Siptu).
It was reported last month that some workers were seeking pay rises of up to 53%, which Transdev described as unsustainable.
Speaking to RTÃ‰ after the talks on Wednesday, Transdev managing director Gerry Madden said the dispute has been disastrous for the Luas brand.
