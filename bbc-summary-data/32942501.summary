[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saudi national Nahid Almanea, 31, was stabbed 16 times as she walked to the University of Essex campus last June.
James Attfield, 33, was found with 102 knife wounds in Castle Park last March.
The boy, from Colchester, entered no plea during a short hearing at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. He was remanded in custody to appear at the city's crown court on Monday.
He cannot be named due to his age.
The teenager is also charged with possessing an offensive weapon.
His parents, who sat in the public gallery, both shed tears as they heard the charges read out.
The boy spoke to confirm his name and date of birth and answered "yes" when the court clerk asked him if he understood the proceedings.
Meanwhile, Essex Police searched the River Colne, near to the Wivenhoe trail, on Saturday for "possible weapons" connected to the case.
