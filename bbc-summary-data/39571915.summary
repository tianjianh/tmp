Ulster hurling final goes ahead on Sunday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunday's Ulster Hurling Championship final between Antrim and Armagh will go ahead as scheduled despite concerns over fixture scheduling.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both teams have to play inter-county matches six days after the Ulster final at Owenbeg and Armagh were reported to want a new date set for the decider.
However, the Orchard county have said the fixture will be fulfilled.
On Saturday, Armagh play Donegal in the Nicky Rackard series and Antrim take on Carlow in the  Christy Ring Cup.
"It is not ideal and we do not have the depth of squad that Antrim have," said Armagh hurling manager Sylvester McConnell.
"It presents us with a dilemma - which competition to prioritise.
"We did not formally request that the provincial hurling decider be deferred, and we will definitely play this Sunday's match."
Antrim have been Ulster champions for 15 years in a row.
