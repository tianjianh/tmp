Sidibe, who died on Thursday, is known for his black and white studio portraits that captured the lives of young Malians in the 1960s and 1970s.
Critics say his photos of Mali's post-colonial period helped people see the West African nation in a new light.
In 2007, he became the first African winner of the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the Venice Biennale.
People on Twitter describe him as a talent whose images of popular and youth culture still resonate among young photographers across Africa.
Sidibe's work captures the lives of young men and women, often showing off a prized possession like a watch or a motorbike.
He also captures street scenes and young men seducing girls at parties with a sense of newfound freedom and identity.
Sidibe has work in several private and public museums around the world.
He became famous around the world after holding his first exhibition in France in 1996
Andres Magnin, Malick Sidibe's close friend and owner of the Parisian gallery which represented him, called the photographer an author "of thousands of images of tenderness and beauty".
"A photographer of the young generation of an independent Mali, untroubled, free, modern, full of joy and hope... He was generous, welcoming, loved by all the young people in Bamako."
