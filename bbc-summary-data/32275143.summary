A huge string of 60,000 plastic bottle tops has been displayed on a beach to highlight the problem of marine litter.

The 1km (0.6 mile) chain, laid out at Whitsand Beach in Cornwall, was made up of lids gathered from beaches around the South West.
Looe Marine Conservation Group and Rame Peninsula Beach Care were among those that collected the tops over the last three months.
The campaigners have called for more recycling of plastics.
Claire Wallerstein of Rame Peninsula Beach Care said: "We are going to take the bottle tops up to London at the end of May. We want to show them to the new Defra minister and Number 10 and hopefully the British Soft Drinks Association.
"I think plastics producers really need to start taking more responsibility for the harm their products are doing."
The British Soft Drinks Association has not been available for comment.
