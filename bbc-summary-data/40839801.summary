Peter Harte scored a first-half penalty and replacement David Mulgrew added two more goals after the interval.
Tyrone will meet All-Ireland holders Dublin in the semi-finals with Mickey Harte eyeing his fourth Sam Maguire success as Red Hand county manager.
Cathal McCarron of Tyrone was sent-off late on for two yellow cards.
Armagh had three players black-carded on what was a miserable afternoon at Croke Park for Kieran McGeeney's men.
They had gone into the last eight clash as 4-1 outsiders but were expected to give their neighbours a sterner test.
Tyrone, beaten in last year's quarter-finals by Mayo, were on top from the start with Colm Cavanagh landing a lovely point from play in the first minute and Mark Bradley quickly adding two more.
Sean Cavanagh's free and Tiernan McCann's score from play stretched the lead and, when Harte despatched the penalty, 4-1 outsiders Armagh were faced with a massive eight-point deficit.
The penalty was awarded by Meath referee David Gough for James Morgan's foul on Bradley, and Harte's reliable left boot did the rest.
It took Armagh 18 minutes to score their first point, through a Niall Grimley free, and Mark Shields and Rory Grugan also scored before the break.
But Armagh's cause was not helped by the black card issued to centre half-back Shields for hauling down Peter Harte from behind.
Tyrone held a 1-8 to 0-4 at half-time and they piled more misery on Armagh after the break.
Ardboe man Mulgrew, who had been dropped from boss Harte's original team selection, came on as a replacement and made his point with two goals.
He collected a high ball and slipped a cool finish past keeper Blaine Hughes in the 55th minute and eight minutes later raced through to net again.
McCarron's dismissal didn't matter in the grand scheme of things and, because it was for two yellows, he will be available for the semi-final.
The last four clash against Dublin on 27 August promises to be Tyrone's first real test of the 2017 Championship.
