[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool and Wycombe played out a goalless draw at Bloomfield Road, with the visitors having goalkeeper Jamal Blackman to thank for a string of late saves.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Seasiders' Andy Taylor came close to the opening goal after five minutes, curling just over from 20 yards.
Wycombe were denied by the woodwork in the 25th minute as Michael Harriman's looping 20-yard strike came back off the crossbar.
Harriman came close again nine minutes later but sent a header straight at goalkeeper Sam Slocombe, while at the other end Brad Potts met Mark Cullen's cross but nodded wide from three yards.
Wycombe started the second half on the front foot as Adebayo Akinfenwa brought the ball down and unleashed a powerful 25-yard strike which was inches over the bar.
On the hour mark, a cleverly-worked low corner created a chance for Blackpool but Potts fired over from eight yards.
The hosts almost snatched a winner in the 81st minute, forcing Blackman to produce a fingertip save to deny Cullen from 12 yards before the on-loan Chelsea youngster pushed Jim McAlister's 25-yard strike wide.
