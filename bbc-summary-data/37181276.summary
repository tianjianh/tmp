[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts have turned down a second bid from Wigan Athletic for right-back Callum Paterson.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The original offer was £600,000 but the Championship club increased this by around £100,000.
BBC Scotland has learned there is a substantial gap between this offer and what Hearts are prepared to accept for the 21-year-old.
Paterson was named in Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Malta.
He made his international debut in May's 1-0 friendly defeat by Italy and has made over 140 appearances for Hearts since 2012.
