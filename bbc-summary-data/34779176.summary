[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who shouted, swore and acted aggressively on a flight from Glasgow to Tenerife has been fined £300.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joanna Felvus, 25, from Newmains, North Lanarkshire, was warned twice about her behaviour as she argued with a male companion on the Jet2 plane on 9 July.
Both were separated and Felvus later told police she had too much to drink.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard Felvus and the man were banned from Jet2 aircraft and used another airline to return home at "significant cost".
Imposing a £300 fine, Sheriff Robert Fife told Felvus: "Behaviour such as this is completely and utterly unacceptable.
"You are right to feel deeply embarrassed - no wonder you do."
