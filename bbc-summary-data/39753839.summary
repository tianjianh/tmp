A statement by the League One club said the 25-year-old Belfastman had been suspended "with immediate effect".
"The club will make no further comment on the matter at this stage," added the Gillingham statement.
The Gills need a victory away to Northampton on Sunday to guarantee their League One status.
Donnelly, who is out of contract this summer, has scored 12 goals in 66 appearances since joining Gillingham from Swansea in the summer of 2015.
The Northern Ireland man scored in last weekend's 3-2 home defeat by Fleetwood Town.
