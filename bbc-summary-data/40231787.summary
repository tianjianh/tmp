Rashid Khan: Afghanistan spinner takes 7-18 against West Indies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan took the fourth best one-day international bowling figures with 7-18 in a 63-run win over the West Indies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old helped dismiss the hosts for 149 after Afghanistan scored 212-6 in St Lucia.
The Windies were 68-2 before Rashid entered the attack and took two wickets in two balls in both of his first two overs.
At one point Rashid had figures of 4-1 in a spell which lasted 8.4 overs.
Sri Lanka left-arm pace bowler Chaminda Vaas has the best bowling figures in an ODI, taking 8-19 against Zimbabwe in 2001.
Afghanistan's win came after they had lost the Twenty20 series 3-0 to the Windies, with the second game of the three-match ODI series on Sunday.
