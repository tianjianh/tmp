A fitness camp popular with celebrities "destroys" the peace of a hamlet, some nearby residents have complained.

The military-style camp in Heydour, near Grantham in Lincolnshire, is a regular haunt for TV stars and cast members of TOWIE and Made in Chelsea.
But residents have complained it is too loud and creates too much traffic.
The camp, which had its planning application deferred on Tuesday, said residents had been "hostile" but they were working to resolve the issues.
Team Bootcamp, which is run by husband and wife Craig and Paula Williams, opened last year in the hamlet which only has eight properties.
It offers a range of military-style training and relaxation programmes, walks and accommodation at a Grade II listed house.
Paul Richardson, who lives nearby, said: "I just think it is the wrong place for something of that nature.
"I don't particularly like seeing the group coming round the village. The building should be used for offices or something that doesn't affect other people."
Mr and Mrs Williams said they had been unaware planning permission was needed to use the site for their camp and had submitted a retrospective application.
"The noise does travel really well here and we are aware of it," said Mr Williams, a former marine.
"We do spend a lot of time and energy keeping on top of the noise and the complaints and we have stopped using music and our trainers from shouting.
"I am used to hostile environments all over the world. The feeling I get when I walk through the village is the same... it's not nice."
The bootcamp has received 27 letters of objection from nearby residents, who said music blared from the site and it affected the local environment.
Councillors at South Kesteven District Council deferred making a decision on the application to a later date. They had asked for amendments to be made before planning permission would be granted.
