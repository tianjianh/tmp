[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gerry McDonagh's third goal of the season gave Wrexham the lead after an excellent ball from Jordan Evans.
Mark Carrington nearly doubled the lead but his shot struck a post while Moore and Nathan Blissett hit the crossbar.
Moore headed wide before the on-loan debutant scored with two minutes remaining.
Wrexham substitute Paul Rutherford had a goal disallowed in injury time and Dean Keates is still seeking his first win since taking permanent charge of the Dragons.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I'm frustrated and disappointed. For the effort and work rate and the guts that we showed we deserved the three points.
"On another day we could probably have gone in at half time two or three up.
"We got put under a lot of pressure in the second half but the lads stood up to it. But two mistakes and we've conceded a goal."
