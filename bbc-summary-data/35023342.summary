GB lost their opening fixture to the hosts on Saturday, but began brightly on day two.
Helen Richardson-Walsh put her side ahead in the third quarter, diverting her wife Kate's penalty corner.
China levelled minutes later through Mengyu Wang, but neither side could find a winner.
GB earned a series of penalty corners in the final minutes of the game but the Chinese defence held their nerve.
"We dominated the game and we had more chances we just couldn't get the ball over the line and it does get frustrating," skipper Kate Richardson-Walsh told BBC Sport.
Lily Owsley - who scored against Argentina - insisted the British team would be motivated by their opening-day loss in Rosario.
True to her word, GB were the stronger in the opening exchanges, but China, who lost their opener 1-0 to Australia, were resilient.
They created few opportunities themselves and restricted GB to just a couple of clear chances until the tense closing stages.
Kate Richardson-Walsh and Alex Danson - who were making their 350th and 250th respective international appearances - both went close, but there were to be no further goals.
Reflecting on her 350th cap, Kate Richardson-Walsh said: "I'm so grateful to have been given this opportunity because this is the most amazing squad I have ever been a part of and I'm really excited about what could happen over the next nine months."
Danson added; "I can't really believe I have 250 caps and I feel so honoured."
Great Britain will face Australia in their final Pool B fixture on Tuesday.
All nations from each pool qualify directly for the quarter-finals with results in the initial phase used to determine seedings.
Whoever finishes bottom of Pool B will face the winner of Pool A, which is expected to be the Netherlands.
The world and Olympic champions secured their second dominant victory in as many days, defeating New Zealand 4-1 earlier on Sunday.
