Chris Latham led the omnium overnight but Danish rider Lasse Norman Hansen controlled the sprints to take gold, with Latham 20 points back in second.
Mark Stewart, who won his first senior gold on Saturday, added bronze in the madison with Germain Burton, despite the latter crashing mid-race.
Emily Kay finished her first World Cup omnium in 15th place.
Emily Nelson was 10th in the scratch race, while in the sprint, Lewis Oliva set a personal best in qualifying with a time of 9.946 seconds, but along with team-mate Callum Skinner, was unable to progress beyond the first round.
Jessica Varnish was pipped to second place by Canada's Monique Sullivan in the first round of the keirin, then bowed out in the repechages.
Stewart and Burton were consistent in the madison, picking up second place in half of the eight sprints to take third place on 13 points.
Burton said: "We were wanting to go for the win but bronze, we're pretty happy with."
