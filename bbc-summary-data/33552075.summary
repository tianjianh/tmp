[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chef serves up soup and sympathy for the homeless

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former homeless chef is on a one-man mission to serve healthy food to Aberdeen's homeless and rough sleepers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"My tent was set on fire. My clothes were stolen. My sleeping bag was stolen."
Louise is sitting, begging, in a shop front on Aberdeen's Union Street.
She says nowhere is safe if you are rough sleeping on the city's streets or in its parks.
I talk to her as she is hungrily eating lentil and smoked bacon soup from a plastic carton - served to her by Bobby Beasant and his friend Jerry.
Bobby works as a chef in one of the Granite City's restaurants. But spends his days off cooking and distributing healthy food to people like Louise.
I met him first at his home at Seaton, near the city centre.
As he chopped carrots, onions and celery he said it is important to give healthy food to rough sleepers and the homeless.
"They can get very ill, when they're out on the streets," he says.
"It's cold. So it's very important to offer nutritious food that's hot."
Then the portions are served out, and the containers packed into a box. And it's off, out, into the rain.
First stop a hostel for the homeless. One man, just out of jail, takes a carton of soup.
Then a sheltered housing scheme - a half-way house for people who have been rough sleeping.
Bobby distributes half a dozen containers.
Then we're off to the shopping streets. Plenty of money here. You can see it in the shop fronts. And in the shoppers passing-by.
The man who always sits near the Trinity Centre steps is not out today.
But there's a couple, begging in a bus shelter. They gratefully accept some food. And Bobby and Jerry stay for a chat.
Then there's Louise. She explains that a drunken brawl one night at the end of last year forced her out of her home.
Someone threatened to stab someone. Someone got "battered". I don't like to ask for too many details.
But, Louise says, she's been sleeping on Aberdeen's streets, and in the city's parks, for the past five months.
"I had everything, up until October", she says.
"I had my house. My wee boy stayed with me."
She says was using her past experience as a heroin addict to train as a drugs counsellor. And she was a volunteer with a project in Arbroath.
"I had everything. But now I've got nothing."
And there's a twist to the story.
The real reason Bobby Beasant does it.
"I went through it myself. I was homeless for six months.
"I ended up in the hostels. It's not very nice. You've got to fend for yourself.
"Yeah, there are people there to give you support and help you. But food-wise and that sort of stuff, you've got to do it yourself. If you've got no money, it's very hard."
And this is all happening at the same time as the subject of what homeless people eat, and the role it plays in their health, is starting to provoke academic interest.
Researchers at Robert Gordon University, and several homeless organisations in Aberdeen, have just completed their first study of the health of the city's homeless population.
It focused on access to healthcare, and how well homeless people follow the instructions doctors give them about taking prescribed medicines.
But researchers say there's much more they need to find out, if they are to help tackle health inequalities.
"We're looking, in the next phase, at wider aspects of self care. And this includes diet", lead investigator Dr Vibhu Paudyal told me.
"As well as physical and mental health, avoidance of alcohol or illicit substances, and sleep quality.
"Maintaining a good diet is really important, and particularly important for this population because of all the hazards that they are vulnerable to."
Meanwhile, back on the streets, Bobby insists he is in this for the long haul. He is already planning for the next 10 to 15 years of feeding Aberdeen's homeless.
