Bill Greaves died, at the age of 81, in Harrogate, following a heart attack.
He was the editor when the programme began broadcasting in 1968 from an old church hall in Blackman Lane, Leeds.
Harry Gration, one of the programme's presenters, said Mr Greaves was responsible for "the success BBC Look North enjoys today".
Mr Gration, who has presented Look North since 1985, was recruited by Mr Greaves.
"He was well known for his innovation, not just through news output but also the regional documentaries that have become an important part of the BBC's output", Mr Gration said.
Under Mr Greaves, Look North went on to produce 30-minute special programmes in addition to its news output.
His eye for a story led to many news items from Yorkshire being picked up and carried nationally by the BBC.
Tim Smith, acting head of BBC Yorkshire, said: "Bill Greaves was a broadcasting pioneer.
"The very first edition of Look North in 1968 was presented from a boat as York flooded. He was an inspirational leader to many and will be much missed."
