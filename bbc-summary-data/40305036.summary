A zoo where a keeper was killed by a tiger has reopened to the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rosa King, 33, died at Hamerton Zoo Park in Cambridgeshire on 29 May. She was attacked by a rare male Malayan tiger after it entered the enclosure she was working in.
The zoo had been closed since, but has reopened to visitors after safety inspections and consultation with police, staff and Ms King's family.
The tiger, named Cicip, will not be put down, the zoo said.
Visitors on the day of reopening said they felt safe but remained sad about what had happened to Ms King.
Ali Harris, 28, from Cambridge, came to the zoo with her six-year-old son Jack to celebrate their birthdays.
She said the incident did not worry her from a safety perspective as the attack happened in the enclosure and there had been no risk to the public.
Another visitor, Rebekha Dunstan, 25, from Chatteris, said the attack was "not an issue" as the tiger had not escaped.
She had visited the zoo before and had brought her two-year-old son William for a day out.
