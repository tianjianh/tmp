River Hull's £45m flood defences improvement plan agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £45m plan to improve flood defences along the River Hull has been agreed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The River Hull Advisory Board approved measures including using the Hull tidal barrier during prolonged rainfall and removing sunken ships.
Upgrading pumping stations and raising riverbanks were also recommended for the works over the next five years.
Board chairman and MP Graham Stuart said maintaining the defences was "critical" to prevent any future flood damages which could cost up to £3.4bn.
Under the plans, pumping stations at Great Culvert, Hedon Road, Bransholme, Wilfholme and Hempholme would be upgraded.
Riverbanks at low spots on sections of the Holderness Drain and Beverley and Barmston Drain would be raised.
About 20 sunken vessels have been identified by the board as "causing severe obstructions".
The board promised continued investment in existing flood defences over the next 100 years to "reduce flooding risk to residents and businesses" in Hull and East Riding.
Mr Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, said: "Maintaining the existing river defence systems is critical for Hull and East Riding as failing to make this continued investment may result in flood damages estimated at £3.4bn."
The board includes local MPs, councillors from East Riding of Yorkshire and Hull City authorities, representatives from Environment Agency, Yorkshire Water, National Farmers Union and Natural England.
