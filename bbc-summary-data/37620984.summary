[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five pillars were accessed and either had their fuses removed or circuit breakers switched off between Saturday evening and Monday morning.
Officers said the vandal "knew what they were doing".
Street lights in Newlands Road, Kerse Road, Union Road, Victoria Road and Dundas Street were targeted.
Police said the Kerse Road light was switched off shortly after 06:00 on Monday and have appealed for witnesses.
PC Matthew Newell said: "Whoever did this knew what they were doing and did so with the objective of causing needless disruption.
"They are fortunate not to have been electrocuted and put themselves, and others, at unnecessary risk."
