[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Bath boss Mike Ford is set to be named first-team coach of three-time European champions Toulon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ford, who has worked as an assistant coach for both England and Ireland, is set to start his new job on Monday.
It is understood the 50-year-old will be responsible for shaping the team's attack, defence and overall gameplan.
Ford led Bath to the Premiership final in 2015, but was sacked by the club at the end of last season following a disappointing campaign.
Former England boss Stuart Lancaster was previously linked with a coaching role at Toulon.
