Yeovil Town Ladies striker Sarah Wiltshire says she "did not expect to be back so soon", having re-signed for the 2017 Spring Series only 11 weeks after giving birth in February.

Wales' Wiltshire, 25, was Yeovil's top scorer with 11 goals in 12 league games in 2016 despite leaving in July after discovering she was 13 weeks pregnant.
The former Manchester City player re-signed for the Lady Glovers on Sunday.
Yeovil boss Jamie Sherwood described her speedy return as "amazing".
She had already quickly resumed playing - and scoring - with lower-league Cambridge before returning to train with top-flight Yeovil in April.
Speaking before the Lady Glovers' first match in Women's Super League One - in which she scored a consolation goal in a 4-1 loss to Liverpool - Wiltshire told BBC Sport: "It was always in my plan to return, I just wasn't really sure when that was going to be.
"I didn't think I'd be back so soon. I actually played for Cambridge three weeks after (my daughter was born), which again I wasn't expecting to, but I felt right and I felt good.

"I love being a Mum. I'm the happiest I have ever been. She makes me happy and even more excited to play football."
Sherwood added: "On a personal level, it is amazing to see Sarah back playing so quickly.
"Everything has been done correctly, which is the main thing, following protocol from the club doctor, making sure that she is ready.
"We know she is sharp. She is one of those players that you just want in your squad. I'm really pleased we have got her back in our squad.
"She has scored goals wherever she has been. She is a goalscorer. She knows where the back of the net is and she doesn't need two chances."
