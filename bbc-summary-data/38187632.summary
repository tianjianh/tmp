Anthony Showers attacked Karen and Jade Hales, aged 53 and 28, at the house in Anfield, Liverpool, in June, also killing the family dog.
Showers, who admitted two counts of murder, also raped Jade in her dying moments, Liverpool Crown Court heard.
The 42-year-old was ordered to serve two minimum terms of 29 years and six months to run concurrently.
The court heard Showers, of Clarendon Road, Anfield, broke into the home in Cathedral Road armed with a hammer on 12 June.
He was already subject to a court order banning him from the address after subjecting Jade to domestic abuse during their on-off relationship.
Smashing the rear bedroom window to gain entry, he killed the pet dog with a single blow to its head.
He attacked Jade, striking her in the head at least 12 times with "severe force".
He then went downstairs and bludgeoned Karen Hales, who had numerous health problems, used a walking frame and relied on her daughter for care.
A pathologist told the court that while Jade was either dying or dead, Showers had sexual intercourse with her.
He later handed himself into the police and admitted the killings but claimed the sexual intercourse had been consensual and that he had not taken the hammer with him to the home.
But the court dismissed his claims.
Following the sentencing hearing, Harry Pepper of the Crown Prosecution Service said Showers carried out a "very brutal attack" on two vulnerable women.
"Karen had poor health and Jade, her full-time carer, weighed just six stone," he said.
"Showers tried to minimise his guilt in interview but police and the CPS worked hard to prove that he was lying.
"Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Karen and Jade Hales at this very difficult time."
