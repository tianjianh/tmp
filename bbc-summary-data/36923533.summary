David Forde: Portsmouth sign goalkeeper on loan from Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth have completed the signing of goalkeeper David Forde on a season-long loan from Millwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Republic of Ireland international, 36, has made 339 appearances for Millwall since being signed on a free transfer in 2008.
Forde played just 10 times last season, largely because of the form of first-choice Lions keeper Jordan Archer.
He was previously at Cardiff and before that had a spell at West Ham, where he did not make a first-team appearance.
Forde helped Millwall win promotion to the Championship via the play-offs in 2010 and was voted the club's player of the year in 2014.
