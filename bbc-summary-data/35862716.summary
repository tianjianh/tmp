Double Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah will join more than 17,000 competitors in the 13.1m (21km) IAAF/Cardiff University World Half Marathon on Saturday.
Organisers Run 4 Wales also expect more than 100,000 spectators.
Cardiff council has issued a travel guide for race day.
Rolling road closures at Cardiff civic centre were set to start on Monday so the finishing area for the race could be built.
On Saturday, roads will be closed around the city centre from the early hours of the morning until the evening, with the women's elite race starting outside Cardiff Castle at 13:35 GMT and the men's elite and mass participation races starting at 14:10.
A Cardiff council spokesman said planned engineering work on the Cardiff and Valleys railway line - starting at 21:00 on the Saturday evening - could also affect those planning to stay overnight in the city before heading home on the train on Sunday.
"Many local services into and out of Cardiff will be affected with bus replacements in operation, diversions will also be in place via different routes and trains will start and terminate from different stations," the council said in a statement.
"Customers using local rail services during this period are advised to check journey plans before travelling."
Meanwhile, shoppers heading into the city centre are advised to use park and ride facilities and to avoid travelling between 11:00 and 14:30. Some Cardiff Bus services will also be changed.
Farah, who won Olympic gold in the 10,000m and 5,000m races, will be running in Saturday's race as part of the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team.
He is aiming to become the first male British winner in the event's 24-year history.
