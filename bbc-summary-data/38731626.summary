[SN]TITLE[SN]
Office sex dentistry lecturer struck off by General Dental Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dentistry lecturer who had sex in his office has been struck off the General Dental Council register.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Alec High "repeatedly" engaged in sexual activity between 2013 and 2015 at the University of Leeds despite being warned not to, a General Dental Council (GDC) committee heard.
He was "erased from the register with immediate effect", meaning he can no longer practice dentistry.
Dr High had ignored a warning by a senior colleague, the committee heard.
The dentist, who had refused to attend the hearing in London, lied during a university investigation giving a false account of his whereabouts, the tribunal was told.
The allegations relate to the period between January 2013 and March 2015.
On one occasion, a colleague trying to comfort a grieving student overheard him having sex with a woman who was often seen coming and going from his office.
Dr High qualified in 1966 and worked for the NHS in the North East before moving to the University of Leeds in 1981.
He was a senior lecturer and consultant specialising in the head and neck, but left the university in 2014.
At the end of the two-day hearing, the GDC committee said: "Dr High continued with his inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour even following an informal warning.
"[We have seen] nothing to show Dr High has any insight into the seriousness of his actions or the potential consequences, and he has not provided any assurance that his misconduct would not be repeated."
The GDC said Dr High's breaches of the standards of the dental profession were "serious and fundamental".
The committee said: "Engaging in sexual activity during working hours at his place of work within the hearing of colleagues, and potentially also of students, would be considered deplorable by fellow professionals.
"Further, the deliberate and calculated false account provided by Dr High during the university's investigation with the intention to mislead investigators and undermine the allegations made against him was conduct that fell significantly below the standards expected."
The GDC continued: "Dr High's misconduct, including his unprofessional behaviour and dishonesty, was wholly unacceptable and seriously damaging to the reputation and to the public's confidence in the dental profession."
