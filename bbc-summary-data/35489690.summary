Malaysia ex-diplomat convicted of indecent assault in NZ

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A New Zealand court has found a former Malaysian diplomat guilty of indecent assault and sentenced him to nine months of home detention.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Muhammad Rizalman bin Ismail will be deported after he serves his sentence.
The judge said he "terrorised" the Wellington woman by following her home in 2014 and entering her bedroom.
The former military attache sparked a furore last year when he was allowed to return home under diplomatic immunity. He was later extradited to New Zealand.
His lawyers had argued that he was mentally unwell at the time of the offence.
Rizalman had said the woman, Tania Billingsley, had given him a "signal" by smiling at him. His lawyers said he followed her home without her knowledge.
He had taken off his trousers and underwear after defecating outside her house, before entering her bedroom, where they struggled briefly. He left her home and the woman called the police.
He later pleaded guilty to a charge of indecent assault but not to more serious charges of attempted rape and burglary, which were later dismissed.
Judge David Collins said Rizalman's actions showed there was a "high level of premeditation" and that he had "terrorised" the woman.
"You mistook a smile for a sexual advance, you deliberately followed her and waited outside her home for a long period of time," he said.
"No woman should have to endure the terrifying circumstances experienced by Ms Billingsley when you breached the sanctity of her bedroom."
Ms Billingsley had waived her right to immunity when she spoke to the media about the case last year, after Rizalman was controversially allowed by New Zealand authorities to return home while awaiting trial.
His departure sparked anger in Wellington and a disagreement with Malaysia on how he was able to exercise diplomatic immunity for his exit. He was eventually extradited back to New Zealand to face trial.
A government inquiry was conducted on the diplomatic incident and the results will be made public on Friday, reported The New Zealand Herald.
