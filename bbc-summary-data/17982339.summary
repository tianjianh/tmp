The Chilgrove mosaic, discovered at Chilgrove Roman Villa, had to be moved in four sections, from Chichester District Museum to the Novium.
The museum has been built to display the remains of a Roman bath house.
Chichester residents can win the chance to visit the museum the day before it opens to the public on 8 July.
The Chilgrove mosaic will be sited opposite the remains of the bath house, which were excavated in the 1970s.
They were later preserved under a temporary car park but it was always the hope of the city council that a museum would one day stand on the site.
"The public will be able to see some of Chichester's extraordinary heritage in a wonderful setting," said Councillor Myles Cullen.
"The new museum is magnificent. It is sure to become one of the jewels in Chichester's crown.
"Not only will the museum attract local people but also visitors from far and wide. It will give a major boost to the local economy."
Novium will have about 150,000 artefacts, both on display and in storage.
"Together these tell the story of the district and the people that have lived here and influenced its development," said Novium manager Tracey Clark.
Residents will be able to apply for one of 40 "golden tickets" to preview the museum.
