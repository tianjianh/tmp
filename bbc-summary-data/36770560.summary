Wales striker Hal Robson-Kanu's wonder goal against Belgium at Euro 2016 will help him find a new club, says his international team-mate Chris Gunter.

Robson-Kanu, 27, is currently without a team after leaving Championship side Reading at the end of the season.
But he said he received offers "from around the world" after scoring what was voted the goal of the tournament.
"He's now probably got a really big decision to make," said Gunter, who played with Robson-Kanu at Reading.
"The stage it was on and not just that, but the way he actually took the goal as well probably opened up another good few doors for him."
Hull manager Steve Bruce has said he wants to sign Robson-Kanu, but believes the Premier League newcomers will face competition for his signature.
Robson-Kanu's goal in the 3-1 quarter-final win over Belgium was only his fourth for Wales, who were beaten by Portugal in the semi-finals.
He was an injury doubt before the tournament so he started the campaign on the bench, but he came on as a substitute to score the winning goal in the opening group game against Slovakia.
He then started in the defeat by England, lost his place to Sam Vokes for the wins over Russia and Northern Ireland before returning to the starting line-up in spectacular fashion against Belgium.
Robson-Kanu scored five goals in 35 appearances for Reading last season and Gunter thinks his displays in France will have boosted his reputation.
"He probably would have been alright before the tournament, but obviously he then scored the winning goal in the first game which made his advert a little bit better.
"He's is sort of a cult hero back home in Wales. He doesn't score that many goals, but the work he puts in for the team is fantastic.
"And he was another big part of why we qualified and it's nice that again somebody who is probably under appreciated at certain times of his career could get that sort of publicity.
"To come away winning goal of the tournament is fantastic and I thought it was rightly so because it was a brilliant goal."
