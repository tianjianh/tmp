Fleetwood Town 0-0 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One play-off rivals Fleetwood and Rochdale both squandered gilt-edged chances as they ground out a goalless stalemate at Highbury Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Kitching's long-range effort was the only real opportunity in a hard-fought and frantic first 25 minutes in which Dale dominated but failed to test Alex Cairns.
Ash Hunter came as close as any to opening the scoring before the break, sprinting clear with a perfectly-timed run, Ben Wilson catching hold of his low blast at the second attempt.
Fleetwood's pace up front was a problem for the visitors and David Ball might have broken the deadlock 30 seconds into the second half.
The striker kept his balance as he squeezed between Dale's centre-half pair but -having made the space to shoot -somehow fired wide of the upright.
The hosts were almost made to pay for wasted chances when Kyle Dempsey's loose touch played Ian Henderson in on goal, the forward's chip having the distance but not the direction to find the net.
Oliver Rathbone went closer still for the visitors, skipping clear of Victor Nirennold and shaving the woodwork with an effort intended to squeeze inside the back post as Keith Hill's men finished the stronger but were forced to share the spoils.
