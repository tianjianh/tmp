Newport County will not appeal against Sean Rigg red card at Plymouth

Newport County will not appeal against the red card given to Sean Rigg in the FA Cup second round goalless draw at Plymouth Argyle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rigg, 28, was sent off in the first-half after a challenge on Jake Jarvis.
He now faces a three-match suspension starting with Tuesday's League Two home clash with Stevenage.
"Chances of success at appeal are probably limited because to the letter of the law it was probably dangerous." said Newport boss Graham Westley.
But there is good news for Westley with defenders Darren Jones and Paul Bignot back from suspensions for the Stevenage game.
Westley felt striker Rigg's dismissal was ''harsh'' when compared to the tackle by Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo on Idrissa Gueye which drew a yellow card in the Premier League game with Everton on Sunday.
The Newport manager said: "I think when you watch incidents like Rojo that is red, but the official sees it as he sees it.
"Riggy will, I am sure, feel really aggrieved he is sitting out three games while tackles like that are getting away. It's this consistency thing."
But Westley added: "If I am honest he could probably do with a breather.
"He has been playing a lot of football and he has been brilliant for me since I've been here.
"He has played virtually every minute, though I left him out for a rest during the Wimbledon game.
"Fatigue can set in physically and mentally when you go through a run of games he's had and I'm sure we will have a really refreshed player when he comes back."
Newport will play Plymouth in their FA Cup second round replay at Rodney Parade on Tuesday, 13 December (Kick-off 19.45 GMT).
