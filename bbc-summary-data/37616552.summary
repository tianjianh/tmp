Called Wee Day Out, it features Scotland's famous West Highland Line railway, including the Glenfinnan Viaduct.
His stunts are performed on bridges, a straw bale and a giant puddle. It also features a cameo by his father, Peter.
MacAskill's video last year, Cascadia, was shot on the rooftops of a town in Gran Canaria.
In an interview with the BBC News Scotland website in August, the cyclist said months of preparation went gone into the new video.
Wee Day Out's soundtrack is National Express by The Divine Comedy and includes outtakes showing MacAskill falling off his bike while performing stunts.
The Ridge, a short film made on the Cuillin Ridge on Skye and released in 2014, has had more than 45 million views.
