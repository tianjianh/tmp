Owen Creaney: Murder accused called ex and said he 'killed wee Owen'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of two people accused of murder called his ex-girlfriend and told her he was going to jail for a "very, very long time" because he killed a man, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Owen Creaney, from Lurgan, was found dead in a wheelie bin on 5 July 2014.
The ex-partner of Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, claimed he called her from Lurgan police station and said he had killed 'wee Owen'.
Mr Hughes and Shauneen Boyle, 25, are jointly charged with murder.
They deny the charges.
The ex-partner of Mr Hughes, who is also the mother of his son, broke down in tears several times while giving evidence.
She said that a few days before Mr Creaney's body was found in the green recycling bin, she met the co-accused and noticed blood on his trainers.
The witness told the court that Mr Hughes, whose address was given as HMP Maghaberry, was "OCD" about keeping his trainers clean and that when she asked about the bloodstains she was told to mind her own business.
She added that on the day Mr Creaney was found dead, Mr Hughes called her from the police station and asked her if his house had been boarded up.
She told the court that he said he had killed "wee Owen" and had used the term 'I' instead of 'we'.
She also said Mr Hughes spoke about emptying his green recycling bin.
She said: "I asked him if it was anything to do with the blood on his shoes, he said 'yes'."
A neighbour also gave evidence at Belfast Crown Court and said she saw a man in Mr Hughes' house in a room that "smelled like poo".
The mother-of-two refused to look at the two defendants as she gave evidence and told the court: "I don't want to see them ones."
She said that on 4 July 2014 her family were invited over to the house, where Ms Boyle and her infant son were also present.
The neighbour told the court they had a few drinks and planned a picnic for the next day "just like everything was normal".
She said she went upstairs to use the toilet, where she heard a noise "like snoring" coming from one of the rooms.
She added that after she came out of the bathroom, she noticed the bedroom door was open and saw Ms Boyle, from Edenderry Park, Banbridge, on her knees beside a man on a bed.
The witness said she noticed a syringe in Ms Boyle's hand and when she asked who the man was, Ms Boyle looked at her and did not answer.
"She said the bedroom "smelled like poo" and that "it was a different smell, just not normal".
She told the court that when she asked Mr Hughes who the man was he said it was "just wee Owen".
He said Mr Creaney had been drinking with them and had wet himself, which is why he had been washed and changed.
The court also heard that Mr Hughes said the syringe was being used to give him water.
The trial continues.
