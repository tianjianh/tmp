Manchester United defender Luke Shaw returned to training on Monday for the first time since breaking his leg almost seven months ago.

The England left-back, 20, suffered a double fracture in the Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven in September.
Shaw's return was confirmed by United team-mate Juan Mata, who uploaded a picture of the pair on Instagram.
"My friend Luke Shaw just came in from running out on the pitch! Getting closer," added the Spain midfielder.
Shaw is still in contention for Euro 2016, according to England manager Roy Hodgson.
Hodgson wants United to allow Shaw, an England regular before the injury, to prove his fitness before naming his squad on 12 May.
However, Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal said last week he does not think Shaw will play for the team before the tournament.
Meanwhile, Phil Jones made his comeback in Monday's 1-1 under-21 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford.
Jones, who has been out for three months, played in central defence for 75 minutes before being substituted.
The 24-year-old has been picked for every England squad he has been fit for since the last World Cup.
