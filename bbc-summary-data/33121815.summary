The Belfast club's leading goalscorer is leaving Solitude for an undisclosed fee after a four-year association with the Irish Premiership side.
Gormley scored 40 goals in 2014-15, including five hat-tricks, breaking the club's record for goals in a season.
The 26-year-old had three years remaining on his contract.
"Another signing to compliment our young squad," Posh owner Darragh MacAnthony tweeted.
"Won't be a lot this summer but key ones in key areas we feel we have been missing."
Gormley, the Northern Ireland Football Writers' player of the year in 2014, joined Cliftonville from amateur club Crumlin Star in 2011.
He won back-to-back Premiership titles with Tommy Breslin's side, as well as three successive League Cup triumphs.
Former Northern Ireland midfielder Grant McCann is now assistant manager to Dave Robertson at Peterborough following a spell with Linfield.
