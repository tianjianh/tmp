Ryan Giggs could benefit from a move away from Manchester United, Wales manager Chris Coleman says.

Old Trafford legend Giggs' position is unclear after Louis van Gaal was sacked as manager.
Jose Mourinho is set to be named as the new boss on Tuesday, with no indication of what will happen to the Welshman who was Van Gaal's assistant.
"It will be hard for him to leave, but it might also give him that little bit of a spark," Coleman said.
"It would be a new challenge for him, something different and out of his comfort zone."
Giggs played alongside Coleman for Wales and has been at United since joining on his 14th birthday in November 1987.
He is club's most decorated player and made a record 963 appearances.
Some senior figures at United were known to have reservations about the prospect of appointing the controversial Mourinho, with some preferring Giggs as an alternative.
The club have made Giggs an offer to stay but it is not yet known what that role would be.
Giggs is considering the offer but Coleman believes a move away could help him prove he is a future United manager.
"He's a legend at United, but if he goes somewhere else he may find that little bit of a spring in his step," he said.
"He's a determined character and it could work in his favour coming away from something he's known for so long because you can get a bit stale.
"I'm not saying that he has, but it might be a bit of a kick-start for him."
Giggs has spent the three seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement as United's number two, first to David Moyes and then in the past two years to Van Gaal.
He was in charge as interim manager in April 2014 following Moyes' departure.
And Coleman believes Giggs is capable of making the step up and becoming a manager on a permanent basis.
"Has Giggsy got what it takes? Yes, definitely," he said.
"He's quite quiet, but underneath that there is a very determined and strong character and a person the players will like.
"He's got all that experience working with Moyes and Van Gaal, and obviously his time with Fergie as well, and could definitely do the job.
"Man United is a massive job. So maybe he would be better going and cutting his teeth somewhere else and proving he has what it takes to then go back there."
