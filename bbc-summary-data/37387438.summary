An event will take place outside the Senedd in Cardiff Bay on 29 September between 17:00 BST and 19:00.
It will include a samba band and dancers and athletes will be welcomed by First Minister Carwyn Jones and Presiding Officer Elin Jones.
Flint's Taekwondo gold medallist Jade Jones received a rapturous reception in a homecoming in the town on Saturday.
Mr Jones said the event was "an opportunity for the nation to thank these truly inspirational athletes for the joy they have brought to Wales this summer".
In Flint on Saturday evening, people lined the streets to honour the 23-year-old double gold medal winner.
Speaking after a civic reception at the town hall and before she set off on an open top bus tour, Jones said she received "amazing support" from the people of Flint.
"It just makes me go for it even more," she added.
Jones has taken a break from training but said she has her sights on being crowned world champion in May.
