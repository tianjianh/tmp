The former Peterborough boss was appointed boss of the Keepmoat Stadium side, who are currently 20th in the table, on Friday.
"This club is ready to go, there is no question about that," the 43-year-old told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"There is a good blend of youth and experience. I've had plenty of time to look at them and there's a team there."
He continued: "It has been made clear that the aim is to get to the Championship. The reality of that means this season we need to get 21 wins from our remaining 35 games.
"It's an exciting challenge and one that we will meet head-on."
Ferguson, who is the son of former Manchester United boss Sir Alex, will take charge of the team for the first time in Saturday's home match against Bradford.
He has replaced fellow Scot Paul Dickov in the Keepmoat Stadium dugout after the former Oldham boss was sacked on 8 September after taking just six points from their opening six league games.
Interim boss Rob Jones won one of his six matches in charge to leave Doncaster above the League One drop zone on goal difference only.
Ferguson left Peterborough in February after four years with the London Road side and has signed a rolling contract with Rovers.
He said he had benefitted from taking some time out of the game.
"I wanted the break and I felt that I needed it in the right way," he added.
"I went straight from playing to management and then had maybe a month between leaving Peterborough and Preston and going back to Peterborough.
"There was an offer straight after I left Peterborough and in the summer, but the timing wasn't right."
