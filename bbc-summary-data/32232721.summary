The UK Treasury uses the Barnett formula devised in the 1970s to allocate money to the four UK nations.
The system, based on population and which powers are devolved, gives more money per head to Scotland than Wales.
In a televised debate on Wednesday night, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said he would "keep the Barnett formula today, tomorrow and forever, and that's what you get with Labour".
But Mr Jones said Wales' funding needs could be met, without changing the formula.
