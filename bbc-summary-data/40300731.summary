He is also chairman of Rhyl and Prestatyn Panthers RLFC, developing the junior section, coaching at under 16, under 12 and under 10 levels.
"It's all the people I've played with and worked with over all these years who have acted as the enabling factor, which is a source of great joy and pride to me," said Mr Greenwood.
"It is a great team game, so I am above all a team player, and my debt is to all my team-mates who have supported me through the years."
