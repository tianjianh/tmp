[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man arrested after being on the run for nearly three years has been charged with child sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Carruthers, from Bury, is accused of 18 offences of making indecent photographs of a child and one of failing to surrender to custody.
He was arrested earlier this month after being admitted to a French hospital.
The 43-year-old is due before South Lakeland magistrates in Kendal, Cumbria, later.
Mr Carruthers was originally arrested in March 2014 at an address in Ambleside.
Police said a computer recovered at the scene allegedly contained 5,332 indecent images of children.
After being interviewed he was given bail to re-attend the police station but failed to return.
