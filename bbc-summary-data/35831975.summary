The three pieces, which each weigh one ton and stand 19ft (6m) tall, are the work of British artist and Turner Prize nominee David Mach.
A specialist team took fives days to install the artwork in the cathedral's 14th Century south transept.
The statues, named Golgotha, are on display until 1 May.
Sculptor Mach, who is influenced by pop art and consumerism, said: "Golgotha is my largest coat hanger piece to date.
"I wanted this sculpture to be dramatic. It is an epic, violent scene.
"I extruded the coat hanger hooks outward to reflect that and to me they seem to capture the agony of the moment."
