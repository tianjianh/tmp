The Premier League club agreed a deal for the 21-year-old with the Dutch champions last week.
He will play for PSV in their final game of the season on Sunday, then travel to Manchester for a medical and contract signing on Monday.
Depay, who has scored 21 goals this season, will sign a four-year contract.
United are understood to be paying an initial fee of £24.6m, with a further £6.5m due in performance-related bonuses and additional payments.
Depay, who has 15 international caps, played under Red Devils manager Louis van Gaal for the Dutch national team.
Van Gaal claimed United were "forced" to sign the player early because of interest from French Ligue 1 leaders Paris St-Germain.
