The 28-year-old's arrival will be subject to him being given a work permit.
Uncapped Fonotia made his Crusaders debut in 2014.
Ospreys rugby general manager Andrew Millward said: "We are delighted to be able to announce the signing of a player who has made a huge impact in Super Rugby over the last few years."
Fonotia is looking forward to playing behind a pack that includes Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones, hooker Scott Baldwin and flanker Dan Lydiate.
"That's pretty awesome for a back to play behind that, it should mean some go forward ball," said Fonotia.
"I pride myself on being a player who can break the line when attacking, as well as being strong defensively, I bring a bit of aggression.
"Talking to my mates, the Pro12 is a physical competition, direct, and it will suit my game."
