The pilot scheme will use travel operators' crime data to target "hotspots" and support transport staff.
The move, led by Transport for Greater Manchester (TFGM) and Greater Manchester Police, will see officers using body cameras while on patrol.
TFGM said the partnership will seek to ban offenders from public transport.
It said officers will also visit schools to educate pupils about the impacts and consequences of crime and antisocial behaviour on the region's travel networks.
