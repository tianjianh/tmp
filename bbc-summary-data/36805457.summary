Keith Curle: Carlisle United has selection quandaries for League Two season ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle United's pre-season friendly performances have given manager Keith Curle some selection quandaries for the forthcoming League Two campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cumbrians have played pre-season matches against Queen of the South, Kendal, Workington and Warrington so far, with four more games scheduled.
United have made eight new signings during the summer in a bid to improve on last season's 10th place finish.
Curle told BBC Radio Cumbria: "The starting XI is nowhere near selected."
"We've come though unscathed injury wise and the attitude of the players has been exceptional.
"There's been lots to look at and much food for thought."
