What makes a good mascot? We asked a monkey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mascot for the Euro 2016 in France has been named Super Victor.

He's a cartoon character boy dressed as a footballer with a red cape. 107,790 fans voted and chose Victor ahead of Driblou and Goalix.
Nearly half voted for Super Victor. But what makes a good mascot? We asked a monkey. A monkey mascot.
As monkeys can't talk we asked the man who spent almost three years inside the Hartlepool mascot H'Angus the Monkey, Stuart Drummond, what he thought.
The best mascots according to H'Angus (or Stuart): "Never takes himself or herself too seriously.
"The number one priority of any mascot is to put a smile of the faces of the public.
"They must always be ready to seize any opportunity to do so, even if it means getting themselves into hot water from time to time."
He also told Newsbeat that you can't be too shy and be a good mascot.
"The very best mascots sometimes even upstage the athletes they are employed to support."
The mascot made his first appearance on the pitch before France's 1-0 friendly victory over Sweden on 18 November.
H'Angus thinks Super Victor is confusing.
"I'm not entirely sure what this guy is supposed to be. He looks like a character out of a kid's television show.
"I very much suspect that people will be laughing at him rather than with him but with a bit of luck, he will inspire the French team to be as pathetic he is!
"It'd be interesting to see him come face to face with some of his English league counterparts as he would undoubtedly sent packing with more than just a bruised ego."
They haven't got names yet but the designers said that they are inspired by the plants and animals of Brazil.
H'Angus is impressed with these two.
"Not a bad effort by the Brazilians with these two to be fair, although I don't think a plant will be very well received in mascot circles.
"It suggests the designers were low on ideas."
The characters were named after the small town of Much Wenlock - which hosted a precursor to the modern Olympic Games, and the birthplace of the Paralympic Games, Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire.
But these two mascots received a frosty reception from H'Angus.
"I never quite understood what these two were all about.  I don't think the public particularly took them to their hearts.
"It was a good job Team GB performed so well or the blame could well have fallen on these two."
Clyde was named after the river which flows through the host city. He was designed by a 12-year-old girl Beth Gilmour from Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire.
H'Angus is a fan of Clyde.
"I like this guy and I'd would have loved the chance to have a penalty competition against him.
"Nothing would have given me more pleasure than destroying a Scotsman in front of his own fans."
The psychedelic trio live in the sky in a place called Atmozone, where they play their own version of soccer called Atmoball.
This one really wound up H'Angus. He thought he looked like a damaged sweet.
"These guys looks like half-melted jelly babies! What were they thinking?
"I wouldn't know whether to shake their hands or take a bite out of them. Ridiculous!"
Again H'Angus is not impressed with the Brazil 2014 mascot.
"A strange choice of animal for a mascot and another that has been quickly forgotten.
"Big improvements needed for Russia and Qatar."
The last time the French FA designed a mascot they came up with Footix in 1998. This guy certainly floats H'Angus' boat.
"Now this is the type of mascot that the World Cup needs in future.  Ignore the rubbish name, the French have always been associated with coqs.
"He evokes memories of a great World Cup tournament and should be inducted into the mascot hall of fame (if we had one)."
Over to the big man to tell us about this monkey.
"No mascot line up is ever complete without the inclusion of H'Angus the Monkey."
"His antics are legendary and he shocked the world by becoming the first mascot to ever enter into politics by becoming the town's mayor.
"He represents the folk story of his home town, Hartlepool, where the townsfolk once hung a monkey, mistaking it for a French spy.
"I sincerely suggest that France's latest effort, Super Victor, never graces Hartlepool with his presence or I suspect that H'Angus might just ensure that he meets the same fate as the last dodgy Frenchman."
