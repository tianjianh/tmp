[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mohammed Miah guilty of murdering 13-week-old son Rifat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been found guilty of murdering his 13-week-old son whose death he falsely tried to blame on a child with autism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rifat was subjected to "systematic" abuse at the hands of his parents and died of a brain injury on 5 July 2016, the Old Bailey heard.
Mohammed Miah, 37, of Poplar, east London, was found guilty of murder and causing suffering.
The child had 38 rib fractures, eight leg fractures and a broken spine.
Jurors also heard he had been whipped with a mobile phone charger cord and burned on a radiator.
Rifat's mother, Rebeka Nazmin, 32, was cleared of murder but found guilty of causing or allowing the death of her baby and causing him to suffer.
She told the court her husband may have had a problem with Rifat's deformed hand and ear, and may have abused him because of it.
Both parents blamed a young child with autism, who was also in the house, for Rifat's injuries.
However, their stories were contradicted in a police interview with the child in which the child told officers they had been instructed by Nazmin to shake the baby to rouse him.
The child said: "I told [Nazmin] about it and she said I should shake him or put water on him. If he wakes, he's fine. If not, I will have to call the ambulance."
The court heard the child, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, previously had behavioural problems but had been "charming" and delightful" since receiving specialist help in the months before the baby's death.
Nazmin and Miah denied murder.
Miah was cleared of cruelty to two other children.  Sentencing is due to take place later.
