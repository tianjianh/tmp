The original of Darren 'Birdie' Bird's painting showing the mascot "paying his respects" to Sir Terry went under the hammer on BBC Radio Suffolk.
Bidders included a regular listener from New York. A last-minute offer of £1,300 saw it sold to an Ipswich man, who wanted to remain anonymous.
Mr Bird said he was "very proud".

He said: "The fact that it's done what it's done, I can't put it into words.
"Every single one of those £1,300 is going to Children in Need and if that makes Sir Terry happy somewhere then I'm a very proud man today."
Mr Bird, from Ipswich, created the A3 watercolour on the morning news broke that Sir Terry had died.
It features Pudsey with a tear running down his face and his usually colourful eye patch is black.
Mr Bird's design was adopted by the official Children in Need charity and went viral on social media. It was sold on James Hazell's morning show.
Friday's Children in Need show will be the first since Sir Terry died in January.
It will feature a special tribute to the presenter.
