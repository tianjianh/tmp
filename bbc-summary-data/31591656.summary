Marie Holmes, 26, of North Carolina, bought one of three winning tickets, and will take a $127m lump sum payment.
Ms Holmes bought 10 tickets for the draw earlier in February.
She was "screaming and jumping" when she heard, she told reporters on Monday and the best part of winning was being able to provide for her children.
She also plans to give to her church, travel, finish her university degree and buy her mother a house.
"I am humbled and grateful for the opportunities this has created for my family," Ms Holmes said a press conference where she was presented with a cheque.
She said when she realised she had the winning numbers she started "screaming and jumping around".
"I said to my kids, 'You just don't understand what this means.'"
Two other winning tickets for the Powerball drawing were bought in Puerto Rico and Texas.
The Puerto Rico winner has decided to stay anonymous while no-one has come forward in Texas.
