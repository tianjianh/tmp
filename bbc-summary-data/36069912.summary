The six-song show at Cornwall beach bar The Watering Hole was an "absolute joke" and an "absolute rip-off" said fans of the rappers.
"We are absolutely devastated & extremely disappointed," said the bar which charged Â£22 a ticket.
Reggie N Bollie apologised to fans who "wanted us to play longer", but said they were booked to perform six songs.

The rappers, who finished second on The X Factor in 2015, played the Watering Hole in Perranporth on Saturday night.
Nikki Povey from Kingsbridge in Devon, who went with four friends and four children, told the BBC: "It was totally unacceptable. If you'd gone to the bar to get a drink you would have missed it.
"For some of the children it was their first gig. Reggie N Bollie have let them down."
Amie Bradshaw said on Facebook that she and a friend were "absolutely disgusted" and they were "grossly overcharged".
The Watering Hole said the pair were contracted for six songs "which many of these artists in this genre... spread out with audience interaction, that in the past has brought these performances to 45 minutes."
It said the "very quick exit" was "completely unacceptable" and offered free tickets to any Watering Hole event in 2016 "as a goodwill gesture".
Reggie N Bollie said on Twitter: "Sincere apologies to our fans who wanted us to play longer yesterday, we were booked to perform 6 songs. You were such an energetic crowd."
