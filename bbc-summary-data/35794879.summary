Perry compiled 82 in the opening frame and raced 3-0 ahead but Bingham doubled the final brown in a 58 to take the fourth before levelling at 3-3.
Bingham then won the final two frames, sealing the decider with a break of 69.
The world number two will play Shaun Murphy in Sunday's final after he beat Ding Junhui 6-3 in the evening match.
It will be a repeat of last year's World Championship final, which saw Bingham land the title for the first time with an 18-15 victory.
Bingham was always behind in a high-quality encounter against Perry, who took the seventh courtesy of a superb long pot on the deciding black, having come from 60 points behind.
A break of 97 from Bingham levelled the match again at 4-4 but Perry compiled a 53 to move within one frame of the final, only for Bingham to secure the remaining two frames without conceding a point.
"It wasn't going to plan and I just had to be patient," Bingham said. "I nicked that frame to go 3-1 - it was massive - I came in at the interval, had a chat with my manager and I went out there a bit different, a bit more determined."
The 39-year-old from Essex revealed he had been feeling unwell prior to the match and said: "I'm feeling better, still sweating up a little bit but I've been up since about four o'clock this morning. Hopefully I can have a good night's sleep and be ready for the final."
Murphy, who came from 8-2 down to beat Ding 9-8 in the 2010 Wuxi Classic final, lost the opening frame to a half-century break by the Chinese player.
World number seven Murphy took the next with a 62 and levelled again at 2-2 following a 110 which ended when he ran out of position on a red.
Ding, without a ranking title since 2013, moved ahead for a third time but Murphy reeled off four frames in succession to seal victory, including breaks of 88 and 66.
Looking ahead to another final with Bingham, Murphy said: "We're very good mates away from the table - we play a lot of golf together and we've known each other a long long time.
"The world final was one of the highest standard finals ever seen. It couldn't have been much closer and I'm hoping that here I manage to get to 10 before he does.
"I think it'll be about who makes the least unforced errors - I'd better bring my 'A' game "
