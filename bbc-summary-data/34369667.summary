The right-arm seamer, 20, was joint leading wicket-taker in Division Two of the County Championship, along with Mark Footitt of Derbyshire.
Curran, born in Cape Town, qualifies for England at the end of October.
"It's great news that Tom has been recognised by the ECB for his efforts this season," said Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart.
"The huge potential and skill levels he possesses, I'm sure will see him wearing an England shirt in the near future"
Curran took 76 County Championship wickets at an average of 23.07, and also took 29 in the NatWest T20 Blast and Royal London One-Day Cup competitions.
He will join the EPP squad in Loughborough before flying to Potchefstroom, South Africa, for a 10-day training camp under the guidance of fast-bowling coach Kevin Shine.
The fast bowlers will then join the EPP batting and spin-bowling group in Dubai for more training in sub-continent conditions.
