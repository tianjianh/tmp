Kagiso Rabada: Kent sign South Africa fast bowler

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent have signed South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada as an overseas player for a spell in June and July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old was the top wicket-taker in the recent Test series against England, taking 22 wickets at an average of 21.90 in three matches.
Rabada will move to Kent in June after playing in South Africa's tri-series with Australia and the West Indies.
He is eligible for six T20 Blast matches, two Championship games and one One-Day Cup fixture.
The right-armer, who had been linked with Durham, took match figures of 13-144 as South Africa won the fourth Test against England by 280 runs at Centurion.
Rabada also impressed for the Proteas in the one-day international series against England, taking nine wickets at an average of 19.88 and an economy rate of 4.73 runs an over.
His debut for Kent is expected to come in the Twenty20 fixture against Sussex on 30 June and he will remain at the St Lawrence Ground until their One-Day Cup fixture at Middlesex on 24 July, after which he will report back for international duty against New Zealand in August.
Kent did not have an overseas player last season, but Australia bowler Doug Bollinger had a spell with the club in 2014.
