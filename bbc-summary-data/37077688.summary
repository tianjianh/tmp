Earlier, police closed off a number of roads in the Broadmead area after the car was left outside Bridewell police station for about an hour.
Avon and Somerset Police said calling in the bomb disposal unit was part of the standard procedure and an assessment was under way.
The road closures have added to the Balloon Fiesta congestion.
Police said the car raised suspicion earlier this afternoon by a member of staff at the police station who thought it was "strange" after the car had been left there.
They also said the bomb disposal unit team had their own vehicles and equipment and while their investigation continued, the cordon would remain in place.
Avon and Somerset police said: "We're conducting enquiries to establish the owner of the car and as a precaution are also assessing it."
Road closures were put in place just before 16:00 BST on Sunday.
The roads affected are Bridewell St, Nelson St, Silver St, Union St, Rupert St & Haymarket.
Police added that cars parked in Rupert St car park can be collected.
Bus services run by First have also been affected by the Rupert St closure and diversions are being put in place.
