The planned design of a new justice centre proposed for Inverness has been unveiled.

The building is to be developed on a site between Longman Road and Burnett Road to the north of Burnett Road Police Station.
The new centre would allow the courts service to move out of historic Inverness Castle.
A public exhibition of the plans will be held in the Spectrum Centre in Inverness on Tuesday from 14:00-19:00.
The Scottish government is to fund the construction of the new two-storey Inverness Justice Centre.
The concept design of the complex forms part of a pre-planning document submitted to Highland Council, ahead of the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) applying for full planning permission.
The exhibition will show plans of office space and courtroom accommodation that will be shared by the justice organisations to be located in the building.
Two distinct wings have been proposed for the building, which will be joined by a public atrium.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said the centre would be an important development for the city and the wider Highlands area.
He said: "I would encourage the public to visit the Scottish Courts and Tribunals exhibition for the opportunity to see these exciting new proposals for themselves."
Eric McQueen, chief executive of SCTS, said: "This is a very exciting development and unique in its vision to bring together a range of organisations who work within the justice environment in the Highlands.
"We have a first class project team in place and are working with justice organisations to make sure we can provide the best environment and facilities for victims, witnesses and all courts and tribunals users, all within an accessible and high quality building which is supported by  digital innovation and sustainable by design."
SCTS moving to the new centre would allow for Inverness Castle to be developed into a tourist attraction - a move supported by Highland Council.
