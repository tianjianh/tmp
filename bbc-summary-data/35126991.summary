Louis Ross was with friends when he lost control on a slope in the Meribel resort on Wednesday, police said.
The 17-year-old was a lower-sixth form pupil at the independent Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset.
In a statement, the school said: "We are devastated by this shocking news and doing all we can to support the family during this time."
"The thoughts and prayers of the entire Canford community are with them."
The resort is the same one where former F1 world champion Michael Schumacher suffered a brain injury in 2013.
French police said Louis lost his balance and crashed into the slope during the morning and, despite wearing a helmet, suffered injuries to his face.
Mountain rescuers were on the scene within 10 minutes but nothing could be done to save him.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: "We are in contact with the local authorities and providing support to the family at this difficult time."
