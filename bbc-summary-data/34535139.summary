Planners back Allstate's Belfast office building plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planners have recommended that the US company Allstate should be allowed to develop a new office building close to Central Station in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Another firm, Concentrix, had lodged a formal objection to the Allstate plans.
Concentrix had claimed their plan to redevelop the former Maysfield leisure centre would have been negatively affected by the Allstate scheme.
However, planners say the Allstate design is acceptable for the site and area.
They said it should go ahead subject to certain conditions, mainly relating to the loss of open space in the area.
The conditions include Allstate making a cash donation of Â£2,000 a year for 10 years for the maintenance of the children's playground and open area in nearby Stewart Street.
Allstate will develop two community gardens through cash donations and volunteer time.
It will also pay Â£25,000 for a Belfast Bikes docking station to be installed at the site.
The company will also provide interview and IT skills training to people in the area
The planners said the measures will outweigh the loss of a portion of public open space.
The application is due to be decided by Belfast City Council planning meeting next week.
