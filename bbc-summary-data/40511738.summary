Jack Hendry: Dundee recruit centre-half on two-year deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee have signed central defender Jack Hendry on a two-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old left Partick Thistle in 2015 to join Wigan Athletic after just five first-team appearances for the Jags.
He spent time on loan with MK Dons last season after a spell at Shrewsbury Town in the previous campaign.
Hendry was on a four-year contract at Wigan but has negotiated an early release to kick-start his career back in Scotland.
