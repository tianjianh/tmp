Ireland wing Keith Earls is a doubt for Saturday's Six Nations game against England because of a tight groin.

The Munster man was unable to take part in squad training on Monday or Tuesday but has not yet been ruled out of the match at the Aviva Stadium.
"We're giving him a bit of time," said scrum coach Greg Feek, who indicated that Earls should be able to take a full part in training on Thursday.
Johnny Sexton and Conor Murray are both set to be fit for the Dublin encounter.
Both Irish half-backs trained on Tuesday, despite picking up injuries in the 22-9 defeat by Wales in Cardiff on Friday.
Scrum-half Murray sustained a shoulder injury while fly-half Sexton suffered a head knock but was not concussed.
Sexton was taken off for a head injury assessment and returned after clearing the medical tests.
Flanker Tommy O'Donnell sat out Tuesday's session with some quad tightness but, like Earls, is likely to return to action on Thursday.
Wing Tommy Bowe has been ruled out of the match with England after suffering a suspected broken leg against Wales.
Ireland's hopes of a third Six Nations title in four years were ended at the Principality Stadium last weekend.
Joe Schmidt's team stayed in second spot but eight points behind England, who are aiming for back-to-back Grand Slams.
