But beyond the enjoyment of elite-level competition, these events are equally important in providing inspiration and a legacy for grassroots sport.
Women's Sport Week (19-25 June) provides a platform for governing bodies to boost female participation across all age ranges and abilities, so here are seven ways you can get involved...
The Football Association's SSE Wildcats initiative has created 200 clubs throughout the UK aimed at girls aged 5-11 in its bid to double participation in football from that age group by 2020.
The clubs run weekly sessions with FA-qualified coaches at local facilities which can be searched for at www.thefa.com/forgirls.
Karen Carney, an ambassador for the scheme who played 128 times for England, said: "I attended a similar FA initiative as a child and that was when I first fell in love with football.
"Hopefully the girls will get the same enjoyment I did and stay involved in the game for years to come."
The Women's Cricket World Cup starts on 24 June, with hosts England taking on India in Derby.
Meanwhile, at grassroots level, governing body the ECB has organised a series of events for women this summer across the UK, introducing beginners to the game with 'soft ball' cricket (as opposed to softball the sport).
They are designed to be fun, fast, social games with no specialist equipment or clothing required and are a key part of the ECB's plans to continue to make the sport accessible for all.
Clubs can register to receive soft ball cricket kit, here, while you can search for a soft ball cricket festival near you with the ECB's club finder.
The Women's Rugby World Cup (9-26 August) is split between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with the group stage taking place in Dublin and the knockout matches, including the final, all being played in Belfast.

In the build-up to the tournament, WISPA (Women in Sport and Physical Activity) and Ulster Rugby have teamed up to offer a Get Fit Women's Boot Camp at Girdwood Community Hub in Belfast.
The sessions - hosted by qualified fitness instructors - cost Â£1 and are open to women aged 16 and over. They focus on physical and rugby activities in a fun and positive environment and no experience of playing rugby is necessary.
To sign up for sessions on Monday 26 June and/or Monday 3 July (6-7pm), call WISPA on 02890 314298 or email wispa.co@btconnect.com
Since 2010, more than 60,000 women have taken part in Back to Netball sessions, an initiative from English Netball to bring back women who may have played the game at school, or those who have never played but want to give it a go.
Useful links
The sessions are run by passionate and enthusiastic coaches, with sessions covering the basics of the game including passing, footwork and shooting and finishing with a friendly game to put the skills you have learned into practice.
To find a session near you, use the netball finder and you can also have a look at stories and testimonials from some of those involved.
Talking of throwbacks to your school days, how about a game of rounders? Governing body Rounders England has a map to find clubs and leagues near you. And if you don't live near any of these, all you need is a bat, ball, some friends to play with and a bit of open space and you can set up a game.

Since the start of the year, former Fed Cup captain Judy Murray has been heavily involved in a Lawn Tennis Association initiative called She Rallies, which aims to increase the proportion of female coaches in the UK (previously only 30%), delivering sessions specifically for girls and women to drive up participation and retention in the sport.
If you want to join in, check out courses near you with She Rallies course finder.

And if you run activities yourself as part of a club or community groups, you can sign up as a partner and add activities to the list as you schedule them.
