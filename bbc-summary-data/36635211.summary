Welsh football is set for a bumper financial legacy thanks to the success of the national team at Euro 2016.

Wales' progress to the quarter finals has netted the Football Association of Wales 14m euros (£11.3m) in prize money so far.
It will get another 4m euros (£3.2m) if Chris Coleman's side make it through to the semi-finals with a win on Friday.
It is big money for the relatively small FAW, which made a profit of £20,000 last year.
Chief executive Jonathan Ford told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme that tournament progress had been "an absolute dream come true."
"It has gone beyond my dreams, it has gone beyond the nation's dreams. Wales - wow - through to the last eight in Euro 2016," he added.
The FAW will have to spend some of the prize money on hotels and transportation, staffing costs and player bonuses, but it will invest the rest in the sport itself.
"It is the job of the FAW to develop, promote and protect Welsh football," said Mr Ford.
"And what better way than to see our team play at the highest level in Europe.
"It certainly helps as far as achieving the objectives we set ourselves in our strategic plan and what we are now really able to do is to achieve those objectives more quickly and better than we would have without the team having qualified."
The tournament is the first time Wales have qualified for a major finals in 58 years and the side have now matched the achievement of the 1958 World Cup team which reached the last eight and lost 1-0 to eventual winners Brazil.
When asked if Welsh qualification was the new norm, Mr Ford replied: "I certainly hope so. We have got to look at this in a consistent way.
"It is not about one qualification, but doing it in a consistent fashion.
"Let's hope that after this - and we do not want this to end any time soon - we can concentrate on World Cup 2018 and see our way to Russia as well."
In a real "absolute dream" scenario Wales would pick up another 8m euros (£6.4m) if they went on to become European champions.
Participation in tournament - 8m euro (£6.4m)
Each win in the pool stages - 1m euro (£812,000)
Reach last 16 - 1.5m euro (£1.2m)
Reach quarter finals - 2.5m euro (£2m)
Reach semi finals 4m euro (£3.2m)
Champions 8m euro (£6.4m)
