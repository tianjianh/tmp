English subtitles call for all S4C TV output

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former S4C executive has called on the Welsh language broadcaster to display English subtitles automatically on all its programmes.

Tweli Griffiths told BBC Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf the move would be inclusive and could attract more viewers.
He said the idea has been prompted by the "continuing decline in the number of Welsh speakers".
S4C said the idea was "interesting" and it provided subtitles for more than 78% of its current programme output.
Mr Griffiths, who spent two years as a commissioner for factual language programming at S4C, called on the broadcaster to follow the example of a Gaelic language channel where English subtitles were included automatically on screen for all programmes.
He also said it was time for Welsh speakers to "adopt measures that will attract more people who don't speak the language to show an interest and be entertained by it".
He added: "In Ireland, there is a different philosophy. It's not just a channel for Irish speakers. It is for the whole population. That's the kind of message we need to get across here in Wales."
Rachel Evans, S4C deputy director for content and broadcasting, said: "We haven't received feedback that the audience want to see automatic subtitles on screen, and we have no plans at the moment to introduce them.
"During 2014-15, subtitles were available for 78.05% of our programmes, on both our TV and online platforms, and we provide subtitling on screen for a number of our repeats e.g. dramas."
