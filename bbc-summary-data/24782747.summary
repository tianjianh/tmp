Bishop gave his side the lead with a header from Neil Ashton's cross before adding a second after good play by Brett Ormerod.
Ex-Wrexham striker Jake Speight scored from the spot after Stephen Wright's foul on John Akinde.
Jay Harris settled nerves with a volley after Ross Atkins saved Ormerod's shot.
Kick-off at the Racecourse was delayed for 20 minutes after the Alfreton team bus was held up in traffic.
Wrexham player-manager Andy Morrell told BBC Radio Wales:
"I thought we were good today - it's been the best we've been for quite a while and it starts from the start.
"We start the game right, keep the ball right, nullify their threats and when we keep the ball and pass and move we're a half decent team.
"I thought we thoroughly deserved it today."
