The ex-Carlisle academy player joined Huddersfield in July 2015, and has left after one goal in 24 games.
"His displays for us haven't gone unnoticed," chairman Andy Pilley said.
He told the club website: "This is a huge signal of intent for Fleetwood Town to be able to sign a player of Kyle's calibre on a permanent basis."
