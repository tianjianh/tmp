"Ian has been a massive part of the one-day and T20 side in recent times," said head coach Richard Dawson.
Cockbain, 29, made his first-class debut for Gloucestershire in April 2011, after three seasons on the MCC Young Cricketers' programme at Lord's.
He was briefly appointed county captain in 2015 when Geraint Jones stood down.
He then got injured in a pre-play net session at the Cheltenham Festival, breaking his wrist, but he recovered to have a successful time in the T20 Blast in 2016.
He was the country's third highest run scorer, with 499 runs, at an average of 55.44, but struggled to make runs in the One-Day Cup with 119 in seven matches, and made just four County Championship appearances.
Bootle-born, he is the son of former Lancashire and Cheshire opening batsman Ian Cockbain Sr.
Gloucestershire had Gareth Roderick as four-day captain last season, while Australian Michael Klinger skippered them in white-ball cricket.
