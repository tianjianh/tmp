The 30-year-old, who can also play as a winger, had been with the Robins since January after a spell in Sweden.
The former Coventry, Northampton and Oxford man made 16 appearances for Cheltenham - the last of which was a 6-1 defeat by Portsmouth on 6 May.
"Liam is a player who has done the business at a far higher level," said Torquay manager Kevin Nicholson.
