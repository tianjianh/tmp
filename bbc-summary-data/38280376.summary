The 26-year-old Scot finished in 42.734 seconds, ahead of second-placed Arianna Fontana of Italy (42.835secs).
On Saturday, she won gold in the first of two 500m events in 43.590 seconds.
Shanghai is the third World Cup event of six to be held over 2016-17, with the next taking place in Gangneung, South Korea, from 16-18 December.
Christie, who also won gold in the season-opening event in Calgary, Canada in November, leads the women's 500m overall rankings from Fan Kexin of China and Canadian Marianne St-Gelais.
She also broke the 500m world record in a quarter-final at the second World Cup in Salt Lake City, USA but fell in the final.
