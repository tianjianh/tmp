Congestion, which began to build up on major routes on Friday afternoon, has increased steadily and is expected to ease late on Saturday afternoon.
This weekend is traditionally one of the busiest of the year with some 16 million cars expected on the roads.
The weather for the bank holiday is set to be a mix of sunshine and showers, according to the BBC weather centre.
Graham Smith, of AA Roadwatch, said the traffic was "horrendous", and was particularly heavy around the M25 west of London, the A303 and the M5 through Somerset, along with the M6 north of Birmingham and parts of the M1 and A61.
In the build-up to the bank holiday, about 340 miles of roadworks were completed or suspended to help ease congestion.
