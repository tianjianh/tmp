Samora Roberts, 34, known as "Black Dee", was also convicted of two counts of possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply and possession of heroin.
Roberts, of James Turner Street, was cleared of a separate offence of having a small amount of ammunition.
She will be sentenced on 11 January.
Roberts was granted bail at Birmingham Crown Court ahead of sentencing,
Her co-accused and neighbour, Tina Thomas, 47, who had denied a single offence of possessing .38 calibre bullets, was found not guilty of that offence.
A third man, Marvin Scott, 38, who formerly lived in the street but has since moved, was convicted of having crack cocaine with intent to supply and of possession of cannabis.
The jury of five men and seven women took four and a half hours to reach verdicts on the offences, which all took place around June 2013.
Judge Philip Parker said: "I make it plain you'll face custodial sentences. You've kept your bail and I will bail you for sentence on that particular day.
"Bail is no indication as to the ultimate sentence."
Roberts told Judge Parker as she left the dock: "Thank you, your honour," amid outbursts from her supporters in the public gallery.
Jurors had been selected from those who had never watched the Channel 4 reality TV show Benefits Street in January 2014, which focused on the day-to-day lives of the residents of Birmingham's James Turner Street.
