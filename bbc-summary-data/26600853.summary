It started at about 04:20 GMT in St Peters Way, in the Bishopton area, Warwickshire Fire Service said.
Five crews tackled the blaze, which spread through the roof space.
"The crews have worked hard and they've contained it to two properties overall," incident commander Mark Scrooby said.
"Now we're working with the police, ambulance and of course fire investigators to bring it to an early and safe conclusion."
The nearby Birmingham Road was closed in both directions as a result of the fire.
