Danny Gabbidon believes his former boss Neil Warnock is the perfect man to lift Cardiff City.

The Bluebirds sacked Paul Trollope and 67-year old Warnock is the club's top target to replace him.
"Knowing Neil personally and working under him, I know what he is about. He could be a nice fit to come in and get the team up and running quickly," Gabbidon said.
"This Cardiff job is a difficult job, it's not suited to everyone."
"You have to have the right personality and the right credentials."
Gabbidon, who was signed by Warnock in June 2011, feels his experience would make him a good fit at a good time for the Championship strugglers, who have won just twice in 11 games.
"You need a manager who can go in there and get that team performing and he could be someone who could do that," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"He's a very good man-manager, he's good at working on a tight budget and getting the right players in.
"Working under him at QPR, I know the kind of person Neil is, the kind of manager he is.
"He's also proven in that division to get the best out of teams and get them out of that division.
"It's not just about bringing in a coach who will be good on the training ground, it's about bringing in a personality who can lift the players and lift the spirits of the players."
The former Cardiff and West Ham defender felt the club had to act to remove Trollope.
"I don't think anyone can argue with the decision to sack Paul," he said.
"Results have not been good and performances have not been good either.
"I am hardly surprised by the decision. He has tried to put his stamp on things and it has not worked.
"He's not been getting enough out of the players. With the squad they've got there they should not be sitting towards the bottom of the league."
Under Trollope Cardiff won just two games all season and are just one place off the bottom of the Championship.
Cardiff see their next Championship action on 14 October when Bristol City travel to the Welsh capital.
"If Neil Warnock came in he would relish the Bristol City game and it could be a catalyst for the season," Gabbidon said.
