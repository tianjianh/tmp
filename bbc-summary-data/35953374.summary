The 25-year-old, fighting in his home city of Liverpool, needed only one minute and 41 seconds to defeat his French opponent.
The result leaves Smith with a perfect record of 19 wins from 19 bouts and he is now in with a chance of a WBC world-title fight.
Promoter Eddie Hearn called Smith a "scary, scary man".
He told Sky Sports: "The man's going to dominate the super middleweight division for years to come."
Smith also beat Rocky Fielding with a first-round knock-out to win the British title in November.
He said after his victory over Mohoumadi: "I've always claimed I'm not a big puncher but my record suggests different now. I believe that when I get in the changing room and get the gloves on I can hurt anyone in the world."
