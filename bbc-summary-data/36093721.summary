[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent's outgoing high-profile police and crime commissioner (PCC) has said she is proud of her achievements four years after being elected.

Ann Barnes dealt with an "ill-advised" TV documentary, a probe into her car insurance, and youth commissioners who both had to step away from their role.
But she said she judged her time as PCC as a success.
She said Kent Police was now target-free, provided quality service and put victims at the heart of its work.
"Apart from one or two things I'd rather not have happened, I've really, really had a good time," she said.
Referring to incidents that led to adverse headlines, she said: "You have to accept what life throws at you and deal with it."
Mrs Barnes, who is not standing for re-election, said the Kent force was recognised nationally after latest HMIC reports.
"[Kent Police] genuinely puts victims at the heart of what it does. There are no targets, people don't chase targets. They just look to do a quality service," she said.
On her youth commissioner appointments, Mrs Barnes said: "You can't interview for the unexpected."
Kent's first youth commissioner Paris Brown resigned over comments she had posted on Twitter, and Kerry Boyd had to stop public engagements while reports of a relationship were investigated.
Mrs Barnes said Ms Brown handled things well after making mistakes when younger, and Ms Boyd did a good job and could have continued but turned down an extended contract.
After Ms Boyd left, the youth commissioner was not replaced.
Mrs Barnes said she was most proud of Kent Police's "open and transparent" culture.
And she said a new victim centre was providing "a wraparound service" to victims and witnesses, and she believed it would become a blueprint for delivering victims' services.
Voting for Kent's next PCC will take place on 5 May, with six candidates standing.
