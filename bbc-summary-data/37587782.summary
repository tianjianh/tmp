More than 12,000 people are expected at the Ordination Mass of Fr Joseph Srampicka, which begins at 13:30 BST.
Pope Francis created the new diocese - or eparchy - in July, making it one of only three worldwide.

It reopened to serve an Indian branch of the Roman Catholic Church.
Twenty-five bishops and more than 200 priests and many nuns will attend the service, with people expected from Australia, Canada and South America.
The Indian community are from the Syro Malabar Rite, which claims to have been founded by St Thomas The Apostle in India and is one 22 Eastern Catholic Churches in unity with the Pope.
St Ignatius was built in 1836, seven years after the legalisation of Catholicism in England, and was staffed by the Jesuit Order.
