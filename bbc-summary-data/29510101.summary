Reza Beluchi, 42, built himself a "Hydro Pod", a huge plastic bubble powered using his legs.
His aim was to travel over 1,000 miles - across water - from the USA to the island of Bermuda.
But unfortunately he fell short due to exhaustion, just 70 miles into his adventure.
The human hamster had to call the local coastguard and ask to be rescued.
Watch Jenny's report for more on bubble man.
