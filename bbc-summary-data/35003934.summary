Glasgow Warriors v Leinster postponed due to severe weather

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors' Pro12 match against Leinster has been postponed due to severe weather conditions.

Heavy rain overnight on Friday which continued into Saturday rendered the pitch at Scotstoun unplayable.
The postponement creates something of a fixture headache for Warriors.
They have already had to squeeze their rearranged Champions Cup fixture against Racing 92 into an already packed calendar, and may now need to face Leinster on a midweek date.
"The pitch at Scotstoun Stadium is unplayable due to surface water and there is a concern for both players and supporters safety given the adverse weather conditions," a Warriors statement said.
Several Scottish football fixtures have also fallen victim to the weather.
