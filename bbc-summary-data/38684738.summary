Oakland Raiders: NFL team apply to move to Las Vegas in 2020

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
NFL team Oakland Raiders have applied for relocation to Las Vegas in 2020.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Raiders plan to move from the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum to a proposed 65,000-seater stadium which is expected to cost $1.9bn (Â£1.54bn).
Relocation to the USA's famous gambling destination must be approved by three-quarters of NFL team owners (24 of 32).
The Raiders extended their lease on their current stadium by a year for the current season and will remain there until they move.
The NFL website states that owners will vote on the team's relocation proposal at a meeting in March.
