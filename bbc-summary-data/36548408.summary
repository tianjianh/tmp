Fraud agent breaks payback order

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A financial agent who took thousands of pounds by fraud has breached her community payback order by failing to carry out 180 hours unpaid work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lorna Waddell, 41, of Kelso, previously admitted obtaining nearly Â£4,000 by fraud while working for Provident Financial Management Services Ltd.
She was given unpaid work as an alternative to custody.
Jedburgh Sheriff Court was told she had breached her payback order. Sentence was deferred until 11 July for reports.
Waddell got five clients to sign loan applications, saying she would receive the capital and repay the loan instalments, in Kelso between February 2012 and February 2013.
However, after receiving the cash no payments were made.
She also admitted that while acting as an agent for the same company she embezzled nearly Â£700 at her home between November 2012 and March 2013.
