[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 4-0 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kyle Vassell scored twice and helped create two others as Blackpool moved to within a point of the play-offs with a win over 10-man Notts County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Seasiders, who have lost just once at home in all competitions this season, took the lead after 20 minutes as Vassell picked up the loose ball and slotted past Adam Collin from 12 yards.
Jamille Matt then rounded Collin, but somehow placed the ball wide of the post.
But Gary Bowyer's side did double their lead three minutes after half-time, as Vassell's shot from 12 yards was parried as far as Colin Daniel, who tapped into the empty net.
The hosts had another four minutes later, as Matt made amends for his earlier miss by thumping home from 10 yards after Vassell's deflected shot broke his way.
Notts County's misery was compounded when Vadaine Oliver was shown a straight red after 79 minutes for a tackle on Tom Aldred.
The rout was completed on 87 minutes as Vassell robbed Louis Laing of possession and placed it past Collin for his 10th goal of the season.
