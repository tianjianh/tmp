Marc-Antoine Fortuné set up on-loan Newcastle United striker Armstrong to fire home left-footed on 26 minutes.
Fortuné then converted a penalty on the stroke of half-time after being brought down by Nat Knight-Percival.
Armstrong added his second when he was set up by Reda Johnson for a left-foot shot midway through the second half.
Tony Mowbray's Coventry, still unbeaten at home this season, climb to fifth, just three points shy of an automatic promotion place.
Shrewsbury, unbeaten in their first four away league matches, are now kept out of the relegation zone only on goal difference after a second successive defeat on the road.
Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"It is satisfying. We did a fair bit of work on that during the week.
"It's an important win, a performance that hopefully gives everybody confidence and keeps the crowd on board.
"We hopefully are going to keep the consistency and the confidence levels high, but we warranted a victory.
"We should enjoy it and then get back to work on Monday and then try and go to Yeovil and get through to the next round of the JPT."
Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"It is a disappointing scoreline against a difficult side. They looked like one of the better sides we will come up against this season.
"We know we can be better but it's funny against teams like this. You know when you have a lapse of concentration they will punish you.
"When you lose a goal so close to half time, it is really disappointing. We have given away far too many penalties this season. We need to show a bit more composure in the area.
"We always know we have a chance, even when three down. You can't say that effort levels weren't good enough but we lack that bit of quality."
