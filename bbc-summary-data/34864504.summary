The Australian, 55, finalised the details of his appointment with Rugby Football Union chief Ian Ritchie during a meeting in London on Thursday.
Former Australia and Japan coach Jones had needed to secure his release from a "long-term contract" with South African franchise the Stormers.
Jones succeeds Stuart Lancaster, who left the job after England's failed 2015 World Cup campaign.
Former England captain Steve Borthwick could be brought in as part of Jones' coaching team. He is under contract as forwards coach at Bristol and worked with Jones at Saracens and Japan.
Jones has been the frontrunner from the beginning of the recruitment process and will be among the highest paid rugby coaches in the world.
South African Jake White - who brought in Jones as a consultant during his World Cup winning campaign with the Springboks in 2007 - had also been under consideration.
However, White said on Thursday: "I have a contract with Montpellier. I'm not going to change, I'm staying here."
Jones was only appointed as the new Stormers head coach in September after leading Japan to the World Cup in England, during which they recorded a famous victory over South Africa in the pool stage.
He fits Ritchie's desire to appoint a man with "proven international experience".
The RFU are keen to have a core of English assistants working under Jones.
As well as Jones and White, Wales coach Warren Gatland had been linked with the role, although the New Zealander insisted he is committed to honouring his contract, which runs until 2019.
However, former Australia international David Campese said a foreign coach makes England look "desperate".
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, he said: "Don't you want an Englishman to coach an English team and win the World Cup?
"It obviously shows that after the World Cup you guys are lost. You've got all the money in the world - and all the players - and you've still got no idea how to play the game."
Age: 55
Nationality: Australian
Current position: Head coach of South African Super Rugby side Stormers, who he joined after coaching Japan at the World Cup.
Credentials: Guided Japan to a stunning victory over South Africa in their opening 2015 World Cup match. Led Australia to the 2001 Tri-Nations title but was beaten by England in the 2003 World Cup final. Played an advisory role in South Africa's 2007 World Cup triumph.
