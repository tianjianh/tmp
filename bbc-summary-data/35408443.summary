Glencoe Mountain, Lecht, Glenshee, Nevis Range and CairnGorm Mountain all report not having enough snow for skiing or snowboarding.
The resorts' operators said they were hoping for a return of wintry conditions soon.
Earlier this month, all five centres were able to open runs following heavy snowfalls and freezing temperatures.
Temperatures have been rising over the past few days,
CairnGorm Mountain, near Aviemore, said it has had heavy rain, winds gusting to 100mph and a temperature of 3C.
On its website Glenshee Ski Centre said: "The ongoing thaw has done a lot of damage.
"With the mild weather set to continue for a couple of days we will be closed for snowsports until we get more snow."
Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) has also reported thawing conditions in the hills.
The service provides forecasts of avalanche risk for Torridon, Glen Coe, Northern Cairngorms, Southern Cairngorms, Lochaber and Creag Meagaidh.
