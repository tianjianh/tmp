Jones-Bishop's score came with Wakefield momentarily down to 11 men.
The hosts led 24-6 at the break, with tries from Matty Ashurst, Tom Johnstone and two from Craig Hall, while Joe Westerman responded for Wolves.
Ashurst went in again, only for Wolves to hit back with four unanswered tries before Jones-Bishop sealed victory.
Wakefield's sixth win in seven league games since Chester took over in March moves them up to sixth in the table.
Jones-Bishop's crucial score came two minutes from time, with two Wildcats, Anthony England and Danny Kirmond, in the sin-bin.
It was a dramatic and tense finish as Kirmond was shown a yellow card with five minutes remaining for a high shot on Morgan Smith, while England and Warrington's Kurt Gidley were sin-binned in the 68th minute for fighting.
Jones-Bishop himself was sin-binned earlier in the second half and Matthew Russell took full advantage for Warrington, running in the third of the visitors' second-half tries after Daryl Clark and Gidley crossed to revive Wire's hopes.
While Smith converted a second try from Westerman to get the visitors to within four points of Wakefield, Liam Finn's 12 points from the boot - including a second-half penalty - before that late Jones-Bishop try helped them move into the top half of the table.
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester: "I wasn't particularly confident with five minutes to go but we defended very well and deserved the win.
"I thought it was a very courageous performance. The amount of possession Warrington had in the second half really hurt us but my boys kept turning up for each other.
"We were very good without the ball in the last five or 10 minutes. I'm proud of the guys, it was the most spirited and courageous performance from a group of players I've seen in a long time."
Warrington coach Tony Smith: "The first half hurt. They started really enthusiastically and cashed in on a couple of our errors.
"We left ourselves a fairly hefty hill to climb up and we nearly got to the top and had a look over the other side.
"We had an opportunity to get our noses in front but it was not meant to be. We had a few boys off their best today."
