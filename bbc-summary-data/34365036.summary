Now five weeks old and weighing 3lbs (1.3kg), he was officially named by US First Lady Michelle Obama and Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan.
The name is pronounced "Bay Bay" and when combined with his two-year-old sister's name, Bao Bao, means "precious treasure".
The women revealed the name in both English and Mandarin, accompanied by third-graders from a DC school.
Mrs Obama said her family loves the zoo while Ms Peng said the pandas are a way to bond the two countries together.
Bei Bei turns five weeks old on Saturday. His twin died four days after its birth to their mother Mei Xiang.
