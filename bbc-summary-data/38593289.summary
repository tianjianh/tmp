Roger Smith, 46, was concerned about an attack similar to that on Fusilier Lee Rigby, Nottingham Crown Court was told.
Smith was found guilty in November of two counts of having explosive substances and of possessing a document for terrorist purposes.
The court heard Smith saw himself as a "crusader against Muslims".
The document charge related to a copy of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000, a guide to making bombs based on The Anarchist Cookbook.

Judge Gregory Dickinson QC told Smith: "In your warped view of the world, you were preparing for the possibility of a local war with Islamic terrorists.
"In your own obsessive and misguided way, you were preparing for a fight that you believed to come."
Police searched Smith's home in Clifton, Nottingham, on 21 October 2015 and found gunpowder and large amounts of chemicals that could be used to make explosives, along with a copy of the Anarchy Cookbook Version 2000.
Smith's trial heard he was concerned about "a terrorist attack or Islamic attack similar to the Lee Rigby attack".
PCSO Matthew Holden told jurors Smith believed a citizen should have the right to "bear arms", and said words to the effect that "Islam was an evil religion and Islam was at war with the West".
The prosecution told jurors there was no allegation Smith was a terrorist or that he was going to personally commit an act of terror.
In his police interview, Smith said he made the gunpowder to entertain his young relatives by lighting it in the garden.
He claimed he had "an interest in chemistry" and had the weapons because he was a "survivalist" who liked to shoot arrows in his garden.
