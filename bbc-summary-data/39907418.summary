Rangers' Clint Hill has expressed his disappointment at not being offered a new deal by boss Pedro Caixinha.

The 38-year-old joined Rangers in the summer but does not feature in Caixinha's plans and will leave when his deal ends in a few weeks.
"I will be moving on, unfortunately," Hill said.
"Obviously you are a little bit disappointed (at no deal) because when you play at such a big club you want it to last as long as possible."
Former QPR, Crystal Palace and Stoke City defender Hill was in fine form on Saturday as Rangers beat Hearts 2-1 at Ibrox, making a number of timely blocks to help earn his side three points.
Joe Garner gave the Ibrox men an early lead and Barrie McKay won it after Esmael Goncalves levelled for 10-man Hearts.
The win ensure Rangers will finish third this season and while Hill was happy to make it two victories in succession, he knows the season has not gone to plan.
The Englishman joined the club under previous boss Mark Warburton, who left Ibrox in February, and has been a popular figure with the Rangers fans.
He scored a late goal to earn Rangers a point away to Celtic in March and revealed he loved his time at the Glasgow outfit.
"It has been hard on the pitch in terms of performances but it has been brilliant for me to play at this club, and to play in front of the fans has been a big highlight for me," Hill added.
"I have been in football long enough to know that when a new manager comes in they have different ideas, so I am just trying to enjoy every minute as if it's my last.
"I can only wish the club all the best and hopefully see them get back to the top sooner rather than later."
