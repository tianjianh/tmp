The 28-year-old defender has made 17 appearances for the U's since joining the League Two club in the summer.
Prosser initially had the operation in the hope the injury would only be minor and cleared in a few weeks.
"We'll know more about the exact nature of the injury once I've spoken to the surgeon - we can't give exact timescales," said physio Tony Flynn.
