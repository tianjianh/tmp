The 34-year-old, who is currently at Euro 2016, has said he will not make a decision on his participation until after the competition is over.
Hakan Ericson - Sweden's coach at the Rio Games - said he wants to keep the chance Ibrahimovic will compete "open" but admitted his "hopes are not huge".
It is widely expected Ibrahimovic will join Manchester United after Euro 2016.

The former Barcelona, Inter Milan and AC Milan striker ended his four-year stay at Paris St-Germain at the end of the season.
He has remained quiet on his future but speculation on a link-up with his former Inter Milan boss Jose Mourinho at Old Trafford has been widespread.
Ibrahimovic - who created Sweden's goal in their opening draw with Republic of Ireland at Euro 2016 - has scored 62 goals in 114 appearances for his country.
Ericson has said it would be "fantastic" to have Ibrahimovic at his disposal at the Games and Sweden will select their final 18-man squad next month.
They have been drawn against Colombia, Nigeria and Japan at the Olympics.
The men's football tournament - won by Mexico at London 2012 - begins on 3 August in Brazil, two days before the official Olympic opening ceremony.
Manchester United meet Leicester City in the Community Shield at Wembley on 7 August and travel to Bournemouth for their first Premier League fixture on 13 August.
