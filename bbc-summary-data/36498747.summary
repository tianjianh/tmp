EU referendum should be about country's future, says Bryant

A pro-EU Labour MP has said the European referendum should be about the future of the UK, not the Tory party.

Chris Bryant said his constituents in Rhondda would be the ones to suffer from the economic uncertainty caused.
It follows a TV debate where Boris Johnson was accused by fellow Tory Amber Rudd of backing Brexit in the hope of becoming prime minister.
Leave campaigner Dr Liam Fox MP accused the Remain side of "sustained personal attacks" on the former London mayor.
Referring to the debate broadcast live by ITV on Thursday night, the former Conservative defence secretary told BBC Radio Wales the tactic would be "counter-productive".
"There are more than sufficient issues in this referendum," he said on the Good Morning Wales programme.
"I personally want to leave the European Union because I want to get control of our lawmaking, I want to get control of our borders, and I want to get control of our money.
"What was really disappointing from the Remain side is that they weren't making a positive case for remaining in Europe - presumably they have one - but we weren't hearing it last night.
"We were hearing the case against Boris Johnson as the next prime minister, and I thought that was a wasted opportunity."
Mr Bryant, Labour's shadow leader of the House of Commons, told the programme: "This is not about the future of the Tory party, it's about the future of our country.
"We've got a very fragile economic recovery in the UK at the moment - everyone knows that the one thing you do not want is a bout of uncertainty that always leads to another recession, and that's my biggest fear.
"In Wales it's particularly important for us because we get so much more out of the European Union than we put in, financially or socially.
"When you have uncertainty, investors stop making investment decisions and that leads to recession.
"The people who will be hit most will be my constituents in the Rhondda."
