Police were called to Bosworth Drive in Chelmsley Wood at about 04:00 BST on Saturday after receiving reports an ATM had been targeted.
When officers arrived a stolen red Audi A6 car, with four people inside, fled the scene and rammed two marked police cars.
The car was later abandoned and two boys, aged 15 and 16, found nearby.
The pair were arrested on suspicion of burglary and have been released on bail.
Officers are looking to trace two other people seen in the stolen car.
Det Sgt Jamie Mason, from West Midlands Police, said two traffic officers were treated for bruising and whiplash after the cars were rammed.
