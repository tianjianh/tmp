Angola profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The state controls all media with nationwide reach, including radio, the most influential medium outside the capital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The only daily newspaper, Jornal de Angola, and the terrestrial TV service TPA are state-owned and rarely criticise the government.
State-run Radio Nacional de Angola (RNA) is the only outlet to offer programmes in indigenous languages such as Bantu. Private stations operate in cities, including Catholic Radio Ecclesia, but RNA is the only broadcaster with near-national coverage.
The constitution provides for freedom of expression.
Nonetheless, the authorities impede the work of journalists and security forces have targeted reporters, especially those covering anti-government protests and corruption, says US-based NGO Freedom House.
Pay TV is provided by MultiChoice Angola and TV Cabo.
There were 4.3 million internet users by 2014 (Internetlivestats.com).
