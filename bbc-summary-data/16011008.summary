Joseph Webb committed the offence at Southampton's St Mary's Stadium during the Championship game with Brighton and Hove Albion on 19 November.
Webb, 26, of Field Close, Romsey, admitted at Southampton Magistrates' Court to a charge under the Public Order Act.
He was also fined Â£100 and ordered to pay Â£100 costs.
Rikesh Sakaaria, 28, from Bassett Avenue, in Bassett, Southampton, was also charged under the same offence but the case against him was withdrawn.
A Hampshire Constabulary spokeswoman said: "Homophobia within football is currently the subject of national debate, and the ban given today highlights the fact this type of behaviour will not be tolerated.
"Thousands of people pay each week to watch sport and enjoy themselves, and they should not have to hear offensive language and abuse while they do so. We will continue to take action against those who behave in such a way at football matches."
