[SN]TITLE[SN]
US state department investment event in NI postponed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "low-key" investment event organised by the US state department for Belfast and Londonderry has been postponed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But US sources have refused to comment on a claim by Sinn FÃ©in Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness that the move is because of the UK's decision to leave the EU.
He disclosed it had been postponed at a Sinn FÃ©in meeting in Derry.
Sources say the conference would have involved between 20 to 25 people, including potential investors.
It is understood Mr McGuinness was told of the postponement at a meeting in Belfast on Wednesday with US officials, including the US Secretary of State John Kerry's personal representative to Northern Ireland, Senator Gary Hart.
Before last month's referendum President Barack Obama warned that Britain would go to the "back of the queue" for trade deals with the US if it voted to leave the European Union.
It is hoped the event will now go ahead next spring instead.
