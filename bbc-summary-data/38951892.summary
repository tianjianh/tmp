McColgan was runner-up to Sarah McDonald in the 1500m, but had already edged out Steph Twell to win the 3000m.
Eilidh Doyle looks certain to be racing at the Belgrade event in March as she won the 400m on Sunday in Sheffield.
Guy Learmonth won the 800m and Allan Smith leapt to the high jump title for the second time in three years.
Lasswade's Learmonth led from start to finish and crossed the line in one minute 48.19 seconds, while Paisley-born Smith's jump of 2.25m earned him the British indoor title once again.
Three other Scots were on the podium, all winning bronze medals - Mhairi Hendry in the 800m, Courtney MacGuire in the pole vault and Grant Plenderleith in the 200m.
The team announcement is not due until 21 February, after next weekend's Grand Prix meeting in Birmingham.
