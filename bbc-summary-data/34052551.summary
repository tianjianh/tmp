[SN]TITLE[SN]
Petition for parliamentary inquiry into Lancashire water bug

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A petition calling for a parliamentary inquiry into how a bug entered the water supply in Lancashire has been signed by about 12,000 people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nearly 300,000 households have been boiling water since 6 August after the discovery of cryptosporidium at a water treatment works near Preston.
United Utilities is installing ultra violet (UV) rigs to kill the parasite, which can cause diarrhoea and cramps.
The water company has declined to comment.
The petition calls for the inquiry to find out "how and why United Utilities seemingly allowed cryptosporidium to contaminate drinking water supplies and why there seems to be no contingency plans to deal with such a situation".
The water firm previously said it would have an idea of when restrictions could be lifted once UV light treated the water.
Affected areas include Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble, Wyre and the Mellor area of Blackburn.
Levels of cryptosporidium are "very low" but United Utilities urged people to continue boiling water.
South Ribble MP Seema Kennedy has criticised the company for delays in informing customers when their supply will be safe to drink.
She said the Drinking Water Inspectorate had informed her that United Utilities had been told "to get on with providing a plan and managing the public's expectations".
