The frequency of street cleaning and the number of children's play areas will also be cut under the Labour-run authority's plans.
It said its budget has reduced by £144m since 2011 and it must cut a further 15.4m by 2018 and find £11.5m for social care over the same period.
A spokesman said it would have a "major impact on nearly all council services".

The proposals are to be discussed by cabinet on 14 February and, if approved, will be presented to full council on 28 February.
Among the plans announced, the council said it hopes to save £159,000 by reducing street cleaning and scrapping its dedicated fly-tipping removal team and £54,000 by reducing the number of play areas and ongoing maintenance.
It said it would save £650,000 through the closure of Knottingley Sports Centre and Castleford Swimming Pool.
It also plans to cut 100 full-time posts from its workforce of 4,916.
The council is also proposing to raise council tax by 1.99% and implement a 3% adult social care precept.
Council leader Peter Box said: "We are making tough choices and it will get even tougher, but the needs and welfare of our residents and this district remain at the heart of every decision we make."
