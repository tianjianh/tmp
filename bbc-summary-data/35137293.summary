Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson has been elected as the new chair of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He replaces Wirral Council leader Phil Davies who stepped down from the post.
The authority includes council leaders from Liverpool, Wirral, Sefton, St Helens, Knowsley and Halton in Cheshire.
A new metro cabinet has been unveiled to oversee the devolution of powers from Whitehall.
Merseyside became the sixth region to agree a settlement giving its political leaders wide-ranging powers under a devolution deal signed last month.
Councillor Phil Davies held the role of chair since the combined authority was formed in April 2014, with the leader of St Helens council Barrie Grunewald elected as Deputy Chair in June.
