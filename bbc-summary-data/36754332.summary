The 17-year-olds, named locally as Megan Bell from Seaham and Peter MacCallum from Lochgilphead, Argyll, died in separate incidents on Friday.
Organisers have subsequently urged anyone with drugs at the event to dump them in special bins around the site.
Police Scotland said the deaths were not suspicious and formal identifications would take place later.
Tributes have been paid online to the teenagers.
Ruth Bond wrote on Twitter: "Absolutely wiped, poor girl taken far too soon. RIP Megan, hearts go out to her family and friends xxx."
Callum Talbot described Megan as "such a lovely lass and gone too soon".
Ellena Davies wrote: "RIP to one of my longest friends Peter MacCallum, so heartbreaking to witness something so horrible."
Ch Sup Angela McLaren said: "We are continuing to investigate these deaths and are following lines of inquiry, including the possibility that they may be drug-related. I would remind all persons attending the festival that there is no safe way of taking drugs.
"Anyone who has any concerns for themselves or others at the festival should contact festival staff, police officers or medics for assistance."
A festival spokesman added: "Amnesty bins are now in the campsite. We remain focused on delivering a safe, enjoyable event for the rest of the fans onsite and we thank them for their positive attitude."
There have been almost 20 arrests so far at the three-day event at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire, where more than 80,000 people are expected to attend.
There have been deaths in previous years at the festival, which moved to its new location in Perthshire last year.
A 36-year-old man was found dead in the toilets in 2015, and a 24-year-old man collapsed and died during the night in 2010.
