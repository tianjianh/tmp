Firefighters were called to the airport at 08:30 GMT after the on-board crew reported a possible blaze in one of the engines.
The flight from Jersey had been due to land at London City Airport.
Airline Blue Islands claimed initial investigations suggested it had been a false alarm.
Divisional officer Neil Fenwick, who attended the incident, said: "This was a textbook operation. No-one appears to have been hurt.
"The plane landed safely on one engine. We left the scene in the hands of the airport.
"This had the potential to be an extremely serious incident but everything which should happen in a situation like this did and the plane was able to land safely and no one has been hurt."
A spokeswoman for London Southend Airport said the pilot asked to land in Essex due to "technical difficulties".
"Emergency services were stood down shortly after landing and the aircraft taxied normally to the stand to allow passengers to disembark," said the spokesman. "They are now being coached back to London City Airport."
Blue Islands runs flights from Jersey and Guernsey to Amsterdam, Bristol, Chambery, Geneva, London City, Paris and Southampton.
A company spokesman said: "At approximately 08:28 local this morning, the Blue Islands flight SI712 Jersey to London City Airport, with 28 passengers and three crew on-board, experienced a safety warning.
"As a precautionary measure, the engine was shut down, and this flight followed standard procedures and diverted to London Southend Airport. The aircraft landed safely at London Southend at 08:48.
"The aircraft is currently being inspected by engineers at Southend. Initial indications are that no fire took place and it appears to be a false alert."
