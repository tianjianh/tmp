[SN]TITLE[SN]
Free city parking for pure electric vehicles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers of pure electric vehicles in Dundee will be given free parking at all city council car parks, the local authority has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Owners of the vehicles will have free use of multi-storey car parks after registering with the council.
They will also be added to the permit scheme for street level council car parks.
The scheme, which goes live on 5 December, includes non-recharging parking bays.
The council said hybrid electric vehicles, which are not eligible for the scheme, will still be able to plug in and recharge for free when parked at a designated charging bay.
Dundee City Council's city development convener, Will Dawson, said: "Free parking in Dundee can now be added to the growing list of environmental and social benefits of owning an electric vehicle in the city and I'm sure the scheme will prove popular.
"The funding for this initiative will be covered through the Smarter Choices Smarter Places programme."
Once signed up, the car's registration number will be put into the Automatic Number Plate Recognition system to enable the barrier to lift on arrival and departure.
UK Transport Minister John Hayes said: "More drivers than ever are choosing electric vehicles - which are cleaner, greener and cheaper to run and Dundee City Council's electric vehicle free parking scheme is an innovative way of rewarding motorists who have switched to electric vehicles."
