[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 1-3 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A first-half double from Steve Morison inspired Millwall to victory at Chesterfield, who were beaten at home for the first time this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morison pounced after Shane Ferguson opened the scoring and although Sam Hird pulled one back in the second half, it was too late to rescue the Spireites.
Both teams could have scored in the first 90 seconds with Shaun Williams striking the bar from the edge of the area before Jordan Archer saved from Gboly Ariyibi.
Millwall found the net in the 13th minute when an excellent move started by Williams was finished by Ferguson, who fired low past Ryan Fulton from 15 yards.
Morison put the visitors in control with two goals in the space of four minutes, the first a sharp finish in the 38th minute from just inside the area and the second a precise lob over Fulton from 30 yards.
Chesterfield reduced the arrears in the 65th minute when Hird headed in a free-kick but Millwall held on for a well deserved three points.
