Birmingham middleweight Matthew Macklin tweeted that his trainer, Moore, of Salford, was attacked in Marbella, Spain and was "still in hospital".
Moore, 35, has also tweeted: "Overwhelmed. Gutted and confused about what happened, but thank God I'm OK.
The Foreign Office confirmed a British national had been shot in Marbella and was "providing consular assistance".
Moore thanked people for their support following the shooting.
He said: "It's at times like this that you realise how well you're thought of.
"I've had unbelievable support. Means a lot it really does."
Moore won the European title in 2009 but his career was hampered by a persistent shoulder injury.
He was on the verge of a world title challenge before retiring in 2010 on doctors' advice.
He moved into television punditry before trying his hand at training fighters, coaching Hull lightweight Tommy Coyle as well as world title challenger Macklin, who appointed him as his trainer at his gym in Marbella.
Moore and Macklin are former opponents, with their most memorable battle in 2006 that Moore won by a knockout.
Coyle tweeted: "It's not my place to comment on my friend and trainer Jamie Moore's situation.
"Jamie is stable and will be OK, that's all I can say right now."
He later tweeted: "You don't realise how much you care & love some one until you almost lose them. J is a strong individual he be OK."
Moore was due to be in Macklin's corner for his fight against Jorge Sebastian Heiiland in Dublin on 30 August.
