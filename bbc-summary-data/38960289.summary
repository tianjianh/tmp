[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Ham boss Slaven Bilic charged with improper conduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham manager Slaven Bilic has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association following Saturday's 2-2 draw with West Brom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bilic, 48, was sent off by referee Michael Oliver after throwing a TV microphone to the ground in reaction to Gareth McAuley's injury-time equaliser for the visitors at London Stadium.
Hammers assistant boss Nikola Jurcevic has also been charged with misconduct.
Both have until 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 16 February to respond.
Jurcevic's charge relates to an incident in the 19th minute where he was sent to the stands after leaving the technical area to protest against Sofiane Feghouli's strike being disallowed for offside.
Both Bilic and Jurcevic could be handed touchline bans, as well as fines, if found guilty of the charges.
West Ham's next match is away to Watford in the Premier League on 25 February, before a London derby at home to Chelsea on 6 March.
