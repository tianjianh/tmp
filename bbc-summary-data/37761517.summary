Academy funding must be transparent, says MP

The transparency of academy spending must be improved, says the chairman of the parliamentary Education Committee.

Neil Carmichael MP said there was "growing concern" about the value for public money among England's academies.
He also criticised the Department for Education for not giving his committee the necessary information, ahead of a hearing about finances on Tuesday.
His comments came after an academy trust was stripped of its funding over concerns of financial irregularities.
Earlier this month, the  Education Funding Agency (EFA) served a termination of funding notice on the Durand Academy Trust, which runs an infant and junior school in Stockwell, south London, and a boarding school for older pupils in Midhurst, West Sussex.
Appearing before the Education Committee on Tuesday, head of the EFA Peter Lauener said the case was particularly complex, largely because a separate charitable trust owed land used by the academy.
He said the Durand case should not be viewed as typical of how other academies manage their finances.
"It is important not to get this kind of case out of context," Mr Lauener told the committee.
"This has been the most difficult case we've had to deal with in the four and a half years that the EFA has existed.
"There are 3,000 or so other academy trusts... and we only have concerns about 1% of the related party transactions in academy accounts, so by and large I think this is a system where these conflicts [of interests] are recognised and managed well," he added.
However, Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office (NAO), who also appeared before the committee on Tuesday, noted that the Durand case "did seem to be going on quite a long time".
Asked if he felt the academy sector needed a "level and depth of scrutiny greater than it's currently undergoing", Sir Amyas replied: "Either that or it needs a very fast reaction to things going wrong."
"Possibly the Department [for Education] needs a bit more power to extradite proceedings when they find something that's not right," he added.
In April, the NAO criticised the DfE for failing to properly account for spending by academies.
The spending watchdog concluded that there was a level of "misstatement and uncertainty" that meant the truth and fairness of the accounts could not be verified.
Speaking after the committee hearing, Mr Carmichael said: "There is growing concern around value for public money in the academy sector, from trustees earning more than the prime minister to multi-million pound contracts being awarded to related parties.
"Ministers must get a grip and ensure that the autonomy afforded to academies is matched in government by the highest levels of transparency and accountability," he added.
He also reprimanded DfE officials for failing to provide "in good time" the written material necessary for the committee to scrutinise academy spending, describing the delay as "unacceptable".
"When the information was finally forthcoming, it was enigmatic and incomplete," he said.
