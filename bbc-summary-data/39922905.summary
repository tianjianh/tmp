[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Hughes, 33, of Buckley, Flintshire, accidentally let off a shotgun while getting a drink in July 2016, Mold Crown Court heard.
After the gun went off, Hughes was heard screaming and was seen outside his house with a bleeding foot.
He admitted possessing a shotgun and a stun gun, cannabis and cocaine.
The court heard Hughes had wanted to kill himself at the time of the shotgun shooting.
Judge Rhys Rowlands accepted Hughes had been looking after the gun for someone else.
Prosecuting, Anna Price said armed police had gone to the house after the Hughes was seen outside it.
She told the court he had previously been jailed for two years for wounding in 2005 and for four years in 2009 for arson.
Julian Nutter, defending, said Hughes was no longer suicidal and wanted to make something of his life.
Judge Rowlands accepted Hughes had been depressed at the time. He added Hughes was still at risk of losing his foot from what he called a "dreadful injury".
He sentenced Hughes to three years and four months in prison.
