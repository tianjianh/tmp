Jardim, in charge since 2014, described the last three years at the club as "exceptional".
Monaco finished eight points ahead of nearest rivals Paris St-Germain to be crowned champions of France in 2016-17.
"I feel part of AS Monaco and the principality," said Portuguese Jardim, the former Olympiakos boss.
Monaco also beat Tottenham and Manchester City on their way to reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League during 2016-17, before losing to Juventus 4-1 on aggregate in the semi-finals.
Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said Jardim had received offers to coach elsewhere.
"He is one of the best coaches in European football and despite other offers he has chosen to continue the adventure at Monaco, which demonstrates our ambition," added Vasilyev.
