The 29-year-old joined Forest in 2014 from Hamburg and his next appearance will be his 100th for the club.
"I know the manager (Mark Warburton) is looking to do a lot of positive things for the club," Mancienne told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"The way that he wants to play suits me down to a tee and I think that we can really push on next season."
The London-born centre-back came through Chelsea's academy, after being picked up from the youth ranks of non-League Kingstonian.
He made only six first-team appearances for the Blues and had loan spells with QPR and Wolves before being sold to Hamburg in 2011.
Mancienne played 49 times in the Bundesliga prior to returning to England with Forest, who are still looking to secure their Championship survival.
"I'm really happy to be here," Mancienne, who was named in one England squad under Fabio Capello, added.
"It gives me stability in my life as well, knowing where I'm going to be for the next two years."
