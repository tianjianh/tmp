Great Britain forward Craig Peacock welcomed the Elite League's new format as he confirmed he had signed for a second season with Braehead Clan.

The Elite League will have three conferences instead of two, with the four Scottish sides grouped together.
"There will be a good rivalry in the Scottish conference and I expect there will be some good battles among the teams all year long," said Peacock.
"Every team is improving all the time. It'll certainly be interesting."
Dundee Stars, who made the play-off finals last season, Fife Flyers, Edinburgh Capitals and Braehead will also play teams from the other two conferences.
And Great Britain international Peacock welcomed the introduction of two new clubs - Milton Keynes and Guildford.
"The new format was the best outcome for the league and you want to see as many teams in the league as possible," he said.
"It'll be good as you'll play more cross-conference games.
"It's hard to say what Milton Keynes and Guildford will bring to the league, but it's great we've got two new teams coming in.
"I'm certain these two teams won't be coming in to make up the numbers."
Clan are seeking a new coach after the departure of Ryan Finnerty after his side's fifth-place finish.
"The outlook of the team will be different without Ryan and a new coach will come in with new ideas and systems," said Peacock.
"For me, Ryan did a good job and brought me to Braehead last year and I really enjoyed working with him. I'm sad to see him go.
"But a new coach coming in will have the full backing of the players and it'll be interesting to see how it all pans out."
Meanwhile, Dundee Stars have announced that 24-year-old netminder Craig Holland has signed a new deal to stay for a fourth season with the club.
Holland was signed by former coach Jeff Hutchins in 2014 and said the decision to work again with Marc LeFebvre and his team was straightforward.
"I can't wait to get started on the new season," he said.
"I really like the organisation, the rink and the fans and they've always made me feel welcome so it was an easy decision to make."
