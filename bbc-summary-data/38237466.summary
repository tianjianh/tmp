Huw Jenkins: 'I accept responsibility' for Swansea City troubles

Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins says he takes responsibility for the club's slump, which has left them bottom of the Premier League.

The turmoil has been reflected off the field, with Bob Bradley becoming the Swans' fourth manager in three years.
Fans have turned on Jenkins and the board, accusing them of greed after selling most of their shares in July's American takeover.
"I fully understand their feelings, being a supporter myself," he said.
"When things don't go well somebody has to take the blame and I fully accept the responsibility.
"But let's not forget there's a long way to go this season, and we've got a lot of choices to make between now and then to make sure we survive in this league."
Swansea are two points adrift at the foot of the Premier League table and three points from safety.
It has been a dismal start to life under the club's American owners, Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan, who bought a controlling stake of 68% of shares in the club in July.
During the Swans' recent defeats by Tottenham and Manchester United, supporters directed their fury at Levien, Kaplan and the directors from whom they bought their shares.
Jenkins - who made more than Â£8m by selling 8.2% of his 13.2% stake - has been singled out for criticism, having previously been praised as the figurehead of Swansea's rise from the fourth tier of English football to the Premier League.
He was a prominent member of the consortium that saved the club from financial ruin in 2002 but - along with vice-chairman Leigh Dineen and fellow directors such as Martin Morgan - Jenkins is now facing the wrath of the fans who believe their saviours are acting in self-interest.
There has also been widespread criticism of Swansea's dealings in the transfer market, and Jenkins admits he and the club might have made mistakes in squandering the opportunities to sign the likes of former midfielder Joe Allen.
"There might have been one or two decisions we could have taken in the summer that may have changed the feel around the club," Jenkins added in an interview with BBC Wales Sport.
"I'm not going to go in to detail, we may have gone down one or two different routes, may have recruited a few players differently.
"But we are where we are, we've got to everything in our power to make sure we turn our fortunes around. We need everyone to be 100% behind the team."
It has been an inauspicious start to Bradley's reign, with the American winning only one of his first seven matches in charge.
Swansea have scored just 16 goals in their 14 Premier League games so far this season, and they have conceded 31 - more than any other team.
The consensus is that the Swans will need to spend heavily during January to improve their squad, and Jenkins says the American owners will make funds available.
"They [Levien and Kaplan] are fully committed to making a few signings to give everyone a lift, they're fully committed to making sure we stay in the Premier League every year, and we're all working with that one aim in mind," he said.
"We are still a Premier League club and it's up to us to bring in one or two players in January and making sure we are standing as one and give the players every support between now and the end of the season.
"We need to fight tooth and nail to ensure we are fighting and in the Premier League next season."
