[SN]TITLE[SN]
African quilt sale to raise funds for Bristol refugees

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A traditional African quilt has been made by women in Bristol to raise money for the British Red Cross and highlight its work with refugees in the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A call for sewing volunteers was put out by the Afrika Eye Festival who said the response had been "overwhelming", with "yards of African fabric" donated.
The Red Cross said it would help fund its work with Bristol's "vulnerable" refugees and asylum seekers.
The quilt is on show at the Watershed and will be auctioned on Sunday.
The quilting project was supervised by artist Gaie Delap and took about three months.
The design is based on a traditional African method of weaving narrow strips of cloth, which are then sewn together in a "harmonious pattern".
Ms Delap said quilts were "emblematic of resistance and conflict" and had a "strong history of women working together and being made in times of trouble and strife".
The quilt is on display at the Watershed from Friday to Sunday. Anyone interested in bidding for it has until 16:00 GMT on Sunday.
