The news came as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the number of migrants and refugees crossing illegally into Europe by sea and land had passed one million.
The figure for 2015 represents a fourfold rise on the total last year.
Before the latest deaths, the number of dead or missing was put at 3,695.
Most of the migrants crossed by sea, with more than 800,000 travelling from Turkey to Greece. Half are migrants from Syria.
The influx of migrants has caused significant political rifts within the EU, with some states inside the border-free Schengen area putting up fences and re-imposing frontier controls.
Hungary and Slovakia are taking legal action at the European Court of Justice to challenge EU plans to share asylum seekers across EU states.
Most migrants and refugees want to settle in richer northern countries like Germany and Sweden.
Germany alone has received a million refugees and migrants this year, although many were already within Europe, particularly in the Balkans.

Multiple migrant rescues were reported on Tuesday despite the wintry weather
In the Aegean, 11 people died after their boat went down, apparently en route from Kusadasi in Turkey to the Greek island of Samos.
Turkish coast guards rescued seven people. One report said the dead were Syrians.
According to the IOM report, the total number of migrants and refugees entering by land or sea reached more than 1,006,000 this year on Monday.
It covered entries via six EU nations - Greece, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, Malta and Cyprus.
The report found among other things that
The IOM gathers its statistics from registrations, law enforcement agencies and its own monitors.
A joint IOM and UNHCR statement said found a "more co-ordinated European response" was beginning to take shape.
However, it argued that more needed to be done to improve reception facilities, accommodation and  registration, and to identify those who do and do not qualify for refugee protection.
The EU last week agreed to increase the numbers of Frontex border agency staff in Greece, a key arrival point.
Macedonia is now refusing to allow anyone through its Greek border who does not come from a war zone.
A UN report also last week warned that the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide would "far surpass" 60 million this year.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
