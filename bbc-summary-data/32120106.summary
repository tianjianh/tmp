Tunisia avoid 2017 Nations Cup ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tunisia have avoided a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations ban after apologising to the Confederation of African Football for accusing the governing body of bias.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tunisians had made the allegations over a controversial penalty in a Nations Cup quarter-final defeat by Equatorial Guinea on 31 January.
Caf has, however, rejected Tunisia's appeal against a $50,000 fine for violent conduct by its players.
Furious Tunisia players had tried to attack the referee after the game.
The north Africans were incensed when Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn awarded the tournament hosts a penalty in the dying minutes which allowed them to take the game to extra-time and ultimately triumph 2-1.
Tunisian officials accused Caf of bias against it for the contentious decision.
Seechurn was banned for six months by Caf for his performance in the match.
And Caf threatened Tunisia with expulsion from the preliminary tournament of the next Nations Cup if it did not receive an apologise by 31 March.
Tunisia initially refused to do so and lodged a protest with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which they have now agreed to withdraw.
