[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior doctors have urged politicians to address NHS challenges and low morale and give clinicians the power to make radical changes.

The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) says more Welsh medical students need to be trained to fill gaps.
It wants Wales to lead the way in public health, such as taxes on sugary drinks, with obesity a "huge problem".
Political parties have been urged to take on board an RCP action plan ahead of the 2016 Welsh assembly elections.
Dr Alan Rees, RCP vice president for Wales, said: "Morale in Wales is low; throughout the NHS in the UK it is low.
"85% of our senior consultants say they are under intolerable pressure. The NHS in Wales is under-resourced and we have difficulties in recruitment and retention at all levels."
He said the debate about change in the NHS had to be "de-politicised" and they were happy to come to difficult decisions if it was best for patients.
The Royal College for Physicians wants:
"The voice of the clinicians had not been sufficiently heard in any changes and what we'd like is for the next Welsh government to empower clinicians to be innovative, to change the method of delivery of health care which is appropriate for the 21st century," said Dr Rees.
"There are technological improvements, such as virtual clinics in north Wales with neurologists in south Wales for example."
He said more money needed to be spent in the NHS but they could work more efficiently with the resources they had.
More medical students from Wales trained in Welsh medical schools would be likely to have a knock-on effect on keeping doctors, he added.
