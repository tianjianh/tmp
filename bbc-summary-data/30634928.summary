Sam Smith says he thinks The X Factor can be damaging for songwriters.

The star says that being forced to sing covers, as they do on the ITV show, can harm aspiring musicians.
Speaking to the Mirror, the 22-year-old said it was a conscious decision for him not to audition for the show when he was younger.
"I feel that X Factor is perfect for singers who sing, and that's all they want to do. They don't care what they sing, they just love singing," he said.
"You could sing on a cruise ship or release a cover album, that's what it's for. Because when you think about it, every week, that's what you do.
"You're singing other people's songs. People are judging you on other people's music.
"The minute I started writing music, I knew that none of that stuff was going to be for me. I want people judging me on my voice and my songs - that's what's important to me.
"I always say to people, 'If you're a singer, go for it.' It's an amazing platform. But if you're not, and you're a songwriter, I think it's actually quite damaging for you to go on there.
"You're singing other people's music, so then when you release your own stuff, people might not like it."
Smith sang Stay With Me on the final of this year's X Factor at Wembley Arena but says he was disappointed not to be introduced to the judges.
"I didn't like that I didn't get to meet Simon and Cheryl," he said.
"I would have thought they would come and say hello, or I'd have got to go and say hello. But I never got to see them."
Smith, who was 2014's BBC Sound Of winner, also says he doesn't want to become a judge on a show like The X Factor just yet.
"I'm passionate that nobody should judge anyone else until they're at the top of their career and they can give people amazing advice after releasing four or five albums.
"That's why I love Cheryl - she has released a lot of music and knows what she's talking about when it comes to products and being an artist and being famous."
