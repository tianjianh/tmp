[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 0-1 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nick Powell's first-half goal earned Wigan Athletic a winning start to their League One campaign with a 1-0 victory at MK Dons in which both teams had a player sent off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Powell latched onto a through-ball from Michael Jacobs shortly before half-time and tucked the ball past Dons goalkeeper Lee Nicholls for the only goal of the game.
The Latics had chances before the opener through Ivan Toney and Gavin Massey, while MK Dons midfielder Gboly Ariyibi had a free-kick go close.
George Williams was hacked down on the cusp of the break, a challenge which saw Callum Elder dismissed for the visitors but Scott Wootten's red card after the break for hauling down Jacobs evened things up.
Both sides had further chances, with Toney, Ariyibi and former Dons striker Will Grigg all involved, but there was no further score in an even contest just edged by Paul Cook's side.
