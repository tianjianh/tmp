The Sweden midfielder, 31, was sent off just before half-time for a challenge on United's Ander Herrera.
Sunderland were 1-0 down when Larsson was dismissed and went on to lose 3-0.
"I don't want to shout about that [decision to send Seb off] but things didn't go for us," Sunderland boss David Moyes said after the defeat.
Sunderland are bottom of the Premier League, 10 points from safety.
