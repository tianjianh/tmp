Scotland v England's 2018 World Cup qualifier: How the players rated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England came from behind in the 93rd minute to snatch a point against Scotland in 2018 World Cup qualifying.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had given Gareth Southgate's side the lead, before two wonderful free-kicks from Leigh Griffths put Scotland ahead late on, but Harry Kane volleyed in an equaliser in injury time.
Who stood out in the thriller at Hampden Park?
Former Scotland defender Willie Miller scores the home players and BBC Sport's Phil McNulty marks the England players:
There were a couple of occasions where you would expect more from him, especially at the pass-back which led to the first goal and then the shot just after that from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain which ended up in the net. Over the piece, not up to the standard expected of him.
Did OK at times though they weren't put under too much pressure by England. When you play five at the back you expect your defence to be reasonably solid but they almost invited England on to them.
Didn't do too much wrong although maybe at the Harry Kane goal he could have been more alert to the fact that they've only got one main striker and he's drifted off him. There's a question mark over that goal.
He was playing in an unusual position and did well enough but we didn't see him get forward as much given that he was one of three centre-backs. It took some of his game away.
He and Mulgrew switched off for the equaliser, you would have expected him to tuck in and see the run. However, like the rest of the defence, overall, he did OK.
He started the game really well but faded badly in the second half. Didn't do that much, but didn't do much wrong either.
Put himself in a really bad position early on with the booking for the tackle on Dele Alli and he was lucky not to get a second yellow in the second half. Not his best game.
He took a knock early on, hobbled through the first half and didn't have too much influence before going off at half-time.
Wasn't as influential as we have seen him. Generally used the ball well, until he gave it away in the build-up to Kane's late strike. From there, the defenders are assuming the danger has gone and they've been caught cold.
Poor by his standards. He is much better than he showed, he had a poor touch in the first half and this didn't help Scotland's ball retention. I felt it was one of his poorer performances in the dark blue and it was no surprise to see him substituted.
Beyond the two free-kicks he did well, though the balls up to him were difficult to deal with. The two free-kicks are super and I think he could be the main striker now.
James McArthur (for Morrison, half-time) 6: On at half-time for Morrison and I think it was difficult for him to get up to the speed of the game. Showed composure at times but wasn't on the ball an awful lot.
Ryan Fraser (for Snodgrass, 66 minutes) 6: Was involved in the free-kick that led to the Scotland equaliser. He didn't have too long to have an influence. Scotland didn't look like getting back into it until he won the set-piece.
Chris Martin (for Anya, 81 minutes) 6: Won the second free-kick that put Scotland ahead, albeit briefly. He was maybe fortunate to do so but he also showed some decent touches and he held it up well.
Poor positioning for first Griffiths free-kick - not helped by his wall - but now a vulnerable keeper with weaknesses exposed. Time for change.
Solid enough and a threat going forward but can still be a danger to himself and England in the penalty area.
Not the composure and authority of his performances with Chelsea. Unusually unsettled.
Edgy performance. Gave the ball away and was often too hurried in possession.
Some good link-up play down the left and solid once more.
One of England's better performers - which isn't saying much - and had a shot deflected against the post.
Very poor. Booked, wasteful in possession and ineffective.
Tough choice but just about the best of a poor England team on this day. Energetic, creative but should have scored with a header - but still not much above average for this very good player.
Rattled by a very predictable early challenge from Scott Brown and rarely showed the brilliance everyone knows he has.
Looked like a young player who has had a long season. Leg-weary and ineffective.
Largely frustrating day for England's captain but rescued his manager, his performance and his match-rating by poaching that equaliser.
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (for Rashford 65 minutes) 6: Had an impact with his goal - not sure about the celebration in front of Scotland's fans.
Raheem Sterling (for Alli 83 minutes) 6: Only on for 10 minutes but delivered cross for Kane's equaliser.
Jermain Defoe (for Livermore 92 minutes): No rating.
