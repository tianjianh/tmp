[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS trust rated inadequate by a health watchdog has defended the appointment of its seventh boss in four years.

Peter Herring will take over from Karen Fisher at Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust on 19 November.
Last month, a report by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found a number of "serious problems" which were "extremely concerning".
Chairman Sean Lyons said the trust now had the right person in place.
Mr Lyons said: "It's no secret that the best performing trusts have consistent and strong leadership.
"The chief executive position is an exceptionally challenging role in difficult circumstances, and sourcing right and credible leaders is a challenge for any NHS organisation.
"We believe we have found an exceptional interim CEO in Peter Herring."
Mr Lyons added that the CQC report was "shocking and a wake-up call for everybody", but said it was now about finding the "best in class" to deal with the issues and help move things forward.
The trust, which runs Kings Mill Hospital, Newark Hospital and Mansfield Community Hospital, was placed in special measures two years ago because of concerns about death rates and standards of care.
The chief executive brought in at the time - Paul O'Connor - left in April to pursue "alternative career options".
At the time of Mr O'Connor's appointment, the then interim trust chairman Chris Mellor said: "We need an experienced, permanent CEO who can provide the continuity of leadership and direction that, until recently, has been sadly lacking."
