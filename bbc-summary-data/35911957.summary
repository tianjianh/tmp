The woman, who is in her sixties, had been in the water for several hours and was suffering from hypothermia when she was picked up by local fishermen.
She had arrived in Madeira with her husband on a cruise ship on Saturday.
The cruise company said the couple had decided to cut short their 32-night cruise and fly back to Bristol.
Cruise & Maritime Voyages said they booked the couple on to a flight and booked them a taxi to Funchal airport.
They said the woman entered the water close to the airport.
Funchal port captain Fernando Felix Marques told Portuguese radio: "For reasons that are as yet unknown, with the airport being right by the sea, she must have gone and thrown herself in."
The woman was transferred to a local psychiatric unit on Monday afternoon after being assessed, health officials said.
The Marco Polo cruise ship has since sailed to Lisbon and was due to leave for Bristol Avonmouth on Monday evening.
