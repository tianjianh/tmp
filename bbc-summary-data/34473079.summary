TUV propose two alternatives to current Stormont arrangements

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Traditional Unionists have proposed two possible alternatives to the current power sharing executive which, they argue, could provide a path to making Stormont work.

The party's Plan A is a voluntary coalition with an opposition, operating initially on the basis of 60% weighted majority votes.
The party's Plan B would involve MLAs passing bills through the assembly, but British ministers exercising executive functions while remaining accountable to the assembly.
The TUV claim Plan A would ensure cross-community involvement, although they believe it should be possible to reduce the threshold to a straight majority over time.
In a new policy document, the TUV leader, Jim Allister, argues that "clinging endlessly to the failure of mandatory coalition is not serving Northern Ireland well".
Stormont has been in crisis for weeks following the murder of an ex-IRA man.
Kevin McGuigan Sr was shot dead near his home in east Belfast in August, and following a police assessment that Provisional IRA members were involved, all but one of the Northern Ireland Executive's unionist ministers resigned in protest.
Crisis talks involving Northern Ireland's five biggest parties, and the British and Irish governments, have been taking place over the past three weeks.
Earlier this week, Secretary of State Theresa Villiers told the Conservative Party's annual conference that the future of Northern Ireland devolution is under threat.
However, she said a return to direct rule would be a "severe setback" for Northern Ireland's political process.
