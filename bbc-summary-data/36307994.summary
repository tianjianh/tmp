County Championship: Five wickets for McCarthy before second Borthwick ton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham's Irish paceman Barry McCarthy claimed a five-wicket haul in only his third first-class match to create a potentially winning platform against Lancashire at Chester-le-Street.

He took all but one of the six wickets to fall as Lancashire slid from 205-4 to 326 all out, nightwatchman Simon Kerrigan (48) proving his last victim.
Scott Borthwick then hit his second ton of the match to boost the hosts' lead.
He ended the day unbeaten on 103 as Durham closed on 239-4, 324 runs ahead.
After the early loss of skipper Steven Croft for 35, Alex Davies' departure for 31 triggered the loss of Lancashire's last five wickets for 44.
But, helped by Mark Stoneman (62), in a stand of 91 for the second wicket, Borthwick went on to build on his first-innings 134.
He got to his first fifty off 60 balls, but his second needed 100 balls, as he added just two more fours to his haul of 10 boundaries, largely because of the widespread field.
And, helped by 35 from skipper Michael Richardson, those runs put Durham in a position to make a challenging final-day declaration.
Scott Borthwick is only the fourth Durham player to make two tons in a match in their 25 seasons as a first-class county, but the second to do it this season.
Prior to 2016, only former Durham captains Dean Jones and Paul Collingwood had done it. But Keaton Jennings did it against Somerset in April, also at Chester-le-Street - and on both occasions, Collingwood was the man at the other end to offer his congratulations.
Borthwick has now made 237 runs in this match - almost doubling this season's prior haul of 121 in three games.
Durham fast bowler Barry McCarthy:
"There's always been a bit in the pitch and Lancashire batted quite defensively, so it was a matter of being patient.
"I knew with John Hastings not coming back there might be a place available, but there's a lot of competition. I'm very grateful to have the opportunity. I think I got the rewards for persistence."
Lancashire spinner Simon Kerrigan:
"I keep talking about my batting, so it was good to get some runs. The talk was about doing a job for the team and trying to get through the new ball.
"When we bowled, we didn't do as well as we hoped with the new ball, but we did well to restrict them in the last session. The pitch is good and whatever the target, we hope to chase it down."
