Lee Mi-hyang won the Ladies Scottish Open by just one shot after a dramatic final round.

The South Korean sank seven birdies on the final day, finishing six under par with a round of 66.
Her compatriot Hur Mi-jung and Australian Karrie Webb, who had a share of the lead after day three, were joint second on five under.
"It was really good practice for the British Open and I'll take a lot of confidence from this win," said Lee.
"The first and second round, I hit them really well, I just missed a lot of putts.
"I made a lot of putts yesterday so I took a lot of confidence from that."
Webb's eagle putt on the 15th looked to be decisive.
Leading until the final two holes, she bogeyed on the 16th and double-bogeyed on the 17th, dropping her lead.
An eagle putt was needed on the final hole to force the tournament into a play-off - but after shooting into the bunker, Webb could not regain her composure.
Hur coped well in windy conditions to card seven birdies and a round of 66.
Carly Booth was top performing Scot of the tournament. The 2012 winner finished five over par with a final round of 73.
The 25-year-old, who carded two bogeys in her final round, was disheartened with her performance.
"I've just struggled this week," she said. "I'm looking forward to next week. I'm playing well, I just need to sort my putting out.
"I've always struggled on these greens every year. I find them very hard to read. When your confidence isn't up with it, that doesn't help either."
Two-time tournament winner Catriona Matthew finished 10 over par after a round of 74.
She struggled on the fourth with a double bogey and finished with a bogey on the 17th and the upcoming Solheim Cup vice-captain hopes to improve on her performance at the Women's British Open at Kingsbarns next week.
"It's not a typical links, but a nice course," said Matthew.
"I'm looking forward to it. [My game] feels pretty good, I need to sharpen up the short game and the putting."
