A convicted rapist who scarred a prison officer for life by slashing him with a razor blade has been jailed for a further 12 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David McMillan's assault at HMP Glenochil left officer Neil Cumming requiring 53 stitches to a face wound.
McMillan, 39, was found guilty of serious assault in his absence after being removed from the courtroom due to his disruptive behaviour.
He had originally defended himself in court.
McMillan was captured on CCTV carrying out the attack at the prison in Clackmannanshire on 29 October, 2014.
The left side of Mr Cumming's forehead was left paralysed following the assault.
Mr Cumming told the trial at the High Court in Edinburgh: "I see it in the mirror every morning and people looking at me can see it.
"I think they maybe wonder how did he get that, what kind of bother has he been in?"
The trial heard that Mr Cumming was off work for five months following the attack.
McMillan is currently held in jail under an order for lifelong restriction imposed on him in 2008.
Trial judge Lord Uist said: "This was a premeditated assault as the accused must have extracted the razor blade from its holder within a safety razor.
"He calmly walked up to the prison officer, lunged at him three times and slashed him on the left side of his face.
"This was a calculated, unprovoked and motiveless attack on a prison officer in the course of his duty."
