Contract row could mean more junior doctors 'come to Wales'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More junior doctors could come to work in Wales following a dispute with ministers over a new contract in England, it has been suggested.

The British Medical Association (BMA) has arranged three one-day strikes by junior doctors over changes to pay.
Senior Welsh clinical leadership fellow Dr Dai Samuel said the dispute could mean medics coming to Wales to work.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he was talking to junior doctors about opportunities.
It follows a campaign he launched urging junior doctors to take up training places in hospitals and GP practices across Wales.
The dispute in England is over a proposed new contract which would see junior doctors' basic pay go up by 11%, but weekend pay go down.
Dr Celyn Kenny, from Llanelli, who is in her second year of training at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shropshire, told S4C's Newyddion 9 programme some Welsh graduates may consider returning.
"A lot of my friends who are doctors up here, who were undecided, they are more for coming back to Wales now rather than furthering their career in England," she said.
While Mr Drakeford said he has no intention of taking advantage of problems elsewhere, he noted that disagreements "could be dealt with differently" in Wales.
