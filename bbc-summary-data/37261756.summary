Hazlehead crematorium was removed from the list of council properties being opened to the public after complaints from families affected by the scandal.
The council was heavily criticised in a report by Dame Elish Angiolini for cremating babies with unrelated adults.
The former lord advocate described the routine practice as "abhorrent".
A council spokesman confirmed Hazlehead would not be part of the annual Open Doors Day event on 10 September.
He said: "Due to the timing of the event, and as a mark of respect to families affected by historical practices at Hazlehead Crematorium, we have taken the decision to remove the crematorium from this year's Doors Open Day schedule."
BBC Scotland revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
Baby and adult ashes were mixed together and given back to relatives of the adult, while the parents of infants were told there were no ashes.
The Aberdeen crematorium was among those investigated after it emerged staff at the Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh had been burying baby ashes in secret for decades.
