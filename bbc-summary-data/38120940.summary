The League One Pirates, who were shocked by non-league Chesham in last year's competition, went ahead through Rory Gaffney's close-range finish.
But Harrison equalised six minutes later, slotting past keeper Kelle Roos.
And the 29-year-old striker completed the turnaround after half-time, poking home his 13th goal in 10 matches.
Rovers piled forward in the last 20 minutes, with Gaffney striking the post and then firing a further opportunity wide when well placed, but their non-league opponents held on.
Barrow had not won away at an English Football League side in the FA Cup since 1966 - and had looked to be heading for a difficult afternoon when Gaffney put Rovers in front inside the opening 10 minutes.
However, the cutting edge provided by Harrison, whose recent prolific run in front of goal has seen Barrow go unbeaten since 20 August, proved the difference and ensured their place in the third-round draw.
Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke has led the club to two successive promotions from the National League to League One, but their defeat by Barrow was their fifth in seven games.
"We lost it because we weren't good enough with the ball and we can't defend," Clarke told BBC Radio Bristol. "I'm sick of saying it, to be honest.
"The character of the players will now be in question after this result, and rightly so. I thought one or two hid from trying to get on the ball, which is very disappointing - I don't want to see that."
Barrow now go in to the hat for Monday's third-round draw, which will be shown live on BBC Two from 19:00 GMT, and boss Paul Cox says he hopes to secure a tie that "creates memories".
"In my personal opinion these boys deserve a shot, even if it's just a one off, against one of the major players," he told BBC Radio Cumbria. "I'm hoping the boys are enjoying the journey, because there's loads more to come."
