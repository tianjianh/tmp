Sport Wales said 48% of children played sport regularly, up from 40% in 2013.
The survey of more than 116,000 Welsh school children showed the amount of girls participating rose from 36% in 2013 to 44% in 2015, while the number of boys increased from 44% to 52%.
Forty percent of pupils with a disability were participating regularly, up from 31%.
Sarah Powell, Sport Wales' chief executive officer, said it was a "huge achievement".
"The pupils in school today are our Gareth Bales and Sam Warburtons and our Non Stanfords and Jade Joneses," she added.
"They are also our teachers, doctors, nurses, businessmen and women, and ministers of the future."
The figures showed black British children and those of mixed race were more likely to play sport regularly, while more Welsh speakers (53%) than non-Welsh speakers (42%) were likely to take part.
