Isla Nelson was honoured for her online appearances on BBC Scotland's Short Stuff News At 3 series.
The feature, which has notched up nearly 100 million views, shows Isla discussing politics and current affairs with her father, comedian Mark Nelson.
The series was also named Best Online Comedy at the awards, held at Edinburgh's Le Monde hotel on Tuesday.
On collecting her acting award, Isla's father Mark told the audience of comedians and industry figures: "Isla can't be here tonight. She's been made Trump's new communications director."
When collecting the second award, Mr Nelson said: "Frankly, it's about time. It's ridiculous it's taken this long. Let this be a lesson to other three-year-olds to stick with it, and you can break the glass ceiling."
The News At 3 series - A Toddler's Take on the News - recently saw Isla and her father appear on the BBC's One Show programme.
Among its most popular posts are Isla's take on the recent general election and her thoughts on Easter.
BBC Scotland executive producer Anthony Browne said: "Isla is the breakout star of our popular Short Stuff comedy series on BBC Scotland's Facebook page.
"News at Three has struck a chord with our audience gathering over 92M views and praise from across the world. We're always proud when we uncover new talent and I think it is safe to say Isla, at 3 years old, is our freshest new talent to date."
The awards, now in their fourth year, saw Still Game named as best TV show, while BBC Radio Scotland's topical comedy show Breaking The News was the winner in the radio category.
