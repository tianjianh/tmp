BBC Sport understands that GAA disciplinary bosses felt that the video evidence of the Celtic Park incident was inconclusive.
Donnelly appeared to raise his hand towards the Derry player but referee Maurice Deegan took no action.
The incident was early in the second half when Derry were four points down.
However, Tyrone then took total control as they eventually clinched a 0-22 to 0-11 victory.
BBC Championship pundit Oisin McConville said after the game that it was "something that the disciplinary committee may have a look at".
"It wasn't dealt with on the day so they are able to have another look at it," McConville said on BBC Northern Ireland's Championship programme.
"Us looking at the pictures, can you conclusively say it was a punch in the mouth? It's a difficult one.
"I can imagine if Tyrone went up to defend that, they would be able to get (Donnelly) off on this occasion.
"(But) From what we saw, it was a clear enough strike. Certainly at that stage, Derry were were well in the game and it (a Donnelly red card) would have made a huge amount of difference to that match."
The Trillick man was sent off for striking Cavan's Seanie Johnston in a Dr McKenna Cup in January and was banned retrospectively for one match during the Football League following a post-match altercation with Mayo's Aidan O'Shea in March.
