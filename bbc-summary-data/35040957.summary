[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gloucester teenager Zac Evans 'died in savage machete attack'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager was killed in a "swift and savage" machete attack by a man who habitually kept the weapon in the back of his van, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ewen Reynolds, 44, denies murdering Zac Evans and the attempted murder of Keaton Jones outside a Gloucester pub.
Prosecuting, Christopher Quinlan QC said: "The attack was unlawful, it was swift and it was savage."
Mr Evans, 19, was attacked in the car park of the Pipe and Musket in January, in the Tuffley area of the city.
Opening the trial at Bristol Crown Court, the prosecution said there had been a "seemingly inconsequential disagreement" between the defendant's wife and the girlfriend of one of the victims.
But this escalated to a "devastating extent" where the accused, of Foley Close, Tuffley, armed himself with a 24ins (60cm) machete he "habitually carried with in his van".
Mr Quinlan added: "He used that terrifying weapon striking one man to his neck.
"Such was the force that it severed major blood vessels in his neck and shaved off the lower jaw bone and he died almost immediately.
"He then struck another man with a machete to the side of his head."
The jury also heard how the accused then drove off from the scene to London, but was arrested on his return to Gloucester.
Mr Reynolds gave "no comment" during interviews with police after his arrest to a series of questions but would claim during the trial he was acting in self-defence, Mr Quinlan told the court.
"In a sentence he asserts that he was attacked and he used the machete in lawful and proportionate self-defence.
"He feared for his own life and for the safety of his wife," added Mr Quinlan.
The trial continues.
