Wa-ays Dhaye, from Slough, died in hospital following the assault at the junction of Thurston Road and Waterbeach Road, Manor Park, on Monday.
Thames Valley Police said he was on his way home from Notting Hill Carnival in London when he was set upon.
Det Chief Insp Simon Steel described the attack as "senseless and violent".
A post-mortem examination on Tuesday confirmed he died from multiple stab wounds.
Det Chief Insp Steel said Mr Dhaye had been walking alone when he became involved in an altercation with a group of at least three men.
He said it was not yet known how it came about, but added: "His family and friends deserve to know what happened to him and to see those responsible brought to justice."
Mr Dhaye, who was Somalian, had travelled from London to Slough railway station at about 22:30 BST.
He is thought to have walked home via the crossroads between Stoke Poges Lane, Oatlands Drive and Elliman Avenue, then into Mildenhall Road before reaching Thurston Road.
Supt Simon Bowden said his death had "understandably had an impact on the community in Slough" and said officers were continuing to carry out house to house inquiries in the area.
The force said the death was not linked to an assault that occurred in Salt Hill Park on Friday.
