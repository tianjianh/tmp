Khadimou Diagne befriended the 38-year-old as she walked through Wigan town centre, in Greater Manchester, at about 05:25 GMT on 1 October 2016.
She then collapsed and he dragged her by the arms into an alleyway leading to Standishgate before removing her clothes and attempting to rape her.
Diagne, 33, from Wigan, was jailed for seven years at Bolton Crown Court.
The victim was left on the floor in the pouring rain for an hour before she was found by a passer-by who called for an ambulance, police said.
Diagne, of Swinley Road, was later recognised by an off-duty detective after the attack was captured on CCTV.
Det Con Brendan Greally said it was a "despicable attack on a lone woman" who was put through a "chilling ordeal".
Diagne will remain on licence for four years after completing his sentence.
He was also placed on the sexual offenders' register for life.
