Dragons, Wales' sole survivors in European competitions this campaign, will travel to English Premiership side Gloucester in the last eight in April.
Gloucester topped Pool 4 with six wins out of six while Dragons were second in Pool 2.
"It's something to look forward to and by then we'll have half a dozen players back from injury," Jones said.
"Gloucester away is a good challenge and we're happy with that draw. It's going to be a tight game.
Jones' side will face Sale Sharks or Montpellier in the semi-finals if they overcome David Humphreys' side at Kingsholm.
Dragons reached last season's semi-finals, where they were beaten by Edinburgh, who lost to Gloucester in the final.
"We're proud and delighted to get through to the quarter-finals for the second year on the trot," Jones added.
"We're really enjoying the competition and we play a lot of good rugby in it.
"There's no better challenge than going to Kingsholm to prove to ourselves and the rest of Europe that we are a good team and we've got good players.
"But until then we've got a lot of rugby to play."
Dragons return to Pro12 action on Friday when they host second-placed Leinster at Rodney Parade.
Jones expects a reaction from his side, who are 11th in the Pro12, following their 38-5 loss to Sale Sharks in the European Challenge.
"We're keen to make up lost ground," Jones said.
"There's a long way to go yet in this league and we've got a lot of rugby to play and we look forward to it."
