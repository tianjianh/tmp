Murray Dewar, 45, attacked Jack Wemyss in the Tesco Express store in Dundee's Strathmartine Road.
An argument between them started after Dewar blocked the path of Mr Wemyss's mobility scooter.
Dewar, from Dundee, pled guilty to the attack on 20 November.
Fiscal depute Muhamad Sadiq told Dundee Sheriff Court that Dewar had hit the 83-year-old in the face with the basket, leaving him cut above the left eye.
Police issued CCTV images of Dewar, who later handed himself in.
Defence solicitor Emma Sommerville said: "He suffers from severe anxiety and has had a panic attack today, so is not in the dock.
"He is not in a fit state to come into court, but wishes me to tender a guilty plea on his behalf."
Sheriff Richard McFarlane deferred sentence until January for social work background reports.
