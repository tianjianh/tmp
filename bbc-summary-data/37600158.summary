BT plans to remove 1,500 phone boxes across Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BT is looking to remove almost half of Wales' phone boxes which it has blamed on declining usage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company has written to local authorities regarding the removal of 1,579 of Wales' 3,394 payphones.
Tenby Town Council, in Pembrokeshire, is due to oppose the planned removal of two boxes, saying they are needed by people without mobiles phones.
Some former phone boxes have been adopted by community groups and used to store defibrillators and books.
Notices of potential removal have been put up in kiosks under threat. Among those affected are 177 pay phones in Carmarthenshire, 60 in Swansea and 53 in Neath.
Many have not been used at all in the past 12 months.
The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park has received notice from BT regarding 36 public phones boxes, including one in Knowling Mead in Tenby which was used 127 times in this time.
The town council wants it retained along with another, which was used 26 times in a year, on the grounds they are close to schools and some elderly residents do not have a mobile phone.
A BT spokesman said the removal of payphones was carried out in "strict adherence" to guidelines from regulator Ofcom and, where appropriate, the consent of local authorities.
"BT is committed to providing a public payphone service, but with usage declining by over 90% in the last decade, we've continued to review and remove payphones which are no longer needed," he added.
"As an alternative to removal, we will continue to actively promote the Adopt a Kiosk scheme to all councils whilst being committed to maintaining the payphones that remain."
