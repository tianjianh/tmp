'Sex-obsessed' seal sent to girls-only park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "randy" seal has been removed from her home in Cornwall to stop "further illicit breeding".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Common seal Sija, originally from Belgium, has been transferred to Weymouth Sea Life Adventure Park where there are no male seals.
The decision was made after Sija gave birth to a second pup despite being given the contraceptive pill.
She has been joined at the sanctuary by her visually impaired surrogate mother Luna.
While living at the Cornwall Seal Sanctuary in Gweek Sija mated with ageing lothario Babyface.
One-eyed Babyface, 37, is one of the oldest seals in captivity and was thought to be infertile but fathered two pups with Sija.
The Weymouth Sea Life Adventure Park agreed to take Sija, who they described as "sex obsessed" and "randy", to stop her breeding.
On the seals' arrival this week, the park's Fiona Smith said they would be getting "lots of extra love, attention and feeding activities to keep them occupied".
Tamara Cooper, animal care supervisor at the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, said: "Both seals were thoroughly prepared and were not distressed in any way."
