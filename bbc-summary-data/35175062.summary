[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Engineering work over the festive period has been planned "in meticulous detail" this year after it overran 12 months ago causing severe disruption, Network Rail said.

The operator will carry out the work on 27 and 28 December.
Passengers will face journeys of up to 90 minutes longer if they are travelling between south Wales and London over those two days.
Network Rail's Nick Mann said they "got it wrong last year".
Elsewhere, passengers travelling between north Wales and London are facing disruption because of engineering work on the West Coast main line over the same days with replacement buses running between Crewe and Stafford.
Similar arrangements will be in place until 16:00 GMT on New Year's Day.
