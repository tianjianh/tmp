A man who carried out a string of sex attacks over ten days on women in south London has been jailed for eight years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Algerian national Mehdi Midani, of no fixed address, attacked eight women aged in their 20s and 30s in Clapham and Brixton between 22 and 31 October, 2015.
The 28-year-old was found guilty at Inner London Crown Court of six assaults and admitted a seventh.
He was also found guilty on one count of common assault.
The court heard Midani preyed on lone women, following them from busy areas near tube stations to quiet residential areas where he groped them on their doorsteps.
On one day, he attacked four women in the space of four hours.
Judge Nicholas Madge said Midani still posed a danger to the public and ordered that he serve an extended period of two years on licence after being released.
The court heard the UK Border Agency had no record of Midani entering Britain and he would be deported after serving his sentence.
