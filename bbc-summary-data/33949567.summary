Everton manager Roberto Martinez says the club needs unity after fans staged a fly-past protest against chairman Bill Kenwright and the Toffees board.

A plane carrying a banner reading: 'Kenwright & Co #time to go NSNO,' flew over St Mary's Stadium during Everton's 3-0 win at Southampton on Saturday.
"I just heard about it," Martinez said afterwards. "I never saw it.
"We need to be together, help each other and push in the same direction because that makes a difference."
The Toffees supporters who organised the protest are from newly formed group '@EvertonBoardOUT', plus 'The Blue Union' and fan website 'School of Science'.
They are unhappy with the level of the investment in the team and the direction of the club under the current regime.
The slogan 'NSNO' on the plane's banner refers to the club's Latin motto of 'Nil satis nisi optimum' which translates to mean 'Nothing but the best is good enough'.
School of Science editor Joe Jennings told the Daily Mirror on Friday: "The time has come for Bill Kenwright to accept that his performance as chairman has been unacceptable and to let go of the club."
But Martinez gave his backing to Kenwright, who has been on the club's board since 1989 and chairman since 1999.
After seeing his side see off Saints with an impressive away performance, Martinez added: "I will never shy away: we are a big club, we've got a big history and an incredible expectation.
"But as a manager and as football players we understand that, we embrace those expectations and the way to get everyone excited and happy is performing in the manner we did on the pitch.
"The chairman is an incredible Evertonian, who has done a fantastic job over the years. Only he knows the effort he had to put in for the football club."
