China media: Climate change talks 'onus on US'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As a key UN climate change conference opens in Peru, Chinese state media contrast their country's approach to what they cast as the United States' reluctance to shoulder its share of the burden of emissions cuts.

The week-long meeting of 195 countries in Lima - aimed at preparing for a new global climate pact in 2015 - comes after China and the US, two of the world's top polluters, pledged last month to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
The official news agency Xinhua says China is keen to reach a deal on carbon emissions, but adds in another article that progress is likely to be stymied by differences between the developed and developing world - with the US the main culprit.
"Some developed countries demand that developing countries, especially emerging economies, pledge emission cuts, but they are not interested in providing funds and technical assistance to these countries," the article says.
It adds that the US is the "hardcore representative of developed countries that are shirking responsibilities", and will "pressure other nations but avoid delivering its own promises".
State-owned Guangming Daily strikes a similar note, criticising the US and Europe for "not doing enough" while highlighting China's willingness to work towards a deal in accordance with "principle of fairness".
A report in the People's Daily enumerates the way Chinese enterprises and investments have been helping to combat climate change abroad, praising them for "actively protecting the environment of the countries they are in".
"Neighbourhood diplomacy" is the big buzzword in the Chinese papers following a speech by President Xi Jinping over the weekend in which he promised to improve ties with China's neighbours.
Mr Xi's remarks at a conference in Beijing on Saturday are seeing as having struck a conciliatory tone in relations with other countries in the region, which are frequently strained by longstanding disputes over territory.
An article in the Communist Party publication Qiu Shi lends its full support to Mr Xi's "big-country diplomacy", based on principles such as respect of countries' sovereignty and non-interference in their internal affairs.
Highlighting China's traditional insistence that its rise will be a peaceful one, the article also suggests Beijing focus on projecting soft power through culture and technology exports - as well as "the charm and the confidence of Chinese diplomacy".
Continuing the conciliatory theme, an article in the China Daily urges China not be suspicious of other countries' intentions in order to build "strategic partnerships".
According to the commentary, Beijing should understand that the US does not want the Chinese government or nation to collapse, and neighbouring countries do not want to contain it.
"China has a good record of solving disputes peacefully, and its diplomacy should show neighbours its sincerity and reflect its goodwill," it concludes.
And finally, state media back the use of force to end the pro-democracy street protests in Hong Kong, while playing down suggestions that Beijing could deploy troops to the territory.
Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung has warned pro-democracy activists not to return to the streets following the worst clashes between protesters and police since the demonstrations began two months ago.
Condemning the protesters for "severely challenging" Hong Kong's rule of law, the Global Times chides the territory's police for being "overly cautious".
"We stand by the Hong Kong police, which can use force to halt the ruinous and subversive course of street politics", the paper says.
On the other hand, it also warns the mainland authorities against the "temptation" to quell the unrest with troops.
This, it argues, "can only bring temporary peace, but the deep-rooted causes will remain".
