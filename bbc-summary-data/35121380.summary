Surrey farmer reveals inside of 'hidden castle'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer who built a mock Tudor castle without planning permission is preparing to spend his last Christmas in his home before it is demolished.

Robert Fidler, 66, hid the building behind straw bales for four years when he built it in Redhill, Surrey.
Following almost a decade of legal battles he has been told to demolish it by June or face three months in prison.
He said: "This is our home. Everybody who comes here says they just feel this is home."
Mr Fidler, who gave the BBC a tour of his property, said: "It's got such a warmth about it.
"We have so many things going on the kids love to be here."
He added: "We've got three bedrooms and one little box room so it's not as big as people seem to think.
"At least we can enjoy it for this winter.
"Then we'll have to start making plans, maybe they'll let us keep part of it? Reduce the size of it or something, maybe reduce it to a bungalow?"
Mr Fidler said he had contacted firms to find out how much the demolition of his property would cost but as he had until June to comply with the court he would not be tearing down his house in the middle of winter.
Reigate and Banstead Borough Council first told Mr Fidler to demolish his home in 2007.
In November, he appeared in court again and claiming he could not destroy the castle as bats, which are protected by law, were roosting in the property.
However, a High Court judge disagreed, giving him a three-month suspended sentence.
He said Mr Fidler would be jailed for his "defiance" if the property was not demolished by June.
