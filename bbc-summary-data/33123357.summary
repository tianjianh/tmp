A new traffic system that identifies vehicles posing a safety risk has been installed at the Dartford Crossing.

Oversized lorries and hazardous loads travelling northbound from Kent into Essex will be turned around before they enter the tunnels.
The system automatically identifies restricted vehicles and triggers a series of traffic signals and barriers.
Vehicles will then be directed into a separate lane where they will be met by an escort and taken through the tunnel.
Drivers who fail to follow the new signs and use the correct lanes could receive fines or points on their licence.
It is part of the Dart Charge scheme where crossing tolls are paid online.
Previously, unsuitable vehicles were identified by staff at toll booths, which have now been replaced with the free-flow charging system.
Dart Charge project director Nigel Gray said drivers would need to take extra care due to the significant change to the road layout.
"This new safety system is vital for the safe operation of the tunnels and will enable us to remove the old payment barriers for good," he said.
