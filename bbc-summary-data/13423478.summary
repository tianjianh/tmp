Authorities named Rahimjan Makhatov as the man they believe detonated the bomb in front of the National Security Committee office.
Kazakhstan's Prosecutor General's Office alleged that the 25-year-old was a member of an organised crime group.
The attacker died at the scene and two people were injured.
Witnesses said the area around the building had been sealed off.
Such attacks are rare in Kazakhstan, one of the region's most stable states.
The country has been run by long-time President Nursultan Nazarbayev - who was re-elected in April - since before the fall of the Soviet Union.
Aktobe, an oil town in northwestern Kazakhstan close to the Russian border, hosts major oil and gas pipelines, including one of the main pipelines to China.
