Twilight leads Razzies 'worst film' shortlist

The final instalment of the Twilight saga has dominated the shortlist for this year's Razzies, which single out the worst movies of the last 12 months.

Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2, which made $814m (Â£507m) at the box office, has 11 nominations in 10 categories, including worst film and worst sequel.
Its stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are also listed in the "worst screen couple" category.
Critically-reviled blockbuster Battleship received seven nominations.
Among them was worst supporting actress for pop star Rihanna, who made her acting debut as a US Navy Seal in the film, which was based on the classic grid-based boardgame.
Other notable nominations included actor-director Tyler Perry, who was cited for worst actor and worst actress - thanks to his cross-dressing role in Madea's Witness Protection.
Comedian Adam Sandler won both categories last year, for playing a twin brother and sister in Jack and Jill. His latest film, bad-taste comedy That's My Boy, picked up eight nominations in this year's shortlist.
The Razzies committee also put forward "any two cast members" from MTV reality show Jersey Shore for worst screen couple in the Three Stooges movie - based on the cult US comedy act.
The culmination of the Twilight movie franchise, which tells the story of a human girl who falls in love with a sullen vampire, fared relatively well with critics but the Razzies claimed it had sucked the life out of cinemas.
The previous three films have all been nominated for Razzie awards, but have not come away with any of the major prizes.
However, it is thought the annual awards bash has been waiting for the finale to heap its scorn on the franchise - as a parallel to the way the Oscars waited for the final Lord Of The Rings film before awarding it best picture.
"That's the analogy we're making, that this is the Razzies' flipside," said Razzies founder John Wilson.
"This is our equivalent to The Lord of the Rings. It's our members' last chance to razz Twilight."
A spoof of the Academy Awards, the Razzies announcement arrived a day before Thursday's Oscar nominations. This year's winners will be announced on 23 February, the night before the Oscar show.
The full list of nominees is as follows:
Worst Picture
Worst Director
Worst Actress
Worst Actor
Worst Supporting Actress
Worst Supporting Actor
Worst Screen Ensemble
Worst Screenplay
Worst Remake, Rip-Off, or Sequel
Worst Screen Couple
