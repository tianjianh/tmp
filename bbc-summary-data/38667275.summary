Frank Nouble: Southend United sign former West Ham, Ipswich and Gillingham striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Southend United have signed former Coventry and Gillingham striker Frank Nouble on a contract until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old left the Gills earlier in January after scoring three goals in 13 appearances.
Former West Ham youngster Nouble has netted 19 goals in 163 league appearances for 11 teams, including Ipswich, West Brom and Barnsley.
Nouble arrives following the suspension of striker Nile Ranger.
Ranger was suspended by the League One club last week after a "breach of discipline" and will not be allowed to play until an FA inquiry is completed.
