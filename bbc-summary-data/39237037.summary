[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jim Fleeting and Donald Park have been appointed to new coaching roles by Scottish FA performance director Malky Mackay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fleeting will become director of coaching, overseeing coach education, while Park has been named head of coaching and will work closely with Scotland national youth team coaches.
The appointments mark the next stage of the SFA's Project Brave.
It aims to improve and increase the development of elite players.
Former Ayr United defender Fleeting, 61, will move from his current post as director of football development and act as a coaching figurehead for Scotland's seven regional performance schools.
Former Hearts midfielder Park, 63, who has coached at Hibernian, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hearts, will provide coaching support and mentorship to accredited academies.
As part of the changes, Andrew Gould will succeed Fleeting by becoming head of football development, overseeing the grassroots football programmes, following 10 years as head of regional development.
Mackay said: "Jim and Donald are two highly respected and experienced coaches and these new roles will greatly enhance our coaching programme at all levels.
"Our coach education programme is among the most highly-regarded in Europe, but these changes will allow us to provide greater focus in education and mentoring at all levels of the game.
"The roles will not only provide our own national youth teams and performance school coaches with better support, but the clubs, and the coaches working within the clubs, will also benefit greatly.
"These are important changes that will support the development of our coaches and ultimately serve to help us produce better players for the Scotland national team."
