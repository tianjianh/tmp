Hundreds of riders for Deliveroo have staged protests over changes they fear will mean lower wages.

Riders held a demonstration outside the takeaway delivery firm's head office in Soho, central London, on Thursday.
Some decided not to work and have taken to London's streets in convoys to draw attention to their demands.
Deliveroo plans to pay £3.75 per delivery, rather than £7 an hour, plus £1 per delivery. The firm reportedly said riders could earn twice as much.
Riders are calling for pay of £8 an hour with £1 per delivery, as well as tips and the cost of fuel for moped riders.
Deliveroo provides a delivery service to thousands of restaurants that do not have their own drivers using riders on bicycles or mopeds. Customers are charged a £2.50 delivery fee.
The company plans to introduce the new pay terms next week. It said riders had "reacted positively" to the new payment structure in trials this year and that they could earn more than twice as much, the Guardian reported.
Set up in 2013 by William Shu, a former investment banker, and software developer Greg Orlowski, Deliveroo has attracted hundreds of millions in funding from venture capital firms.
It plans to use the cash to offer a service in more cities in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
A fierce battle is under way in the UK takeaway delivery market, with companies including Just Eat, Hungry House and Uber Eats vying for customers.
