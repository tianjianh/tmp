[SN]TITLE[SN]
Motorcyclist 'pulled wheelie before hitting pensioner'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A speeding motorcyclist pulled a wheelie moments before hitting and killing a pensioner, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Stella, 25, is accused of killing Francis Abbot, 71, who was walking home from a supermarket at the time.
St Albans Crown Court was told the "bike came from nowhere" as Mr Abbot crossed a 30mph (48kph)-limit road in Potters Bar.
Mr Stella denies causing death by dangerous driving and a charge of causing death by careless driving.
Prosecutor Peter Shaw told the court Mr Abbot was crossing Mutton Lane when he was hit by Mr Stella's bike.
"Mr Abbot emerged from behind a white van, but the crown say he (Mr Stella) was, in all probability, speeding and not paying sufficient attention to avoid Mr Abbot," he said.
"One witness said the motorbike overtook and was travelling very fast - faster than 30 miles per hour.
"The motorbike moved at speed and the front wheel lifted off the road, performing a wheelie."
The jury was told Mr Abbot died in hospital after being struck on 14 April 2014.
Mr Stella, of Park Street Lane, Park Street, St Albans, suffered a broken leg.
The defendant told police he had no recollection of events before the collision, but denied he would have performed a wheelie as it was not his riding style.
The trial continues.
