Montgomerie tore ligaments in his ankle in February, but is fit to compete at Royal Porthcawl from 27-30 July.
The Scot finished second behind Bernhard Langer at Porthcawl in the 2014 Senior Open and was also second in the 2005 Open at St Andrews.
"I would love to go one better," he said. "It is right on my radar, the most important event on my calendar."
Since turning 50 in June 2013, Montgomerie has claimed three Senior majors but the Senior Open remains elusive.
As well as his second-place finish in Wales three years ago, he had an opportunity to win at Sunningdale in 2015 but had to settle for third behind American Marco Dawson.

"I went there with a very open mind," said Montgomerie, referring to the 2014 Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl. "I was taken aback at how undulating it was for a links course and how good it was. I was very, very impressed.
"It is a very solid golf course and one you have to be extremely careful of. You can get the odd lucky bounce, but you can't be lucky for four days.
"I enjoyed playing it. It was a course full of character and I put it in the same category as Turnberry and Royal Birkdale. Let's also hope the weather plays its part again."
Montgomerie is joined by a host of major winners from the past 40 years in the field, including Tom Watson, Ian Woosnam, John Daly, Jose Maria Olazabal and Fred Couples.
Defending champion Paul Broadhurst, Welshman Phillip Price and Ireland's Paul McGinley will also tee up.
