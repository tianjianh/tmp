At midday, there was a 21-gun salute at Hillsborough Castle in County Down.
Beacons were later lit up in areas including Belfast, Londonderry, Enniskillen in County Fermanagh, Carrickfergus in County Antrim. They were among more than 900 beacons lit in the Queen's honour around the world.
In Enniskillen, a thanksgiving service was held at St Macartin's Cathedral.
Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster attended the service.
Beam of light from St Macartin's Cathedral and St Michael's Church crossed in the sky above the town symbolising the Queen's visit when she crossed the street to visit the two churches in 2012.
Prior to that, the Royal couple visited Northern Ireland in 2012 as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.
During that visit, the Queen and Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and a former IRA leader, shook hands for the first time.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh last visited Northern Ireland in June 2014 when the Royal couple carried out a series of engagements during a three-day visit.
The Royal couple have visited Northern Ireland 21 times.
