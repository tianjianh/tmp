The news has been welcomed by triathlete James Corlett, from Mapperley, who said educating road users was also important.
The city council said funding for cycle lanes around Dunkirk, Mansfield Road, and the River Lean corridor in Basford has been secured.
The authority is also applying for £6m from the Department for Transport.
Mr Corlett, who has represented Team GB at amateur level, said he has had several near misses whilst cycling in the city.
He said: "It's a good investment but I also think there needs to be a whole package.
"We need to educate people better, not only car drivers but there some absolute idiots on bikes too."
Councillor Jane Urqhart, who is responsible for transport in the city, said areas where safety needs to be stepped up are constantly reviewed.
