A 10-year-old boy found hanged in his bedroom "did not understand the risks of putting a scarf around his neck", a coroner has said.

Alfie Hyett was found by his mother Louise Hembrow at home in Hereford last March.
Police told the inquest they found no evidence to support a claim he was copying a choking game that encouraged people to block their airways.
A verdict of accidental death was recorded at Hereford Town Hall.

When the inquest opened in June, Mark Bricknell, senior coroner for Herefordshire, heard Alfie died of vagal inhibition, which causes the heart to stop through the stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck.
Before the inquest, Ms Hembrow told the BBC she believed her son had taken part in the game where the brain is starved of oxygen to create an adrenalin rush.
However, Det Sgt Mark Jinks, from West Mercia Police, said there was no evidence he had researched the game or discussed it with friends.
Mr Bricknell said he believed Alfie had tied the scarf around his neck out of childhood curiosity or experimentation without realising the potential consequences, and had not meant to take his own life.
