Media in Mexico say a post on the social networking site Facebook helped lead police to the main suspect in the shooting of the Paraguayan footballer Salvador Cabanas.

Police knew that the suspect, Jose Jorge Balderas Garza, was in a relationship with a Colombian model.
Reports say when a Facebook profile in her name listed a Mexico City area as her location, officers moved in.
Mr Balderas denies he carried out the shooting.
He blames one of his associates for the attack last January on Cabanas, who played for Paraguay and Mexico's Club America.
The football star was shot in the head in the bathroom of a bar in Mexico City on 25 January last year. He survived, but a bullet remains lodged in his head.
Police also accuse Mr Balderas of running a drug-trafficking ring.
Officers say that during their inquiries about Mr Balderas, they became aware of his romantic link to the Colombian model and participant in the Miss Antioquia 2008 competition, Juliana Sossa.
A profile page in Ms Sossa's name on Facebook gave her current location as Lomas de Chapultepec, Mexico City.
On Tuesday, police moved into the area and found Ms Sossa, 25, and Mr Balderas in the house they shared. They arrested the couple, along with five other suspects.
