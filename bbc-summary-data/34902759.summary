[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were investigating an alleged plan to attack London ahead of the 10th anniversary of the 7 July bombings.
Mohammed Rehman, 25, had discussed possible targets on Twitter under the name Silent Bomber, the court heard.
Mr Rehman and his wife Sana Ahmed Khan, 24, both of Reading, deny charges of preparing terrorist acts.
Before police searched his Reading home, Mr Rehman allegedly said he had rigged up a bomb which could be triggered at the touch of a button at his bedside, saying: "Nobody gets in the way of my Jihad."
Officers found a hunting knife "commonly used in extremist imagery", the Old Bailey heard.
Police also found extremely dangerous chemicals for a large bomb that could have caused "multiple fatalities" and was just days away from being completed on May 28, prosecutor Tony Badenoch QC told the jury.
Mr Rehman, 25, has also pleaded not guilty to possessing an article for terrorist purposes.
The trial continues.
