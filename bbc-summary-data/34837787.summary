A South African court has ruled that two children swapped at birth will remain with the families who raised them.

The parents will also be allowed contact with their biological children.
The mistake came to light when one of the couples split and the father demanded a DNA test to challenge the mother's demand for maintenance payments.
It revealed that neither was the biological parent.
The High Court in Pretoria accepted an expert's recommendation against breaking the strong bonds already formed.
The boy and girl, now aged five, had been unwitting victims of a mix-up in hospital in the Gauteng Province of South Africa.
