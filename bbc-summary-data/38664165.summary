The U's will host Championship club Leeds in the fourth round after beating AFC Wimbledon 3-1 on Tuesday.
The National League side famously beat Coventry, then in the top flight, at the third round stage in 1988-89.
"Coventry was great but the present team are writing their own bit of history," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"No-one will ever forget Coventry but won't it be nice to have something more up-to-date for our younger supporters to enjoy?"

Sutton booked their place in the fourth round thanks to two late goals against the League One Dons in their third-round replay, having drawn the initial tie 0-0.
The tie against the Whites on Sunday, 29 January (14:00 GMT) will bring back memories of Sutton's first appearance in the fourth round in 1969-70, when Leeds beat the U's 6-0 at Gander Green Lane.
"Forty-seven years ago I was very young but I was there when we played Leeds in the fourth round," Elliott added. "Along with the two Wimbledon ties, it oozes nostalgia."
Sutton, who are 15th in the National League, are the lowest-ranked side left in the FA Cup,
With the tie against Leeds set to be televised, their earnings from their run are estimated to reach about Â£500,000 - money Elliott says will "come in handy".
He added: "I am an accountant by trade to it is inbred in me that we don't get carried away with it.
"It is a huge amount of money, and another sold-out gate for us. We will make sure it is used responsibly and wisely."
