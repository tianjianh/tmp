After the late arrival of Boreham Wood's team bus delayed kick-off by 15 minutes, Danny Wright scored from the spot after Danny Woodards' foul on Dan Holman, who then put the Robins 2-0 up.
Harry Pell was felled by Scott Doe and Wright added a second penalty before Danny Haynes replied from 25 yards.
But Holman's strike in stoppage time sealed a fine win for Cheltenham.
Gary Johnson's side are three points clear at the top, while Boreham Wood sit inside the relegation zone in 21st position, one point away from safety.
Cheltenham Town boss Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"It was an enjoyable afternoon, we had to work hard and I thought our spirit was very good; it's very difficult to play the beautiful game on a bumpy pitch.
"I know we've been on bumpy pitches, so a lot of your passes are headers - I know that sounds stupid - but we had to be good passers of a ball with our head.
"The boys showed good control and four goals is a very good return."
