Musician and composer Giorgio Moroder has revealed he is working on a new disco-themed stage musical.

The project "is in the style of disco, using about five of my songs and some new ones," he told Radio 4's Front Row.
"I don't know the story yet. My friend Harald Kloser, a great producer who is currently doing Independence Day 2, is really an expert in writing scripts, directing and music.
"I think he's coming up with a great idea," he added.
Moroder, one of the forefathers of electronic dance music, produced huge hits for Donna Summer during the late-1970s disco era, including I Feel Love and Love to Love You Baby.
He has since collaborated with dozens of artists including David Bowie, Kylie Minogue and Daft Punk.
The 75-year-old has also won three Oscars, including one for best original score for Midnight Express.
He told Front Row presenter John Wilson that he was choosing which of his many hits to use on the production.
"Definitely Call Me (recorded by Blondie in 1980 ) but Flashdance is too typical. Maybe Take My Breath Away (from the film Top Gun)."
Moroder said there were no plans to debut the jukebox-style musical in a Broadway theatre.
"The idea is to have it in the smaller theatres in America," he explained. "The company which is investing has thousands of smaller theatres. Maybe someday we would head for Broadway but [it will be] smaller for now."
With no title or storyline, it is too early to discuss casting but Moroder insisted "we're not going to have big stars".
"We are going to use the original singers and tracks. This is all pre-recorded. Even the new songs we do will be pre-recorded. The show is more like the story behind them."
