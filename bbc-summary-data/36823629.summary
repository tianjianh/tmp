"He's one of the greatest actors I've ever experienced in my career."

That's not a bad accolade for British actor, Mark Rylance, especially when it comes from one of Hollywood's biggest directors, Steven Spielberg.
Rylance, who won an Oscar earlier this year for his role in Spielberg's Bridge of Spies, returns to the big screen this week in the director's adaptation of Roald Dahl's The BFG.

Speaking to BBC arts editor Will Gompertz, Rylance praised Dahl's storytelling.
"He's captured something in this story... that young people hold the key, that young people are not frightened. The BFG has given up but the young person says, 'No, we can change this.'"
The BFG opens in the UK on Friday.
