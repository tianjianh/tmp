Tidworth soldiers in Challenger 2 tank pull record attempt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Soldiers from the Royal Tank Regiment have staged an attempt to set a new world record as the first regiment to pull a Challenger 2 battle tank.

The attempt was made to pull the 62-tonne tank over 100m (328ft) at Tidworth Garrison, Wiltshire.
The team pulled the Challenger 2 tank at approximately the same speed as the Mk1 tank moved over the Somme battlefield 100 years ago.
Judges will decide in March if a Guinness World Record record was set.
Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Nick Cowey said: "We got going fine but really had to work hard for the last 50 metres.
"As we were pulling down and legs were starting to tire, people had to dig in and started cheering each other on, the crowd were fantastic and we got there."
The idea was thought up by Warrant Officer Class Two Harley Upham to commemorate 100 years since the Army put in the order for the first Tanks which were known as land ships.
The RTR was formed by the British Army in 1916, making it the oldest tank unit in the world.
