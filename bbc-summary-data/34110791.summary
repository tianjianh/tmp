The 32-year-old intends to quit the saddle on the last day of the Flat racing season at Doncaster in November.
Turner, the first female British jockey to ride 100 winners in a year, said: "I have loved every second of my career as a jockey."
She has ridden two Group One winners at the highest level in Britain during her career but has suffered a number of injuries.
"I am really excited to be starting a new chapter in my life and am very much looking forward to the new challenges ahead," said Newmarket-based Turner, who will join the team at the At The Races television channel.
"I will continue to stay as focused as ever on my riding until the end of this season and will be hoping to ride as many winners as possible until then."
