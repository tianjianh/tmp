Four Ulster clubs did reach the last eight with Banbridge beating Three Rock Rovers 3-1 while Instonians defeated Annadale on penalty strokes.
Mossley defeated Railway Union and Cookstown were the big winners of the day, 7-1 at Dublin University.
Pegasus, Ards and Ballymoney are into the quarter-finals of the women's cup.
Pegasus had a comfortable 8-0 victory over Dublin side Genesis while Ards beat Lurgan 3-1 and Ballymoney overcame Queens on strokes after the game finished scoreless.
Garvey will be disappointed for allowing two goals in the opening three minutes of the game from Gareth Watkins and Sam Hyland before they levelled matters just after the half hour mark with a quick double strike of their own - a superb solo effort from the impressive Neal Glassey and a deflection from Ryan Getty.
But with just added-on time left to play in the first half another defensive giveaway by Garvey led to a penalty stroke that Steven Cole converted for Monkstown.
The home side would rue missed opportunities in the second half and this is now Garvey's third defeat in a row in all competitions.
Goals from Dane Ward, Matthew Bell and Hugh McShane saw Banbridge ease into the quarter-finals with a 3-1 win over Three Rock Rovers.
In the all-Ulster battle, Instonians edged Annadale on strokes after the game finished 2-2 while Mossley provided the shock of the day as the Ulster League side hammered the IHL's Railway Union 4-1 with Simon Todd grabbing all four goals.
Cookstown's Andrew Smyth helped himself to a hat-trick in a 7-1 victory at Dublin University.
Also through to the last eight are Cork C of I, UCD and Corinthians.
Steph Thompson and Alex Speers each scored twice as Pegasus beat Dublin side Genesis 8-0 while Sara Alexander, Lucy McKee and Kerry Harvey were on target for Ards in a 3-1 victory over Lurgan.
The game between Queens and Ballymoney finished scoreless with Ballymoney going through on strokes.
Belfast Harlequins lost 3-0 at home to Cork Harlequins and holders Hermes-Monkstown hammered Banbridge 6-0 with Irish international forward Anna O'Flanagan scoring five.
Ulster's Katie Mullan was on target in UCD's 2-1 win over Railway Union with Pembroke and Loreto completing the line-up for the quarters.
