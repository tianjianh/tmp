April Reeves, seven, was hit by a car on the A371 while out cycling with her mother and brother in Locking, North Somerset, two weeks ago.
Campaigners said the road through their village was "petrifying" and the 60mph speed limit should be reduced to 40.
North Somerset Council declined to comment during the current police investigation into the collision.
Amy Saul, whose children went to school with April, said the A-road "divided most of the village".
She said: "The road divides the village school, also the post office, the village shop, the park and the town. So no-one can walk to anywhere safely."
Campaigners said the existing footbridge across the A371 had no ramp and could only be accessed by steep steps, making it difficult for buggies and wheelchair users.
Mother-of-four Shelley Adams-Bordon uses the road every day and cannot use the footbridge with her six-month-old baby in a buggy.
Ms Adams-Bordon said: "This needs to change, we need to make our community safer. We hope our local councillors will listen to us, meet with us and we can then discuss whatever we want to happen.
"Primarily we would like to see the speed restricted. We'd like to see the cycle path and footpath moved over closer to the hedge so it's not running alongside the road. And obviously new crossings to keep our children safe."
