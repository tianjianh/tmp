Dhoni is the only Indian athlete on the magazine's annual sporting rich list.
The magazine reports that Dhoni earned US$31m dollars (£19.98m) in the past 12 months.
Boxer Floyd Mayweather earned US$300m (£194m) to top the list, and his rival Manny Pacquiao is in the second spot with $160m (£103.4m).
The third place went to Portugal and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo with his earning of $79.6m (£51.4m).
Dhoni retired from Test cricket at the end of 2014, handing over captaincy to Virat Kohli. But he is still the captain of India's ODI and Twenty20 teams.
He is India's most successful captain and is hugely popular among millions of fans around the country.
He took India to the semi-final of the ODI World Cup in March this year, but lost to eventual champions and hosts Australia.
Pundits say his popularity makes him "a brand ambassador of choice" for many forms.
That explains the breakup of his earnings. The batsman made $4m in salary and winnings, and the rest came from endorsements, reports Forbes.
