Aberdeenshire flooding bill expected to be £7.6m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cost of the clear-up in Aberdeenshire in the aftermath of Storm Frank is expected to be £7.6m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors will be told next week that £1.7m has already been spent.
A large proportion of the money is being spent on repairing and refurbishing 22 flood-damaged council houses in the Ballater area.
Replacing a collapsed section of the A93, near Crathie, cost £300,000.
