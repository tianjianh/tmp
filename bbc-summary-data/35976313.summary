[SN]TITLE[SN]
Payout to Shebbear College sex abuse victims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four pupils abused by a paedophile teacher have received a payout from their former boarding school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victims claimed Simon Harris molested them at Shebbear College in Devon where he was a Latin teacher and deputy housemaster in the 1980s.
Harris, of Pudleston near Leominster in Herefordshire, was jailed for 17 years in 2015 for abusing of three of the Shebbear pupils.
The sentence was also for abusing five Kenyan boys between 2002 and 2013.
He had set up a charity in Kenya in the 1990s and used it to lure children to his home with the prospect of education.
The Methodist Independent Schools Trust, which is responsible for Shebbear College, has settled claims by the four former pupils.
Lawyers for the men would not reveal the scale of the settlement, but claimed Harris could have been stopped from preying on the African boys if the UK victims had been listened to.
Solicitors Leigh Day said one of the British men claimed they tried to tell the-then headmaster but he was shouted at, called a liar and made to feel "like a criminal".
Solicitor Rebekah Read said: "This case highlights why it is imperative that individuals who are alleged to have abused children in the UK are the subject of thorough investigation and, if appropriate, are prevented from travelling abroad.
"We see too many cases where more should have been done in the UK to prevent child abusers from escaping overseas to abuse, often with impunity."
The legal action claimed that the Trust was vicariously liable for the actions of Harris, and that it had a duty to protect pupils.
Harris left the school in 1989 as a result of abuse allegations, and set up his charity in the Kenyan town of Gilgil in the 1990s.
