[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Services have been held at a German war cemetery to remember 10 previously unknown RAF airmen, whose remains were recently identified.

The re-dedication services took place at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Berlin 1939-1945 war cemetery.
A Lancaster and a Halifax bomber crashed while on bombing raids over Germany in January 1944.
New headstones were carved to replace those which previously had no names.
Members of the families of the airmen attended the service after the MoD appealed for relatives to come forward earlier this month.
Lancaster JB640 took off for Berlin on 2 January 1944 with seven crew on board, but was never heard from again.
The other seven-man crew, on Halifax LK709, failed to return from a bombing raid on the German capital on 28 January 1944, when the aeroplane crashed into a lake.
Four members of the Halifax crew already had named graves in the cemetery.
The ceremonies were organised by the Ministry of Defence's Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC) based at Imjin Barracks, Gloucester.
