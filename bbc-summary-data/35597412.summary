The midfielder, who had been relegated to the sidelines after a bout of tonsillitis and an ankle injury, could return to the team as Garde looks to make changes after Sunday's 6-0 home defeat by Liverpool.
The Daily Mirror is reporting that Joleon Lescott has responded to critics following his post-match tweet on Sunday. The defender has told a fan to come to the training ground to meet him as well as retaliating to comments from former Villa striker Stan Collymore.
And the Birmingham Mail has displayed a film made by YouTube stars Copa 90 showing what it is like to be an Aston Villa supporter at the moment. The documentary collates fans' opinions on the club's current situation.
