Birmingham's New Street station has officially reopened after a Â£600m redevelopment.

The revamp includes a new concourse for passengers and a glass atrium allowing natural light into the interior for the first time since the city centre station was redeveloped in the 1960s.
New escalators and lifts have also been installed on platforms.
The station's facelift is part of the larger Grand Central shopping centre development.
Mark Carne, chief executive of Network Rail, said: "We took a really rather awful 1960s station, cut a big hole where the car park used to be, and put in an atrium the size of a football pitch to flood the concourse with natural light."
