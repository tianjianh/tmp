Northampton Saints: No 'regular season' games at Stadium:MK in 2017-18

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton Saints will not play any "regular season" matches at Stadium:MK next season, says the Premiership club's chairman-elect John White.

Saints have used the stadium in Europe and domestically in recent years, and will play their Premiership game against Saracens on April 16 there.
But White, who will replace Tony Hewitt in the summer, says this will be the last "for the foreseeable future".
He added that the club would "never say never" about moving future games.
Stadium:MK is the home of League One football club MK Dons and was one of the venues for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
It was used by Saints in European competition because Franklin's Gardens did not meet regulations that demand knockout games are played in grounds with a minimum attendance of 15,000.
They also used the stadium for a European Cup group game against Munster in 2012, which attracted a crowd of over 22,000.
But White said: "Franklin's Gardens is our home, and we've seen over the years how important it is to have a full stadium and a vibrant atmosphere to give the players the environment in which to thrive."
"We have a unique stadium that is the envy of all of the other Premiership clubs and many in Europe, too, and we have to capitalise on this in the future and retain home advantage."
