Lauri Love hacking case: Suffolk man re-arrested

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British man accused of hacking into US government computer networks has been re-arrested by police in the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lauri Love, 30, of Stradishall in Suffolk, faces charges in the US of hacking into agencies including the US Army, Nasa and the US Federal Reserve.
The Met Police executed an extradition warrant, on behalf of the US, at his house on Ash Walk on Wednesday.
He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court and was bailed until his next hearing on 1 September.
Mr Love was first arrested in 2013 and had computer equipment seized by British police who then released him on bail.
His solicitor Karen Todner said his bail was cancelled over a year ago with no further action having been taken at that time.
Mr Love had begun legal proceedings to get his computer equipment returned by the UK's National Crime Agency.
Twenty-five of 31 items - including laptops, computer towers, memory sticks and hard drives - were given back to him before a court hearing and he withdrew his action.
Ms Todner said his re-arrest came "out of the blue" and he would be fighting extradition.
