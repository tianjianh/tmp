Wall Street closes up on jobs data

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
(Closed): Wall Street stocks rose on Friday, lifted by positive jobs and manufacturing data.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 107.66 point, or 0.6%,  to 17,792.75.
The S&P 500 climbed 13.04 points, or 0.63%,  to 2,072.78 and the Nasdaq was up 0.92% to 4,914.54.
The markets were boosted by 215,000 jobs being created in in March, slightly above the anticipated 200,000. And manufacturing activity increased for the first time in five months.
Shares in US carmakers fell.  They were hit because even though sales in March were strong they were below analysts' expectations.
General Motors shares fell 3.1% and Ford shares dropped 3%.
Petroleum-linked shares dropped on lower oil prices. Chevron fell 1.2% and Marathon Oil 5.2%.
And it was a bad day for US airlines.
Shares in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Continental all fell sharply after Deutsche Bank warned lower corporate earnings could translate into lower demand for corporate travel. Carriers who fly internationally were hit especially hard. American lost 3.6%,  Delta 3.4% and United 5.3%
