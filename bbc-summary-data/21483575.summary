Two inmates have appeared in court charged with murder after the death of a child killer in prison, police said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Subhan Anwar was convicted in February 2009 of murdering Sanam Navsarka, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and given a minimum 23-year sentence.
He was found with a broken neck by prison officers on Thursday night at Long Lartin jail in Worcestershire.
West Mercia Police said two men aged 47 and 44 were remanded in custody by Worcester magistrates.
They will next appear at Worcester Crown Court on 19 February, the force said.
Anwar's partner Zahbeena Navsarka was cleared of her daughter's murder but found guilty of manslaughter and jailed for nine years.
Bradford Crown Court heard that the toddler suffered 107 injuries at Anwar's hands.
During a month-long ordeal a metal pole was used to shatter the child's leg. She died with fractures to all her limbs.
