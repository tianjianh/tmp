The 1Xtra Weekend Breakfast host will become the second solo female to present the show on 25 January.
Current chart host Jameela Jamil has decided to "travel and work abroad", something she's wanted to do her "whole life".
She said that a recent cancer scare had forced her "to just do it, now, while I still can".
Jameela said: "Radio 1 are my family and have been incredibly supportive, and I am absolutely staying at the station but in a role that is flexible enough that I can leave the country for longer periods of time, than if I have a set weekly slot.
"I've literally never had more fun at work in my life than I do with Radio 1, and I hate to leave the chart, but I'm also excited for my next adventure."
Clara Amfo joined 1Xtra in September 2013 as the host of the station's Weekend Breakfast show and more recently made a series of artist-focused documentaries for 1Xtra Live.
She said: "It's an absolute honour to be taking the reins on a show as iconic as the Official Chart. It is a dream come true and I can't wait to announce the UK's number one for the first time."
Ben Cooper, controller of Radio 1 and 1Xtra, said: "Clara is a fantastic presenter with huge potential and I know that fans of the Official Chart will love her energy and passion for music.
"I'm proud that 1Xtra continues to develop young talent for the BBC and the wider industry."
Jameela joined Radio 1 in 2012 to present the station's Sunday night request show and will continue to be part of the Radio 1 presenter family.
