The 23-year-old scored 11 goals in 18 games while on loan at the Rams last season and becomes the sixth player to join this summer.
Darren Bent, Alex Pearce, Scott Carson, Chris Baird and Andreas Weimann have already joined prior to Paul Clement's first season as head coach.
"He is an exciting talent. I am delighted," Clement said.
"I'm aware of the positive impact he had on the side during his time on loan last season from speaking to people at the club, and also watching a number of the matches back myself.
"I feel that we're in a good place with how the squad is looking right now."
The fee for Ince, who had a year to run on his Tigers contract, eclipses the previous record of £3.5m which was paid to Norwich City for Wales striker Robert Earnshaw in 2007.
"I'm over the moon, especially after last season," Ince told BBC Radio Derby.
"We had the disappointment of not achieving what we wanted to achieve, but from an individual point of view it was fantastic for me to get back playing.
"I would like to think that after last season I did everything in my power to try to help the team.
"The fans appreciated that and I appreciated the support I had, not only from the fans but from the players and staff, to get me back on track."
