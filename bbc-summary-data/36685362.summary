The 25-year-old, in her first Games, scored 199.4 in 20 shots to set an Olympic record in her win.
Russia's Vitalina Batsarashkina (197.1) won silver and Greece's Anna Korakaki (177.7) finished with the bronze.
Zhang, ranked five in the world, was the most consistent shooter and none of her rivals could match her, especially once she went into the lead.
