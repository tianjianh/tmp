Fallen soldiers' headstones replaced in Glasgow cemetery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eighty five headstones at the graves of fallen soldiers are being replaced at Sighthill Cemetery in Glasgow after being removed in the 1950s

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) removed 105 headstones after they fell into disrepair.
New headstones will now be erected for 85 of those who gave their lives during both world wars.
One of the headstones is being replaced 100 years on from the day the soldier died.
Gunner James Motherwell of the 51st Division Ammunition Column, Royal Field Artillery, 51st Highland Division, died on 18 October, 1916, aged 32.
He is thought to have most likely died after coming home with injuries or illness sustained during his time fighting in the war effort.
There are also two brothers who will receive new headstones. Alexander Wyper, aged 22, Writer 3rd, Royal Navy, HMS Gunner, who died on 15 May, 1918, and his older brother, John, Able Seaman, Royal Navy, who died on 20 December, 1916.
All those whose headstones had to be removed were commemorated at Dalziel (Globe) Cemetery.
Iain Anderson of the CWGC said: "We are always very pleased to be able to give our men and women who fought during both world wars the commemoration and recognition they deserve.
"Even though our boys were commemorated at another cemetery for the last 60 years when the original headstones were removed, it's very special to be able to re-install the headstones where they lay, so everyone can remember them."
