Tottenham's players are starting to believe they can win the Premier League title this season, says manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Spurs' 1-0 home win over Watford moved them up to second, five points behind surprise leaders Leicester City, who beat Manchester City 3-1 away.
"You can see in their eyes, the feeling, the energy, that they believe," Pochettino said.
"Belief is the most important word. If we believe, anything can happen."
Spurs have not been so high up in the table after 25 games played since 2012, when they finished fourth, and they have not won the league title since 1961.
"It's real, we are in a very good position but we need to keep working and not think too much about the future," Pochettino added.
"For me, historically Tottenham is one of the biggest clubs in England. It is not a surprise we are in a good position. But it is better not to speak too much, only to work hard."
Pochettino's side play away to City themselves next Saturday, when Leicester travel to fourth-placed Arsenal. The Gunners can draw level on points with Spurs before then with victory over Bournemouth on Sunday.
