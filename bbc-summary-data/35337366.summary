There have been several reports of it happening on Church Lane near the Trunk Road flyover in Grangetown, Middlesbrough in the past week.
It is believed a group of five youths are responsible for damaging the roof of one car and smashing the passenger window of another.
Sgt Steve Pattison said someone could be "seriously injured or even killed".
"We repeat these warnings over and over again and a minority still refuse to listen," he said.
"How far does this need to go before they stop?
"It's important that parents know where their children are and what they are up to."
No one was injured in the attacks.
