In January, Tata announced jobs would be lost in the town, citing "difficult market conditions".
All workers have been invited to attend one of four meetings at the plant's academy on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
The plant, which currently employs 4,000 workers, is understood to be losing Â£1m a day.
Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock tweeted on Monday that workers and the community were facing a "difficult time".
