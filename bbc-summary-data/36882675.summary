Melanie Ann Green said in the tribute: "Yesterday was the worst day of my life.
"I know a great many people loved my parents, they were amazing, wonderful, weird people, they opened their hearts to the entire world. They were my world."
Ms Green named the newlyweds as her "Uncle Paul and his partner Sue".
She said the two couples were returning from the wedding in Leeds.
She has asked people "to respect our grief and our privacy".
Traffic Sgt Paul Cording, of North Yorkshire Police, said people at the scene had been confronted by "the carnage of a very serious road traffic collision".
Officers said those killed were from Scarborough and Leeds.
The road was closed in both directions to allow investigators to examine the scene, with it reopening early on Saturday.
Witnesses have been asked to contact North Yorkshire Police.
