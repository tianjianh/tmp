Wade, 28, who plays in Australia's Big Bash for Melbourne Renegades, will step in when Ronchi leaves for New Zealand's tour of Zimbabwe and South Africa.
"Matthew is a great addition and an ideal replacement for Luke," said Bears director of cricket Dougie Brown.
"He will provide power to the middle order and he is a top-class gloveman."
Brown's Bears currently stand fourth in the North Group table, with five points from their first four games, three adrift of leaders Worcestershire.
Wade is currently playing for Australia in their tri-series with South Africa and West Indies in the Caribbean.
He has played in 25 T20 internationals, as well as 65 one-day internationals and has won 12 Test caps.
Ronchi will still be behind the stumps for the Bears' next four games, after which Wade will arrive in time for the away game with Yorkshire at Headingley on Friday, 8 July.
His six-match spell will include only two home appearances at Edgbaston, against Leicestershire (17 July) and Nottinghamshire (22 July).
