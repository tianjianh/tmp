Walsall 0-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fleetwood Town got their promotion push back in top gear as they brought Walsall's winning home run to an end at Bescot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After suffering their first league defeat in four months at home to Bolton on Saturday, Cian Bolger's first-half header was enough to give the Cod Army three points.
The visitors also hit the woodwork through Ben Davies and Ashley Hunter.
It was a poor display from Walsall, who failed to get a shot on target.
Top scorer Erhun Oztumer's last-minute curling left-foot free-kick just wide of the left upright was the closest the Saddlers came to a goal, as they failed to add to their sequence of six straight home wins.
While Walsall are five points adrift of a play-off place, Fleetwood stayed second, in the table, still a point ahead of Bolton, who have a game in hand.
The only goal came on 22 minutes when Bolger headed home a left-wing corner from on-loan Liverpool youngster Cameron Brannagan, who was then denied by a great save to his left from home keeper Neil Etheridge.
From Bolger's initial far-post header, centre-half partner Ben Davies then headed against the bar and after the break, Ashley Hunter went close with an impudent angled lob, before his left-foot shot was touched onto the post.
Fleetwood's victory extended their unbeaten run away from home to 11 matches - but there were only 142 visiting fans there to see it.
Walsall manager Jon Whitney told BBC WM:
"A lot of effort but not a lot of quality. We knew it was going to be very tight. We knew it could be a one-goal game.
"It's always disappointing to concede from a set  piece but Cian Bolger was the difference between the two sides.
"We lost Eoghan O'Connell, who broke his nose five minutes before he came off with some hamstring pain too. But now have to regroup before going down to sunny Southend on Saturday.
"We've got one game less now and you're laying on other people to slip up. But all we can do is control the controllables."
Fleetwood manager Uwe Rosler told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"It's an absolute delight for me, the club and the players that we bounced back against a team who have won six on the trot here and are knocking on the door.
"Especially when I saw who we had unavailable. We were another two players short and had people playing out of position.
"We carried on from Saturday, we played really first half and could have been more than one goal up at half time, we hit the bar and had one cleared off the line.
"In the second half, we were a little bit shaky but we did what we had to. And they did not have one shot on target."
