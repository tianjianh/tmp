Teenagers have said they want to be educated about drugs and alcohol after the death of a 15-year-old girl in Portadown, according to a youth worker.

Police have said a possible link to drugs is one line of inquiry.
The Craigavon Senior High School pupil was reported unconscious in woodland near Portadown's Corcrain housing estate on Saturday evening.
She was taken to hospital in Craigavon but died a short time later. The exact cause of death is not yet known.
A post-mortem examination will be carried out to determine what happened, and police carried out a search for evidence on Sunday afternoon as friends and classmates laid flowers near the scene.
The school has confirmed GCSE examinations would take place as scheduled later on Monday despite the death.
Jordan Russell, who works with young people in the Corcrain area, said: "After this incident happened, kids have approached me to say: 'We want a drugs and alcohol awareness course, we want to be educated, we need to know the difference between right and wrong.'
"If we had a facility where we could take these young people on a Friday night, on a Saturday night, to a facility where we could educate them... They have absolutely nothing.
"They seriously need educated - kids don't know the problems and everything that goes on.
"Nobody believes in these kids, somebody needs to start making a difference."
The death was a tragic loss to both the girl's family and the Craigavon Senior High School community, said associate principal Hilary Woods.
The school has said it would endeavour to keep the environment as normal as possible for the sake of the pupils.
A critical incident team from the Education Authority will be available to give pupils the opportunity to talk through their thoughts and feelings.
