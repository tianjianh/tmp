Caledonian MacBrayne formally signs £900m ferry contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Caledonian MacBrayne has formally signed a new £900m contract to continue operating the Clyde and Hebrides Ferries Network.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
State-owned CalMac had competed with private firm Serco Caledonian Ferries Limited for the Scottish government contract to run the services.
CalMac already operates the routes on the west coast of Scotland, which include the inner and outer Hebrides.
It was named the successful bidder of the new contract in May.
The contract, which was awarded by the Scottish government's Transport Scotland, covers an eight-year period from 1 October.
The deal includes a separate contract which sees CalMac taking responsibility for ferry operations at 24 ports on behalf of Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL).
CalMac managing director Martin Dorchester said: "Now that the contracts have been signed we can start to share information with staff and customers about our ambitious plans to transform the experience of ferry travellers during the lifetime of the contract."
