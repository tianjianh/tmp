[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial service has been held in Turkey for a Bristol woman who was killed in Bulgaria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jan Bennett, 67, and her husband Nick moved to Turkey to start a new life about six years ago and settled in the coastal town of Altinkum.
The couple moved to the village of Malomir in Bulgaria three months ago.
Mrs Bennett was killed while out walking her dog. Ivan Nikolov, 40, has appeared in court charged with her murder.
Andy Probert, editor of Didim Voices, the English newspaper in the couple's former town of Altinkum said there had been "deep shock" in the ex-pat community at the news of Mrs Bennett's death.
The hour-long memorial service was held in Didim at the Cemevi Religious House where the St Mary's Anglican and Ecumenical Christian Fellowship meet on Sundays.
Mrs Bennett was secretary to St Mary's while she lived in Altinkum.
About 50 expats and Turks attended the service, Mr Probert said.
