[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 5-0 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dominant display saw Yeovil run out emphatic winners over Crawley in their League Two meeting at Huish Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A brace from Otis Khan plus additional goals from Tom Eaves, Ryan Hedges and Francois Zoko were enough to see the Glovers move into the play-off places.
Yeovil took the lead inside 16 minutes when Alex Lawless' cross-field ball found Khan who cut inside and released a shot which was turned in by Eaves.
The home side doubled their advantage on 28 minutes. Nathan Smith's ball over the top was not dealt with by the Crawley defence, leaving Eaves to find Hedges to run through and fire powerfully home.
Three minutes before half-time, Yeovil had a third when Khan finished low into the bottom left-hand corner following Kevin Dawson's cut back.
Six minutes after the break, the Glovers further increased their lead. Hedges' initial shot was well-saved by Glen Morris but Khan was first to the rebound.
With 17 minutes remaining, substitute Zoko volleyed home at the far-post from Khan's cross to inflict further damage.
