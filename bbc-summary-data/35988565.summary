World champions Adam Peaty and James Guy hope the momentum generated by their 2015 successes will help push them to Rio Olympic qualification.

The duo secured five world titles between them in Kazan, Russia, with GB claiming a record nine medals.
The pair compete in the British Olympic trials in Glasgow from 12 to 17 April.
"It's a great time to be a GB swimmer because there is so much strength in depth and everyone is pushing each other," Peaty told BBC Sport.
Peaty, 21, and world championship bronze medallist Ross Murdoch will go head-to-head on the first day of competition in the men's 100m breaststroke.
Guy will also line up on Tuesday in the 400m freestyle, the event in which he won world silver last summer in Russia.
"What happened in Kazan is still in my mind, but I have to move on because trials are the most important thing," the 20-year-old said.
The British Olympic trials are the only opportunity for swimmers to gain places for August's Rio Games and the GB selectors will restrict the squad to a maximum of 30 athletes.
Although Peaty won 100m breaststroke world gold and Guy took the world 200m freestyle title, the pair are not just targeting Rio qualification in their favoured events.
With no 50m breaststroke in the Olympic programme, Peaty will bid for a place in the highly competitive 200m event, while Guy will also look for 400m freestyle and 100m butterfly berths.
"I don't think the 200m would be a distraction as the 100m will always be the focus," Peaty said.
"OK, it didn't go that well at the Worlds [failing to reach the semi-finals], but I'd done so much racing that I was just shattered.
"There are advantages to swimming it, though, because there is an outside chance of a medal [in Rio]."
Peaty will be expected to secure a place in the men's 4x100m medley team for the Olympics, while Guy could come into contention should he perform well in the butterfly event at the trials.
Peaty set a 100m breaststroke world record of 57.92 seconds at the 2015 British championships and says he is "strong than ever" after an intense winter training regime and focusing on his racing start.
"I do think it's going to take a world record [in the Olympic final] and that would send out a real message," Peaty said.
"Last year I was losing up to half a second on the start to other swimmers, but I've worked hard on that and I'm not playing catch-up anymore."
Guy, meanwhile, spend much of the off-season training with the Loughborough-based sprint squad, which includes established internationals Fran Halsall and Liam Tancock.
"We went out to Florida and it was a great camp," Guy said.
"Last year I was mostly focused on the 400m, but the gym work I was doing gave me the speed and power to really boost my 200m.
"Now there's more emphasis on the 200m as that will really help the 4x200m freestyle relay where we genuinely think there's a chance of picking up an Olympic medal."
