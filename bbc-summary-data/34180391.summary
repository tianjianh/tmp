Craig Whyte: Prosecutors get extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors have been given an extra three months to bring former Rangers owner Craig Whyte to trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Whyte stood accused in November last year of plotting a fraudulent takeover of the Ibrox club in 2011.
Four other men - David Whitehouse, Paul Clark, David Grier and Gary Withey - also faced charges at that time. All five were granted bail.
The Crown Office were required to serve an indictment against the men by 17 September.
This would be the next step in getting any case to trial.
But, during a special two day hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court, the prosecution requested more time to do this.
Sheriff Sean Murphy QC agreed to a three-month extension following several hours of legal talks.
When he appeared in November, Mr Whyte made no plea or declaration to a charge of being involved in a two-year fraudulent scheme and a second allegation under the Companies Act.
Mr Whyte bought the club from Sir David Murray for Â£1 in 2011. Rangers subsequently went into administration in February 2012.
The fraud charge Mr Whyte faces span from January 2010 to February 2012.
The four other men were also charged with being involved in a fraudulent scheme.
Mr Withey also faced an allegation under the Companies Act.
Mr Grier, Mr Whitehouse and Mr Clark faced an allegation of attempt to pervert the course of justice.
The three were employees of Duff & Phelps, the company which carried out the administration of Rangers.
Mr Withey worked for Mr Whyte's London law firm Collyer Bristow before he took on a post with Rangers.
The four made no plea during the hearing last year and were bailed pending a future court date.
