The Owls went close when Curtis Main's header forced an acrobatic one-handed save from keeper Reice Charles-Cook but Coventry had the better of the chances.
The Sky Blues took the lead when Romain Vincelot headed in from eight yards following Jacob Murphy's corner.
Within seven minutes, Newcastle United loan man Armstrong doubled their lead, sweeping in Murphy's square ball.
Oldham Athletic manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I wanted to win the last two games to keep the momentum going. I don't want to have two much of a downer because what we've achieved is remarkable since we've come in.
"I want to be pushing at the other end. I'll be putting pressure on myself. I'll going to try and build a team that is a John Sheridan team. That's what I'll be judged on next season.
"I've spoken to most of the present players and they all know where they stand. I've got to bring in players that are going to makes us stronger than this season."
Sky Blues manager Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry and Warwickshire:
"There were lots of aspects to be pleased with today. Adam Armstrong got his 20th goal so, all in all, a decent day.
"I think to the supporters of the club an apology really, for the fact that we fell away at the end of the season.
"Try to stick with us as we try to build a team next year to get this club back where we want to be."
