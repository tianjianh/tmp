The 30-year-old matched Britain's best alpine World Cup result when he finished second in Kitzbuhel last month.
The 2017 World Ski Championships from 6-19 February will also feature American Lindsey Vonn, who has only featured in two races since returning from an injured knee and broken arm.
Vonn, 32, has not won gold at a World Championships since 2009 so it may be 21-year-old compatriot Mikaela Shiffrin who takes the glory as she tries to become only the second woman to win three world slalom titles on the trot.
Lara Gut is the host biggest hope of a medal for the hosts. The 25-year-old is in great form in  the super-G and was only beaten by Vonn in a downhill event in Germany recently.
