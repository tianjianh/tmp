Caroline Thomson, 63, who lived near Inverness, was a passenger in an Audi V8 involved in a collision with a Toyota Auris on the A835.
Two men, one of them Mrs Thomson's husband Allan, were injured in the crash which happened at about 22:30 on Tuesday, near the Maryburgh roundabout.
Mrs Thomson was chairwoman of NHS Highland from 1997 to 2004.
She worked as a nurse at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London before moving to Inverness in the 1970s.
In a statement, her family said: "As well as being a loving wife, mother and grandmother Caroline was someone who devoted herself to serving the Highland community.
"She was particularly well known for her time as a board member and Chair of NHS Highland and in the charitable sector.
"We are heartbroken and we know that many of those whose lives she has touched will miss her deeply."
Mrs Thomson was presented with an OBE for her services to the NHS in Scotland in 2003.
In a tribute to her, Highland Council's education director Bill Alexander said: "Children's services in the Highlands are greatly indebted to Caroline's values, wisdom, energy and commitment - as am I."
The current chairman, David Alston, paid tribute to her.
He said: "I am profoundly saddened by the death of Caroline.
"It was Caroline who first encouraged me to apply to become a member of the board of NHS Highland and I can honestly say that she changed the course of my life.
"She cared deeply about our health services and made an important contribution to the Highland community."
Mr Thomson and the driver of the other car have been receiving treatment for multiple injuries at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the crash.
