The wicket is the same one used for the Test match between the sides and England's tour game against Pakistan A.
England lost the Test by 127 runs, although Taylor scored 76 in the first innings.
"The good thing is that some of the guys will be used to the surface," Taylor told BBC Sport.
"Me and Rooty (Joe Root - who scored 59 in the tour match) have spent a lot of time on this particular wicket.
"It is slow and low and it turns similar to the first one-day game in Abu Dhabi (which England lost by six wickets).
"We will relay that information back but these guys have spent some time out here so they should be used to it."
England levelled the one-day series at 1-1 with a 95-run win in the second game in Abu Dhabi, thanks in part to an opening stand of 102 between Jason Roy (54) and Alex Hales - who went go on to make 109 - and a 63 from number three Root.
"The guys can take a lot of positives from the way we played in the second one-dayer against some exceptional spin bowlers as well as a good pace attack," said Taylor.
"In any form of cricket it is important to be dominant, whether that is spin bowlers or seam bowlers and the guys did that exceptionally well, right from the top.
"Alex Hales and Jason Roy took it to them and that is how we want to play - a positive brand of cricket."
Taylor also praised the work of coach Trevor Bayliss and captain Eoin Morgan, who he says have created an "extremely relaxed atmosphere" around the squad.
"Trevor and Eoin work very well together. I love the way they go about their business," he added. "We come together as a team nicely and we can go out and enjoy ourselves and express ourselves to the world.
"It is probably the most I've enjoyed my cricket."
