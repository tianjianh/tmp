The 58-year-old funnyman is to realise a long-held ambition of having a role in ITV's Coronation Street.
Reeves - real name Jim Moir - will play a TV presenter called Colin who comes to Weatherfield to film.
Vic, known for his partnership with Bob Mortimer, said it was "a real thrill to be part of a British institution."
"I've been a life-long fan of Corrie," he said in a statement. "In fact, I think I saw the very first one. I try not to miss any episodes."
Best known for such BBC comedy shows as Shooting Stars and House of Fools, Reeves has made occasional acting appearances in such dramas as Marple and Inspector George Gently.
Kieran Roberts, Coronation Street's executive producer, said the show was "thrilled" to be welcoming "such a well-loved entertainer and a brilliant actor".
Reeves' role will see him interact with regular characters Norris Cole and Mary Taylor after they are chosen to make an appearance on Colin's show.
He will begin filming a three-month stint in July and will appear on screen from late summer onwards.
In 2015 Reeves told the Radio Times it "would make his life complete" to have a role on the long-running soap.
