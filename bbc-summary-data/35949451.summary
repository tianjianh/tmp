Jim Stevenson opened the scoring for the visitors when he headed home Rhys Browne's cross just moments into the second half.
And Browne made certain of all three points late on with a powerful drive from outside the box.
Halifax came close to grabbing a consolation, but Shaquille McDonald's effort was saved by keeper Dan Thomas.
The Shaymen are only two points clear of the relegation zone, while Aldershot climbed one place to 14th.

Aldershot manager Barry Smith told BBC Surrey: "We knew Halifax were on a good run of form and we knew they would come out all guns blazing.
"I felt if we weathered the storm we would always get chances. We've played better but it's not a great pitch and we scored two good goals."
