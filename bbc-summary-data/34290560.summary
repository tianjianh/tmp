Five miles of road from Kincraig to Dalraddy is involved in the first phase of a Â£3bn project to dual the A9 from Inverness to Perth.
A 40mph speed restriction will be in place on the five-mile section from Monday, Transport Scotland said.
Average speed cameras will be used to enforce the speed limit.
