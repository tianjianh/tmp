[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dundee teachers 'opposed' to timetable changes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of secondary school teachers in Dundee are opposed to council plans to introduce a 33-period week, a teaching union has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said only one teacher in 10 of those surveyed supported the proposal.
The new timetable would mean schools finishing earlier on two days a week, though officials say the number of teaching hours would not be reduced.
Dundee City Council said it would "look carefully" at feedback to the plan.
The proposed changes were outlined in a letter to parents which said that the 33-period week will create a "more flexible and efficient" school week.
This will give "greater scope to deliver a range of learning experiences", the letter explained.
Under the plans, school days would begin earlier at 08:45, with later finishes on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday.
But the EIS said teachers in the city had signalled their "clear opposition" to the proposal.
More than 60% of the teachers surveyed oppose the plans, with 26% saying they needed more information.
Dundee EIS secretary David Baxter said: "After a very good response from Dundee members, the results clearly indicate that the majority of teachers do not agree with the council's proposals.
"We hope that Dundee City Council will take cognisance of teacher's views when making any decision surrounding the proposed 33-period week."
Question: Do you agree with the proposed change to a 33-period week?
The EIS said it would continue to discuss the plans with Dundee City Council.
Dundee education convener Councillor Stewart Hunter said: "I can reassure teachers that we will be looking very carefully at the results of our consultation before any final decision is reached by the Education Committee.
"We listened to the views of pupils, parents and staff the last time we considered this move and we will do so again now.
"We believe it would have educational benefits such as an increased flexibility for learners, an extension of personal choice and a good balance of study."
