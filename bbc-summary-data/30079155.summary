The 54-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent went 5-0 up but was pegged back to 10-10 before pulling clear to win 16-13.
Taylor, who dedicated victory to his ill mother, said: "It's been very tough recently with her being in hospital.
"This week's been a little bit of escapism. My mind goes blank for that two or three hours while I'm playing, and I've loved it."
Taylor has won the Grand Slam, contested by players from both the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) and British Darts Organisation (BDO) circuits, in six of the eight years it has been staged.
He topped his group without losing a match before defeating Peter Wright, Michael Smith and Mervyn King on his way to Sunday's final.
"It was very, very tough and Dave didn't give up," said Taylor, who is hoping to win a 17th world title next month.
"If he'd started off the game like he finished it, then it would have been a different kettle of fish."
Chisnall admitted a slow start had cost him the chance to win a first major title in the PDC.
"I'm happy with my performance over the last week but the final got away from me at the beginning," the 34-year-old from St Helens said.
"You can't give Phil Taylor a 5-0 lead, and even though I've been further behind this week, Phil was too good in the end."
