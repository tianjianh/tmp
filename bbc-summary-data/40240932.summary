Champions Trophy: AB de Villiers wants to stay South Africa captain

AB de Villiers wants to stay as South Africa one-day captain and is targeting the 2019 World Cup.

The Proteas were knocked out of the Champions Trophy after a crushing eight-wicket defeat by India.
"I can take us to win a World Cup, I believe," said the 33-year-old batsman. "I'm a good captain and I can take this team forward.
"There's more than enough talent and we've just got to get it right when it matters most."
De Villiers stepped down as Test captain in 2016 and will not play in the four-match series against England later this summer.
At the beginning of the Champions Trophy he was ranked as the top one-day international batsman in the world, but managed only 20 runs in three innings.
And his captaincy was criticised by Test Match Special summariser Simon Hughes, who said: "I don't think he's got much of an idea about captaincy. He seems to be a spectator most of the time."
The defeat in the winner-takes-all Group B match against India is the latest in a stream of tournament disappointments for South Africa, who have won only one knockout match in an International Cricket Council tournament since 2000.
"There's always going be questions until we do get it right," said coach Russell Domingo. "The longer it takes to get over that the harder it will be.
"The selectors will sit down and shape a squad for the World Cup. The majority of this group will be the guys going forward, but maybe there will be one or two tweaks."
India would also have  been eliminated with defeat but now move on to the semi-finals, probably against Bangladesh at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Captain Virat Kohli said he did not believe that South Africa's previous failings in big games made them any more fragile at The Oval, despite the fact the Proteas suffered three run-outs.
"To me, their batsmen looked pretty confident," he said. "If you get two run-outs pretty quickly, then the mindset totally changes.
"Getting their big hitters early was a bonus. We asked our bowlers to make them play difficult shots."
