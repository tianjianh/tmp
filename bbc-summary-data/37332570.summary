Detectives recovered new evidence from the strap of a bag found close to the bus stop where the 18-year-old A-level student was stabbed to death.
Improvements in forensic testing led to the breakthrough, the Met said.
Stephen Lawrence was murdered by a group of six white youths in an unprovoked attack in Eltham in 1993.
Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of his murder and sentenced to minimum terms of 15 years and two months and 14 years and three months in January 2012.
The investigation into Mr Lawrence's death remains open, with around 13 officers still working on the case led by Det Ch Insp Chris Le Pere.
The black leather strap, which did not belong to Mr Lawrence, is believed to have been left in Dickson Road, by the junction with Well Hall Road close to the scene of the murder on 22 April.
The BBC understands there is no suggestion that a woman was at the scene of the attack but officers are seeking to establish who the bag belonged to, and why it was at the spot where Stephen was attacked.
A reconstruction and appeal for information will be shown on BBC's Crimewatch at 21:00 BST on Monday, on the eve of what would have been Stephen Lawrence's 42nd birthday.
His father, Neville Lawrence, will also appeal for further information about the murder.
Officers have spoken to around 110 people in connection with this line of inquiry, and gathered 50 DNA samples.
Police are still trying to trace a man reportedly seen in a distinctive green jacket with a V emblem near Well Hall Road Roundabout at about the time Mr Lawrence was attacked.
CCTV footage, recently digitally enhanced using techniques not available in 1993, showed him in a nearby off-licence hours before the murder took place.
In a sketch by a police artist, based on their accounts, the wearer of the jacket has light reddish hair.  However the man in the CCTV pictures is dark-haired.
Police say he could be a witness.
