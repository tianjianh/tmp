[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An online petition against Aberdeen Airport doubling its fees for the use of its drop-off zone has been launched.

It was announced earlier this month that the fee was changing from £1 to £2, with the airport increasing the length of stay in the drop-off zone from 10 to 15 minutes.
It led to social media criticism, and now a petition calling for a re-think.
Aberdeen Airport said the concern of some councillors had come to its attention, and it aimed to hold talks.
A spokesman added: "The drop-off charge was introduced to ease congestion and manage the traffic flow in what is a restricted area.
"Over the coming weeks and as part of our £20m investment programme, there will be a significant increase in construction traffic using our lower forecourt.
"This will significantly reduce capacity in this area and as a result, we will be encouraging passengers to use the car park.
"These measures will allow us to continue to provide a safe environment for passengers and all our customers during this time and beyond."
