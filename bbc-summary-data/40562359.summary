The 20-year-old, who is yet to make a first-team appearance for the Premier League side, has had previous loan spells with Stockport and Grimsby.
Henderson, 20, spent the first half of last season on loan with League Two side Grimsby Town, where he was signed by Paul Hurst, now the Shrewsbury boss.
He was part of the England squad who won this month's Under-20 World Cup.
"I had a few options but the interest the gaffer has shown in me was massive," said Henderson. "But you've got to show progression and I'm obviously delighted to come here."
He is the fourth Town player signed by Hurst to have played for him before at Grimsby, following defender Aristote Nsiala, and two of his eight signings this summer, striker Lenell John-Lewis and midfielder Jon Nolan.
