Burnley 2-1 Everton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Arfield's 90th-minute winner gave Burnley their third win of the season in a match dominated by Everton at Turf Moor.

It had looked like Yannick Bolasie's first Everton goal had earned his side a point before Arfield fired home after Johann Berg Gudmundsson's fierce shot rebounded off the crossbar.
Kevin Mirallas nearly gave the visitors an early lead but an error by Everton keeper Maarten Stekelenburg allowed Sam Vokes to poke Burnley in front.
Bolasie stole the ball off team-mate Romelu Lukaku before firing across home keeper Tom Heaton to equalise.
Lukaku was twice close to making it 2-1 to the Toffees but Michael Keane and Heaton both made crucial clearances with the Belgium striker ready to pounce.
It is Everton's second league defeat under manager Ronald Koeman.
It was an astonishing finish as Everton had totally dominated after equalising and appeared the only side likely to force a winner.
The Toffees' main downfall was that, after a bright opening, they failed to make the most of their dominance, despite a shot count of 20 to nine in their favour.
Midfielder Ross Barkley was recalled to the side after being dropped at Manchester City last Saturday and tested Heaton with a fierce drive, but Burnley's centre-half partnership of Ben Mee and Michael Keane was tough to break down after a first-minute mix-up allowed Mirallas a clear opening.
Conceding late winners was a habit of Everton's under previous manager Roberto Martinez last season and the Toffees can only hope this defeat is not part of a pattern. After starting the season with a draw and five wins, they are now winless in their past five games, losing three of them.
All of Burnley's 10 points so far this season have been won at Turf Moor and their home form is going to be crucial if they are to stay up.
Midfielder Arfield's strike was the Clarets' first 90th-minute winner in the Premier League, having previously been relegated from the top flight in 2009-10 and 2014-15.
The Canada international, who was raised in Scotland, was prominent throughout this match. After picking up an early booking, he had to be spoken to by referee Mike Jones having committed another foul.
Late in the first half, the 27-year-old burst through and had a shot that Stekelenburg could only parry into Vokes' path for the opening goal with the keeper, who saved two penalties at Manchester City last Saturday, seemingly late getting down to the ball.
There was nothing Stekelenburg could do about the winner with Arfield well positioned to smash left-footed into the far corner and spark bedlam in the stands.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche told BBC Sport: "It was a good performance, a very authentic performance. We went away from what we're good at in the match at Southampton I thought, and we had to remind our players we build on the basics here.
"We know we have to work for everything we get and I thought that was on show today. The two goals, though, they were both real quality.

"We go to take the game on and give a performance, that was the key thing. We know if we get that right we've got a chance of getting something.
"This is a difficult place to come. We've made it that way over the last few years, and we want it to continue of course."
Everton boss Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: "It is hard to take because sometimes football can be so unfair. We did not deserve to lose. We did so many good things but finally the result is not what we want.
"We started well, maybe we dropped a bit for the last 20 minutes of the first half. We played well in the second half, we had a good reaction and had enough chances to score.

"Burnley were very well organised and dropped back, it was difficult but I thought we played well in that time. To travel back without any points is really very disappointing. It's one of those days when you cannot believe you lost the game."
Former England midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day:
"Everton manager Ronald Koeman will be a little concerned by not winning in four league matches, but most coaches look at performance and the performance was much better than it has been in recent weeks. If Everton keep playing like this, they will be fine. They have lots of pace and creativity and they were unlucky."
Former Middlesbrough and Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on Match of the Day:
"I thought Tom Heaton made some good saves and was very busy throughout the game. He is their leader, their captain. It is his second season in the Premier League and you can see that he has grown in confidence and now Burnley are reaping the rewards.
"It is important he does well if they are to have any chance of staying in the league. He is the most improved goalkeeper in the Premier League and his experience with the national team has done him good."
Burnley travel to Old Trafford to take on Manchester United next Saturday (15:00 BST), while Everton host West Ham on Sunday, 30 October (13:30 GMT).
