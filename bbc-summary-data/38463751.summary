The Championship side have the option to extend the Nigeria international's deal by a further year.
Ikeme, 30, has been at Molineux since the age of 15, making 192 appearances and winning both the Championship and League One titles with the club.
"Carl has been terrific since I arrived and I think this is a big signing for the club," said boss Paul Lambert.
"He knows exactly what the club is about and if you get a core of lads like that then they can look after the dressing room as well."
Ikeme joins five other Wolves players in agreeing new deals in December, including Wales international midfielder Dave Edwards.
