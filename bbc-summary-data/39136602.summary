Owner Vincent Tan has said he is in "no rush" to sell the Bluebirds, but would listen to offers.
Warnock hinted it might be worth waiting to see if Cardiff can win promotion to the Premier League before selling.
"The owners don't really matter to me as long as they're supportive," he said.
"Mehmet [Dalman, Cardiff's chairman] and Vincent have been supportive from day one so I haven't got a problem.
"But if they want to sell it I would imagine the best time would be in the next 18 months.
"They'll probably wait and see what happens next year."
Warnock, who signed a new contract on Saturday, has transformed Cardiff's fortunes since his appointment in October, lifting the Bluebirds from the Championship relegation zone to mid-table security.
The 68-year-old has ruled out the possibility of promotion this season - Cardiff are 12 points adrift of the play-off places - but hopes to challenge for a place in the Premier League next term.
Warnock has been assured by Dalman and Tan he will be given the funds to do so in the summer, and the former Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace manager is confident his plans will not be affected should Tan decide to sell the club.
"Not at all. He's probably enjoying it a bit now. The money he's put into the club he should be able to enjoy it," Warnock added.
"Nothing surprises me in football. I knew there were talks about it [selling Cardiff] when I came to the club because I spoke to Mehmet about it.
"But I'd be very surprised if anything happens in the next 12 months because Mehmet's given me assurances. We're all singing from the same hymn sheet."
Tan says he has rejected offers for the club, which he bought in 2010, on "numerous occasions" in the past.
The Malaysian's tenure has been controversial, with a decision to change the team's shirt colour to red prompting a furious reaction from fans.
His reign has also brought success on the field, most notably promotion to the Premier League in 2013, although Cardiff were relegated the following season.
Despite the turbulence of subsequent campaigns, Warnock does not believe speculation about the club's ownership will unsettle supporters.
"I don't think fans give a damn. They've had enough off-field problems over the years," he said.
"You don't realise the factions you get off the field. If a club is unified, it's so much easier.
"There's a lot of bickering in the background of a lot of clubs.
"Everybody has stepped up a gear the last few months and we know we've got to do that next season.
"Everything has settled down, Vincent and Mehmet have been great, players, results and fans too.
"Everyone is in a great place at the moment."
