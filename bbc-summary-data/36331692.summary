Cardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman says the club would consider selling Bruno Ecuele Manga for the right price.

Ecuele Manga, 27, joined the Bluebirds on summer deadline day in 2014 for Â£5m from Ligue 1 side FC Lorient.
The Gabon international has been linked with Premier League side Swansea City as well as French club Rennes.
"At the right price, anything is possible. We don't want Bruno to go, I brought him in and worked hard to do so," Dalman told BBC Wales Sport.
Dalman continued, "He is a quality player and we want to keep our quality players, but if someone wants to come and make a big offer for any of our players, as a business, you have to consider it."
Ecuele Manga has made 55 appearances for Cardiff but suffered an injury-plagued 2015-16 season with knee and groin injuries and also recovered from malaria.
"He did a fantastic job for us, although last season not so much because of injuries," Dalman added.
In January, former Cardiff boss Russell Slade said the move to send striker Kenwyne Jones on loan to United Arab Emirates club Al Jazira was a "financial decision."
