[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Rushe, 55, of Moore, Cheshire, and Mark Fishwick, 47, of Penwortham, Preston, were both sentenced to six years at Liverpool Crown Court for conspiracy to supply a controlled drug.
Rushe is a former director of Northwich Victoria Football Club and Fishwick owns Penwortham MOT Centre.
Police said 14 others involved in the drugs plot had been jailed previously.
They were investigated by the North West regional organised crime unit, Titan, during a 12-month operation that led to the seizure of highly pure class A and B drugs.
Fishwick was arrested at his home in June 2015 on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine.
Rushe was arrested in August after text messages were discovered between the pair discussing large cash payments.
Det Supt Jason Hudson, of Titan, said: "James Rushe and Mark Fishwick are common criminals who thought that by being businessmen they could get away with being involved in large-scale drug dealing. They were wrong."
