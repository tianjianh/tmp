[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A vaccine for meningitis B will be made available for all babies from September.
There were nine cases in Wales in the first five months of 2015.
Meanwhile, students under the age of 25 who are attending university for the first time will get ACWY - a replacement for the existing meningitis C jab - in August.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "Wales is one of the first countries in the world to introduce a nationwide MenB vaccination programme to help tackle the effects of this disease, which can be devastating for children and their families.
"I am very pleased to be able to approve the introduction of the MenACWY vaccine, which will protect teenagers against a number of forms of this disease, ensuring young people are protected at such an important time in their lives."
There will also be a catch-up programme for all 14 to 18-year-olds over the next two years for ACWY and for those children born between 1 May and 30 June, 2015.
