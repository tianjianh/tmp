[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 0-2 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Managerless Coventry City ended this season's 10-game League One winless run by winning at Port Vale - just two days after Tony Mowbray's resignation.

Marvin Sordell and Chris McCann both fired home after the hosts gifted possession to the Sky Blues who, under caretaker boss Mark Venus, became the first team to take any points from Vale Park this season.
The visitors took the lead after 36 minutes when experienced midfielder Michael Brown lost possession to Gael Bigirimana, who charged into the box and pulled back to Sordell, who smashed home from close range.

City doubled their tally after 72 minutes when Paulo Tavares was robbed of the ball in midfield by Daniel Agyei, who found McCann in the box to fire into the roof of the net.
Just six minutes earlier, the away side almost capitalised on one of many Vale mistakes when home keeper Jak Alnwick presented the ball to Agyei from a roll-out, but the keeper redeemed himself by tipping the subsequent shot wide.
City's first league win of the season lifts them off the bottom of the table while Bruno Ribeiro's Vale drop to sixth.
