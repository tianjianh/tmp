Briton Melissa Reid, who was jailed for trying to smuggle drugs from Peru, is to be released from prison, authorities in the country have said.

The 22-year-old, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, and Michaella McCollum, from Co Tyrone, were jailed in 2013 for attempting to smuggle cocaine to Spain.
Reid has served about a third of her sentence of six years and eight months.
McCollum, 23, was freed last month after serving two years and three months in prison.
However, it is anticipated she will have to remain in Peru for a considerable period as part of her parole conditions.
Peruvian authorities said, following a court hearing on Friday, they had agreed to expel Reid from the country.
They said she had met the legal requirements to be released because she had complied with other measures.
A UK Foreign Office statement released on Saturday said: "We continue to provide assistance to Melissa Reid, and remain in contact with her family and local authorities."
McCollum and Reid were caught with an estimated Â£1.5m of cocaine at Lima airport on 6 August 2013 while attempting to board a flight to Madrid, in Spain.
The pair were caught with 24lb (11kg) of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage.
They had claimed they were forced to carry the drugs, but pleaded guilty to charges later that year.
They had faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind-closed-doors plea bargain to secure a shorter sentence.
Following her release, McCollum told Irish state broadcaster RTÃ‰ she had been "very naive, so young and very insecure".
"A lot of times I didn't know how to say no to somebody," she said.
"I kind of just followed along with it and I guess a part of me kind of wanted to be something I'm not.
"But, simply, I made a decision in my moment of madness."
Reid's father Billy has previously said the impact of his daughter's imprisonment on his family had been "horrendous".
He said: "It's horrendous to see your daughter in handcuffs and the living conditions that she has to put up with.
"Melissa has spent her own 20th and 21st birthdays in prison in Peru."
