The double world champion missed the season-opening race in Australia last weekend after suffering concussion in a crash in pre-season testing.
On Wednesday, he took another step towards a return to the cockpit, later tweeting: "Great day. Lots of meetings and simulator work!"
Before he can race again, Alonso must pass a number of medical checks.
The 33-year-old Spaniard, who spent three days in hospital after the crash, is planning to undergo those checks later this week.
It is normal practice for drivers to prepare for the next race in a simulator, but the session will have helped Alonso determine whether his senses have fully recovered from the effects of the accident.
Sources close to Alonso say that he has been concerned by the crash, the causes of which so far are unexplained, and especially by his loss of memory in the immediate aftermath.
But Alonso is determined to race in the next grand prix in Malaysia on 29 March and has posted photographs of his preparations on Twitter.
