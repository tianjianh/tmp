NBA Finals: Cleveland Cavaliers beat Golden State Warriors in game five

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cleveland Cavaliers beat Golden State Warriors 112-97 to reduce the deficit to 3-2 in the best-of-seven NBA Finals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
LeBron James and Kyrie Irving each netted 41 points to become the first team-mates to score more than 40 points in the same NBA Finals match.
Steph Curry scored only 25 points and the Warriors also missed the suspended Draymond Green as they failed to clinch the title on their home court.
Warriors return to Cleveland, where they won the 2015 title, in game six.
No side has come back from 3-1 down to win the Finals but the Cavaliers will feel they now have the momentum on their home court on Thursday to take it to a decider on Sunday.
They hit 10 of 24 three-pointers to hand the Warriors their fourth home loss this season.
It was level at 61-61 at half-time, but Cleveland then outscored their hosts 51-36, with Curry particularly wasteful as the Warriors hit just three of 21 three-points during that period.
It is now 26 consecutive series for James with at least one road win, extending his NBA record.
