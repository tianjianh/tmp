[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gillingham 0-4 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton scored four away from home for the second time in four days, comprehensively beating a disjointed Gillingham to keep their automatic promotion hopes firmly alive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winger Filipe Morais remarkably provided the assists for all four goals, continuing his excellent form.
David Wheater opened the scoring at the back post after four minutes. Then Morais drove down the right at pace in the 15th minute and delivered a pinpoint ball to Adam Le Fondre who made it three in two games with a point-blank header.
Gillingham were reduced to small bursts but could not convert much into a solid chance and Mark Beevers' header on the stroke of half-time killed the game.
Morais continued in the same vein after the restart with a low drive in the 49th minute that was turned in by Josh Vela from just inside the area.
That was enough for some of the home support.
After the fourth goal the game descended into near-testimonial intensity, with the home side trying flicks and overhead kicks, being ironically cheered on by the Rainham End, while Phil Parkinson's team pawed them away.
