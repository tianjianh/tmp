Officers said a staff member and a customer at William Hill in St Leonard's Square were left "badly shaken" after being threatened with a suspected firearm.
The raiders, whose faces were covered, made off with a four-figure sum of money.
The incident took place at about 21:10 on Thursday.
Police said both suspects wore hooded tops, gloves and scarves.
One man wore dark trousers, black trainers with white soles and had a carrier bag.
The second suspect wore a dark hooded jacket, dark jogging trousers with white stripes down the outside legs and white trainers.
Det Sgt Ronnie Douglas said: "We are still in the process of carrying out door-to-door inquiries and everything is being done to trace those responsible.
"We will also be seeking to gather CCTV footage from in and around this area as it may provide us with additional detail on the suspects.
"There are a number of other premises in this area, such as an off-licence, a chip shop and a supermarket, so I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area last night around the time of the incident to contact us."
