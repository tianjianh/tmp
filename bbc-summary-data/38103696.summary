The targets are part of Glasgow City Council's new economic strategy, which also aims for 25,000 new homes and 1,000 Living Wage employers by 2023.
An Â£185m increase in tourism revenue is also being sought by adding an extra million visitors annually. This would create demand for a dozen new hotels.
The council said its targets were ambitious but achievable.
The economic strategy was set out by Council leader Frank McAveety at the 19th annual State of the City Economy Conference.
"We aim to make the next seven years the biggest jobs bonanza in Glasgow's history," he said.
"We know that the 50,000 target is ambitious but we have done the sums and they add up.
"We plan to deliver 50,000 jobs across all of the city's employment sectors, from tourism to high-tech, from renewables to health and life sciences."
Other pledges in the strategy include:
The council said that for the first time its economic strategy had been linked to the city's social policies and meeting challenges on health and poverty.
