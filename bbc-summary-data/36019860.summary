The Briton beat Iulia Coroli of Moldova via unanimous decision in Turkey.
She now faces France's Sarah Ourahmoune in the last eight on Wednesday and must reach the final to book her place in Brazil at the first attempt.
Adams, 33, is aiming to become the first British boxer to retain an Olympic title in 92 years.
Her Great Britain team-mate Savannah Marshall lost to Erika Guerrier of France at the same tournament and will now hope to qualify via the World Championships next month.
There are 36 qualification places for the 2016 Olympics available - 30 for men and six for women.
