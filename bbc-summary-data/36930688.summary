[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boreham Wood 1-0 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Shakes helped Boreham Wood stun last season's National League high-flyers Forest Green Rovers 1-0 at Meadow Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shakes made no mistake when a block by Dale Bennett fell kindly for him in the box on the half-hour mark, rifling past goalkeeper Sam Russell.
Prior to the goal and for long periods after that, Forest Green Rovers, who lost to Grimsby in last term's play-off final after finishing second overall, created chances and just could not finish them off.
Portuguese midfielder Bruno Andrade was a constant threat for the hosts, though, and he nearly rubber-stamped the victory with a late burst into the box, only to be denied by Russell.

LISTEN: Forest Green Rovers boss Mark Cooper's post-match interview
Forest Green Rovers boss Mark Cooper told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:
"You can't expect to win a game when you have as many players as we did. Boreham Wood fully deserved to win the game.
"If you have seven, eight or nine players not at it or not near the top of their game you don't win. We'll put that down to first day blues and move on.
"We were poor in the forward areas, the front players didn't secure the ball, we didn't have any control in the middle of the pitch from where we've been in pre-season. If we lose control of the game we look ragged and we were today."
