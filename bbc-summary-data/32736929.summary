Ewan Gordon, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, grew out his hair and beard to emulate the film character, to run the length of the UK.
He ran about 26 miles each day (42km) for 42 days, from John O'Groats to Land's End.
Mr Gordon did it in memory of Thomas Laurie, who died last year from Cockayne Syndrome - a rare premature ageing condition.
Nine-year-old Thomas, who died last February at Oxford hospice Helen and Douglas House, was one of about 10 children in the UK who have the genetic condition.
Mr Gordon said the idea to run dressed as Forrest Gump started as a bet.
In the 1994 film, the title character, played by Tom Hanks, ran across America, attracting a group of followers.
Mr Gordon, who left John O'Groats on 4 May, said other runners had also joined him along the route.
"People just think it's really funny and a lot of people just shout 'run Forrest run'," he said.
On arriving at Land's End on Sunday, Mr Gordon said he was "delighted" to have finished.
He added: "I haven't got a single blister - your body just gets used to running that far every day."
Mr Gordon's run has so far raised almost Â£9,000 for three charities that supported Thomas and his family: Respite Nursing for Oxfordshire's Sick Youngsters, Helen and Douglas House, and Amy and Friends, a Cockayne Syndrome support group.
Thomas's mother Catherine Laurie said: "We are so very proud of Ewan and totally humbled by his fundraising in memory of Thomas."
