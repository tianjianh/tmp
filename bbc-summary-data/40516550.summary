[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Cody, of no fixed address, had been found guilty at Caernarfon Crown Court of killing David Kingsbury, 35.
The fatal attack took place in Old Colwyn on 5 January.
Sentencing Cody to life in prison, judge Mr Justice Griffith-Williams told him his criminal record was "as bad as they come for someone of your age".
He said: "You carried that knife because you are a committed criminal and an associate of criminals, and happy to throw your weight around in the Colwyn Bay area."
The judge added that while Mr Kingsbury had been very drunk and abusive to Cody, most people would have treated his insults "as the ramblings of a drunken man".
