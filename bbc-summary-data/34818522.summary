[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wes York scored the winner in the second half, adding the slightest of touches to Dominic Vose's low cross.
Aldershot, who had been on top before the goal, then lost midfielder Jake Gallagher as he collected two yellow cards in the space of six minutes.
The visitors had little problems protecting the lead, with Sean Newton going close to doubling the lead.
Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey:

"I don't think there was a lot in the game but a lapse in concentration allows them to score at the other end and if they have a lapse of concentration we don't put in the net.
"That's been the story over the past few games, with not taking our chances.
"We've got to be picking up the guy that scores and if you make those mistakes you don't win games. We know what Chris Barker's experience has got him through the game but it does show how threadbare our squad is. We put him in at centre-back which is not somewhere I would see him play but he did his job.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales:
"Our shape was really good and we had to be patient again.
"But I always feel there's goals in us, I always feel one of our front five are going to score for us.
"I thought we deserved to win, there's no two ways about that. To win 1-0 away from home is a great result for us."
