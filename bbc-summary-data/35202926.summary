[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Kearns, 34, had just finished having a meal with his wife at a restaurant above a pub in Blackhorse Avenue near the Phoenix Park.
He was in his car with his wife when a lone gunman fired several shots at them.
Mr Kearns was hit in the head and died at the scene.
His wife remains severely traumatised and police said she was lucky not to have been shot also.
The gunman escaped in a 5 series BMW. The car was later found burned out on nearby Regal Park and men were seen fleeing the scene.
Police believe the murder is linked to drugs and organised crime and that Mr Kearns - a convicted drug dealer - was targeted.
