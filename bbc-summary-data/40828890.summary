Kim backed up her opening 65 with an eagle and three birdies in torrential rain to reach 11 under and leave her clear of England's Georgia Hall (67) and American Lexi Thompson (68).
Overnight leader Michelle Wie followed her course record 64 with a 76.
"I think it [the rain] was about as bad as it could get," Kim said.
"But I really enjoy playing here. If I had to play golf anywhere in the rain, this would be the course."
American Ally McDonald sits fourth after a 68, one clear of England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff, who posted a 70.
Sally Watson is the only Scot out of the seven starters to have made the cut, posting a 69 that included an eagle on 11 to sit three under in a tie for 34th.
Hall led for most of the day thanks to four consecutive birdies and a solitary bogey in a stunning front nine. She added three more birdies on the way in to put herself in a great position for the final two days.
"I don't think I've had four birdies in a row before," Hall said. "I holed some great putts and I'm playing really well."
Another player who hit a hot streak was Thompson, who managed to go one better than Hall with five birdies in a row at the start of the back nine, as well as another on 17, to roar into contention.
British number one Charley Hull hit three early bogeys on her way to a 71 that leaves her five under for the tournament.
England's Mel Reid is also on five under after a 72, with compatriot Sophie Lamb a shot further back after a 71.
