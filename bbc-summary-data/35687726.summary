Premier League predictions: Lawro v The Coral frontman James Skelly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for the midweek Premier League fixtures is The Coral frontman James Skelly.
After a five-year break the Merseyside band have a new album coming out and and are about to start a UK Tour.
Rehearsals before they hit the road meant Liverpool fan Skelly had to miss a trip to Wembley on Sunday to watch the Capital One Cup final.
"I had a ticket but it was the last day I had to sort everything," Skelly told BBC Sport. "So I had to watch on telly instead."
Liverpool's form has been inconsistent since Jurgen Klopp took charge in October but Skelly believes he will get things right.
He added: "I like Klopp a lot. He is a class manager, everyone knows that.
"It is going to take him a bit of time because he has an imbalanced squad but if we had our best team out all the time, we would probably be challenging for a top-four place now.
"It is really refreshing to hear him talk and he is passionate too. I sometimes sit right behind him in the main stand at Anfield, and I just end up watching him if the game is rubbish."
Skelly's best moment as a Liverpool fan was the 2005 Champions League final when they came back from 3-0 down at half-time to beat AC Milan.
"It has to be Istanbul," he explained. "Me and my mate tried to leave at half-time but we were locked in.
"Instead we just thought we would eat a load of choc-ices and eat the pain away but as we celebrated goal after goal we lost the choc-ices and ended up waving the sticks in the air. It would have made a great choc-ice advert actually."
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last week, Lawro got five correct results from eight Premier League games, with no perfect scores. He also incorrectly backed Liverpool to win the Capital One Cup
His score of 50 points saw him beat Nobby Butcher - aka Sacha Baron Cohen, who picked two correct results but no perfect scores for a total of 20.
Lawro and Nobby can still pick up extra points for their predictions for the Premier League games which were postponed at the weekend because of the Capital One Cup final - Liverpool v Everton and Newcastle v Man City.

Match report
Arsenal are my tip for the title but they were so disappointing in their defeat by Manchester United on Sunday.
The Gunners have so many good players but they are such a strange team - every time you think they will kick on, they throw in a performance like that.

Swansea put up a good fight against Tottenham and Lukasz Fabianski made some great saves to keep them in it, but they still lost and it is hard to see them getting anything at Emirates Stadium.
To have any hope of winning the title, Arsenal quite simply have to win.
If they don't, for whatever reason, their fans are going to have a real moan. Even if they do, there are going to be a lot of people doubting the Gunners ahead of Saturday's north London derby.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
James's prediction: 2-0
Stoke are going well - previously they struggled a bit for goals but on a good day they have now got more than one match-winner, which makes a big difference.
Newcastle, who remain in the relegation zone, have not had a game for 18 days and have been at a training camp in Spain.
This is not the game they need right now and I just do not fancy their chances at the Britannia Stadium.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
James's prediction: 1-1
A lot of people are looking at Tottenham and thinking they can win the league - and they probably think they can themselves as well.
But this is a tough game for them because West Ham are not just a skilful side, they are very strong too.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
James's prediction: I want West Ham to win but Spurs are on a roll. 1-2
This game comes three days after Manchester City beat Liverpool on penalties in the Capital One Cup final and I don't see Jurgen Klopp's side getting much in the way of revenge.

Firstly Klopp must decide what kind of team to put out, but City manager Manuel Pellegrini has to put out another strong side because he cannot afford to drop any more points.
It is no coincidence that City play well when the spine of their team - Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Sergio Aguero - are fit and in form.
Just like at Wembley, Liverpool's first task is to stop City. Too many of the Reds players went missing in the first half at Wembley, and they cannot afford to let that happen again.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
James's prediction: I said before Sunday that whoever wins the League Cup will lose this game, and I obviously hope that is the case now. I could never back against Liverpool anyway though. 3-2
The goals have started flowing for Manchester United again, and they have 11 in their last three games - although eight of them were against Shrewsbury and FC Midtjylland.
I think Watford will be a tougher nut to crack defensively and they will also look to hit United on the break, so they will cause Louis van Gaal's side some problems.
Lawro's prediction: 1-2
James's prediction: United are having a difficult time but Liverpool fans are not really in a position to be laughing at anyone at the moment. At least we are used to being pretty rubbish, while it is a whole new thing for their supporters.
Also, we can see there is a clear plan for us under Klopp now - things are a lot more uncertain for United but, if they get Jose Mourinho as their next manager, then they will have a couple of decent seasons. 2-2
