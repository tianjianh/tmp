The Scottish SPCA is seeking the owner of a stray Harris Hawk who was found near Blair Drummond Safari Park.

The animal welfare charity was alerted by a member of the public to the hawk, named Evis by staff, on 3 April.
Harris hawks are often used in falconry as they are one of the easiest birds of prey to train.
Scottish SPCA centre manager Colin Seddon said the bird was a slightly underweight when brought in but was now "doing well."
He said, "Evis is doing well in our care, but we would like to reunite him with his owner as soon as possible.
"When he was reported to us it was said he was harassing nearby ducks.
"However, he did have tassels on and was relatively easy to catch, which leads us to believe he is tame."
