Bournemouth forward Lee Tomlin has claimed that Bristol City are yet to make an official bid to sign him.

The 27-year-old scored six times in 18 games after joining the Championship club on loan in January.
Earlier in June, Bristol City's chief operating officer Mark Ashton said they were in "constant contact" with Tomlin.
"I know I've had a lot of messages from the Bristol City fans but no official offer has been made," Tomlin posted on his Twitter account.
Having joined Bournemouth from Middlesbrough for Â£3m in August 2015, Tomlin has a contract with the Cherries until 2018.
"It's difficult for me to talk about it because he's a Bournemouth player," City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Points West.
"I'd be upset if other clubs were talking about our players. All I'll say is, everybody knows he was loved here.
"I enjoyed working with him and if there is ever an opportunity to bring a player of that quality in, of course we'd be interested.
"He had a fantastic spell. If it becomes possible, we'll certainly be at the front of the queue."
Johnson has already added Norwich midfielder Gary O'Neil and Preston North End midfielder Josh Brownhill to his squad ahead of the 2016-17 season.
"I'm OK with where we are," Johnson added. "I'd like to have had one or two (more) but we're certainly in the mix for three or four.
"It's just a case of 'can we get them over the line?' But of course there is serious competition, because we're after good players.
"Josh Brownhill is a really good signing for us because we got him at a good price, taking advantage of the rules really, to be able to get him in.
"He took less money, believe it or not, which is a trait of his character, to come to the right club that he thinks is right for his development.
"Gary O'Neil has been there and done it, and will hopefully help people like Josh Brownhill. He's certainly still got his mobility in his legs and that was the key thing is us bringing him in."
Bristol City finished 18th in the Championship last season.
