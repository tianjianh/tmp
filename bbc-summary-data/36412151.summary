Reading's Danson, who has scored 89 international goals, suffered a hand injury in February and missed Test series against Australia and Germany.
Great Britain play the Dutch in Amsterdam on Tuesday and Thursday.
"We're looking forward to testing ourselves against the number-one-ranked team," said GB coach Danny Kerry.
East Grinstead's Laura Unsworth and University of Birmingham's Lily Owsley are also fit again after injuries and included in the 20-strong squad.
"It is good to have Laura, Alex and Lily back after long periods of injury and it will be good to have competitive match play to help bring them up to match speed," added Kerry.
England came from 2-0 behind to beat the Dutch on penalties to win the EuroHockey Championships in August, with Danson picking up the player of the tournament award.
