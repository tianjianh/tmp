[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Ham United v Liverpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Noble and Cheikhou Kouyate will miss West Ham's final two games after surgery on long-standing injuries.

Andy Carroll, Michail Antonio, Pedro Obiang, Diafra Sakho, Angelo Ogbonna and Arthur Masuaku remain sidelined.
Roberto Firmino and Lucas Leiva are both doubts for Liverpool because of muscle problems.
Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge are in contention to start after making several substitute appearances following returns from injury.
Alistair Mann: "Having spoiled Tottenham's pursuit of the title in their last game, West Ham now have the opportunity to wreck another team's plans by damaging Liverpool's target of Champions League football.
"With arguably their best performance of the season, the Hammers not only demonstrated what they are capable of when everything is in sync, but also proved that the London Stadium can work to their advantage - if they harness the fervent atmosphere their huge new home can generate.
"Despite entering the weekend in third, a run of just one win from their last three games has been extremely untimely for the visitors, who will feel any further dropped points may well irrevocably floor their ambitions."

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "Everything is still in our hands. All the teams have to play tough games and no-one wins all of them. Now we have to win ours and it will be fine.
"A week ago we thought we had to win all three. Now we know a draw and a win could be enough depending on other results.
"That is the situation so let's feel the opportunity together."
West Ham manager Slaven Bilic on Andy Carroll's injury problems: "Andy is kind of a player that has such a big impact on our game that we won't give up on him.
"Especially now as this has nothing to do with lifestyle or not being committed enough. He works really hard, it was bad luck and, as I said, I will never give up on him.
"On the other hand it is no good having a player whose name you put down first, second or third and can't rely on him."
I think Liverpool will need to win their final two games to make the top four - but I am just not convinced they will do it. I don't think they will get three points against West Ham for starters.
