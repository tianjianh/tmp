But, a water tower, the site of a World War Two anti-aircraft gun and the home of a shrunken head collector are three which have been added.
Historic England (HE), formerly English Heritage, compiles the annual UK-wide list and award funding for repairs.
Its figures show that 43% of Yorkshire sites have been removed from the register, up from a target of 25%.
Tammy Whitaker, of HE, said that was an "amazing achievement" for the county.
Across England, 604 sites were removed and 324 were added. Ms Whitaker said in Yorkshire 36 sites were removed and 19 added.
Sheffield's non-conformist chapel at the General Cemetery was classed as no longer at risk.
"The very things that make our region special are the things most at risk," she said. "If they're lost, then a sense of that region is lost too."
Bramham Biggin, an 18th-century manor house in Leeds, Wressle Castle in East Yorkshire which was once owned by Henry VIII, the 14th-century Ayton Castle near Scarborough in North Yorkshire, and Pontefract Castle in West Yorkshire have all been removed from Historic England's list.
The body awards and organises tens of thousands of pounds in grants.
Walkington anti-aircraft gun site, added to the register this year, was built in 1941 in a chain of East Coast defences to protect Hull and Yorkshire from air raids.
Places in West Yorkshire also off the at-risk list, include Blacker Hall in Wakefield, Dalton Mills in Keighley and Illingworth Gaol.
In East Yorkshire, Flamborough Castle with its prominent chalk ruins has been offered an HE grant.
In North Yorkshire, a management scheme is planned for the Howardian Hills while a six-year scheme to repair sites on the North York Moors National Park has just ended. Proposals to restore Whorlton Castle's gatehouse have collapsed.
