[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tory views: Is Labour finished?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The election of Jeremy Corbyn has been seized on by the Conservative leadership as a chance to dominate the centre ground of British politics - some have even reportedly suggested they could lock Labour out of power permanently. What do party members in Manchester think?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"I think Mr Corbyn is quite an opportunity. He is a rallying call to the socialist wing of the Labour Party. The Blairite wing must have gone home crying. The big thing for us is that he is very pro-nationalisation. He is very Old Labour. Some of us are old enough to remember what it was like and it will just make us campaign harder. I don't think we can afford to be too smug.
"Corbyn looks very Old Labour and quite silly from our commercial point of view, but we can't just take him for granted. We actually have to compete and make it very clear why he's wrong and what he's wrong about."
"He (Jeremy Corbyn) is already capturing the headlines. You've only got to look outside to see all the protesters. The number of people who have been excited by what he can offer. I think the danger is that we can take it too lightly, perhaps. I don't think he can unite the left but I think he'll do a jolly good job at pulling together those that had already lost some hope under Miliband. So he's got as good a chance as anyone else I guess."
"I don't think the Tories should underestimate him. I think in five years time if Corbyn is still in the position he is in I think he will be quite formidable. I think what Corbyn offers to certain groups in society is hope and belief and I think the Tories need to work on that front, especially over five years. Some Tories can be seen as a bit cold. I think that wins elections but in the long run I think people respect you if you seem to care about them. And I think Tories do care but we just need to get the message out properly.
"Even before Corbyn was elected I was not as hopeful as some Tory members, who were thinking that's Labour done for two generations. I don't think that's the case whatsoever. I think we will be surprised over time with Corbyn and what he can do for the left."
"I think the election of Corbyn is in some respects very similar to the strength of UKIP. He represents a real drive from certain parts of society that feel left behind. And I think our party need to think about how we address and include those people so that there isn't a whole tranche of society that feel dispossessed and want to go off and support people like Corbyn and like Farage, because they feel like they give them a voice. Not the right voice, in my opinion, but a voice. And that's something we can't be complacent about.
"One Nation Conservatism has always sought to represent everybody but I am not sure it's doing a very good job of talking to that section of society right now. And that's something that's good food for thought for the party I think."
"I would say it's a time not be complacent. I think we need to focus on the Labour Party's policies and counteracting those as opposed to attacking individuals in the party. It's for Labour to decide on their future direction and we have to oppose that where necessary and work in consensus where possible. I think they are making it difficult for themselves. I wouldn't be as arrogant to say that they are finished. Political parties go through cycles. We have gone through cycles ourselves and I think it's an opportunity for them to perhaps reassess where they want to go as a political force and what they want to achieve."
"I can't see Jeremy Corbyn as a viable prime minister for the country. I think we'd be in for 'back to the seventies'. I think they have got a hard task on their hands to bring themselves back to a tangible, electable party. You always want a good opposition because I think you always want something to bounce things off. If you have no opposition, that's when you become dictatorial. But I think it will be a long time before they can get back into the centre ground and get back into power. I can't see Labour being back in for years because it will take ages now before they can turn themselves around. I think they have boxed themselves into a corner."
