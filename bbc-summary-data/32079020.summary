Neglected horse numbers 'critical' in Wales, says RSPCA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of unwanted and neglected horses, ponies and donkeys in Wales is at a "critical" point, according to the RSPCA.

It has launched an urgent appeal for homes for the animals after it said it had no room in its rescue centres for any more.
There are currently about 640 horses in RSPCA care in England and Wales.
In Wales alone the charity dealt with 2,166 complaints about the animals last year.
The most came from Swansea (289) and Cardiff (229), while 203 came from Carmarthenshire.
The RSPCA said the main reasons for horses being taken into its care were injuries, starvation, untreated wounds and irresponsible ownership.
RSPCA Cymru's Steve Carter said: "The situation in Wales remains critical and the number of equines dealt with by RSPCA officers, that have been neglected and abused, is worrying.
"The numbers of calls we are receiving remain a strain but the work that is being done by the RSPCA is paying off thanks to a lot of hard work being put in."
