Bristol City will be without Wales defender Adam Matthews for up to four weeks because of a hamstring injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old, on loan from Sunderland, had a scan on the injury on Monday, which he suffered in Saturday's 1-0 loss to Newcastle United.
He has made three appearances for the Championship club so far this season.
The club's website said: "It's positive news for the defender, as a more serious hamstring tear could have sidelined him for up to 10 weeks."
