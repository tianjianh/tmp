Waight Keller takes over from Ricardo Tisci, who left the label at the end of January after 12 years in charge.
Waight Keller, who announced earlier in January she was leaving Chloe after five years, will be the first woman to run Givenchy's creative side.
She unveiled her final collection for Chloe at Paris Fashion Week.
Waight Keller, whose appointment was announced on social media, takes on a post previously filled by John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Julien Macdonald.
In a statement, she said the "confident style" of label founder Hubert de Givenchy had "always been an inspiration".
According to the Telegraph, her appointment may signal a "tonal shift" towards a "more classic, feminine vision".
Waight Keller studied at the Ravensbourne College of Art and the Royal College of Art before going to New York to work at Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren.
She went on to work with Tom Ford at Gucci before spending six years as creative director at Pringle of Scotland.
