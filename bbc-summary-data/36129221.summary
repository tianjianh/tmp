The group, formed in the city 20 years ago, will play Glasgow University Union debating hall on 13, 14 and 15 June.
Their participation was announced as WEF organisers published the programme of events, which run from 3-26 June.
The Byres Road parade has been dropped from this year's event but organisers said it would return in the future.
WEF chairman Liz Scobie said: "The West End Festival is 21 today and all of us connected with it feel very happy that we've reached this major milestone.
"Over the years we've grown to become the largest community festival in Scotland and this is due to the efforts of a small army of dedicated staff, volunteers who donate their time and effort, and numerous supporters and sponsors who give us their money and encouragement."
Organisers said the festival would feature more than 400 events, including a festival of singing, a big band concert and a series of rock concerts.
Many of these will be held at the bandstand in Kelvingrove Park.
Among the highlights will be Capercaillie's Karen Matheson performing at Maryhill Community Hall, an "All Dayer" at the Oran Mor venue in Byres Road, the Gibson Street Gala and "Sounds of Shakespeare" at St Bride's Church, commemorating 400 years since the Bard's death.
