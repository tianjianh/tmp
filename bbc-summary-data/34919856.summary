Officers found the silver Nissan Micra stuck in mud off a Middlesbrough road.
Cleveland and Durham Road Policing Unit said both driver and front passenger seats were missing, but the back seats were intact.
"By the time we found it the occupants had it stuck in the mud and had abandoned it, leaving their best garden furniture behind," the unit said.
The Facebook post said officers found the car after being called to "a report of a vehicle being used anti-socially off road at Skippers Lane".
The uninsured vehicle has now been recovered.
