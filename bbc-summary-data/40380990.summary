Stefan Campbell, Joe McElroy and Oisin O'Neill are the trio to drop out for the all-Ulster encounter at the Athletic Grounds.
Cavan are also in 1B qualifier action on Sunday and they make two changes for the trip to take on Offaly.
Jason McLoughlin and Dara McVeety come into the Breffni side.
Cavan pushed Monaghan all the way in the Ulster SFC semi-final derby a fortnight ago ago but lost out by three points.
Campbell was Armagh's top scorer in the league campaign but he failed to register a score in the Ulster SFC defeat by Down and he drops to the bench.
McGeeney also makes positional switches with Aidan Forker going from half-forward to half-back and Mark Shields moving into the attacking slot.
Armagh and Fermanagh are meeting for the first time in the championship since 2010 when the Orchard men won a round two qualifier tie by 0-11 to 0-7 in Enniskillen.
Fermanagh's last championship win over Armagh was in the 2004 All-Ireland final.
Limerick host Wexford in the opening 1B qualifier on Saturday while London meet Carlow in Ruislip on Sunday.
Armagh: B Hughes, J Morgan, C Vernon, A McKay, A Forker, B Donaghy, P HUghes, S Sheridan, N Grimley, M Shields, A Duffy, R Grugan, J Clarke, A Murnin, G McParland.
Cavan: R Galligan, P Faulkner, K Clarke, J McLoughlin, J McEnroe, C Moynagh, G Smith, L Buchanan, G McKiernan, C Mackey, D McVeety, M Reilly, N Clerkin, N McDermott, S Johnston.
