Euro 2016: Qualify before new Wales deal says Chris Coleman

Wales manager Chris Coleman says he will begin negotiations about a new deal if his side qualify for Euro 2016.

Coleman, appointed in 2012, has held tentative talks about a new contract.
But with Wales top of Group B ahead of September's double-header against Cyprus and Israel, the 45-year-old is waiting until qualification is secured.
"If that happens - and I believe it will - then we can sit down and talk about me signing a new contract," said Coleman.
Wales' 1-0 win against Belgium in June has given them an excellent opportunity of qualifying for a first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup.
Coleman's side are three points clear of second-placed Belgium in Group B, knowing that victories against Cyprus and Israel coupled with a failure from Bosnia-Herzegovina to win in Belgium would guarantee their passage to Euro 2016.
Wales' recent success earned them top-seed status and a relatively favourable draw for their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign.
It was after July's draw in St Petersburg where Coleman and the Football Association of Wales first broached the subject of a new contract.
"We all went out for dinner while we were there and had a chat," said Coleman.
"My reason for not wanting to get into negotiations about a new contract is because all I think about is doing this first part of the job, and that's qualifying for France.
"Managing Wales, I've always said that is the biggest job I'll ever have. It's the biggest honour I'll ever have as a manager no matter what happens to me afterwards.
"I don't want to give that up lightly - of course I don't. Nevertheless I still want to make sure we get this job done.
"That means keeping our focus on this campaign and not worrying about the next one."
