Two schools involved in the Trojan Horse affair have been removed from special measures, their trust said.

Birmingham's Nansen Primary and Rockwood Academy, formerly called Park View, were deemed "inadequate" when they had their last full inspection in 2014.
They were now rated "good" by watchdog Ofsted, CORE Education Trust said.
It said both schools had appointed new head teachers, senior leadership teams and governing bodies.
The Trojan Horse affair was sparked by an anonymous letter which claimed hard-line Muslims were trying to get their own members on to governing bodies to try and oust head teachers at some schools in the city.
As a result, five Birmingham schools were put into special measures by Ofsted.
Academy sponsor CORE Education Trust said Nansen Primary and Rockwood Academy, both in Naseby Road, had now been rated as "good" overall.
They had also been rated "good" in every category they were inspected, including pupil outcomes, quality of teaching and effectiveness of leadership and management, it added.
The trust said inspectors were left impressed by the efforts made by all to transform the education being provided to Nansen's 930 pupils aged three to 11 and Rockwood's 590 pupils aged 11 to 16.
Cath Rindl, who has been interim head teacher at Nansen since April 2015 and will take on the position permanently from September, said the news was "testament to the hard work of all those involved in the running" of the school.
Fuzel Choudhury, who was appointed principal at Rockwood Academy last September, said she had been "heartened by how staff, parents and pupils alike" had embraced a "passion for positive change".
