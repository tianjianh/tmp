Daley, 21, and Reid, who turned 20 on Monday, won the mixed 3m synchronised event with a score of 321.06 at the Olympic Park Aquatics Centre in London.
Daley told BBC Sport: "I can't believe what has just happened.
"Grace and I were only put together 10 days ago and to come away with a European gold on a board that I never train on, I'm just over the moon."
Italians Maicol Verzotto and Tania Cagnotto took silver and Russians Nadezhda Bazhina and Nikita Shleikher bronze.
Daley will also compete in the synchronised 10m platform on Thursday and individual 10m on Sunday.
Reid, who will compete in the individual 3m springboard on Saturday, said: "Today was a great day and there's a lot to take away from it and just build on it this season.
"My eyes are on the Olympic trials (in June), but there's another event to go here first."
This is the first European diving final in which men and women have competed together.
Mixed events were included for the first time at last year's World Championships following approval by international governing body Fina in late 2014.
Georgia Ward and Matty Lee won team bronze for Britain on Monday.
