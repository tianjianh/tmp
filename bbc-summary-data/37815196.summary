Nick Kyrgios ban to be cut after 'care plan' agreement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
World number 13 Nick Kyrgios could have his eight-week tournament ban cut to three after agreeing to a "care plan".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Australian was banned and fined for behaviour, including "lack of best efforts", at the Shanghai Masters.
The ATP confirmed the 21-year-old had "taken up the care plan on offer" but details are "strictly confidential".
If he completes the plan, Kyrgios can play from 7 November rather than the initial ban expiration date of 15 January 2017.
Kyrgios came under scrutiny after his 6-3 6-1 defeat by Mischa Zverev of Germany, in which he returned serves tamely and received a code violation for verbally abusing a spectator.
Tennis Australia has said it is "our responsibility" to help Kyrgios.
Last year, he was fined $1,500 (Â£1,230) for a foul-mouthed outburst while playing in Shanghai, China.
That came two months after he was given a suspended 28-day ban for making a sexual comment about Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend during a match.
Earlier this year, his attitude was questioned after he lost convincingly to British world number two Andy Murray in the fourth round at Wimbledon.
