What is even more remarkable is that Gughan Ramakrishnan only started studying for his exam at the beginning of this year.
Gughan was a pupil at St Joseph's Primary School in west Belfast's Slate Street when he sat the exam in June.
His father said the family were delighted at his success.
"Gughan was ready to go to cricket training at Stormont when the principal of St Joseph's Primary School called me about the GCSE result," Mr Ramakrishnan added.
"We were delighted, I then called my wife and she was very happy.
"We also shared our happiness with our parents in India and relatives in the US."
Gughan, whose family is originally from Karur in southern India, joined St Joseph's Primary School in December 2010.
The school's principal, Mairead Weir, explained the background to Gughan studying for the GCSE exam.
"We have informal links with St Louise's Comprehensive in west Belfast to ensure a good transition for children moving from primary to post primary level," she added.
"Some of their teachers thought he would be able to do a GCSE in maths when they saw his work."
Ms Weir said GCSE foundation level had originally been considered, but this opinion was later revised following further consultation.
"I approached St Louise's to see would they enter Gughan for the GCSE on my behalf, the principal was able to do that and accommodate him," she added.
Ms Weir said the young maths student was "a little nervous" prior to sitting the exam, but had "a big smile on his face" on its completion.
"Gughan is quiet, humble and unassuming and he said it was fine," she added.
"I am delighted for him and the school and our staff that we were able to move him on to achieve his potential.
"He is a brilliant all-rounder at maths and has a wonderful flair for it.
"Our school is in an area of multiple deprivation, yet we have wonderful children who can achieve the best if given that chance. Gughan was given that chance and achieved, we wish him all the best."
Gughan, who is aiming to become a scientist in the future, will now be bringing his numerical skills to Methodist College.
He began his GCSE maths journey soon after securing success in his transfer test.
But before he enjoys another test triumph at his new school, he will want to display his ability with fours and sixes on another stage.
"Gughan is an all-rounder who likes to bat as well as bowl, I think the maths will be useful for his cricket," Mr Ramakrishnan added.
"He plays for the under-11s at Civil Service and they are in the final of a cricket tournament in Dublin in September."
