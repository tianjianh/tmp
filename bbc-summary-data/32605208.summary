The rock band join Foo Fighters and Kanye West at the top of the bill for the sold out festival next month.
Roger Daltrey said The Who would "close this year's event with a bang".
The band will also headline the British Summertime Hyde Park festival with a show on Friday 26 June, supported by Paul Weller, Kaiser Chiefs, Johnny Marr and Gaz Coombes.
Paul Weller will also play before The Who at Glastonbury, in the penultimate Sunday night slot on the Pyramid Stage.
The band said they would take the audience on an "amazing journey" through The Who's back catalogue, including classic albums such as Who's Next, Tommy, Quadrophenia and My Generation.
"It's great to be ending this part of a 50-year career at the most prestigious and respected music festival in the world," said Daltrey.
"We'll do our best to close this year's event with a bang, unless of course the fireworks get wet!"
The Who made their first and only Glastonbury headline appearance in 2007, when they also closed the festival. They ended their set with a five song medley from the concept album Tommy, starting with Pinball Wizard.
At the time Daltrey likened the band's performance, "after three days of horrendous weather", to the Battle of Passchendaele during World War One
"The conditions were horrendous and you think no one is going to stay to the end. It was like the 70s when the crowds got bigger," Daltry told The Sun.
Glastonbury confirmed 2015's final headliner on Twitter on Wednesday, writing: "We're delighted to announce that The Who will headline Sunday night, with Paul Weller playing the penultimate slot."
The Who are currently performing a career-spanning set on their world tour, The Who Hits 50.
