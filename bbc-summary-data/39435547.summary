The charity saw lifeboats at its 30 stations across Wales launch 1,175 times in 2016, an 11% rise on the previous year.
Mumbles RNLI in Swansea was the busiest station for the second year running, with 83 launches.
RNLI lifeguards also had a busy year, responding to 1,271 incidents across 39 patrolled beaches.
Matt Crofts, RNLI lifesaving manager, said the charity was "extremely grateful for the dedication show by its lifesavers" who spent almost 28,000 hours at sea last year.
"But we really do see our rescue service as a last resort," he said.
The 2016 Wales figures also showed:
The latest figures came as the charity celebrated the official opening of a new visitor centre in Vale of Glamorgan.
The Barry Island venue claims to be the first of its kind in the UK, focusing on drowning prevention.
The RNLI hopes to help teach 30,000 visitors a year about water safety, using bespoke interactive exhibitions.
It is part of the charity's bid to cut drowning deaths in Britain by 50% by 2024.
