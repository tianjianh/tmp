The Nigeria international had a disappointing season in England after signing for a then club-record fee of Â£10 million at West Bromwich Albion.
He made 31 appearances in all competitions scoring just seven goals for the Baggies.
"I am happy to be here. My immediate goal is to play regularly and work hard for the team," Ideye told BBC Sport.
"It's a fresh start for me and to join a club with a strong habit of winning titles gives me great joy.
"Playing in the Champions League is every player's dream and after my previous experience with Dynamo Kiev I feel excited to get another chance again."
He expressed his determination to make an impression.
"I have received a warm welcome from everyone and that has made me feel at home," he added.
"As a striker my job is to score goals and help the club win as many titles as possible."
Ideye, who scored 34 goals in 74 league appearances during his three seasons in Kiev, struggled to make an impact at West Brom under Alan Irvine and his successor Tony Pulis.
His only match this season for West Brom came against Port Vale in the Capital One Cup, despite this he insists he can only take positives away from his short spell at the club.
"Even though it didn't quite work out as planned, the club and fans stood by me and I will never forget that," said Ideye.
"I wish West Brom all the best as a club. My focus now is to do well at Olympiakos."
Ideye made his international debut for Nigeria in August 2010 and has scored five goals in 24 appearances for the Super Eagles.
In 2013, he helped his country clinch their third African Cup of Nations title, scoring in the 4-1 semi-final victory over Mali.
A member of their 2010 World Cup squad in South Africa, Ideye was omitted from the Super Eagles squad that reached the second round at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
