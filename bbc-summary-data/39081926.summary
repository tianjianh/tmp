Holding the title-challenging Blues left the Ports 11 points adrift at the Premiership basement.
"We have set out own bar with that performance against Linfield and we need that to be a springboard," said Currie.
"We've have highs and lows and but now need that consistency."
He added: "When we are right, when we are pulling in the same direction we can be competitive.
"If we can get that honesty regularly throughout the rest of the season then we can be a match for any team."
The result at Windsor Park may have been a boost for the Ports but it was a hammer blow to Linfield's hopes of catching Crusaders, who are now nine points clear.
