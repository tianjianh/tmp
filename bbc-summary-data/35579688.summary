[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norfolk tractor chase fugitive jailed for eight years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who led police on a "low-speed pursuit" in a stolen tractor did so because he wanted to go to prison, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nathan Lovell, 25, was pursued by six police vehicles and a helicopter in two counties before he was arrested.
Norwich Crown Court heard the chase lasted an hour, with Lovell driving at 10mph before abandoning the vehicle.
Lovell, of Wisbech, was sentenced to eight years for various offences, which he had denied.
The court heard he took the tractor from a farm near King's Lynn, and abandoned it in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, on 16 January.
He caused damage to a farm gate and crops at Tilney St Lawrence before police were alerted and gave chase.
Lovell jumped out of the tractor while it was still moving in Oakroyd Crescent, Wisbech.
It came to a stop at the kerbside and officers arrested Lovell.

The court heard he had not been drinking or taking drugs but had a history of depression and was on licence for another offence.
He was struggling to cope and and wanted to go back to jail.
Judge Anthony Bate said it was a waste of police resources and it was a mercy no-one had come to any harm.
Lovell was also disqualified from driving for 28 months after being convicted of aggravated vehicle-taking, dangerous driving, failing to stop and driving without insurance.
