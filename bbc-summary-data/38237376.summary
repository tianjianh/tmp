But less than 17% of biographies on Wikipedia and less than 10% of entries in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography (DWB) are about women.
On Thursday, some of Wales' most influential women will take part in a 12-hour edit-a-thon in a bid to close the gender gap.
Marion Loffler of the DWB said many were "hidden away" in men's entries.
The global edit-a-thon, a joint project between the BBC and Wikipedia, will see people from all over the world creating profiles for their heroines to mark the end of this year's Women 100 campaign.
As it happened:Women take over Wikipedia
While Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites in the world, only about 15% of its editors are women, and less than 17% of biographies are of women, according to the site.
John Lubbock, media spokesman for Wikipedia UK, said the lack of female profiles reflected the division in wider society.
"We rely on society to put reliable facts in, and a lot of those facts dating back about 60 or 70 years ago would have been produced for and about men," he said.
"We look more western, more white, more male: we really want to create a world where these divisions are much less obvious."
Nine Welsh women from business, television, politics and sport will add and create new profiles for the women who have inspired them at an event at BBC Wales' HQ in Llandaff.
Co-founder of the Hang Fire Smokehouse, Cardiff, Shauna Guinn, will edit the profile of singer Cerys Matthews, while one of the stars of the 2013 Great British Bake Off, Beca Lyne-Pirkis, from Penylan in Cardiff, will edit composer Grace Williams' profile.
Assistant editor of the DWB Marion Loffler said the national archive "urgently" needed articles on hundreds of women.
While progress has been made, less than 10% of biographies on the site are about women - at least 200 women are missing.
"Some entries written early on, like that on Betsi Cadwaladr, are very much of their time and urgently need thorough revision," she said.
"Other women, such as the pioneering industrialist and feminist novelist Amy Dillwyn, are not there at all.
"Some, such as the influential cultural patron Lady Augusta Hall (Lady Llanover) are hidden away in their husbands' or fathers' entries," she said.

The first Welsh woman to climb to the summit of Mount Everest, Tori James battled -40C temperatures and crippling illness to make history.

Ms James was also a member of the Pink Lady Polecats - the first team of women to complete the Polar challenge, a 360-mile (579km) race to the North Pole.
