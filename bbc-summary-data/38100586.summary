Super-councils: Regeneration powers to remain with NI Executive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The finance minister has said he is disappointed that local councils will not get powers for regeneration in their areas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
When councils were reduced from 26 to 11, responsibilities like planning were passed to them by the government.
However, on Wednesday, Communities Minister Paul Givan said regeneration will remain an executive function.
Speaking on the BBC's The View, Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said that decision was regrettable.
"He knows my position on the regeneration of powers to local councils, he knows I'm disappointed. It is my belief that the councils would be stronger partners.
"Paul isn't convinced of that at the minute. I work with councils every day. I admire their ambition and I'm going to continue to work with them."
Mr Givan said he wanted regeneration to remain with the executive for the time being.
"This was a power which had been discussed in the last mandate," he said.
"There were numerous attempts to bring forward legislation and there wasn't consensus to do that and I'm clear now in this new mandate that I don't want to be involved in tinkering around who gets what, where the budget should be divided, it's about getting things done."
