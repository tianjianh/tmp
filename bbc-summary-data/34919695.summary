Films starring Bradley Cooper, Johnny Depp, Chris Hemsworth and George Clooney are among the biggest film flops of 2015.

Rock the Kasbah starring Bill Murray is number one on the list by Forbes.
Mortdecai starring Johnny Depp and Aloha starring Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone also made the top ten.
Cyber crime thriller Blackhat starring Chris Hemsworth is in third place, while Clooney's sci-fi family film Tomorrowland came in fourteenth place.
Rock the Kasbah sees Murray as a washed up music manager stranded in Afghanistan - it also starred Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson and Zooey Deschanel.
Forbes estimated it only made $2.87m (£1.9m) at the box-office but cost $15m (£9.95m) to make.
In second place is hitman drama The Gunman starring and co-written by Sean Penn. It made $10.7m (£7.10m) in ticket sales after costing a reported $40m (£26.5m) to make.
Both big and small budget films made the list.
Fairytale Pan and Disney fantasy Tomorrowland were both big budget disappointments at the box office.
Clooney could not save the Disney film which made $190m (£126.1m) at the box-office, but was made on a budget of $209.m (£138.7m).
The Neverland 3D-fantasy film Pan failed to top the US box office when it was released despite massive promotion.
The movie, starring Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard and directed by Atonement filmmaker Joe Wright, suffered from bad reviews.
It cost a reputed $150m (£99.6m) to make and only made $119.8m (£79.5m) at the box office - this placed it eleventh on the Forbes list.
On the other end of the scale, We Are Your Friends, which starred Zac Efron as an EDM DJ, was made for just $6m (£2.39m) - but only made $3.6m (£3.9m) at the box office. These figures placed it in eighth place.
Despite Cameron Crowe's stellar cast for Aloha, which included Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone, the film is in ninth place.
The film was in the spotlight after leaked emails from Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chair Amy Pascal said its script was "ridiculous".
It was also criticised after Stone, who has blonde hair and green eyes, was cast as Allison Ng - a fighter pilot who was part-Chinese, part-Hawaiian and part-Swedish.
One advocacy group called Aloha "a whitewashed film" that failed to portray the ethnic diversity of Hawaii.
It cost $37m (£24.56m) to make but only made $26.3m (£17.46m).
Johnny Depp's art heist comedy Mortdecai, which also starred Gwyneth Paltrow, came in tenth place with box office takings of $47.3m. It cost $60m to make.
