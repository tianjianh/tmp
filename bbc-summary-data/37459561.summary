[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 0-3 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Padraig Amond came back to haunt Grimsby as his brace helped Hartlepool to a 3-0 win over his old club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Irishman, who was the Mariners' top scorer last season as they won promotion back to the Football League, struck twice in the first half with Pools' leading marksman Nathan Thomas adding an impudent third after the break as Craig Hignett's men ended Town's run of back-to-back victories.
Amond's first came after he pounced on the rebound after Lewis Alessandra had hit a post before heading home a second when left unmarked in the box.

Grimsby responded well after the restart and saw three quick-fire efforts kept out by Hartlepool goalkeeper Trevor Carson before the visitors went on to extend their advantage with Thomas' superb turn and lob over James McKeown from the edge of the box.

Shaun Tuton dragged an effort wide as the game limped to its conclusion and Alessandra was denied by McKeown, but Hartlepool saw out the win with minimum fuss, ending their run of three consecutive draws.
