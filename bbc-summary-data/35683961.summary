Irish election: Recounts continue but still no clear indication on government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Recounts are continuing in three constituencies in the Irish election, but there is still no firm indication on who will form the new government.

Most of the 158 seats have been filled with just 10 left to be allocated.
So far, Fine Gael remains the largest party with 47 seats - a four-seat lead over its main rival, Fianna Fáil.
Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has said a new government should not be formed before reforms of the Dail (parliament) take place.
"We believe that the new Dáil should not represent more business as usual - that it should involve a decisive move towards a reformed politics," he said.
Former prime minister (taioseach) Bertie Ahern said he believed talks to form a new coalition government would not be concluded before Easter.
The current taoiseach, Enda Kenny, admitted over the weekend that the Fine Gael/Labour coalition government he led for the past five years had failed to secure a return to office.
He will continue to lead the Republic of Ireland in a caretaker capacity until a new coalition is agreed.
It is now likely that Mr Kenny will be one of three party leaders who could be proposed as a potential Taoiseach when the parliament (Dàil) reconvenes on 10 March.
The other candidates are Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams.
Sinn Féin is currently in third place with 22 seats while independents and smaller parties have also done well with 30 seats between them so far.
However, the junior coalition partner, Labour, has suffered badly with only six seats so far, after winning 37 in 2011.
As counting entered its third day on Monday, Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan told the state broadcaster RTÉ that Irish politics is in a state of flux.
Mr Flanagan acknowledged that Fine Gael had made mistakes during its campaign but he expressed continuing confidence in his leader Mr Kenny.
Electoral staff are re-examining the ballot papers in Wexford, Longford-Westmeath and three Dublin constituencies.
Notable candidates to lose their seats over the weekend include Fine Gael deputy leader and children's minister, James Reilly, Fine Gael junior minister Jimmy Deenihan and Labour Party's Alex White, the communications minister.
Alan Kelly, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, narrowly retained his seat.
Despite polling well in the election, Sinn Féin lost a seat in Donegal when independent candidate Thomas Pringle was selected ahead of Pádraig Mac Lochlainn.
Before the election, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil indicated that they would not go into coalition with each other.
Mr Kenny - who has been re-elected in Mayo - said it was clear the existing government would not regain power.
He refused to discuss possible options for the next government.
However, he added: "As taoiseach I have a duty and responsibility to see how best we might be able to put together a government."
On Saturday, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said he was "very pleased" but that it would take time before the shape of the new government becomes clear.
Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said the election represented a "fundamental realignment of Irish politics".
"Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael no longer command a majority of support," he said.
"These parties cannot and will not deliver the changes required in health and housing."
Labour Party deputy leader Alan Kelly, who narrowly retained his seat in Tipperary, said Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael should "cop themselves on now" and form a government.
"All of this pretending that there are massive issues between them is rubbish.
"They need to come together, work together and put a government in place for the good of the people."
More than three million people were entitled to vote in Friday's poll, which will return 157 members of parliament, known as TDs. The speaker is automatically returned.
The campaign was fought mainly over economic issues, with the government parties asking voters for their support to keep the recovery going at a time when international storm clouds were gathering.
But the opposition parties countered that not everyone, especially outside middle-class Dublin, had been benefiting from the up-turn.
The Republic of Ireland has had the fastest growing economy in the eurozone for the last two years.
TDs are being elected according to the single transferable vote system, in which candidates have to reach a quota, before their surplus votes are distributed to others.
