One of the first police to respond to Wednesday's deadly shooting at a social service centre in California has spoken of scenes of "unspeakable" carnage.

Lt Mike Madden said he and officers who arrived later saw dead bodies and had to pass injured people as they tried to "engage the shooters".
Officials say a husband and wife shot dead 14 people and wounded 21 in the city of San Bernardino on Wednesday.
Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, were killed in a shootout.
Bomb equipment, weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition were later found in the attackers' home.
The authorities have still not found a motive for the attack.
"It was unspeakable, the carnage that we were seeing," Lt Madden told a news conference.
"The number of people who were injured and unfortunately already dead and the pure panic on the face of those individuals that were still in need and needing to be safe."
He said he and other police officers led about 50 people out of the centre's conference room.
"Then we went further into the building and that was a difficult choice to have to make as well, passing people that we knew were injured and in need of assistance," Lt Madden said.
"But our goal at that time had to be trying to locate the shooters and deal with them."
Police said between 75-80 people were at the centre when the shooting began.
The names of the victims have now been released by San Bernardino's coroner.
The youngest victim was 26 and the oldest was 60.
Who are the victims?
Police said the attack indicated there had been "some degree of planning".
Local police chief Jarrod Burguan said it appeared that the duo was prepared to carry out another attack.
"There was obviously a mission here. We know that. We do not know why. We don't know if this was the intended target or if there was something that triggered him to do this immediately," said David Bowdich, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles office.
In the shootout with police hours after the attack, Farook and Malik fired 76 rounds of ammunition at the officers and the officers fired 380 rounds back.
Two police officers were injured during the pursuit.
It marks the deadliest mass shooting in the US since 26 people were killed at a school in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012.
