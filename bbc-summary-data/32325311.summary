Karen Buckley, 24, from Cork, was last seen leaving the Sanctuary nightclub with a man in the early hours of Sunday.
Police Scotland confirmed officers are following a "definite line of inquiry".
High Craigton Farm near Milngavie, north of Glasgow, has been cordoned off as part of the investigation.
Officers have also been seen at a nearby golf course.
Miss Buckley's handbag was discovered in Glasgow's Dawsholm Park on Tuesday. Police divers and specialist officers are continuing to carry out a detailed search of the park, which is in the Kelvinside area of the city and is bordered by both the River Kelvin and the Forth and Clyde Canal.
They are being supported by the Police Scotland helicopter, police search dogs and the specialist crime division.
Miss Buckley arrived at the Sanctuary nightclub with friends at about 23:45 on Saturday and at about 01:00 she told them she was going to the toilet. She failed to return and did not take her jacket.
Her friends have said she had had a few drinks, but was not drunk.
She was seen talking to a man outside the club. Police said later they had traced the man, who told them they travelled together by car to his flat but she left about 04:00 on Sunday.
Miss Buckley moved to Glasgow in February and is a first year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. She was previously a nurse at the Princess Alexandria Hospital in Harlow, Essex.
Her parents have flown to Scotland from their home in Ireland.
