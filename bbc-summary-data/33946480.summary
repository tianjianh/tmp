[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The University of Bristol has admitted it had problems with its telephone system which left some students not knowing if they had secured a place.

The technical issues meant students were left waiting for news about potential offers, putting some at risk of losing offers at other universities.
A spokesperson for the university said it had been making personal calls to try to resolve individual situations.
It apologised on Twitter to those "experiencing delays getting through".
The tweet said: "Do keep trying our hotline and you will get through."
Universities can give students a place whether they have achieved the correct grades or not.
Students tweeted their annoyance at the situation, with one writing: "Appears you've still not made decisions and now you've gone until Monday? How is this fair?"
The university said it had been dealing with an "unprecedented number of calls" but had called students "once a decision had been made".
Students can only enter the clearing system when they have been officially refused a place at the universities they originally chose.
On Friday, the University and College Admissions Service said 6,910 students had been matched with places through clearing.
This leaves 154,850 students still looking for a university place.
