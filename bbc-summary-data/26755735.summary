[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trust which runs three struggling academies has appointed a head teacher from Northamptonshire as its new boss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Jamie Clarke, head teacher at Sponne academy in Towcester, is now chief executive of the Grace Academy Trust.
The trust runs Grace Academy Coventry which was declared inadequate and put in special measures last week.
It also runs Grace Academy Solihull, rated inadequate in October, and Grace Academy Darlaston, rated as requiring improvement in September.
Former chief executive Steve Chase resigned in December.
Dr Clarke said he expected all three schools would be rated at least good in the next few years.
"It's about making sure there is a really good consistently, high quality teaching that takes place across every single subject area in all three academies," he said.
Meanwhile, Colin Boxall, who was taken on as interim head teacher of Grace Academy Coventry in January, has been made permanent principal.
