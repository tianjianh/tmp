Kent Police and the Electoral Commission are investigating whether the Conservatives broke the law in 2015 by failing to properly declare election expenses.
A Conservative spokesman said: "All local spending was correctly declared. We are co-operating with the ongoing investigations."
Mr Farage, who came second to the Conservatives in the seat, has run for Parliament seven times, unsuccessfully.
