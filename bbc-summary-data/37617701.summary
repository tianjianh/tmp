[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester Warriors made a disappointing start to their Challenge Cup campaign as the long trip to Russia ended in a 19-12 defeat by Enisei-STM.

Davit Kacharava scored an early try as the home side opened up a 10-0 lead.
Dean Hammond created an opening for Josh Adams to touch down in reply, with Jamie Shillcock adding the conversion.
Two Yury Kushnarev penalties extended the lead and although replacement Derrick Appiah crossed for Worcester, a Ramel Gaisin drop goal sealed Enisei's win.
Academy centre Will Butler, Adams, Charlie Hewitt and Matti Williams all made their first starts in a much-changed Warriors line-up.
And 22-year-old Appiah joined the youthful faces on the pitch as they rang the changes in the second half.
Worcester, who won only one of their six group games last season's competition, next play Brive at Sixways on 22 October.
