Lions manager Neil Harris has named an unchanged XI in a four-match unbeaten run and is expected to retain the same line-up at The Den on Saturday.
Bournemouth are without captain Simon Francis, who starts a three-match ban following his red card against Arsenal.
Boss Eddie Howe is expected to rotate his squad, with Andrew Surman, Jordon Ibe and Lewis Grabban in contention.
Bournemouth assistant manager Jason Tindall:
"The FA Cup is a fantastic competition and one we want to do as well as we can in.
"Regardless of any competition, when you go to The Den, which we have experienced ourselves before many times, it is never easy. This one will be no different.
"It was not so long ago we were coming up against Millwall in the league and they were always very tough games.
"We are all aware of it and know what type of game it will be."
Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC Radio London:
"We are the underdogs against a really talented Bournemouth squad who have established themselves in the Premier League.
"It is a chance for the players to test themselves against top players and an opportunity to cause an upset. It has the makings of a really entertaining tie.
"Eddie Howe has done a phenomenal job there. He has been backed well by the owner but you still have to get decisions right.
"We had the final in 2004 and a semi-final a few years after so there is pedigree for us in this competition. But upsets don't just happen as you have to play to the best of your ability and have a bit of luck."
