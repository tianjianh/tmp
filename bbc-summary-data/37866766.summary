Neil Warnock says he is ready to sell players to bring in his own signings in the January transfer window.

Warnock signed four free agents in his first week as Bluebirds boss after replacing Paul Trollope.
However, he is still looking for further additions and admits he may have to sell to bring in his own players.
"We may have to probably let go someone we may not want to, if it means getting the right player in," he said.
Warnock says the transfer window will be vital as he plots Cardiff's route away from the Championship relegation zone.
Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Wigan leaves Cardiff a point out of the bottom three ahead of a daunting trip to Newcastle.
"It's not the international break I'm looking forward to, it's January if I'm honest," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"I've learned a lot in the last few weeks, and we have to change certain things and probably one or two players as well.
"We haven't got an awful lot of natural goal scorers so we have to work harder for the goals, and we have to try and solve those problems in January.
"We have got to be out and about in these next few weeks, looking at international games and all the staff will be looking at players at different levels."
Warnock is aware of the need to balance the books.
"January is a difficult time to buy but needs must at times," he said.
"You don't really want to be buying in January if you can help it. Clubs don't want their best players to go so they want more money than you want to pay.
The former Crystal Palace boss has already discussed targets with the club's owners.
"I've got a great relationship with them; I speak regularly to Mehmet [Dalman] and Ken [Choo] and Vincent [Tan] is in touch with all of them.
"They seem to be on board with what I'm saying and it's up to me to try and generate the income to get the players in I want to improve the squad as soon as possible."
