Air tax stakeholder forum holds first meeting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new group charged with considering how Air Passenger Duty (APD) could be replaced in Scotland has been set up by ministers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deputy First Minister John Swinney and Infrastructure Secretary Keith Brown jointly chaired the first meeting of the new Scottish APD stakeholder forum.
It includes representatives of the aviation industry, environmental groups and tax practitioners.
The move comes ahead of a consultation on the levy planned for the autumn.
Powers over APD are to be devolved to Holyrood as part of the new Scotland Bill.
The Smith Commission on further powers recommended the change.
The Scottish government has committed to halving the levy paid by air passengers within the lifetime of the next parliament, with a view to abolishing it completely when "public finances permit".
Research for Edinburgh Airport has already suggested that cutting APD in half would result in 700,000 more passengers going through Scotland's airports in the first year alone.
Mr Swinney said: "Scotland's airports are busier than ever and the Scottish government wants to see that success grow further to the benefit of passengers, business, tourism and our wider economy.
"The forum and this autumn's policy consultation allow us to take the next step and begin the process of designing and developing a Scottish APD to help deliver our objective of sustainable economic growth."
Mr Swinney made the comments as he and Mr Brown visited Edinburgh Airport, where they met chairman Sir John Elvidge.
Sir John said:  "Our report earlier in the year showed very clearly that APD is placing a drag on Scotland's economic growth, costing jobs and millions of pounds in lost revenue.
"We've long supported its devolution and are keen to work with the Scottish government to ensure that the process is as smooth and as quick as possible."
Environmental group WWF Scotland, who have cautioned against moves to scrap APD, argued that any conclusions of the Scottish government and the forum must take into account the impact on the climate.
Director Lang Banks said: "The Scottish government's own analysis shows that cutting APD by half would increase Scotland's climate emissions from flying.
"If ministers insist on going ahead with its plans to increase climate emissions from flying, then it will have to explain which other sectors of society will pick up the shortfall and at what cost.".
