Steve Cook: Steve Fletcher training ground influence behind improved Bournemouth

Bournemouth centre-back Steve Cook says the simple process of hard work on the training ground has been behind recent improved defensive displays.

Premier League wins against West Ham and Swansea have lifted the Cherries away from the relegation zone.
Cook hailed club legend and coach Steve Fletcher for restoring confidence at set-pieces to the back four.
"At 44, I don't think there's many better in the air than him," Cook said. "The coaches are always thinking."
Fletcher, who scored 103 goals in more than 600 appearances for the club, only finished playing aged 40 and has been part of Eddie Howe's coaching team since 2013.
"You're never done, I don't think, at this club," Cook told BBC Radio Solent. "It's been helpful and we've been working really hard on the training pitch with Fletch."
Following a barren run at the turn of the year of just two points from a possible 21, Bournemouth have taken seven points from their past three games to move nine clear of the bottom three.
"We've come through that tough period, which was worrying," Cook added. "But we're a strong group and we've stuck together and we've ground out three great results.
"When you're conceding goals, it's hard to take as that's your job. That's been frustrating as, at the start of the season, we weren't conceding that many."
