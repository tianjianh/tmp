Emily McBride and her partner Thomas Carson were on their way to Royal Stoke University Hospital when their car ground to a halt.
The couple from Stone were picked up by officers from Staffordshire Police who took them to hospital in the back of their patrol vehicle.
But before Emily could make it out of the car, she gave birth to baby Darcey.
Darcey Carson McBride was delivered by hospital staff on the back seat of the car at 08:56 GMT on Friday weighing 6lb 9oz (2.98kg).
Both were then admitted to the delivery suite.
The police force said: "Staffordshire Police send their very best wishes to Emily, Thomas and Darcey."
Thanking the officers for getting her to hospital safely, Ms McBride said: "I'm really grateful, they (Staffordshire Police) got us there in time, if it wasn't for them, I would have been giving birth in traffic."
