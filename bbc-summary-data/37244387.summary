Ben Purrington says he is ready to stake his claim for a regular place in the Plymouth Argyle side.

The 20-year-old left-back is set to deputise for injured counterpart Gary Sawyer against Cheltenham Town.
"I've got the opportunity through Gary's injury, so hopefully I can capitalise on that and hopefully keep the position," he told BBC Radio Devon.
Purrington started six games toward the end of last season, but was mainly used as a central midfielder.
But he says he prefers the left-back role, a position in which he made his name for when impressing as a 17-year-old debutant in 2013.
"I favour the left-back position as I can get up and down the line," he said. "I don't mind it at centre midfield, but I prefer left-back.
"I've been sat on the bench since I was 17, playing odd games at centre midfield and left-back, but it's obviously nice if you can get a run in the team and more minutes under your belt.
"It can be frustrating at times, but when he (Sawyer) is playing well and he's consistent there's not a lot you can do.
"You've just got to keep working hard in training and try to grind away at it and hope you get an opportunity when he gets an injury like now.
"We're together every day in training, I learn things from him, he's got all the experience and we talk to each other and he guides you through things at times."
