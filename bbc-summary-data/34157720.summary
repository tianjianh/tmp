[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thames Valley Police said the serviceman, in his 20s, was found in a critical condition just before midday and, despite efforts attempts to resuscitate him, he later died on the site.
The death is not believed to be suspicious or involve a third party.
An MoD spokesman said a full investigation was under way.
In June, the first members of the German-based 1 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps moved to the Oxfordshire barracks.
