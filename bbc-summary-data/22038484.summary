More than 70 workers at a Walkers crisp factory in Lincoln have been made redundant.

The jobs losses at the site in Newark Road took effect at the end of March.
Workers came under threat of redundancy after parent company PepsiCo announced plans to install new packing equipment.
Steve Switzer, site leader at Walkers Lincoln, said bosses had been successful in reducing the number of redundancies from 87 to 72 out of about 250 employees at the site.
The factory, which makes Quavers and some of the Walkers Sensation ranges, has been in the city for more than 70 years.
It was originally the home of Smiths Crisps and in January there were about 250 people employed at the site.
Karl McCartney, Conservative MP for Lincoln, said he was disappointed by the redundancies but added he hoped the move would "ensure the long-term viability of the site".
Mr Switzer said: "We are investing in new state-of-the-art packing equipment at our Lincoln site, a move that will significantly change the way we pack our goods and improve efficiency.
"We understand this has been a difficult time for our employees but as we outlined at the time, these changes will secure the long-term future of the Lincoln site and growth of the Walkers business in the UK."
