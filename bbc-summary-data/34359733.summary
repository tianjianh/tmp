[SN]TITLE[SN]
UKIP leader still counting on Yorkshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigel Farage is adamant he has not parked his tanks on the wrong Labour leader's lawn by taking UKIP's conference back to Doncaster Racecourse for the second year in a row.

In 2014 he taunted Ed Miliband with that quip in his rousing pre-election speech to the party faithful.
The cheers were so loud they must have been heard right the way across the then Labour leader's parliamentary constituency which borders the racecourse.
It's unlikely a similar reception will be echoing across Jeremy Corbyn's Islington North constituency as it is 170 miles away, but the infectiously enthusiastic Mr Farage is convinced Labour supporters everywhere will be listening to every word of this year's speech.
"OK, so we didn't go on from that Conference and take any seats from Labour," he conceded in a pre conference interview for BBC Look North.
"But we took enough support away from Labour in its heartland in South Yorkshire to make them be very worried about us."
In fact UKIP fell a long way short of taking any of the cluster of seats around Rotherham it had confidently predicted it would snatch from Labour.
However, the general election results didn't bring much cheer to the Labour MPs who were relieved to retain their seats.
UKIP's candidates, among them the party's Yorkshire MEPs Jane Collins and Mike Hookem, clearly took a fair chunk of votes from Labour and took a string of second places.
But it will be difficult to see how even Mr Farage can sustain the UKIP euphoria of 2015 after what was still a disappointment.
He clearly thinks he has the policies to keep the momentum going:
In fact, he feels he has plenty of sympathy from Yorkshire voters for his loud support for an exit vote whenever David Cameron's promised referendum is eventually held.
He virtually launched UKIP's "Brexit" campaign on a well-publicised visit to the National Game Fair at Harewood House this summer.
"Migration will be at the heart of this debate," he told me.
"What is being proposed now for here and across the European Union is unsustainable".
