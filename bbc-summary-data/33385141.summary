[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services went to Mermaid Quay on Friday after reports of an incident at 13:45 BST.
The teenager was taken to the city's University Hospital of Wales by ambulance in a serious condition.
Insp Tony Williams, of South Wales Police, issued a warning against swimming in the area's waters.
Cardiff council posted a tweet to re-iterate "swimming is not permitted in Cardiff Bay" because of "high-speed boats and hidden dangers under the water".
