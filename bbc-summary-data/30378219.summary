The former Dr Feelgood guitarist, 67, was treated for pancreatic cancer at Addenbrooke's Hospital after being told the condition was terminal.
Johnson, from Southend, was given the all clear in April.
"What can I say about Addenbrooke's? To me it's like a magic place. They saved my life, it was fantastic. What a wonderful place," he said.
Johnson was given 10 months to live after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
But medics found he had a rare and curable form of the cancer when one of his doctor friends started to question why he was still feeling fairly well several months after the diagnosis.
The musician underwent 11 hours of radical surgery at Addenbrooke's to take out the 3kg tumour and earlier this year was given the all clear.
He credited the hospital's doctors with "curing" him.
"To me, everybody at Addenbrooke's from the consultants to the cleaners to the nurses are heroes," he said.
"Certainly when I was in there I was suffering quite a bit of discomfort, but what those people did, I mean they saved my life."
Johnson said he hoped to get back to playing in the new year.
"Man, I really want to do that.
"You know, it's been quite nice this kind of holiday, sitting around watching the telly and what not, but I've had enough of that now and I want to get back on the stage."
It is not just his musical career he is keen to get back to.
Johnson's role in television series Game of Thrones, in which he played Ilyn Payne was interrupted by his cancer diagnosis.
"The producers have said they haven't absolutely written my character out," he said.
"In America, where it's been such a success, I'm known as 'actor Wilko Johnson who also plays the guitar'."
