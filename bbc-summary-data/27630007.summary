Nearly 200 members of the RAF based in Cambridgeshire are to be disbanded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defence Minister Mark Francois said no posts would be lost but 183 people from 1 Force Protection Wing and 3 Squadron at RAF Wittering would be assimilated into four other bases in the UK.
He said the move was the latest in a reorganisation that saw disbandments at RAF Leuchars in St Andrews.
North West Cambridgeshire MP Shailesh Vara said it was "regrettable", but was pleased that no jobs would be lost.
He added he had received assurances from Mr Francois that the number of people affected would not increase and that it was not a prelude to the eventual closure of the base.
RAF Wittering is a logistics and engineering hub and currently has about 1,500 service and civilian personnel. Up until 2010 it was the home of the Harrier jet.
Mr Francois said the staff would be transferred to Honington in Suffolk, Marham in Norfolk, Coningsby in Lincolnshire and Lossiemouth in Moray.
The move will start in spring 2015.
