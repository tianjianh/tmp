A British war veteran who dodged enemy bullets to help secure a French beach on D-Day has received the country's highest honour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ted Turner was 18 when he sailed a tiny landing craft from Portsmouth to join Canadian troops at Normandy.
The 89-year-old former Royal Marine, from Waterlooville, said it was a "great honour" to receive the Legion d'Honneur at a ceremony earlier.
He is among the first UK veterans to be awarded the medal.
Recalling the landings in 1944, Mr Turner said: "It was very quiet, no one spoke. Then when we got close to the beach, the Germans started firing and it was pretty noisy.
"I wasn't frightened. I was only young, so it felt a bit like an adventure to me, even at that stage."
Mr Turner helped secure a beachhead on Juno beach while under fire from German soldiers and aircraft.
He was presented with the French medal at the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea.
"I know that I'll be thinking of those who didn't make it, my friends who didn't come back from the Normandy beaches after D-Day," he said.
After the war Mr Turner served in Germany, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and Japan.
