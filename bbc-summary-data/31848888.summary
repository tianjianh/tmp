Snoop Dogg has told Annie Mac on her new Radio 1 evening show that the sound of his new album, Bush, is down to Pharrell acting as "CEO" on it.

"He came up with the title, the concept of the record, the whole everything," he said.
"I was trying to be the artist on this without being the CEO of it.
"I wanted him to basically control it and tell me where I should be at, what I should sound like, what I should look like. Basically the hole nine [yards]."
Explaining why he was so comfortable, he said it was down to his long-term friendship with Pharrell.
"This is not our first merry-go-round," he said.
"We've been doing this for years and so for him to finally do a whole album on me and tell me what I should be doing - that's what I was looking for.
"I've been doing it for so long now and sometimes it gets to a point where it's too hectic because I've got to do everything.
"I've got to come up with the concept, the look, the style - whereas with this one I've just got to worry about being Snoop."
Bush, due for release in May, is Snoop Dogg's 13th studio album.
The first single from it, Peaches and Cream, was released on Tuesday.
