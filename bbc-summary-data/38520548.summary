He is the longest-serving player with the Cod Army, having joined them from Lancaster City in 2003 and holds the club record for most appearances.
The 32-year-old's new deal also includes an option for a further year.
"I think he has been brilliant since I walked through through the door, on and off the pitch," boss Uwe Rosler told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"He is very important for the group and I'm delighted he is keeping on this journey together."
Fleetwood have also confirmed that on-loan Preston defender Ben Davies has been given permission to play in the FA Cup at Bristol City on Saturday.
