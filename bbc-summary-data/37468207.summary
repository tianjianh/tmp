[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour MPs have beaten the press in the annual party conference football match with the winning goal scored by a comedian "guesting" for the team.

John Bishop, who has played the game semi-professionally, scored the decisive spot kick in a penalty shoot-out after the match finished three all.
The MPs' team came from three-down at half-time to secure victory.
Liverpool-supporting Bishop suggested the team had evoked the spirit of the Reds' 2005 Champions League Final win.
In that game in Istanbul, Liverpool were 3-0 behind at the break before levelling in the second half, and then winning on penalties.
Steve Rotheram, who captained a Labour team including the likes of Andy Burnham and Clive Betts, helped inspire the team to an unlikely triumph although his missed one of the penalties in the closing shoot-out.
In doing so, they put their political differences aside.
Mr Rotheram is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn while the team included a handful of those who have called on him to go, including former shadow Scotland secretary Ian Murray and Stephen Kinnock, son of the former Labour leader.
