[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leeds United 1-1 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds United were held by Fulham at Elland Road and have won just one in 10 Championship games despite Lewis Cook's wonderful equaliser.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Leeds trainee Tom Cairney gave Fulham the lead with an excellent volley on the edge of the box.
Cook, 19, levelled with a sublime 35-yard shot which gave goalkeeper Andy Lonergan no chance.
Fulham finished with 10 men after defender Fernando Amorebieta was sent off for a second bookable offence.

The result leaves Leeds 17th in the table, 12 points above the relegation zone with 14 games remaining.
Fulham, who have 13 games left, are one place below with a 10-point safety cushion.
The home side survived an early scare as Luke Garbutt's deflected strike flashed just wide before Sol Bamba headed former Leeds captain Ross McCormack's mis-hit volley against his own crossbar.
Fulham took the lead when Cairney took the ball down on the edge of the box and volleyed past motionless Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri - his fourth goal in as many games.
Garbutt stung the palms of Silvestri before the hosts levelled thanks to a moment of inspiration by Cook from distance.
Amorebieta was sent off for stopping a Leeds break with a handball deep into stoppage time.
Leeds United boss Steve Evans:
"If [Lewis Cook's] goal was scored in the Premier League then it would get shown for the next five years. I don't think I have seen a better goal scored. I've just seen a stunning goal from a stunning young player.
"We were unfortunate not to win but we need to improve in terms of scoring goals."
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic:
"It's good news for us because we showed a different face and a different performance as what we showed last Tuesday night against Blackburn.
"We created many [chances], they scored a fantastic goal too. In the end, in my opinion, I believe we played better football than Leeds and we were closer to win the three points.
"At the end, Leeds was fighting very well and put us under some kind of pressure. They are fighting and deserve this point too."
