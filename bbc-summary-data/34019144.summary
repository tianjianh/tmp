Dundee men convicted of 'cuckoo smurfing' laundering scam

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men have become the first in Scotland to be convicted of a money laundering scam known as "cuckoo smurfing".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme involves replacing legitimate cash - intended for bank transfer overseas - with "dirty" money.
Shopkeeper Muhammed Hameed, his uncle Saleem Shikari and worker Shahid Aslam pled guilty to the charges under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
They hid almost Â£700,000 from the authorities, the High Court heard.
The men were detained as part of Operation Confab - a huge probe set-up to catch Hameed and his associates.
The term "cuckoo smurfing" is used to describe a certain type of money laundering.
Cuckoo refers to the fact those involved pay sums of money into accounts of other unsuspecting individuals.
This is likened to the way a cuckoo will lay its eggs in the nests of other species of birds.
Smurfing refers to paying multiple amounts of cash into a variety of accounts.
In 2013, when police moved in, the three were caught red-handed with a plastic bag stuffed with Â£75,000 of banknotes at Hameed's flat in Dundee.
A judge remanded Hameed, 32, Aslam, 36, and 52-year-old Shikari in custody. They face a lengthy jail-term when they are sentenced next month.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that police got a tip-off that Hameed was involved in a large scale money laundering operation with international links.
Prosecutor Steven Borthwick said the scan involved an unsuspecting overseas customer sending funds to the UK to another innocent individual.
Unknown to them, the person handling the transfer would be linked to a money laundering gang.
This person - known as the "controller" - would then pass on the account details.
The gang would replace the money with illegitimate cash, leaving the customer none the wiser.
The money originally deposited overseas was retained by the "controller" who transferred it to "a cash pool account" often based in Dubai.
Mr Borthwick added: "The criminal proceeds raised by the UK based crime gangs have thus been successfully laundered and the gang owes nothing but a commission to the 'controller' for his work.
"It is a sophisticated crime operated by a syndicate of highly organised crime gangs."
Police worked with the National Crime Agency, watching Hameed and his associates for several months.
The court heard that the shopkeeper and Shikari and Aslam were seen making "multiple cash deposits" at banks in Dundee, on an "almost daily basis" often involving "significant sums of money".
Detectives eventually moved in after Hameed was spotted collecting a suspicious bag near his home.
When police entered his flat they found the trio and discovered the bag contained Â£75,150 in mixed banknotes.
It was said to be "dirty money" belonging to a Scotland-based crime group.
Mr Borthwick said Hameed carried out an "organisational role" and the other two played "lesser, although still significant" parts in the offence.
Hameed, Shikari and Aslam had originally gone to trial, but admitted their guilt during the case.
A co-accused Philip Reid, 47, of Glasgow, also faced a Proceeds of Crime charge, but his not guilty plea was accepted.
