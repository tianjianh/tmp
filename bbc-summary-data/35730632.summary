£225k for lights before A40 Llandovery roadworks start

A set of temporary traffic lights has cost the taxpayer £225,000 after being in place on the same stretch of road for three years without any work being carried out.

The Welsh government has paid £1,500-a-week to have them on the A40 near Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, as one side of the carriageway has subsidence.
But the area affected is twice as long as first thought.
A spokesman said work could only start once nearby land has been bought.
Councillor Haydn Hudson said: "We as a community want to know what's going on.
"Lets sort it out and let's get it done. There's another summer coming and we're losing holiday trade because people don't want to travel on this road."
The Welsh government said it was mindful the situation had been frustrating for people but the works had proved to be a "complex project".
A statement added: "An investigation of the site established that the affected area was almost twice as long as the initial estimated 110 metres, which required further investigation and plans were revised accordingly.
"Resolving the issue has been further complicated by the need for us to purchase land from the owners to allow the repair works to go ahead."
BBC Wales understands negotiations over the land are now in the process of being finalised but what has angered many residents is the staggering costs that have built up while that has been ongoing.
In a letter to Llandovery town council, Transport Minister Edwina Hart said she hoped an agreement would be reached soon and the scheme could commence before the end of the year.
