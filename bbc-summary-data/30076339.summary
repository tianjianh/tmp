[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zinedine Zidane's eldest son, Enzo, made his debut as a substitute for Real Madrid 'B' in a 2-1 win over Conquense in Spain's Segunda B on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Real and France midfielder and World Cup winner Zidane, 42, is assistant coach of the Real Madrid Castilla team.
Named after Uruguay legend Enzo Francescoli, Zidane Jr, 19, played for Spain's Under-15 side but has since opted to represent France.
The midfielder's younger brothers Luca, Theo and Eliaz attend Real's academy.
Zidane Sr was banned for three months from coaching Castilla last month for not having the required qualifications but that is on hold until his appeal is heard.
