The camera was revealed when a fourth year pupil from James Gillespie High School threw his shoe and dislodged a ceiling panel.
The changing rooms are used by male and females at different times.
The incident happened at about 15:30 on Wednesday.

"I am unable to discuss any of the specifics at this time while a Police Scotland investigation is underway."
