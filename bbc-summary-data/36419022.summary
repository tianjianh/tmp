"The conversation around equality and representation has never been stronger," says Ms Baskerville. "In meeting these women I realised that we are a society obsessed with gender and capability.
"These women prove that this is only a small factor in the path to become change makers and that their success is down to determination, focus, passion and love.
"This is something that we can all learn from, regardless of our gender."
Philippa Napier is an engineering technician apprentice training to become a parts quality engineer at the BMW Mini plant in Oxford.
After leaving school, she decided to pursue her passion for mechanics, enrolling onto the apprenticeship scheme at the age of 18. She is now reaching the end of her four-year apprenticeship programme.
"If you are an employer you should hire the right person for the job, regardless of gender," says Ms Napier.
"My advice for women would be to explore, understand and challenge themselves in all environments, not just professionally. There's no problem with challenging stereotypes by demonstrating capability."

Juli Beattie founded The Art Room in 2002 at Oxford Spires Academy and uses art as therapy to help school-aged children struggling in mainstream education. The charity now runs eight Art Rooms in Oxford, London and Edinburgh.
"My message for positive change in this turbulent world is that we should respect each other, try to be non-judgemental and, as much as we possibly can, send out messages of hope and inclusion," says Ms Beattie.
Icolyn Smith, born in rural Jamaica, came to live in Oxford in 1965. Her first job was in the canteen of the British Leyland car factory in Cowley before she became a nurse at Cowley Road Hospital and then a care worker with social services.
