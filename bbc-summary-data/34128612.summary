MYC Rowing Porthmadog aims to reach the Wales Millennium Centre in time for its 10th anniversary celebration finale.
Rowers like Maggy Clarke, 71, from Porthmadog, plan to work in relays, completing between 20-30 miles a day.
Their planned arrival on 12 September coincides with a celebration in the Bay to mark the art centre's anniversary.
They will join a flotilla of boats playing their part in an outdoor theatrical production, Ar Waith Ar Daith, which involves 700 participants.
The rowers from Porthmadog are also carrying a slate plaque for the arts centre taken from Llechwedd Quarry, Blaenau Ffestiniog.
It is symbolic gesture because slate for its construction was to be ferried along the coast on a schooner in 2003 before bad weather thwarted the plans and it was transported by a helicopter instead.
