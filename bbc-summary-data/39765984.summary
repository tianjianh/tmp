The Italian celebrated on the pitch with his players at full-time at Goodison Park, after goals from Pedro, Gary Cahill and Willian.
Chelsea need three more wins from their last four games to secure the title in Conte's first season in charge.
"There are two Antonios. Two different people," said the 47-year-old.
"During the game, I know I am an animal.
"After the game, I must be relaxed when we win but I think it's very good to celebrate this win with the players, staff and fans. I live for this."
Conte, who won three consecutive Serie A titles as Juventus boss between 2012 and 2014, is renowned for being an energetic, loud presence on the touchline.
He celebrated all three of his side's goals at Everton by punching the air and running down the touchline.
The Italian is calm and thoughtful during post-match interviews and news conferences, a trait he says he likes to see in his players.
"We must be pleased because we played a game with the head and, at this part of this season, it is important to use our head, then your heart and then your legs," he said.
Conte believes in the mantra so much, he wrote a book called Testa, cuore e gambe (Head, heart and legs) in 2014.
Chelsea's lead over second-placed Tottenham remains at four points after Spurs' 2-0 win over Arsenal later on Sunday.
And Blues captain Cahill said it could prove to be a crucial day in the title race.
"We have made a massive stride, there's no getting away from that," he said.
"We knew how big the three points would be. There's still time to go but it's a huge step."
