Joburg Open 2016: Anthony Wall holds share of lead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Anthony Wall is in a three-way share of the lead after the third round of South Africa's Joburg Open.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wall, 40, shot a four-under-par 68 to tie with South Africans Zander Lombard and Haydn Porteous on 15 under.
Wall's only win on the European Tour came at the the Alfred Dunhill Championship in 2000.
Overnight leader Ross McGowan from England shot a 73 and is two adrift of the lead in a group that also includes Ireland's Paul Dunne, who had a 68.
Porteus, 21, finished strongly with birdies at the 17th and 18th holes on the East Course at Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club, while Lombard's round of 65 saw him move up the leaderboard two days before his 21st birthday.
