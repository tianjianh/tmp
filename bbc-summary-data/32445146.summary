Three Padarn Bus employees deny £800,000 fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three people will go on trial accused of an £800,000 bus firm fraud.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Hulme, Darren Price and Anne Price appeared at Mold Crown Court and denied intending to make a gain for Gwynedd-based Padarn Bus and falsifying a claim form.
Mr Hulme, 54, Mr Price, 44, both of Caernarfon, and Ms Price, 29, of Llanberis, deny the charges.
It is alleged the company exaggerated the number of concessionary passengers it carried to Gwynedd council.
Mr Hulme is accused of a £496,000 fraud between July 2011 and December 2012 while Mr and Ms Price both deny fraud involving £318,500 between January 2013 and February 2014 and falsifying council claim documents.
All three pleaded not guilty on Friday and will go on trial in November.
