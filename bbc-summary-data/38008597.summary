Vanessa Marcotte, 27, was attacked while on a Sunday afternoon jog near her mother's home in a wooded area of Princeton on 7 August.
Officials have appealed for help in finding the vehicle witnesses saw parked near where her body was found.
Police suspect the Boston University graduate fought with her attacker, leaving him with scrapes and bruises.
Investigators had previously determined the suspect is male.
Worchester District Attorney Joseph Early said in a statement: "State Police Detectives and Princeton Police have asked that area law enforcement agencies be vigilant and mindful of this homicide investigation when interacting with men operating or occupying a dark-colored SUV."
The police's dedicated tip line had already received more than 1,000 calls before Wednesday's lead.
The body of Ms Marcotte, who lived in New York City, was discovered just half a mile from her mother's home.
She was naked and had burns on her head, feet and hands, a WCVB-TV reporter quoted police sources as saying.
The murder was the town's first in three decades, and made national headlines, sparking fears among female joggers.
The killing happened only days after the sexual assault and strangling of another jogger, 30-year-old speech therapist Karina Vetrano, in Queens, New York.
Police officials have said they do not believe the attacks are related, despite many noting a resemblance between the two women.
