[SN]TITLE[SN]
More arts funding 'should go outside London'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Theatres, galleries and other cultural groups located outside London should get a bigger share of government arts funding, a committee of MPs has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There should be a "better regional balance" in the grants, according to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee.
They said it was easier for arts organisations in London to raise money through sponsorship and philanthropy.
Arts Council England said it was increasing funding outside London.
The body distributes government money in the form of annual funding to almost 700 venues and other arts organisations.
"We agree that more needs to be done on increasing the proportion of our funding outside the capital," Arts Council chief executive Darren Henley said.
A spokesperson said 56 percent of the Arts Council's annual government funding will be spent outside London 2017/18. This will rise to 60 percent in 2018/19.
The Arts Council also distributes National Lottery money and said 75 percent of its Lottery pot would go outside the capital by 2018.
Committee chair Damian Collins MP said there should be "a greater appreciation of the cultural treasures and creative innovation to be found across the UK, and especially outside of London".
He added: "Strong local leadership and innovation from regional arts and cultural organisations has produced some remarkable successes, but more needs to be done to avoid further closures of small museums and galleries, as funding from local authorities declines."
The report also said major national institutions should only get direct government subsidies if they support regional organisations, through lending exhibits, touring and mentoring.
In its response to the report, the Local Government Association said councils had "always been a vital part of this country's cultural landscape, spending over Â£1 billion a year on culture".
Cllr Ian Stephens, chair of the LGA's culture tourism and sport board, said councils were "working more efficiently... to support cultural experiences and facilities through trusts or social enterprises, shared services [and] maximising income generation".
However, he continued, "the squeeze on council budgets as a result of the Â£2.6bn social care funding gap by 2020 means councils will have to continue to divert more money from other local services, including cultural services, to try and plug growing social care funding gaps".
