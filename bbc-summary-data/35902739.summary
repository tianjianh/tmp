Forest Green dominated and James Jennings' header was cleared off the line by Robbie Evans.
Wrexham were reduced to 10 men when Blaine Hudson was sent-off for a professional foul on Kurtis Guthrie.
Hudson was followed three minutes later by captain Connor Jennings, who received a second yellow card.
Gary Mills' side remain three points adrift of the play-offs while Forest Green are five points behind leaders Cheltenham Town.
Forest Green boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"We had chances, but it's about putting the ball in the back of the net. It wasn't for a lack of trying today.
"At half time, more than anything else, we just wanted to get more players forward. But every time we got the momentum up, the referee seemed to kill the game for us and it was very frustrating. It happens, it's football.
"We dust ourselves off now, it's another point on the board but obviously we wanted all three."
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales:
"When your team plays like that, as a manager you're proud. It's a massive point for us.
"Nobody wants to play us at the moment and we've proved with nine men we're not about to give in.
"We deserved the point. It's an unbelievable point for us."
