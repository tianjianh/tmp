Ryan Morse death: Doctor 'refused home visit' day before he died

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor accused of the manslaughter of an ill 12-year-old boy refused to see him at home the evening before he died, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff Crown Court heard that Dr Joanne Rudling, 46, told Ryan Morse's mother Carol, that his condition was due to hormonal changes.
She said he should see a male doctor the following Monday.
Dr Rudling, from Cardiff, and Dr Lindsey Thomas, from Tredegar, deny manslaughter.
Ryan, from Brynithel, Blaenau Gwent died on 8 December 2012 from Addison's Disease, a rare disorder affecting the adrenal glands.
He weighed just 4st 11lb.
He had first fallen ill in July of that year but his symptoms had previously been attributed to a virus by three doctors, including Dr Rudling.
The court heard that Mrs Morse phoned Abernant Surgery in Abertillery on Friday 7 December 2012 after she noticed Ryan's genitals were "completely black" and he was suffering from sickness and diarrhoea.
Earlier that day he had become very disorientated, hearing voices,  and had been unable to walk downstairs unaided because his head "felt funny", she said.
Despite Dr Rudling seeing Ryan on two occasions in the previous month due to his fatigue, bouts of projectile vomiting and discoloured skin, no mention was made of his case history in that phone call.
Earlier that day - at 08.55 GMT - Mrs Morse had received a requested call back from Dr Thomas.
She told Dr Thomas about Ryan's sickness and diarrhoea, as well as the fact he had at one point been hearing voices and was unable to make it downstairs unaided.
Dr Thomas asked Mrs Morse to bring Ryan to the surgery for an examination.
Mrs Morse said in a police interview: "She said 'fetch him up' and I said that I couldn't because he couldn't walk and I was on my own and I couldn't carry him to the car.
"I was surprised at her insistence that I bring him up. I explained that he couldn't walk and I couldn't carry him to her three or four times.
"I thought she would offer to come up and see him."
Mrs Morse said Dr Thomas had advised her to give Ryan paracetamol and see how he was later.
The case continues.
