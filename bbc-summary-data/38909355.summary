PC Paul Briggs: Funeral for right to end life support officer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The funeral of a policeman whose wife fought a hospital to end his life support has taken place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Friends and family gathered at the Landican Cemetery and Crematorium, Woodchurch, Wirral, to celebrate the life of Paul Briggs, 43.
Doctors treating PC Briggs at the Walton Centre in Liverpool opposed the application to withdraw treatment.
But a judge ruled in December in favour of the application from his wife Lindsey, 40.
The officer suffered a brain injury in a crash on his way to work for Merseyside Police and had been in a minimally conscious state for 18 months.
PC Briggs, from Wirral, who died last month, suffered a bleed on the brain and five fractures to his spine in the crash. He was kept alive through medical intervention.
In July 2016, driver Chelsea Rowe was jailed for a year for crashing into the officer.
Lindsey Briggs told the Court of Protection her husband's treatment should be stopped "given his previously expressed wishes" and he should be allowed to die.
Mr Justice Charles ruled in Mrs Briggs' favour at a hearing in the Court of Protection, where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to take decisions.
The judge attended the funeral service to pay his respects.
Officers on motorbikes and mounted officers led the funeral procession and a guard of honour was formed as it arrived at the chapel.
A police officer's hat was laid on the coffin, which was carried by PC Briggs' colleagues.
Assistant Chief Constable Ian Critchley saluted the coffin as mourners made their way inside the chapel for the ceremony which included tributes from his brothers Jeff and Greg and the song It's My Life by Bon Jovi.
The service ended with a poem chosen by his daughter, which was listed in the order of service as Ella's Tribute to Daddy - My Spirit.
