[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bala Lake Railway boosted by lottery funding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A heritage railway project is to expand its operations in Gwynedd after receiving lottery funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bala Lake Railway takes visitors on a nine-mile return journey through Snowdonia National Park.
It has been awarded Â£38,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to extend the accommodation for its rolling stock at Llanuwchllyn Station.
Money will also be spent on improving the visitor experience with disabled access and heritage exhibits.
Project Leader Julian Birley said: "The existing facilities have become increasingly overcrowded and do not allow us to expand, particularly taking into account the increasing collection of historic locomotives and rolling stock."
The funding follows an announcement earlier this year that land had been acquired for a new Bala Town station.
