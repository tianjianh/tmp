Sadly Puffy was hit by a car and now her back legs don't work very well.
But thanks to her own doggy pedal cart she's back on the move.
She's also having hydrotherapy to help her get better.
Her owners say they are "overwhelmed" by the generosity of the people who have helped to pay for Puffy's new wheels,
Watch her use pedal power to get around!
