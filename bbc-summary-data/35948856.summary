[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-0 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Keeper Carl Ikeme helped extend Wolves' unbeaten run to six games as he pulled off three stunning saves to frustrate Blackburn in a goalless draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ikeme twice denied Jordi Gomez and also prevented Shane Duffy from scoring as the hosts struggled at the other end.
Their first attempt on target came after 76 minutes through substitute Bjorn Sigurdarson's shot.
The stalemate was the third in a row at Molineux, the first time that has happened to Wolves since 1899.
Blackburn lost striker Danny Graham early on when he limped off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.

Ikeme's first superb save came just before half-time when he pushed away Gomez's 25-yard strike.
He then turned a late Gomez header over the bar before denying Duffy in similar fashion from close range.
Wolves boss Kenny Jackett:
"It is six games unbeaten but it doesn't feel like six games unbeaten.
"I thought that we had the better of Blackburn and we were on top. But it was difficult for us to go and create and go past people in one-v-one situations.
"We had excellent performances in midfield and we got the ball into wide areas but from there it was tough for us."
Blackburn boss Paul Lambert:
"Their goalkeeper has kept them in the game with three world-class saves. It is disappointing not to win the game as I thought we had the better chances.
"To come here and Jason (Steele, goalkeeper) not to make a save speaks volumes for the defence.
"It was a nothing game really but we had the better chances and I thought we should have won it at the end."
