The Spiders had chances to add to their tally before Duggan was brought down by Chris Kane and converted the penalty on 66 minutes.
Duggan was then denied a hat-trick when he hit the post from close range.
Sean Burns went close for the hosts soon after Duggan's spectacular opener, while a long-range effort from Declan McDaid flashed wide for Cowdenbeath.
With half-time approaching, Joe Bradley and Liam Brown both spurned good openings for the hosts.
Duggan forced a good save from Grant Adam early in the second period just before Kyle Miller headed narrowly over for the visitors.
Duggan again went close in an action-packed period of play that continued with each keeper making an excellent stop.
After Duggan had tucked away his penalty, Adam denied Vincent Berry before the woodwork rescued him.
Cowdenbeath came close through Dean Brett's shot and Kane's header but the Fife side now have a tough job in Saturday's return leg.
