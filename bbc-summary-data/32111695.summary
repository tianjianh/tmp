[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danny Whitaker finished calmly under pressure to give Macclesfield the lead but Connor Jennings, netting against his former club, made it level before the break.
Lee Bell then restored the hosts' lead when he nodded in a Scott Barrow cross.
But Evans headed in Sam Finley's cross to maintain Carl Darlington's unbeaten start as Dragons' caretaker boss.
Play-off chasing Macclesfield are now without a win in five matches.
Wrexham interim manager Carl Darlington told BBC Radio Wales: "I thought we were very unfortunate today. That was our fourth game in eight days. To come out with the attitude and desire and the work rate that they've put in, you can only commend the players for that."
