The former Dundee United midfielder, 28, will be at McDiarmid Park for the rest of the season.
"He's a talented player who I think will add quality to the squad at a crucial time of the season," Saints manager Tommy Wright told the club website.
Meanwhile, the Perth Club have released midfielder Gary McDonald.
Wright brought McDonald to Perth from League Two Morecambe in June 2013 and he has since played more than 50 matches for the club.
Last January he signed a contract extension to keep him at McDiarmid Park until the end of this season but both parties have ended that agreement.
St Johnstone stated on their website that McDonald, 32, "leaves with the best wishes of everyone at the club".
McDonald began his career at Kilmarnock and moved to Oldham in 2006. He played more than 50 times for Aberdeen when he returned to Scotland in 2008 and had a season at Hamilton Academical before his two-year spell at Morecambe.
Development squad player Scott Stevenson has also been released by St Johnstone by mutual consent. The 18-year-old joined in the summer of 2013.
Swanson won the Scottish Cup with United before joining Peterborough in 2012 and Coventry two years later.
