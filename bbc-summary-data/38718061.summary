Plans to buy cameras which will sit on a parked car, monitoring those who park on zig-zag lines, were approved by the county council on Monday.
A council report said they would "deter drivers from parking in an area that jeopardises the safety of children".
The car will be parked outside school entrances at eight sites on rotation, starting later this month.
These are:
The pilot scheme was recommended for approved in April last year. Since then, council officers have surveyed each site to ensure road markings and signage are clear.
Richard Davies, executive member for highways, said: "We want to make sure local children can get to school safely. Irresponsible parking can put them at risk, and we need to put a stop to it.
"It can also massively inconvenience local residents, which isn't fair."
He said the CCTV would record vehicles parked illegally outside schools, capture their registration numbers and send their owners tickets through the post.
