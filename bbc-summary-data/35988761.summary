[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph Page, 62, of Brecon Close, Ipswich, was sentenced after being found guilty at Ipswich Crown Court last month.
The court heard his victim was younger than ten years old when Page assaulted her in the 1990s.
Suffolk Police said the case showed it was possible to "get justice for victims of historical offences".

Det Con Natalie Cole said: "A friend of the victim had encouraged her to tell her partner about the abuse and, after receiving their support, she decided to report to police.
"She was interviewed and gave a clear account of several occasions when abuse had occurred."
She added: "The result today has again shown that we can get justice for victims of historical offences.
"Any allegations will be investigated and, even if you do not wish to go to court, support and help is available."
