After falling in the first few minutes of trade, the FTSE 100 recovered to stand 22.61 points higher at 6,140.89.
The biggest fallers in the index were all from the travel and tourism sector.
Travel firm Tui fell 4.4%, British Airways owner IAG was down 3% while cruise firm Carnival fell 2.2%.
Intercontinental Hotels had been one of the biggest fallers, but it regained some ground following news of a big hotel deal in the US. Marriott International has agreed to buy Starwood Hotels for $12.2bn.
Oil prices rose slightly following Friday's attack in Paris, as traders feared rising political and security tensions.
Brent crude rose 55 cents to $45.02 a barrel, while US crude climbed 75 cents, nearly 2%, to $41.49.
As a result, Royal Dutch Shell rose 2.6% while shares in BP were up 1.8%.
The Paris attacks led investors to seek out traditional haven assets such as gold, and the spot price of the metal hit a 10-day high of $1,097.90 an ounce at one point.
Aerospace group Rolls-Royce was one of the largest risers in the index, up 2.4% after having fallen sharply last week following another profit warning.
