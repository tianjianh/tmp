Football League: Five things you may have missed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One the most bizarre red cards of the season, a 540-mile round trip to see your team concede four goals and a Premier League legend leading his side to their highest-ever league position.

Add to that a penalty-saving machine and some first wins of the season - this is BBC Sport's guide to the stories you might have missed in the Football League on Saturday.
Gabriel's controversial red card at Chelsea grabbed many of the Premier League headlines on Saturday - but his red card might not have been the most controversial of the day.
Step forward Peterborough's England youth international Jermaine Anderson. The 19-year-old was dismissed for throwing a drinks bottle into the crowd.
Referee Mark Heywood appeared to miss the incident, but it did not escape the notice of fourth official Rob Smith, and Anderson was sent for an early bath in Peterborough's League One game with Walsall.
Anderson claimed it was accidental, but it did not do his team any harm as he had barely taken his socks off before Michael Bostwick won and scored a penalty to gain a point for the Posh.
If Anderson is something of a villain, then Jamie Jones is most certainly a hero, unless you are a Gillingham fan.
Having kept out a spot-kick to earn his side a win at Sheffield United in midweek, Colchester's on-loan goalkeeper saved a penalty for the second game in succession to secure a 2-1 victory against the team that began the day top of League One.
Colchester are up to 12th in the table.
Thank goodness Burton is the brewing capital of Great Britain. Their fans are celebrating after reaching the summit of League One for the first time in their history.
Under the guidance of former Netherlands, Chelsea and Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, the Brewers broke new ground with a 1-0 win at Swindon.
The 1956 Staffordshire Senior Cup winners have come a long way in 65 years, having only won promotion to the Football League in 2009 and winning the League Two title last season.
For the record, Stuart Beavon scored Albion's winner - he's got 23 fewer Dutch caps and played in two fewer FA Cup finals than his manager - but Beavon does have one more Hellenic League Premier Division winners medal.
Newport County are now the only side yet to achieve a league win this season.
Blackburn, Crewe and Rotherham all finally got their first three-point hauls, leaving Terry Butcher's side to rue their missed chances as they drew 0-0 at Dagenham and Redbridge.
Jordan Rhodes was Blackburn's hero as he scored twice in Rovers' 3-0 win over Charlton to move them out of the Championship's bottom three.
Rotherham stay bottom despite getting a helping hand for their first win - Cardiff's Matthew Connolly scored a last-minute own goal to gift the Millers a 2-1 win.
And Crewe moved off the bottom of League One thanks to Adam King's goal after two minutes at Shrewsbury Town. Those final 88 minutes must have been pretty tense for their travelling fans.
Finally, spare a thought for Exeter City's 201 travelling fans, who embarked on a 540-mile round trip to Accrington full of hope after three wins in a row, including a 4-0 demolition of leaders Leyton Orient and no goals conceded in that time.
But they did not bank on Josh Windass. The son of ex-Hull striker Dean, Windass scored twice in a minute to set Stanley on their way as they racked up a 4-0 lead before City grabbed a couple near the end.
Accrington seem to be tipped for relegation at the start of every season and this one was no different. However, John Coleman's team sit proudly in a League Two play-off spot after eight matches.
