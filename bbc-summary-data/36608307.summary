[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United have signed goalkeeper Simon Eastwood on an initial one-year contract after his release by Blackburn Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old re-signs for the club he left in 2011, after failing to make a single appearance in 12 months.
Oxford boss Michael Appleton managed Eastwood during his short spell in charge at Ewood Park in 2013.
The goalkeeper becomes Appleton's first summer signing following their promotion to League One.
Eastwood signed a new two-year deal at Ewood Park in 2014 but he failed to make a single Blackburn appearance during 2015-16.
"It was time to leave Blackburn to play first-team football and that's what I am here for," Eastwood told BBC Radio Oxford.
"I think it is very different [to when I was here before], there are only a couple lads still here from last time."
Oxford have the option to exercise a one-year contract extension.
