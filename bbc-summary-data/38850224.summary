It had been forecast by analysts to report larger sales of $44.7bn during the busy holiday period of the three months to 31 December 2016.
Net profit rose from $482m in the final quarter of 2015 to $749m.
For the full-year, sales increased 27% to $136bn and income soared from $596m to $2.4bn.
Amazon said last month that the 2016 holiday was its best-ever shopping season, when it shipped 50% more items than the prior year.
