Several roads are closed in Great Yarmouth and motorists have been warned the town is "gridlocked".
The machinery, which police described as "bigger than a car", fell off a lorry on South Quay and rolled onto the pavement.
Damage to the road still needs to be assessed and engineers are on site, Norfolk County Council said.
