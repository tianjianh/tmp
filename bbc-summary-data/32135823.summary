That was how West Midlands political editor Patrick Burns summed up May's election result in a blog post earlier this year.
When it comes to Coventry & Warwickshire we know seats like North Warwickshire - the most marginal Conservative seat in the country - and Labour's number one target seat, will be a key battleground.
Another on Labour's list is the fight to try to take back Warwick & Leamington. The Conservatives are defending a majority of 3,513 there.
Nuneaton will be an interesting fight, with the Conservatives defending a majority of 2,069.

Out on the streets of the city I caught a snapshot of the big issues for voters. For those I spoke to it was the economy, immigration and the NHS.

I'll be following the candidates out on the campaign trail and watching carefully as they target every vote.
