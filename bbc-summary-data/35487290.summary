The news of Annan Athletic's 4-1 fourth-round win over Hamilton Academical was far-reaching.
Omar, the son of refugees from Iraqi Kurdistan, was featured in the local press there.
"There's a big following there now, my uncle tells me," said the Glasgow University student.
"A lot of them, when they are looking out for scores, will look out for Annan Athletic now."
Annan's dream ended in the fifth round though, when they lost 4-1 to Morton.
