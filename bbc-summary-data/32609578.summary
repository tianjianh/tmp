Dyffryn Gardens is a hive of activity as gardeners, conservationists and builders work on the restoration programme.
As part of the renovation, statues have been removed to be restored and plants are being grown ready for the summer.
Workmen will be on the site continuously from now to July.
Geraldine Donovan, general manager at National Trust Dyffryn Gardens, said: "It's wonderful to see so much care and attention go into this project from so many experts.
"Parts of these gardens were restored in 1998 but more was needed and the level of detail this project will achieve will make these rooms extra special places to visit.
"Watching the gardens changing a little bit each day is really exciting.
"The process is just as exciting as the prospect of the end result."
The rooms will be finished and open to the public in the summer.
