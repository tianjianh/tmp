Norway jails two for Danish newspaper terror plot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Norwegian court has convicted two men of planning to attack Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten after it printed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The convictions were the first under Norway's anti-terrorism legislation.
Mikael Davud, a Norwegian from China's ethnic Uighur minority who had links to al-Qaeda, was jailed for seven years.
An Iraqi Kurd, Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak, was given three-and-a-half years. Another man, David Jakobsen, was cleared of terror charges.
The judge said that Davud "had planned the attack together with al-Qaeda".
The three men, arrested in July 2010, had denied the charges, although Davud had admitted he was planning to attack Chinese interests in Norway because of the treatment of ethnic Uighurs.
During the trial, prosecutors said that Davud had learned about explosives at an al-Qaeda camp in Pakistan and, together with Bujak, had planned to use them against the Danish newspaper.
It was also claimed they had intended to kill Kurt Westergaard, who drew some of the cartoons.
Bujak admitted his hatred for the cartoonist but said he and Davud had gone no further than discussing the possibility of punishing Kurt Westergaard and the newspaper.
Jakobsen was found guilty of helping the other two get hold of explosives, but cleared of terror charges.
He said that after he had bought the chemical hydrogen peroxide from an Oslo pharmacy, he alerted Norway's Police Security Service (PST) in November 2009.
He was given a four-month sentence, but was freed immediately because of time already served.
