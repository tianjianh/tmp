Barrister Omar Khan admits supplying cocaine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

Omar Khan, 31, had worked at The Johnson Partnership in Nottingham for five years before he was arrested.

They are due to be sentenced on 15 April.

The court heard the case involved the recovery of 1kg (2.2lb) of cocaine.
Digby Johnson, a partner at the Johnson firm, confirmed they did not represent Khan - who had set up his own office and was set to leave the company.
"I still find it hard to believe he could do something as stupid as involve himself in drugs and people who were heavily involved in drugs," Mr Johnson said.
"I'm just at a loss. You do question everything you've ever believed about anybody."
Mr Johnson also described Khan, of William Street, Huddersfield, as a "lovely guy" who was "incredibly hard-working".
"He would put in hour after hour," he added. "He was keen to progress and impress."
Khan appeared at the court via video link to admit conspiracy to supply the Class A drug.
Manahasa, of no fixed address, Dibra, of Joyce Avenue, Nottingham, and Ali, of Chard Street, Nottingham, were remanded in custody following the hearing.
