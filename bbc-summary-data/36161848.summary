Scotland's politicians have been looking ahead to polling day with the Holyrood election one week away.

Party leaders set out their vision for the next five years while campaigning across Scotland.
Nicola Sturgeon marked the one-week countdown to polling day with her deputy John Swinney in South Queensferry.
In the shadow of the new Forth crossing, Ms Sturgeon appealed to voters to give her a personal mandate as first minister.
She said: "The SNP is the only party with the strength, unity and vision to move Scotland forward.
"Our positive, ambitious plans to shape a better future for Scotland by increasing childcare, transforming the NHS and securing more and better-paid jobs are winning support across the country."
Kezia Dugdale warned that not backing Labour could see a further Â£3bn in cuts imposed on Scotland.
Visiting a nursery in Glasgow, the Scottish Labour leader said she would introduce a three-step programme to create "a fairer country for all".
These include a 50p tax rate on people earning more than Â£150,000, investment in schools through an increase to the education budget in the next parliament, and a halt to cuts to the NHS and public services.
Ms Dugdale said: "Change isn't easy, but voting for change is. A week from today, I want people to put a cross next to Labour on both their ballot papers so that we can use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to change our country for the better."
Visiting a waste management plant in Dumfries, Ruth Davidson said her party could be "the strong opposition" that Scotland needs.
The Scottish Conservative leader said she could "hold the SNP to account" and force the next Scottish government to focus on issues that really mattered - such as service provision, jobs and the economy.
Ms Davidson said the Tories were the only party not talking about taking more money out of people's pay packets in the form of extra tax.
She said she wanted to see a "competitive and fair" tax rate to encourage job creation and investment.
Willie Rennie took to a quad bike in Angus while seeking to accelerate his campaign ahead of the vote on 5 May.
The Scottish Lib Dem leader said his party had run a "positive, uplifting campaign" about "making Scotland the best again", which he said was broadening support.
He said: "Everywhere I go, people come up to me to say how pleased they are that our party is campaigning strongly on education and that we are giving mental health the attention it has missed out on for years.
"People are considering voting Liberal Democrat for the first time based on our bold and positive programme for Scotland."
