A house in Dorian Drive, Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, was targeted by a gunman just after midnight.
A 49-year-old man who lives in the house was uninjured. His daughters, aged 20 and 25, were also uninjured in the attack which happened at 00:05.
However, police said a window at the front of the property had received "extensive damage".
Det Sgt Dougie Stevenson appealed for information from anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area around the time of the incident.
He said extra patrols had been put in place in the area in an effort to reassure the local community.
"Police inquiries are at an early stage to establish a potential motive for this crime, however, a thorough investigation will be carried out into the circumstances, and to trace whoever is responsible," he said.
"Local officers have been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and are gathering CCTV images from the local area to gather more information.
"Crimes of this nature are very rare, however, I can understand the concerns that the public may have.
"I would like to reassure the local community that there are extra police patrols in the area, and anyone with concerns should speak to police."
