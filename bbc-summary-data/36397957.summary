Leeds United head coach Steve Evans has said he is keen to stay at the club but wants his future to be resolved soon.

Evans, 53, returned to work at Elland Road this week despite the club approaching Bristol Rovers boss Darrell Clarke on Tuesday.
"The obvious and simple, one-word answer to that [if he would stay], is yes," Evans told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I need to establish, in the next week or so at the latest, whether I have a plan going forward at Leeds United."
He added: "I've not allowed my representatives to put me in front of any other board of directors or chairman and have a chat about somewhere else, because of the wonderful opportunity that is here.
"The chairman is very straight with me and has been all down the line. I have had a great relationship with him all the way through the season I've been here."
Evans was appointed in October 2015 on a rolling contract until 30 June, with the remit to keep Leeds in the Championship.
The Whites finished in 13th place but Evans has been given no assurances about his future, with MK Dons manager Karl Robinson recently turning down an offer to coach Leeds.
"At this minute in time I need to establish whether the bridge is broken or whether it's remaining and I can get across it," Evans said.
"If Steve Evans is the head coach at Leeds United, you can put the kettle on for the play-offs."
After the approach from Leeds, Bristol Rovers confirmed on Friday that Clarke had agreed a new three-year contract.
"It's been a difficult situation as everyone can imagine, but I respect the fact that Mr Cellino and the board have a decision to make," Evans added.
"I think I have to retain a lot of dignity and character and I think I've tried to display that, and that's always been in the forefront of my mind as I've gone forward."
