Disclosure have posted a statement on their Facebook page to deny claims that they stole lyrics for some of their tracks.

They said they wanted to "make it clear that every Disclosure song we've put our names to has been written by us".
Songwriter Katie Farrah Sopher claims that the band's tracks White Noise, Latch and You and Me feature words taken from her personal songbook.
Sopher is claiming a reported Â£200,000 in damages for the tracks.
According to the Mail on Sunday she is accusing ex-boyfriend Sean Sawyers of stealing the songbook and selling lyrics to music industry contacts.
The songwriter also claims the book features lyrical content inspired by a "toxic" relationship with Sawyers.
Disclosure's statement continued: "We sometimes write lyrics and melodies alongside whoever the featured singer may be (i.e. Sam, Eliza etc) and the great Mr. Jimmy Napes, but that is it.
"When we do, we always make sure everyone gets proper credit.
"We take great pride in our self sufficiency, our work and the way we work, and it's incredibly frustrating when someone tries to take that away from us, by claiming we stole even one word or one note of our music from anyone."
Disclosure, brothers Guy Lawrence and Howard Lawrence, said they would much rather "be working on more music than commenting on these types of things".
"So, just to be clear, all allegations made against us to do with this subject are completely false, as anyone we have ever worked with will back up.
"We didn't get into this industry to steal other people's ideas and we haven't - we are musicians, artists and producers."
The Lawrence brothers ended their post with a comment about their next album.
"In better newsâ€¦ Album 2 is niiiiicely underway!"
