A rare copy of the comic in which Superman made his debut has been sold at auction for $956,000 (£728,000).

Action Comics No 1 cost 10 cents when it first went on sale in 1938.
The copy sold by Dallas-based Heritage Auctions is one of about 100 originals known to still exist. Its condition was rated 5.5 out of 10.
But it is far from the most expensive comic ever sold - a nine out of 10-rated copy of the same edition fetched $3.2m (£1.9m) in 2014.
Heritage said the copy sold on Thursday came from the collection of an unnamed East Coast comic book fan who had bought it in the 1990s for $26,000 (£19,800).
After his appearance in Action Comics No 1, Superman soon became a hit and was given his own dedicated comic in 1939.
