The Arsenal man, 25, has not played since getting injured on the opening weekend of the Premier League season.
Midfielder Jonny Williams has returned to light training with loan club Ipswich but is lacking match fitness and is also not included.
Shaun MacDonald has been called up, but George Williams is left out.
The Euro 2016 semi-finalists started their World Cup qualifying campaign with a 4-0 win over Moldova in September and play Austria on 6 October followed by Georgia in Cardiff three days later.
Ramsey was Wales' outstanding player at Euro 2016, but was suspended for the 2-0 semi-final defeat by Portugal.
Wales squad: Wayne Hennessey, Danny Ward, Owain Fon Williams, Ben Davies, James Chester, James Collins, Paul Dummett, Chris Gunter, Ashley Richards, Neil Taylor, Ashley Williams, Joe Allen, David Edwards, Emyr Huws, Andy King, Tom Lawrence, Joe Ledley, Shaun MacDonald, Gareth Bale, Simon Church, David Cotterill, Hal Robson-Kanu, Sam Vokes
