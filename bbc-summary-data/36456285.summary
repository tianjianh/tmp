Rosemary and Lewis Owen, of Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan, were on holiday with their son, John, in Hua Hin when the attack happened in April.
Mrs Owen, 65, needed surgery to remove fluid from the brain after the attack.
On Sunday, she said the Foreign Office had confirmed the men had each been jailed for four years.
News of their sentences was reported in the Bangkok Post.
Suphatra Baithong and Yingyai Saengkham-in, both aged 32, and Siwa Noksri and Chaiya Jaiboon, both 20, were each sentenced to four years in prison.
But their jail terms were halved because they had confessed, meaning each man will serve two years.
Footage of the assault captured on CCTV was widely shared online in Thailand and drew international attention to the attack.
Thai police said it started after John Owen accidentally bumped into a Thai man in the street during celebrations for the Thai New Year.
Footage showed a brief argument taking place before attackers punched and kicked the Owens.
Mr Owen, 68, a director at Glamorgan Electrical Repairs in Cardiff, and John Owen, 43, a graphic designer who lives in Singapore, both needed stitches for head injuries following the assault on 13 April.
After the attack Panadda Diskul, a minister in the Thai prime minister's office, visited Mr and Mrs Owen in hospital where he was reported to have apologised on behalf of the Thai government.
