[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 2-2 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Parkin struck back twice to level for Newport County as they and Cheltenham battled to a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Asa Hall hammered in the opener from outside the box amid sloppy home defending.
Parkin equalised from close range only for Daniel Wright to put the visitors back ahead from the penalty spot after Paul Bignot brought down Harry Pell.
But Parkin struck again soon after, again from close range to finalise the scoring before the break.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales: "For the neutral it's a great game but from our point of view I'm disappointed we didn't win that.
"I said before the game I wanted clean sheets and we didn't do it. We gave them the two goals. It's schoolboy football.
"You can't question our character and I though there were some good performances from us but I'm just disappointed with the manner of the goals we conceded."
