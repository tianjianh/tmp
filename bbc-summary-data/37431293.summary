London 2012 Olympic bronze medallist Conlan, 24, has opted to turn pro after signing a deal with the American-based Top Rank organisation run by Bob Arum.
"Carl is probably Ireland's greatest fighter ever at the minute. I want to surpass that obviously," said Conlan, whose amateur career ended on a sour note as he suffered a controversial quarter-final defeat at the recent Olympics.
"He's someone I would love to fight. His style is a great style. I know ways I could beat it so obviously I want to fight him.
"That's miles from me at the minute but hopefully one day it happens."
Frampton, 29, became the first Northern Ireland fighter to win a world title in two weight divisions when he outpointed the previously unbeaten Leo Santa Cruz in July.
