Kieffer Moore hopes he can continue his goalscoring form after getting a hat-trick for Torquay United against Solihull Moors.

The Torbay-born forward is on a month's loan at Plainmoor from National League rivals Forest Green and has scored four goals in two games.
"That was my first hat-trick so I'm buzzing," Moore told BBC Radio Devon.
"I did have a good feeling, but it's a great start and hopefully I can continue this form."
The 24-year-old was part of Torquay's academy before it was disbanded in 2009, having also been a ball-boy at the club.
"I hope I can see the whole stint out and maybe more, you never know, but I'm enjoying it here, it's brilliant," he added.
"I was lacking that match sharpness, so a move to Torquay it was, but I don't think I was lacking that much."
Moore began playing football in the amateur South Devon League in Paignton before being picked up by non-league Truro City and eventually ending up at Yeovil Town.
He spent two years at Yeovil in the Championship and League One, before moving to Norway to play for Viking FK.
Moore said: "My career's taken a funny turn, maybe going out to Norway didn't help that, so in a sense I've had to rebuild myself and this is part of that.
"This is all for my career and hopefully I'll get back to those heights one day and prove that I am that Championship player and maybe better."
