Avon and Somerset Police said it has received seven reports of people on motorbikes throwing bottles of flammable liquid since Thursday.
A van, two bikes and a portable toilet were among the items torched around the Bedminster area.
A police spokesman said it was "sheer luck" that no-one had been injured.
On Thursday evening, police received reports of five people on motorbikes riding around Dame Emily Park starting fires.
A few minutes later, two riders were spotted throwing a "fireball" at a parked motorbike.
Later, a group of teenagers reported two motorcyclists threw a lit glass bottle at them.
On Friday, officers were called out to a van fire on Elmdale Road and bike on fire on North Street.
Det Sgt Jack Tween said: "The suspects have clearly given no thought to their safety or the safety of others.
"We would appeal for anyone who may have information on any of these incidents to contact us."
