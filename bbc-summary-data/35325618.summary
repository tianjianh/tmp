Exonian Ladies player Lily Partridge, 22, collapsed at the side of the pitch after getting hurt during a tackle in December at North Tawton, Devon, and died in hospital days later.
About 200 people watched the game against Newton Abbot Ladies in Topsham.
A charity auction followed, with items donated by Coldplay, and Shaldon Zoo where Ms Partridge worked.
Coldplay's lead singer Chris Martin, who knows the family, donated signed merchandise including a guitar.
Katie Lunnon, team captain, said: "It's about remembering what a special person Lily was and how much fun and excitement she bought into our lives.
"It's not a day to be sad.
"We're part of a rugby family and we've all pulled together and everyone has been there for each other."
The club said Ms Partridge had suffered "a couple" of concussions previously, but had taken the recommended time out from playing and had consulted a doctor.
Ms Partridge, who was a part-time teacher and also worked as a keeper at the zoo, had played for Exonian Ladies for about 18 months. She was also the club's social secretary.
Her parents Jeff and Liz paid tribute at the time, saying she was "the glue that stuck everyone together and was a brilliant star in their lives".
It was revealed at her funeral at Exeter Cathedral that Ms Partridge saved the lives of at least four people as she was an organ donor.
The money raised from the auction will be donated to the Devon Air Ambulance, Exeter Intensive Care Unit and Shaldon Zoo.
