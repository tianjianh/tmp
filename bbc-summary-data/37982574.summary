[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 2-2 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham substitute Carl Winchester rescued a draw for cash-strapped Oldham with an injury-time equaliser at Vale Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vale had come from behind when dangerous substitute Rigino Cicilia fired in on 78 minutes, after Remie Streete had cancelled out Oliver Banks' early second-half opener for the visitors.
Following revelations earlier in the day of the full extent of their off-field difficulties, Oldham had the better of a poor first half in which the home side took a long time to get going.
Right-back Josh Law was  a constant threat on the overlap, while Banks' powerful header drew a fine save from Jak Alnwick leaping to his right.
Banks then broke the deadlock just three minutes after the break when his right foot 20-yard free-kick took a wicked deflection off the Vale wall to wrongfoot Alnwick.
But Vale took only three minutes to level when Streete headed home Ryan Taylor's free-kick.
They looked to have won it when Latics keeper Connor Ripley turned away Alex Jones' shot, only for Portuguese midfielder Quentin Pereira to steer the ball back in from the left, allowing fellow sub Cicilia to drill home from 15 yards.
But Winchester eased Oldham's troubles when he struck from close range four minutes into stoppage-time to send Oldham's 148 faithful fans home happy on a freezing night in Burslem.
