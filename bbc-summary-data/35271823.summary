[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A swimming pool threatened with closure could be saved after Derby City Council entered discussions with local groups to help run the facility.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Labour-led authority had planned to shut Moorways Pool from March in a bid to save about Â£350,000 a year.
It said "positive" meetings have been held with groups including the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) to find external funding.
Thousands of people signed a petition to keep the pool open in 2014.
The city council said rising maintenance costs on the 42-year-old pool and the need to make Â£45m in cuts by 2018/19, were behind the proposals,
Councillor Baggy Shanker, who has been leading the negotiations, said: "We know how important Moorways is to the wider community but we cannot allow our perilous financial situation to limit our ambitions for the future.
"That's why we are looking at ways to enable local groups to take over the running of the pool."
He added that meetings have been scheduled with a charitable trust seeking a site for a pool in the city.
