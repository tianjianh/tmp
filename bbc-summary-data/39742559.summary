[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If you're a fan of David Beckham, have a look at the front page of the Coleraine Chronicle.

The paper shows a picture of local woman Kathleen McBride with the man himself.
Mrs McBride had the chance encounter with the football legend at Buckingham Palace where she received an MBE.
Becks told her he had enjoyed his time in Coleraine when playing in the Milk Cup.
Also in the paper, there's a row brewing up north between unionists.
The paper reports that DUP MP Gregory Campbell has urged Jim Allister to "see the wider picture" after the TUV leader lodged an uncompromising objection to a new north coast hotel development.
Mr Allister, who owns a home near the site, questioned the need for more hotel beds, however, Mr Campbell said the need was "unquestionable".
"Don't be a stinker," pleads the front page of the Antrim Guardian. Sound advice indeed, but, in the words of the late Cilla Black, what's it all about?
The paper says angry residents of the town have complained after "yet another local area fell foul of dog waste".
Residents of Brantwood Gardens in Antrim have said enough is enough and they are fed up with the amount of dog dirt in the area.
The council said it takes the issue of dog fouling seriously and enforcement action is ongoing.  It said eight people have been hit with a fine this month.
Milkman are few and far between these days, but the paper has feature with a man who's lifted the lid on the job.
Retired milkman John Robinson, who now collects bottles from around the world, has let the paper in to some of the more bizarre experiences he's had.
Some of the more unusual notes he's had: "Dear milkman, money on the table, wife in bed, please help yourself" - what an offer.
Another gem is "Milkman, please do not leave any milk at number 14 as he is dead until further notice".
There's only one story in town in the The Newry Democrat.
Earlier this month, the Southern Health Trust announced the emergency service at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry was unsustainable as it relied too heavily on locums.
"The writing's on the wall" - the paper warns. It quotes Jim Kerr, who was involved in trying to save the service.
He said he believes the permanent closure of the emergency department is a possibility as closures can be like a "house of cards".
Doh! The paper also reports on a woman from Dromore who is bringing Moe's Tavern from popular cartoon The Simpsons to the Emerald Isle.
Lisa McMahon's company is setting up an inflatable Moe's Tavern where punters can drink just like Homer, Lenny and Barney.
"Tragic road racer was living his dream" - The Portadown Times reports that the Italian motorbike rider who died after coming off his bike at at the Tandragee 100 at the weekend would be devastated if the race was scrapped for safety reasons.
Dario Cecconi sustained critical injuries in the last lap of the senior support race on Saturday.
Anne Forsyth, clerk of the course and a friend of Dario's said the 38-year-old loved the road race and was living his dream.
She added that it would be a "disservice to the riders if they didn't continue with it".
The paper also features a woman from Moyraverty who has been to the infamous island of Fernandos. Fans of the ITV dating show Take me Out will know just what this means.
Ciara DeCartaret, a former pupil of St Anthony's Primary School and Lismore Comprehensive School, went to the island with her date Daniel.
Sadly it was "no likey" for Ciara, but she doesn't regret the experience.
The Strabane Chronicle has a tribute to a local woman who died in a fatal road traffic accident on Monday.
Margaret McLaughlin, 69, was a passenger in a car returning from a bingo game with her husband Pat and was involved in a collision with a lorry.
Mrs McLaughlin's priest and friend Fr Michael Doherty described her as a "gentle woman".  She had worked for the priest for 27 years as a housekeeper.
Also in the paper - there's an 83-year-old who's just run his 37th London Marathon.
Pensioner Ken Jones belongs to a group of people called the "Everpresents" who have run the marathon every year since it began.
"At my age you're always in doubt because you never know if you're going to be fit enough, but I'm already thinking about it next year," Ken told the paper.
The Impartial Reporter reports that young entrepreneurs from a Fermanagh primary school have produced a CD that "helps children to learn their times tables" with the help of the latest chart hits.
The pupils from Tattygar Primary School, Lisbellaw have put together the 'Times Tables CD' as part of their participation in the Junior Entrepreneur Programme (JEP).
