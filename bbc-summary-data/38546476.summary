[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump has confirmed he will hold his first meeting with Theresa May in the spring, saying he was "very much" looking forward to it.

The US President-elect tweeted that the Prime Minister would head to Washington to meet him after his inauguration.
He referred to Britain as "a long time US ally" and as "very special".
Mrs May said Britain "shares values" with the US but denounced Mr Trump's previous obscene comments about women as "unacceptable".
In reference to footage of Mr Trump bragging about grabbing women, released before his election, Mrs May said: "I think that's unacceptable, but in fact Donald Trump himself has said that and has apologised for it."
She told Sky News on Sunday that UK-US relations were "much bigger" than an individual friendship between the British and American premiers.
"It's an important relationship in terms of security and stability around the world," she said.
Mrs May, who said she has had two "positive conversations" with Mr Trump ahead of the meeting, added: "We feel we can say to the US if we disagree with something they're doing."
The meeting was organised by the PM's closest advisers over Christmas. A date has not yet been confirmed, but is expected to come within weeks of Mr Trump's inauguration on 20 January.
Mr Trump's tweet was sent just after 02:00 GMT (21:00 in New York).
The PM and President-elect have spoken twice since his election victory in November and Mrs May's joint chiefs of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, travelled to the US in December to meet with Mr Trump's team.
The first British politician to meet Mr Trump after his win was former Ukip leader Nigel Farage - five days after the US went to the polls.
Mr Farage, who campaigned alongside the incoming president, said the new leadership offered a "real opportunity" for improved trade between the UK and the US.
Mrs May received a phone call from Mr Trump two days after the election and is thought to have been the ninth leader he spoke to.
In a tweet a week later, Mr Trump said Mr Farage would "do a great job" if the government made him the ambassador to the US.
Mr Farage said the suggestion had come as a "bolt from the blue", adding: "If I could help the UK in any way I would".
But Downing Street rejected the idea, saying "there is no vacancy".
