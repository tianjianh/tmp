Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink managed Southampton counterpart Ronald Koeman when the pair won the European Cup with PSV Eindhoven in 1988.
They later fell out over Hiddink's appointment as Netherlands manager in 2014, although both have said there were no hard feelings.
They shared a handshake and a few words before their teams competed in a fascinating match.
Southampton were initially on top but Chelsea showed they had the greater stamina and capitalised on the home side dropping back too much after the break.
Hiddink will not only be pleased with his side's desire and commitment but the fact they recovered from conceding against a team who had not let in a goal in six games.
The Blues remain unbeaten in the Dutchman's 11 league games since he took over from Jose Mourinho.
Southampton had been unbeaten in six league games, including five wins, before this match.
Keeper Fraser Forster set a top-flight league record of going 667 minutes without being beaten when the clock reached 34 minutes at St Mary's and, when he did eventually let a goal in, it was in bizarre circumstances.
The assistant was flagging for a foul by Chelsea's Kenedy on Cedric Soares but referee Martin Atkinson overruled and Fabregas sent in a low curling cross, which Forster misjudged as it went across him and in at the far post.
"I don't understand that. The linesman is the closest to the situation. If it is a fault by Kenedy then you have to listen to the linesman. That's why you have linesmen - to help you," Koeman said.
When asked about his view, Hiddink said: "There are many duels and referees in England usually let a lot of duels go."

Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink: "I think it was a deserved win for us. They haven't conceded in the last six, seven games so it was successful for us.
"We had a setback when we went 1-0 down - it was a present from our defence - but we did very well in the second half. We were well organised and then got the goals."
On replacing Baba Rahman, whose mistake led to Southampton's goal, at half-time: "I don't want to make a fake injury. I took him off because of the error. He has to cope with that. He was very down in the locker room about his mistake, but we have to make decisions like we did."
