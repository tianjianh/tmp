[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues fly-half Jarrod Evans kicked a late penalty as they beat visitors Exeter Chiefs 21-20 in their final pre-season warm-up.

Earlier Dragons were beaten 40-23 by Glasgow Warriors at Ebbw Vale's Eugene Cross Park home.
And there were similar defeats for west Wales teams Scarlets and Ospreys.
Gloucester proved too strong for Scarlets in a 40-21 win at Kingsholm while Ospreys were beaten 40-14 at Leicester.
Returning fly-half James Hook was powerless to prevent Ospreys' loss at Welford Road, but wing Jeff Hassler touched down on his first appearance after 10 months out injured.
Olympics Sevens silver medallist Sam Cross came off the Ospreys' bench as he sought to impress in the sport's full version.
Leicester wing Jonny May went over twice as they eased to victory.
Scarlets were level 7-7 at the break at Gloucester after Willi Heinz and Gareth Davies exchanged tries.
But the hosts built a commanding lead by the time Wales prop Rob Evans and scrum-half Aled Davies went over late on for the visitors.
However, lock lock Jake Ball returned after missing Wales' summer tour Tests against Tonga and Samoa.
Ball also missed Scarlets' win over Munster in the Pro12 final in Dublin.
Prop Samson Lee was in the pack and Scotland flanker John Barclay among the replacements.
Blues wing Aled Summerhill went over twice and half-time replacement Evans' late shot went over after Henry Slade had kicked the visitors ahead.
Summerhill struck back after Don Armand scored Exeter's opening try and did so again after Sam Simmonds went over for the Chiefs.
Earlier Dragons were beaten 40-23 by Glasgow Warriors at Ebbw Vale's Eugene Cross Park home.
A dead leg ruled summer signing Gavin Henson out of that game.
But he is expected to be in contention for Dragons' opening Pro14 match against Leinster on Saturday, 2 September.
Angus O'Brien kicked an early penalty and converted half-back partner Charlie Davies' opening try at Eugene Cross Park.
Rory Hughes began the fight-back and Ruaridh Jackson also crossed as Warriors led 14-13 at the break.
O'Brien put Dragons briefly in front, but Nick Grigg, Scott Cummings, Sam Johnson and Paddy Kelly sealed Glasgow's win.
