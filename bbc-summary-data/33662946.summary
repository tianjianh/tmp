Mick Fanning, 34, posted a picture of himself early on Saturday near his Tweed Heads home in northern New South Wales.
He wrote: "First surf back. Feels so good."
Mr Fanning was competing in Jeffreys Bay, on the eastern Cape, when he was knocked off his surfboard by a shark.
The three-time world champion was competing in the final of the J-Bay Open when two sharks were seen in his vicinity.
A live camera caught the moment he was thrown from his board.
He said he managed to punch the shark and startle it escaping injury. He was soon rescued and the tournament called off.
On Saturday, he posted an Instagram picture on Twitter of himself looking out to sea.
Responses included user nick.j.poole writing: "Good on ya man" and 'knee_house' posting: "Dude, such an inspiration. Now go get that gold jersey".
Meanwhile, a man has been killed by a shark in Tasmania, Australia, while diving with his daughter local media reported.
He was a recreational scallop diver and was attacked on the east coast near Orford.
