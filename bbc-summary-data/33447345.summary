[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shane Ward, 31, of Dukes Crescent in Edlington, Doncaster commented on a court case on South Yorkshire Police's Facebook page and identified the victim.
Victims of sexual offences have their anonymity protected by law for life.
Mr Ward was charged with breaching a victim's right to anonymity under the Sexual Offences Amendment Act 1992.
He is due to appear at Doncaster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday 21 July.
South Yorkshire Police said: "Whilst we welcome comments and we are keen to encourage them on our Facebook page, we will not tolerate anyone breaking the law or making threatening or abusive posts which are intended to intimidate people living in South Yorkshire.
"We understand that people have differing views on many issues, however we will not condone these types of post and they will be removed and where appropriate, investigated by police."
