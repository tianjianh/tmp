County Championship: Lancashire's Haseeb Hameed makes unbeaten 100 in Roses draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teenager Haseeb Hameed became the first Lancashire batsman to score two centuries in a Roses match as the game with Yorkshire was drawn.

The 19-year-old, who resumed the final day at Old Trafford on 30, was given time to reach his hundred off 124 balls before Lancashire declared on 232-3.
Yorkshire were left with a target of 367 in 71 overs and batted positively to reach 188-0, Alex Lees making 114.
But with 19 overs remaining and 179 still needed, the captains shook hands.
England Under-19 opener Hameed also went past 1,000 Championship runs for the season, becoming the first teenager to do so since James Taylor for Leicestershire in 2009.
And following his 114 in the first innings, Hameed joined only Percy Holmes in 1920 and Ted Lester in 1948, both Yorkshiremen, in scoring a hundred in each innings of a Roses match.
Lancashire began day four on 70-0 and pushed for quick runs with Tom Smith falling for 87 having shared an opening stand of 168 with Hameed.
But once Hameed had reached his milestone and the declaration followed, the draw always looked the most likely result with Lees and fellow opener Adam Lyth (63 not out) left with too much to do.
The result means Yorkshire are 26 points behind Division One leaders Middlesex with a game in hand, while Lancashire are eight points adrift of their biggest rivals.
