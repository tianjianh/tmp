A Dundee restaurateur who paid a failed asylum seeker £4 an hour to run his kitchen has been placed on a six-month curfew.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Habibur Chowdhury, paid Mohammed Manik just over half the minimum wage to work a 72-hour week.
Chowdhury's Ashiana restaurant was raided in June 2015 following a tip-off about illegal immigrants working there.
He later told police he had nothing to do with the restaurant and claimed not to know who Mr Manik was.
His defence agent described 60-year-old Chowdhury as "wilfully blind" when it came to checking the Bangladeshi national's papers.
Mr Manik told Home Office investigators he "felt exploited" by Chowdhury.
Depute fiscal Eilidh Robertson previously told Dundee Sheriff Court that Mr Manik had applied for asylum but had been refused.
She said: "He couldn't support himself and was living in Glasgow.
"He explained his predicament to a friend who put him in touch with the accused who offered him a job in Dundee."
The court was told Mr Manik was paid cash to work six days a week for 12 hours a day.
Miss Robertson said: "He was paid £300 a week regardless of how much he worked."
Chowdhury, of Dundee, admitted employing someone who had not been granted leave to enter or remain in the UK.
Sheriff Alastair Brown imposed a restriction of liberty order confining Chowdhury to his home address from 19:00 to 07:00 every day for six months.
Sheriff Brown said: "It seems reasonably clear that the UK government and a significant proportion of the UK public is exercised about immigration.
"The laws are there to protect the vulnerable.
"The picture I get from your record, this offence and your attitude to the social workers preparing reports in this case is of a man who regards regulatory rules with an arrogant attitude that they don't apply to him unless he so chooses."
