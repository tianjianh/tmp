A man has pleaded guilty to kicking a sheriff as he walked towards the court building in Edinburgh.

The incident took place on 22 July after 28-year old Mark Ross had been refused entry to the sheriff court for being drunk.
Ross had first approached four sheriffs as they had coffee at a nearby cafe.
He then kicked Sheriff Frank Crowe on his right leg as he returned to the court building in Chambers Street. Sentence was deferred for reports.
Fiscal depute Bruce Macrosson, prosecuting, told the court that Ross had been refused entry to the court building because of his drunken state.
Five minutes later, Ross entered the cafe where sheriffs Crowe, Gordon Liddle, Nigel Morrison and Norman McFadyen, were having coffee.
"The accused approached the table occupied by the sheriffs and mumbled something towards them which they either neither heard nor understood" said Mr Macrosson.
"The accused then approached another table."
The sheriffs left the cafe at 09:20, walking towards the court building in Chambers Street.
The fiscal depute said: "The accused approached Sheriff Crowe and kicked him on his right leg to his injury."
Sheriff Crowe reported the matter to the police and pointed out Ross as his assailant.
Mr Macrosson added that Sheriff Crowe suffered soreness to his right shin but did not require medical attention.
Defence solicitor Ray Megson told the court: "I want to see if this man can get help.
"He has a large number of previous convictions, all of the same sort. This man is not getting proper medical attention and resorts to alcohol."
Sheriff Alistair Noble deferred sentence until later this month for an updated psychiatric report and Social Work report.
