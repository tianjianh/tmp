Weston-super-Mare railway station access 'unacceptable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A temporary measure for disabled access at Weston-super-Mare railway station is "totally unacceptable", an equality forum has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People with mobility needs have been asked to call in advance if they require help accessing Platform One.
A footbridge has been the only general way to get to the platform since last summer when anti-social behaviour led to its main entrance being closed.
Great Western Railway said funding was in place for improving the access.
This is likely to mean a new bridge but work is not expected to start until next year, according to spokesman Dan Panes.
In the meantime the platform door would be open on some occasions when possible.
"Whenever possible, we do ask people to call in advance because it does mean we are able to organise things more quickly and make sure we have enough staff in the right place," Mr Panes added.
However, Gordon Richardson - vice chair of the Bristol Equality Forum-  said he thought that was "totally unacceptable today".
"If all they have to do is open a door, why should I have to tell them 24 hours in advance?," he told BBC Radio Bristol.
"Why can't they have something where perhaps you come to that door, there's an intercom and they can then open the door for you and let you in?"
Tina Keddy, a station user from the town, is also unhappy about the temporary measures.
On a recent trip to Bath with her 81-year-old mother, she said she asked a guard if there was help for the disabled "and he said 'no'".
"Mum has arthritis in her spine and in her knee. We were there in plenty of time so slowly we went up the steps, along the top, and down the other side but it was very difficult."
