The 28-year-old joined from Reading last August and scored three goals in 29 league games last season.
"It was a strong season and I want to build on the good work and contribute to a more successful future," he said.
Albion, who finished 10th in the Premier League in 2016-17, begin the new season at home to Bournemouth.
Manager Tony Pulis has signed striker Jay Rodriguez from Southampton this summer and Robson-Kanu believes the new addition provides "vital competition".
He added: "We want to be as competitive as possible and everyone will be pushing each other over the course of the season."
