[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sussex Police officers in sex-on-duty inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two police officers are at the centre of a gross misconduct inquiry over an allegation they had sex with each other on duty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sussex Police said both officers were being investigated by its professional standards department.
The Argus is reporting that those involved are a senior male officer and a female sergeant.
A force spokesperson said: "Neither of the officers have been suspended."
Last week, it emerged another Sussex officer, Brighton-based Insp Tony Lumb, had been arrested and bailed over claims of improper conduct with women.
That case is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
