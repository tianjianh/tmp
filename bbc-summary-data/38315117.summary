A road rage driver ordered to knit items to avoid a harsher sentence has been admonished after a sheriff told her he was satisfied with her efforts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amanda McCabe followed Claire Smith around Dundee before boxing her in her vehicle in a car park and punching her.
McCabe claimed she had been travelling to a specialist wool shop in Dundee and had followed Ms Smith coincidentally.
Sheriff John Rafferty told her to bring "several knitted items" to court on her sentencing date to prove her skills.
Her lawyer promised to take them to a charity shop "to help the needy".
The court heard that Ms Smith and a friend were driving on Dundee's Kingsway when MCabe entered from a slip road.
Depute fiscal John Adams said: "Ms Smith was not very impressed with the accused's driving and made her feelings known."
Ms Smith was followed by McCabe, before entering a car park to perform a u-turn.
McCabe boxed in Ms Smith's car before opening her door and punching her on the face.
McCabe, 47, of Dundee, admitted assaulting Ms Smith on 8 January.
Solicitor advocate Jim Laverty, defending, said: "Your lordship chose a unique approach to this from the sewing box.
"As a result she was the target of abuse on social media, where everyone can have an opinion and express it in writing.
"She was made out to be some kind of Madame Defarge character from A Tale of Two Cities."
Sheriff John Rafferty told McCabe at an earlier hearing: "If you are a skilled knitter then I am sure that you could produce some goods for charity.
"You will bring to court several items that you have knitted that you are prepared to donate to a charity shop."
He admonished McCabe at the latest hearing and told her: "I gave you an opportunity to make reparation to society and you did so at no cost to the public purse."
