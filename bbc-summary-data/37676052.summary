[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon £11.5m M4 roundabout project begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £11.5m project to improve junction 16 of the M4 motorway near Swindon is due to get under way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The project involves redesigning the Spittleborough roundabout so it can cope with the increased traffic from the new Wichelstowe development.
Clearance work will be the first phase followed by the major build, with completion due by spring 2018.
A planning clause means the works must be complete by the time the 1,100th home at Wichelstowe can be occupied.
Funding for the scheme has been paid for by the Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), local councils, and Highways England.
The work involves widening the slip roads off the motorway to four lanes in both directions, creating a right turn for Swindon traffic turning on to Hay Lane, and widening the carriageway on the Great Western Way approach.
