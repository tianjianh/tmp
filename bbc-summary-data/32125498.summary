England captain Wayne Rooney shares the country's excitement about Harry Kane, who will make his full international debut against Italy.

Manager Roy Hodgson says Tottenham striker Kane will start Tuesday's friendly in Turin.
Rooney, only two goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton's England record of 49, starts up front with the 21-year-old.
"I'm as excited as everyone else in the country about Harry. He's had an unbelievable season," said Rooney.
Kane won his first cap as a second-half substitute for Rooney in the 4-0 win against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday, and scored 79 seconds after coming on.
"Going into the season, there were even questions about whether he would start for Tottenham," added Manchester United captain Rooney, who also scored against Lithuania.
"He was starting Europa League games but not the Premier League games - but he gave his manager Mauricio Pochettino no option but to play him and he's not looked back, scoring goals every week."
The speed of Kane's development is illustrated by the fact that he did not make his first league start of this season until 9 November, when he played in Spurs' 2-1 home defeat by Stoke City.
However, he had scored 29 goals in all competitions for his club before getting his first England goal on Friday.
Rooney added: "It's exciting for this group of players to train with him. After his goal on Friday, I bet he can't wait to get out on the pitch and try to get another goal.
"It's great for English football to have someone scoring so regularly in the Premier League and getting a goal on his debut at full international level. It's an exciting time for him and all of us."
But Rooney said Kane faces a sterner test against battle-hardened Italy defenders such as Giorgio Chiellini, the player bitten by Luis Suarez during their World Cup defeat against Uruguay in Brazil last June.
He warned the Tottenham striker that Italy's defenders will use their experience and street-wisdom to try to frustrate him.
"They're clever defenders," said Rooney. "They do anything to try to stop you and you have to be aware of that and not get frustrated.
"Harry must continue what he is doing. He's taking the ball, running at defenders and getting shots at goal - that's all he has to do on Tuesday. If he does that the way he has been doing, he'll be fine."
