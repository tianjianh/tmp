Denny Solomona: Castleford's court case against Sale wing to be adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford's court case against Sale winger Denny Solomona, his agent Andy Clarke and the Sharks at the High Court will be adjourned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Super League side Cas are understood to want Â£500,000 in compensation after the 23-year-old quit to join Sale.
He was contracted at the Tigers until 2018, but moved to the Premiership team in December on a three-year deal.
Solomona scored 42 tries in 2016 and has added nine tries in eight games since his cross-code switch.
BBC Sport understands an out-of-court settlement for the former Samoa rugby league international could now be decided between the clubs.
His form since his move to Sale has prompted suggestions that the New Zealand-born wing could play for England when he becomes eligible.
Prominent sports lawyer David Seligman suggested the legal battle over the contract could affect both rugby codes, in a way the Bosman ruling affected football.
