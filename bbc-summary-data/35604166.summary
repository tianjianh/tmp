The 24-year-old South-Africa born forward began his career at Sale Sharks before joining Saints in 2013.
"I'm a big admirer of what [director of rugby] Dean Ryan and the coaches are building at Warriors," Williams told the club's official website.
"I can't wait to be a part of what's going to be an exciting journey."
Williams, who is qualified to play for England, was part of the Saints side that finished last season on top of the Premiership table and has made 18 appearances so far this campaign.
He will join centres Ben Te'o and Jackson Willison, second-rower Will Spencer, flanker Marco Mama and scrum-half Francois Hougaard at Sixways in the summer.
