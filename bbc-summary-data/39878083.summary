[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tinkering for science on the Irrawaddy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Poohsticks" is what you might call entry-level hydrology.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Drop twigs over a bridge on the upstream side and then race over to the downstream side to see which bits of wood appear first.
Good fun, for sure, but the scientist in you may also learn something about stream behaviour.
This is essentially what Delft University of Technology's Thom Bogaard and Rolf Hut have been doing in Myanmar. Together with local students, they've been playing a kind of poohsticks on the Irrawaddy River... with coconuts.
Their aim has been to understand how this mighty watercourse moves, how it mixes, how it might disperse and dilute pollution if faced with such a problem.
In the West, scientists would resort to all sorts of fancy, high-end equipment that costs hundreds, even thousands, of dollars. "But this is Myanmar; they can't afford that," said Dr Bogaard. "They have no information on water quality at the moment. They know a bit about sediment, but that's it. So, we decided to use citizen science to see how far we could go to get basic data."
Start with 300 coconuts. Attach them to coloured balloons that also contain a small bicycle light for visibility at night; and then just throw them in the river.
The density of a coconut is almost one, which means it sits submerged at the surface of the water and is driven by the current alone, not the wind. It's the perfect, low-cost ("off the tree", even edible) scientific drifter.
Those dropped in the middle of the Irrawaddy will in all likelihood move the fastest; those near the bank will very probably move the slowest. "And what you do is position your student teams on bridges and watch them pass by,â€
