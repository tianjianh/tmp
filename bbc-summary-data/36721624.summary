He was taken to hospital after he was struck by a Ford Focus at about 17:55 BST on Grove Lane, Handsworth, on 24 June. He died a week later, police said.
West Midlands Police said they spoke to the 23-year-old driver at the scene of the collision.
Officers have appealed for any witnesses to come forward.
The crash took place near to where two sisters were killed last year, which saw a 35-year-old man jailed for four years for causing death by dangerous driving.
