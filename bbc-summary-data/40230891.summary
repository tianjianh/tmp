Lancashire v Middlesex: Rain prevents any play at Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was frustration for Lancashire and Middlesex as rain prevented any action on day two, with play at Southport abandoned at 15:00 BST.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A wet outfield caused a delayed start and after a failed inspection at 11:30 BST, lunch was taken early.
Rain put paid to a planned inspection at 13:00 BST, and the umpires confirmed there would be no play after a further check two hours later.
Play will resume on Sunday with Lancashire 123-4, trailing by 57 runs.
