[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey Airport landing and take off noise concerns dismissed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation into complaints about increased noise from planes approaching or departing from Guernsey Airport has found "no evidence" of extra noise.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Public Services spokesman said the complaints from "a relatively small number of residents" suggested planes were taking a more southerly route.
It followed the runway being moved 120m (390ft) and safety areas being increased as part of a Â£80m project.
A review by the Director of Civil Aviation reached the same findings.
In June the airport changed its noise abatement procedures because of some of the concerns raised.
The spokesman said since these changes were brought in "a number of complainants" had reported "an improvement in noise levels".
He said: "Given the enormous amount of time and effort, and the lengths that both airport management and Public Services have already gone to in trying and resolve this issue, a line does now have to be drawn.
"Therefore neither the department nor Guernsey Airport will be responding publicly to any further complaints.
"However, the airport management will continue to investigate genuine reports of aircraft not complying with noise abatement procedures, and where this is found to be the case will take appropriate action."
