McGee has signed a three-year deal at Fratton Park.
"He's come through Tottenham's academy system and they've produced a lot of good players," assistant manager Joe Gallen told Portsmouth's website.
"It's great that we've been able to bring in a goalkeeper who's good enough now and is going to improve in the future."
