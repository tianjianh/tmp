Women's Champions League: VfL Wolfsburg Ladies 1-1 Chelsea Ladies (agg 4-1)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea Ladies were knocked out of the Women's Champions League despite a creditable 1-1 draw at German side Wolfsburg in the last-32 second leg.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England forward Eniola Aluko capitalised on a defensive error to slot in shortly before half-time.
Chelsea almost had a second but Karen Carney's crisp strike hit the woodwork.
Sara Bjork Gunnarsdottir's sweet finish ensured Wolfsburg progressed, as they beat Chelsea 4-1 on aggregate for the second consecutive season.
Chelsea were much improved from the side lost 3-0 at Stamford Bridge last Wednesday.
Aluko's low finish gave Emma Hayes' side hope of what had seemed an unlikely comeback, as she raced onto a short backpass from Isabel Kerchowski for a deserved lead.
Wolfsburg - last season's finalists and two-time champions - saw more of the ball after half-time.
But England winger Carney almost set up a nervy finish when her superb effort from outside the area struck the angle of the upright, before the hosts sealed it through Gunnarsdottir with 10 minutes to play.
