Six Nations 2016: Scotland to assess Gray and Russell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland will assess injuries to Jonny Gray and Finn Russell before deciding if the pair are fit for Saturday's final Six Nations match versus Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gray is to have a scan on Monday after suffering a pectoral strain in the 29-18 victory over France on Sunday.
Russell was substituted just five minutes into the match after suffering a concussion while making a tackle in the build-up to France's opening try.
The fly-half will now undergo the graduated return-to-play protocol.
Gray completed the full 80 minutes as Vern Cotter's side ended a 10-year winless run against France.
Scotland go to Dublin looking to seal a third consecutive championship victory for the first time in 20 years.
