The "Leikkurile LeMans" was run outside the town of Lavia 250 kilometres from Finland's capital city Helsinki.
Drivers had to complete as many laps as possible of the 700m circuit within the time.
Lawnmower racing teams arrived from Estonia, Luxembourg and England to join Finnish competitors.
And it was a good day for the English participants - the winners of the event were Team Luxemburg with 2 drivers from England.
They completed 843 laps!
