The 15th anniversary of the annual sound and light display at Faskally Wood has been marked with a show called "Shimmer".
The Enchanted Forest, held in Perthshire each autumn, is thought to be worth about Â£2m to the local economy.
Organisers have released more than 65,000 tickets, and extended the performances to more than a month, in order to meet demand from the public.
