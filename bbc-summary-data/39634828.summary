She was wearing light jeans, a dark jacket and leather knee-high boots at the time.
Dyfed-Powys Police said it was "very concerned" about her and have launched an urgent appeal to try and find her.
"We have a number of leads across Pembrokeshire at this time, but really need the public's help in providing us with more specific information," said detectives on Tuesday evening.
"We are very concerned about her and need any information you think is relevant."
Police have not released more details about the missing woman, including her surname.
