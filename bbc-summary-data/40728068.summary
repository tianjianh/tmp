[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vicar of St Thomas's Church of England Church in Hitchin Road, Stopsley, Luton, arrived to find the paint still wet on Sunday morning.
Slogans including "Hell awaits you. Repent" and "Beware the beast" were painted across the exterior walls.
"Hate crime will not be tolerated," Bedfordshire police said.
The graffiti, in large white letters, appeared sometime between midnight and 08:00 BST on 23 July, officers said.
The vandal also made references to transhumanism - a movement that believes in using technology to improve intellectual, physical and psychological capacities - and wrote: "Anti-Christ" and "Hell awaits".
