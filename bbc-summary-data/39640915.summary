PSG trail Monaco on goal difference at the top of the French league, but Leonardo Jardim's side, who host Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday, have a game in hand.
Kylian Mbappe, Monaco's in-form 19-year-old striker, was not named in the squad against PSG, perhaps with that semi-final first leg in mind.
Colombia forward Radamel Falcao was also rested, while attacking midfielder Bernardo Silva was on the bench.
