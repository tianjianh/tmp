The male teacher, 50, was attacked at Dixons Kings Academy at 08:55 BST, police said.
He has been taken to hospital where his condition has been described as stable.
West Yorkshire Police are searching for a boy, 14, in connection with the attack.  He is described as Asian, with short dark hair and was last seen wearing a blue uniform blazer.
Det Supt Simon Atkinson said: "We are conducting enquiries in the area to locate a suspect and I would like to reassure residents and staff that all necessary resources are being deployed to investigate this ongoing and clearly very serious incident."
He added there was no ongoing risk to pupils or staff at the school.
Operating since September 2011, the academy was one of the first free schools to open.  It has since become part of the Dixons academy group.
