[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother who wrote an open letter to burglars who ransacked her home has been inundated with so many Christmas presents and donations she has given them to a children's hospital.

The raiders took her son's presents, but Alex Mahjouri thanked them for making her see the "real importance" of Christmas.
Four-year-old River kept one donated present.
The pair delivered the rest to Derby Children's Hospital on Christmas Eve.
"To be able to do something and see other children happy and know that you're doing good with something is brilliant," said Mrs Mahjouri, who is pregnant with her second child.
To whoever burgled our house, thank you for making me see the real importance of Christmas - spending time with loved ones - and the imagination Christmas brings to children.
The family also passed on more than Â£2,000 that has been donated to them by people who heard about their home in Castle Donington, Leicestershire, being burgled.
In the open letter, posted on Facebook on 9 December, Mrs Mahjouri had written: "Thank you for making me realise all the materialistic items you took aren't worth my tears as we as a family are safe and unharmed and that's the most important thing."
The burglars stole a money box belonging to River, in which he had been saving money to donate to charity.
They also took jewellery that had belonged to Mrs Mahjouri's father and some presents he bought for her before his death six years ago.
Leicestershire Police said the investigation into the burglary was ongoing and nobody has been arrested.
Many children in the hospital have been discharged home for Christmas, so the presents will be given out as they come in over the festive period.
Lead nurse Jo Watson said: "We're quite astounded at how generous Alex and the family have been in the context of the situation that happened earlier in December."
