Cameron offshore fund row: PM accused of 'hypocrisy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour has accused David Cameron of "hypocrisy" after he revealed he had owned shares in an offshore fund set up by his late father.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Thursday, the PM said he sold the shares before he entered Number 10 in 2010 and had paid all UK taxes due on profits from the £30,000 sale.
He said the firm, Blairmore Holdings, had not been set up to avoid tax.
Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the PM had called people who invested in similar schemes "morally wrong".
Business Minister Nick Boles said "with the benefit of hindsight" it might have been better if the PM had revealed details of his shareholdings when the allegations first surfaced on Monday but he understood Mr Cameron's "natural human instinct to rally round his father".
The key point, he insisted, was that the prime minister had paid all the taxes expected of him.
There have been days of headlines about Blairmore Holdings - a fund for investors which until 2006 used "bearer shares" to protect its clients' privacy - following the leak of 11 million documents held by Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.
They show that Mr Cameron's father, Ian, was one of five UK directors who flew to board meetings in the Bahamas or Switzerland.
Downing Street and Mr Cameron had issued four statements on whether Mr Cameron had any financial involvement with Blairmore Holdings before the PM told ITV News on Thursday about the shares he had owned.
Mr Watson said Mr Cameron could not be blamed for his father's actions but added: "He can for hypocrisy. He said that sunlight is the best disinfectant and wasn't entirely straight with the British people about what his own financial arrangements were.
"That wouldn't be so bad if he hadn't also been lecturing very prominent people about their own tax arrangements, some he called morally wrong for being invested in similar schemes.
"People don't like that and they want a lot more answers from David Cameron before this scandal goes away."
Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Owen Smith said there were now "doubts about the prime minister's trustworthiness", accusing him of "speaking out of both sides of his mouth" in recent days and calling on him to publish details of all his past investments.
And SNP economy spokesman Stewart Hosie MP described it as "an astounding revelation by a prime minister who has questioned the morality of using such tax-avoiding schemes".
But James Quarmby, a specialist in tax planning and wealth structuring at law firm Stephenson Harwood, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a "massive misunderstanding" about what Mr Cameron had invested in.
He said it was a hedge fund that was "about as boring as it gets for investments", adding that it would not be used for avoiding tax.
"It's no different from Mr Cameron investing in a UK stock," he said.
And Mr Boles told BBC Breakfast that tax evasion was a "terrible thing" but no-one was suggesting the prime minister had not made all of the payments "he was required to make under UK law or that he has in any way used any of this to try to avoid tax".
"People have to pay tax," he said. "They have to pay tax on all income, from their work or from investments and I don't care where that investment is... that is what matters, that people pay the tax that is due. The prime minister has done so."
Analysis by deputy political editor James Landale
When a politician is under pressure, facing questions about their family and their finances, their natural instinct is to protect their privacy and say as little as possible. But when that pressure gets too great, there comes a moment when they have to go public and for David Cameron that moment came this evening/ last night.
In the long run, the prime minister will hope to achieve his aim of drawing a line under this story. Journalists and opposition MPs will naturally keep asking questions.
But there are unlikely to be more significant revelations than the fact that Mr Cameron did indeed benefit from an offshore trust, something that is legal but over which people have differing views. The problem for the prime minister is that the political imagery is not good. He is engaged in the political fight of his life, trying to convince the British people to vote to stay in the European Union.
And anything like this that distances Mr Cameron from the electorate, that reminds people of his wealthy and privileged background, well let's just say the timing is not great
Asked why it had taken four days for the prime minister to disclose the information, Mr Boles told Radio 4's Today he understood why Mr Cameron had not wanted to "intrude on his father's memory" at the start of the week and "feed" speculation about his business activities.
"I am sure with the benefit of hindsight he would rather all of what has come out over the last four days had come out on the first day.
"The instinct is one that we can all identify with even if it is something he might have done differently if given a second chance."
In his interview on Thursday, Mr Cameron told ITV News: "I don't have anything to hide. I'm proud of my dad and what he did and the business he established... I can't bear to see his name being dragged through the mud."
Mr Cameron said much criticism was based on a "fundamental misconception" that Blairmore was set up to avoid tax.
"It wasn't. It was set up after exchange controls went, so that people who wanted to invest in dollar denominated shares and companies could do so, and there are many other, thousands of other unit trusts set up in this way," he said.
Downing Street said Mr and Mrs Cameron bought their holding in April 1997 for £12,497 and sold it in January 2010 for £31,500.
That year the personal allowance before capital gains tax was paid was £10,100 per person.
A leak of 11.5 million documents has lifted the lid on how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth.
The files were leaked from one of the world's most secretive companies, a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca.
Among the files are details about:
The scandal also touches football's world governing body, Fifa.
Mossack Fonseca says it has operated beyond reproach for 40 years and never been accused or charged with criminal wrong-doing.
