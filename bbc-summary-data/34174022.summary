[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carolyn Keeling, now 64, is accused of indecently assaulting the boy, who is now 34 and cannot be named for legal reasons, between 1993 and 1996.
At the start of a trial, at Gloucester Crown Court was told the boy reported the abuse to police last year after reading of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
Ms Keeling, of Taynton near Gloucester, denies six counts of indecent assault.
Prosecuting, Ed Burgess said the boy described his tutor as "being hippy-like in her mannerisms" and he "thought she was rather cool".
"He talks about his hormones raging and he wasn't going to turn down what she was offering.
"At the time he didn't see it as abuse, he rather enjoyed it.
"It was only later that he came to understand it as the sexual abuse that it was," he said.
The jury was told the defendant was given a key to the boy's family home and let herself in to give him lessons.
It is alleged she would get into bed with him and also take him on nature walks and horse rides.
Ms Keeling told police the boy slept naked and she would sometimes go into his bedroom to wake him up.
When the allegations were revealed, she described herself as "gobsmacked", Mr Burgess said.
The alleged abuse stopped when the boy reached the age of 15.
The boy, who is now a father of three, told his mother about the sexual relationship in 2012, and reported it to police in April 2014.
The trial continues.
