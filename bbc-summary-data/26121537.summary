Free Church of Scotland settles with crash boy's parents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Legal action taken against the Free Church of Scotland by the parents of a Peruvian boy who died on a trip to Scotland has been settled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gianmarco Peschiera, 14, and Carlos Gonzales, 15, died when the car they were in crashed into a parked lorry on the A9 at Inverness in July 2006.
The church was involved in arranging the trip and the car's driver, Donald MacLeod, 82, was a church member.
Gianmarco's parents wanted to sue the church on the grounds of negligence.
Mr MacLeod had been driving the boys to North Kessock where they were to meet up with the rest of their group for a day trip to Stornoway.
The former rector at Fortrose Academy, in the Black Isle, suffered a fatal heart attack while behind the wheel of his Honda CRV 4x4, which then crashed into a Tesco lorry.
Gianmarco's parents took legal action against the church, the Colegio San Andres school in Lima and the school's former headmaster in 2010.
In a statement, the Free Church of Scotland said: "We can confirm that the legal case in Peru was resolved several months ago.
"This was a tragic accident for all concerned and in particular for the families in both Peru and Scotland who lost loved ones.
"We are pleased that this long running legal process is now at an end."
