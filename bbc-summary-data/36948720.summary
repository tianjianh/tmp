[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a first half of few chances, Wednesday improved after the break and Lucas Joao slotted in their opener.
The Owls looked in control, but Piero Mingoia's brilliant long-range shot put the fourth-tier U's level.
George Maris fired wide for the hosts, before Berry's late left-footed effort earned them a spot in the second round.
Cambridge manager Shaun Derry: "These are special nights. I've been on the receiving end of them so I know what it's like when you lose against lower-level opposition.
"I've never been in the dressing room on the better side and I'm really proud of them. It's another night where Cambridge United are in the press for absolutely the right reasons once again."
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal: "We did well. Not fantastically well but we managed the game, we had the game under control. We had chances and Cambridge also had some chances.
"They scored a fantastic goal, 1-1. After this the game is a lottery. They scored the goal. We must give congratulations to Cambridge."
