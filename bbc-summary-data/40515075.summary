[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The United States has called for the re-establishment of a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland.

Talks aimed at restoring the Stormont executive ended in failure on Monday.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the US urged the DUP and Sinn Féin to form an "effective government" as soon as possible.
It said the US would continue to work with the parties and the British and Irish governments to facilitate the restoration of power sharing.
Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government since January, when the coalition led by the two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, collapsed over a green energy scandal.
US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said: "The United States regrets that the political parties in Northern Ireland have not yet reached an agreement to establish a power-sharing regional government following elections in March.
"We urge the region's two largest parties, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin, to continue their discussions with the aim of forming an effective, responsive, and representative government as soon as possible.
"All of Northern Ireland's political leaders share a collective responsibility to build on the political and economic progress made since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and to construct a better, shared future for all of Northern Ireland's citizens," she added.
