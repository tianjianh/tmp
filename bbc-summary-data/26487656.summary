The woman, whose scarf was wrenched off by the train, suffered back and head injuries in the incident at Holborn Underground station in central London.
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said the driver was unaware the woman was stuck.
The incident happened on 3 February at about 19:00.
Arriving at Holborn, the woman had moved towards a Piccadilly Line train but stopped when she realised the doors were closing.
An RAIB statement said: "The passenger was dragged along the platform by her scarf as the train started to move.
"The station assistant tried to help the passenger by holding on to her and they both fell to the ground.
"This resulted in the scarf being forcibly removed from the passenger's neck and carried into the tunnel by the train."
The investigation will seek to understand the sequence of events and examine if any further arrangements can be put in place to ensure trains leave platforms safely.
