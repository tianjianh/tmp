Football legend Denis Law has opened Scotland's first Cruyff Court in Aberdeen.

The community sports facility in the city centre offers free sessions, including football, hockey and tennis, and is accessible 24 hours a day.
There are almost 200 courts around the world, named after Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff, who died last year.

Law starred for Manchester United and Scotland and was named European footballer of the year in 1964.
