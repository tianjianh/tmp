[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has died in a crash after it is believed he swerved to avoid a mattress in the middle of the carriageway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 69-year-old Chatham man died on the A229 Blue Bell Hill, near Chatham, at about 16:30 GMT on Monday.
His silver Peugeot 206 left the Maidstone-bound carriageway and hit trees before rebounding on to the road.
The mattress had fallen from the roof of a red Peugeot 2008, Kent Police said.
The road was closed until 23.20 GMT to enable officers to carry out initial enquiries and to make the carriageway safe.
