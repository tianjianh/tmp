So where is my selfie stick banned?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From sports stadiums to gig venues, it feels like selfie sticks are being banned all over the place right now.

This may be great news if you're not a fan of the device - which fixes onto a camera or phone to allow users a better photo - because they get in the way of the action.
But if you got one for Christmas, you'd better read this Newsbeat guide to the places where your stick is no longer welcome.
On Sunday night, hip-hop legends Run-DMC performed at London's Scala club.
It's been 12 years since the rap group performed in the UK so you can imagine the excitement to make sure that they got a good selfie with Darryl McDaniels and Joseph Simmons in full flow behind them.
So it's lucky Scala says it has no policy (yet) on the selfie stick.
But many music venues do - and have already outlawed them, such as London's O2 Arena.
"The O2 do not allow selfie sticks into the arena due to safety considerations and so as not to impact the view of other fans. We welcome selfies, but leave the stick at home please," the venue states.
And Academy Music Group, which owns the smaller O2 venues like O2 ABC Glasgow and O2 Academy Bristol, told Newsbeat: "Selfie sticks are not permitted at Academy Music Group venues.
"This is in keeping with our existing policy that prohibits the filming and photography during a performance with iPads and other tablet devices and includes any such obstructions for the satisfaction of other customers."
If you're on a ride and want to capture that look of sheer terror on your mates' faces as you zoom around, we hate to break it to you that selfie sticks are not allowed at most UK theme parks.
A spokesman at Chessington World of Adventures said: "Filming or photography of any kind on any ride or attraction here at Chessington World of Adventures resort is not permitted so selfie sticks would be included in this but they haven't been [specifically] banned at the resort."
The same applies at Alton Towers in Staffordshire.
As for nearby Drayton Manor Theme Park, the people there say while they "always encourage people to capture memories at Drayton Manor" when it comes to the selfie stick each ride has a "safety clearance envelope" which is "measured around the seat to create a safe zone".
What that means is, if you put your arm out of the ride it shouldn't hit anything "therefore due to the nature of a selfie stick this would not comply".
Football grounds were the first to stamp their foot down when it comes to fans capturing the moment in as wide a scope as possible.
Several Premier League clubs have also banned the use of selfie sticks.
Manchester United and Arsenal have confirmed the devices are not allowed at matches. In fact they class them alongside knives and fireworks.
Newsbeat spoke to the Tate group and the British Museum which have a similar stance on the selfie stick. They love a selfie in a museum.
But not during paid-for exhibitions.
