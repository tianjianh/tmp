A closure order was approved on Tuesday following a Thames Valley Police operation in Radstock Road.
One man found at the premises was suspected of paying for sexual services, while two women were placed in the care of a support agency for victims of exploitation.
It followed the closure of a suspected brothel in Bedford Road on Friday.
Closure orders granted on both properties prevent anyone from entering them for three months.
Insp Keith Stacey said three brothels have been closed in the area during the past two months.
He added: "We have become more aware of off-street prostitution in the form of brothels in the town and, in this instance, the enterprise was being carried out in an area populated by lots of families and near two schools.
"We have also been made aware that innocent families have had men at their door wrongly thinking that they were at the brothel."
Anthony Brain, head of community safety at Reading Borough Council, said tackling exploitation "in all its forms" was a priority.
