A County Donegal man has found a live World War Two hand grenade while digging in his garden.

The device was discovered by Bernard Houston at his home in Glencar Park, Letterkenny on Saturday.
CJ McGinley, from the Donegal News, spoke to Mr Houston after the operation.
"He said he went into the house and told his wife he had to stop gardening because he found a bomb. She told him to get back out and finish it."
Nearby homes were evacuated during a seven-hour operation.
The device, which still had its pin attached, was taken to Finner Army camp in Ballyshannon for examination but it is not believed to be sinister.
Mr McGinley said: "Bernard was doing a little bit of digging in his garden and he told me that he was clearing some bushes.
"His spade struck what he thought was a stone, but on closer inspection discovered it was a hand grenade. Obviously he was very concerned.
"His nine-year-old son was with at the time and he shouted for him to run away.
"It's crazy stuff. From talking to some Garda√≠ (Irish police) it may well be that the topsoil in the garden was transported from another area when the houses were built."
Mr McGinley said he was told by army experts that it was a 'pineapple' type of hand grenade that may date back to World War Two.
