Slovakia are analysing Wales as a team and not just the threat of Gareth Bale according to defender Martin Skrtel.

Liverpool defender, Skrtel, 31, will captain Slovakia, as they prepare for their first European Championships.
"Of course Bale is world class, but it is not only him, the Wales team is not only Bale," Skrtel said.
"There are more players, a lot of individuals, so we will have to watch them all and analyse their game. I believe that we will be ready."
Wales begin their Euro 2016 campaign against Slovakia in Saturday's Group B fixture in Bordeaux but Skrtel is already familiar with some of Chris Coleman's side.
"Everybody knows Bale, I have my Liverpool teammate, Joe Allen, [Aaron] Ramsey from Arsenal, so I think that they are all really good players," he added.
"They play in the Premier League which is a sign that they are really good, and they have already proved that by qualifying."
The encounter in south west France will be the first time either side will have played in a major European Championships, while Wales will play in a first international tournament for 58 years.
The ex-Zenit defender is confident his side can record a vital victory over Wales ahead of clashes with Russia and England.
"The first match is important and it can tell you a lot, so I believe that we will do well in the first match and make a better start to the tournament than Wales."
