The visitors scored six tries, including a brace each for wing Akari Kato and fellow back Iroha Nagata.
Wing Jess Kavanagh-Williams' try was Wales' only score in a first half that saw coach Rowland Phillips' side trail 23-5 at the break.
Kelsey Jones did add a late consolation for the home side, touching down from the back of a driving line-out.
Phillips had brought into his squad eight players who have progressed through the Under-18 system.
"We certainly don't plan to lose games of rugby but we know where we are with this group at this point," Phillips said.
"The score didn't really have any bearing on what we wanted to get out of the day.
"You look at [prop] Lleucu George today, that's her first game, she's only 17 and she was outstanding.
"That's a massive tick in the box for us building for the future."
Wales are preparing for the Women's Rugby World Cup in Ireland in two months' time, where they will start against New Zealand in Dublin on 9 August, followed by games against Canada and Hong Kong.
Before that Wales have two more preparation matches against Spain and England in July.
Wales: Jodie Evans; Angharad de Smet, Elen Evans, Rebecca Defilipo, Jessica Kavanagh-Williams; Kayleigh Powell, Sian Moore; Siwan Lilicrap, Nia Elen Davies, Lleucu George, Gwen Crabb, Rebecca Rowe, Megan York, Morfudd Ifans, Gwenllian Pyrs.
Replacements: Kelsey Jones, Catrin Edwards, Brea Leung, Amy Thomas, Mel Clay, Alisha Butchers, Bethan Lewis, Ffion Lewis, India Berbillion, Carly Jones.
