[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blackpool took a 13th-minute lead when Armand Gnanduillet latched onto Kyle Vassell's precise pass and brushed off Tom Eastman in the area before firing home.
But Colchester equalised nine minutes before the break through Sammie Szmodics, who showed great composure before finding the net from close range from Richard Brindley's pass.
Colchester winger Drey Wright went close early in the second half and Blackpool keeper Sam Slocombe thwarted Kurtis Guthrie's far-post header.
But the hosts went ahead 11 minutes after the break when Porter flicked home from two yards after substitute Tarique Fosu had helped on Brennan Dickenson's corner at the near post.
Potts was denied by Colchester keeper Sam Walker while Slocombe foiled Fosu, before Porter made it 3-1 with eight minutes remaining when he collected Fosu's pass and showed fine footwork before slotting home.
Blackpool midfielder Brad Potts netted with a low free-kick from nearly 25 yards with a minute remaining, but Colchester held on.
