The Historical Abuse Inquiry is examining claims of abuse at 13 homes and training centres in Northern Ireland from 1922 to 1995.
The nun, whose identity cannot be revealed, worked at the former St Joseph's home in Termonbacca, Derry.
She said she and another nun were responsible for looking after 60 boys.
"In the first five years, I don't remember any holidays" she said.
She was asked by inquiry chairman, Sir Anthony Hart: "Was it 24/7, 365 days a year?"
"It was, mostly," she replied.
The HIA is examining abuse claims in Northern Ireland's children's homes and juvenile justice institutions.
It is investigating claims of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as childhood neglect.
It began hearing evidence in January.
The public hearings stage of the inquiry is being held in Banbridge, County Down, and is expected to last for 18 months.
During that time, it is due to hear evidence from more than 300 witnesses, including former residents who claim they were abused as children, the people who ran the institutions, health and social care officials and government representatives.
