A court in India has turned down a bail application for a Derby woman accused of plotting to kill her husband.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ramandeep Kaur Mann, 31, denies involvement in the killing of Sukhjit Singh, 34, who was found with his throat slit on 2 September in Banda, Uttar Pradesh.
Ms Kaur Mann is accused alongside her alleged lover, Mr Singh's childhood friend Gurpreet Singh.
Lawyers applied for her to be released while the investigation takes place.

The judge did not specify a reason for turning down the application, her lawyer Benant Noor Singh said.
He said: "You can very well imagine the state of Indian prisons, they are already overcrowded.
"Obviously going into confinement does traumatise a person. She has been placed amongst 56 other females."
Sukhjit Singh, from Littleover, in Derby, was visiting his mother in Banda, about 450km (280 miles) south east of New Delhi with his wife, when he was killed.
Ms Kaur Mann's family have claimed she is being used as a scapegoat and the couple were happily married for 11 years.
Officials from the British High Commission have visited Ms Kaur Mann in prison to check on her welfare.
Neither of the suspects have been formally charged, but both are in custody while police decide whether to bring charges.
