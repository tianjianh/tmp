[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An MP has written to Prime Minister David Cameron in her bid to establish how a suicide verdict was ruled after a British woman died in Italy in 2012 from stab wounds to the neck.

The Italian authorities concluded Claire Martin killed herself after suffering from post-natal depression.
Her parents, from Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, believe she was murdered because "things don't add up".
Ashfield MP Gloria De Piero said there are "anomalies to explore".
Ms Martin, 30, lived with son and her in-laws in Grottaminarda, near Naples, while her partner worked in Germany.
In March 2012, Ms Martin suffered multiple stab wounds to her neck, struggled upstairs and died.
A murder investigation was launched, but 15 months later the Italian authority closed the case after it ruled she had committed suicide.
Following a recent Guardian newspaper article on her death, her father Ray Martin said: "Things don't add up.
"It's impossible to stab yourself multiple times in the neck and climb up stairs after wiping the blood clean off the knife."
Her mother Pat Martin said: "It's a continuing nightmare, nobody gives a damn."
Ms De Piero said forensic reports have been translated into English, but there are witness statements and other evidence only available in Italian.
The MP has asked for a meeting in October with the Italian government to "get the answers the Martin's need".
Mr Martin said: "We hope to meet with the magistrate, but I honestly don't know why they won't speak with us."
The Foreign Office said it would not comment on individual cases, but has provided consular assistance to the family.
It added: "We will continue to assist in any way we can, although we cannot interfere in the legal system of another country."
