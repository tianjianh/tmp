[SN]TITLE[SN]
Huddersfield Town 1-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rajiv van La Parra scored the only goal for Huddersfield as they beat his former club Wolves to go two points clear at the top of the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dutchman found the net early on, his first ever goal for Town, when he fired in the rebound after Nakhi Wells' shot struck the post.
Wolves' half-time substitute Joao Teixeira hit an upright from 20 yards.
The visitors went close again when Jon Dadi Bodvarsson had a header saved by Danny Ward from point-blank range.
Van La Parra, who had a loan spell with Huddersfield last season, left Wolves to join the Terriers on a permanent deal in the summer.
His goal came after just six minutes as he followed up Wells' shot to fire into the bottom-left corner in front of his former supporters.
Wolves were much brighter after the restart, with former Town midfielder Conor Coady having a shot deflected for a corner and Matt Doherty's attempt well saved by Ward.
The Terriers keeper, who is on loan from Liverpool, then did brilliantly to deny Bodvarsson as the hosts held on to claim their fourth win and extend their unbeaten start to the Championship season to five games.
REACTION: Huddersfield manager David Wagner speaks to BBC Radio Leeds
Huddersfield manager David Wagner:
"This has been a very good start to the season but everybody knows how much hard work it was and we will not stop what we did in the past.
"Hard work got us where we are and this will help us to be successful. We only look forward now.
"I am very happy for him (Rajiv van La Parra). He chose the best moment to score his first goal. Everybody knows how difficult it was to get him here on loan last season and he was desperate to come here."
Wolves head coach Walter Zenga:
"In my opinion we could have won the game easily. The goal was one mistake and there was one unbelievable save from Jon Dadi Bodvarsson's header.
"Particularly in the second half we had some big chances. The game is 95 minutes and we have to play the whole game.
"I am 100% happy with where we are but, yes, we could have had more points and probably deserved more points.
"The Championship is a difficult league but not an impossible league and this is a long season with many games left to play."
