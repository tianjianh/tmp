The 26-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, has been among Newport's best players amid their fight for Football League survival.
County are two points clear of the League Two relegation with two games remaining.
"The main thing everyone's focusing on is making sure Newport County are in the league next year," Day said.
He continued: "Once we've secured our status I think maybe talks about next season can start."
The Exiles' 1-0 win over Accrington Stanley lifted County out of the relegation zone for the first time since November 2016.
Mike Flynn's side and can clinch survival on Saturday if they win at Carlisle United and rivals Hartlepool United lose.
