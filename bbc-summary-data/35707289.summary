Neil Hatley: Bath coach wants to keep Leroy Houston despite Australia interest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bath coach Neil Hatley wants to keep number eight Leroy Houston despite reports Australia coach Michael Cheika wants him to play in Super Rugby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hosuton has made 56 Premiership appearances for Bath since joining from French side Colomiers in February 2013.
The 29-year-old former Warratahs and Queensland Reds player has never been capped by Australia.
"You can see exactly why somebody like Michael Cheika would be interested in trying to get him back," Hatley said.
"But Leroy's contracted for this year and he's got another year to go.
"He's been an unbelievable addition to our squad and to the club and, like I said, he's got this year and another year to run and we'd like him to stay beyond that."
