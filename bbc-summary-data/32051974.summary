[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kesgrave Hall and Beam College pupil abuse suspect charged

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been charged with 16 sexual assaults against three children at schools in Suffolk and Devon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John McKno is accused of abusing two boys at the former Kesgrave Hall boarding school in Suffolk in the late 1980s.
Mr McKno, of Alby Hill, Alby, Norfolk is also charged with assaulting a boy at the former Beam College in Great Torrington, in the 1970s.
The 69-year-old is due before Ipswich Magistrates' Court on 14 April.
The alleged offences relate to boys under the ages of 14 and 16.
It is understood Mr McKno, who was first arrested last May, worked at Kesgrave Hall but was not a teacher.
Two other men who were questioned and bailed as part of Operation Garford have since died.
One died of natural causes while the other, a 62-year-old man from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was found dead on a railway line near his home town days after his arrest in April last year.
The latter had also been questioned by National Crime Agency detectives on suspicion of indecently assaulting a boy aged 13 or 14 in the north Wales care system.
