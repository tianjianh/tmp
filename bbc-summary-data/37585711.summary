[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lawyers representing the first husband and father of alleged "honour killing" victim Samia Shahid say they will seek to have the case thrown out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel is accused of murdering the beautician, while her father Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid is being held as an accessory to murder.
The men's lawyers, however, say they will apply to have the case dismissed due to a "complete lack of evidence".
Ms Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died in July in Pakistan.

Following a court hearing in Jhelum, in the state of Punjab, both men were remanded into custody ahead of their next appearance on 20 October.
The judge ordered that Ms Shahid's second husband Syed Mukhtar Kazim should also appear on that date.
Mr Kazim, who married Ms Shahid in Leeds in 2014 before the couple moved to Dubai in 2015, claims his wife was murdered because her family disapproved of their marriage.
It is thought Ms Shahid had travelled to Pakistan to visit family in the village of Pandori after being told her father was ill.
Her relatives in Pakistan initially said she had suffered a heart attack but a post-mortem examination confirmed she died as a result of being strangled.
