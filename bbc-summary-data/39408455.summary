[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Louis Dennis and Tobi Sho-Silva were both on target as Bromley secured a 2-0 victory over York at Bootham Crescent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors got off to the perfect start with a goal after just two minutes through Dennis, who ran on to a through-ball before slotting past Scott Loach.
Amari Morgan-Smith saw an effort bundled wide as York went in search of an equaliser, but Loach was called on in the 25th minute to save Blair Turgott's 25-yard free-kick.
Alex Whittle forced a good low save from Ross Flitney early in the second half, but Bromley doubled their lead in the 57th minute when Sho-Silva headed home a free-kick and they held on to clinch all three points.
