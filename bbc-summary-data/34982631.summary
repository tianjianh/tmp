Translink says cut cable led to signalling problems on railway line

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Translink has said signalling problems on the railway line between Lisburn and Portadown happened after it cut a communications cable.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bus substitutions were in place for much of Wednesday following a "major signalling failure", but normal service has now resumed.
Ciaran Doherty of Translink said: "We were doing some scheduled maintenance works on the line into the night.
"Unfortunately we managed to cut one of the communications cables on the line."
The transport company apologised for any inconvenience.
