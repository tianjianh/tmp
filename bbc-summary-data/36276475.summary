Cardiff City: James Rowberry being considered as Russell Slade replacement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City have held talks with 31-year-old first team coach James Rowberry about the possibility of becoming Russell Slade's successor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rowberry joined the club's academy in 2013, having previously spent four years working alongside the first team and development side at Newport County.
Slade was removed as manager at the end of the season with the club now looking to appoint a head coach.
Rowberry is one candidate under consideration by the Bluebirds.
He is a UEFA pro-licence coach who also spent seven years working with the Football Association of Wales as a coach educator.
Slade was in charge for the final time when Cardiff drew 1-1 with Birmingham on the final day of the Championship season, a result which saw the Bluebirds finish eighth in the table.
Cardiff had targeted a place in the play-offs, but fell short as they recorded one win in their final seven matches.
Slade has now taken up a new role as head of football at Cardiff and will oversee scouting among other duties.
