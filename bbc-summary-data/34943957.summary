A former soldier who was arrested after returning to the UK from Syria - where he said he had fought against the so-called Islamic State - has been bailed.

Joe Robinson, 22, from Accrington, Lancashire, posted on Facebook that he had spent months with Kurdish rebels.
A warrant was issued for his arrest in July in connection with an alleged breach of an unrelated court order.
He was held under Section Five of the Terrorism Act at Manchester Airport on Thursday.
Greater Manchester Police said he had been bailed, pending further inquiries, until 22 March.
