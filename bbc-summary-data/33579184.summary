[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of the M6 in Staffordshire which was closed when heat from a burning lorry melted the road surface, has reopened, police said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The southbound section between junction 13 (Stafford south) and junction 12 (Cannock) was closed following the accident about 01:30 BST.
Traffic officers tweeted a picture of the HGV surrounded by flames which had spread across the carriageway.
Five miles of queues were reported and some people were stuck for six hours.
Long delays were also expected on all surrounding routes, police said earlier.
Earlier Highways England said the "intensity of the fire has caused extensive damage to the carriageway and resurfacing is required".
