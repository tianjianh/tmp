The trekkers from the Holt School in Wokingham were on a three-week expedition in Ladakh, northern India, organised by Adventure Lifesigns.
They were trapped after five days of rain and rescued by Indian Air Force helicopters on Friday.
Philip Collins, whose child is on the trip, said they "never felt at risk".
He said he had been told his daughter Emily and her fellow trekkers would fly back on Tuesday - two days before she is due to collect her A level results.
"There was no real concern, they were in a safe place and had plenty of supplies.
"We were able to speak to her, they were all fine.
"I think it's been an adventure, they never felt at risk."
A spokesman for Adventure Lifesigns said the group was made up of 20 pupils, three staff and five local guides.
Suzanne Richards, headteacher at the Holt School, said the company running the expedition had been "excellent".
The Indian Ministry of Defence said: "All major rivers in Ladakh region were flowing beyond their danger mark.
"The road and telephone communication was cut-off along most major roads.
"Thankfully, the trekkers had made a temporary 'SOS' sign, this distress signal on ground was instrumental in correctly identifying the location."
The UK Foreign Office said it was providing consular assistance and was in contact with local authorities.
