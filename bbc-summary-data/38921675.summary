City of Edinburgh Council will also spend £7.8m to address the costs from rising school rolls and an extra £2.5m to spend on roads and pavements.
Councillors also agreed an updated 2016-20 Business Plan for the council.
This year City of Edinburgh Council has a budget of £968m while making savings of £38m.
During 2017/18 the council will deliver several key projects, including beginning construction on an additional school in South Edinburgh and a new Meadowbank sports centre.
Alasdair Rankin, the City of Edinburgh Council's convener of finance and resources committee, said: "In 2016 we approved a four-year budget framework which drew on feedback and ideas from the public, and this year's budget continues to reflect residents' priorities.
"Despite an uncertain financial climate we have set a balanced budget for Edinburgh, as well as securing funds for several major projects throughout the city."
