Electricity firm EDF temporarily closed down two of its nuclear power stations in Lancashire and Hartlepool in August.
The problem was detected at Heysham 1 during a routine boiler inspection. EDF shut all four reactors at the two stations as a "precautionary measure".
The plant is expected to be back up and running at full capacity next year.
