A teenage girl was seriously hurt when she was hit in the face with a firework on what Greater Manchester fire crews described as a night of "devastation".

At one stage on Bonfire Night, the fire service said half its resources "were deployed at once".
The girl, 14, needed hospital treatment for a left eye injury in Pitt Street, Oldham.
Other incidents saw youths throwing fireworks at firefighters in Salford, and cars set alight.
Elsewhere in the country, a senior police officer in Essex has said fireworks were fired at officers and at Basildon police station.
Greater Manchester Fire & Rescue Service said hundreds of "frightened and concerned" people reported a variety of incidents.
Between 20:00 and 21:00 GMT the service received more than one call per minute, with a total of 300 calls between 15:00 and 22:00 GMT - an increase of 20% on last year.
By midnight, another 50 calls had come in, and fire crews were still attending bonfire-related incidents until after 06:00 GMT.
A spokesman said: "In the most shocking incidents, firefighters came under fire themselves. In particular they withdrew from Orient Street in Salford when youths hurled fireworks at them as they tried to extinguish a fire in a suspected stolen car."
Councillor David Acton, chairman of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Authority, condemned those who caused disruption.
"It is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible should be ashamed," he said.
The injured girl's condition has not been confirmed.
In Essex, no damage or injuries were caused, Insp Rob Brettell said.
Essex Fire Service said it dealt with more than 70 incidents between 17:00 and 23:00 GMT on Saturday.
