The pair, believed to be a couple in their 60s, were hit in a lane behind Finsbury Terrace, Brynmill, at around 09:20 GMT on Sunday.
The woman was flown by air ambulance to hospital and was conscious in the afternoon, police said. A neighbour said they had been unloading shopping.
Officers are investigating.
A blue Peugeot was loaded into a container and removed from the scene - an area which is home to many students in Swansea - on Sunday afternoon.
"I came out my back garden and saw two people trapped under a car," the neighbour said.
"I immediately rang 999 and told the operator they would need to get all the emergency services here. It looked very serious.
"The couple had just come back from shopping when they were run over by their own car.
"It's awful, they were a lovely couple.
"I didn't know their names but they would always say hi and were very polite."
South Wales Police said initial reports were a vehicle had rolled down the street trapping a male and female underneath the vehicle.
Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service added it had released two casualties from underneath the vehicle.
