Liam Hill, 44, was seen at the Bar Bow pub in Rhyl on the night it was screening the Everton-Manchester City 2-1 game on Wednesday 6 January.
Officers are hoping Wednesday's League Cup semi-final return match could jog the memories of fans and drinkers.
North Wales Police have also released CCTV images of Mr Hill whose body was discovered two days later at his flat.
Area commander, Supt Mark Pierce said Mr Hill sustained significant head, upper and lower body injuries consistent with a sustained and deliberate attack.
"This is a murder enquiry and we need the local community and public to come forward and help identify who is responsible," he said.
"Whilst there may be some within the community who did not witness any act of violence we still need help to piece together Mr Hill's movements and whereabouts in the two days leading up to the discovery of his body on the Friday 8 January.
"Any piece of information, no matter how insignificant, you may think it is, may help."
Mr Hill was also seen on Thursday 7 January at Asher Indian Restaurant close to the town's police station.
The CCTV images show he was wearing black denim jeans and a dark blue Columbia embossed jacket.
People with any information are asked to call police on 101 or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111
