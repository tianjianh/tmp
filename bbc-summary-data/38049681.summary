Kurtis Guthrie: Colchester United 'on their way to relegation'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester United will be relegated from League Two if they do not improve after 10 winless league games, says their forward Kurtis Guthrie.

After Saturday's loss at Yeovil, the U's' slipped into the relegation zone.
"It's a shambles. It's nothing to do with the management. They do their best to prepare us," the 23-year-old said.
"We're looking like kids out there, we're getting battered, we're throwing games away, we can't see games out. It's not good enough."
He continued to BBC Essex: "If you're lying to yourself, then you're going to get worse. We'll get relegated if this carries on."
Guthrie's opening goal had given Colchester a second-half lead at Huish Park, before the Glovers struck twice late on to take all three points - leaving the Essex side without a league win since 10 September.
Guthrie moved to Colchester in the summer from Forest Green Rovers and said he "did not come for a relegation battle".
But, having been relegated from League One last season after three previous campaigns of bottom-half finishes, Guthrie says the side should take note of other clubs that have slipped down the divisions.
"If you look at the club over the last few years it's been the same. It's almost like a cancer and we need to cut it out. If you don't you keep falling away.
"You've seen what happens to teams like Stockport, they fall away and keep going and they're not coming back.
"We as the players have to take ownership, take the criticism and use that as motivation to go and do well and not shy away from the fact we are doing bad at the moment."
