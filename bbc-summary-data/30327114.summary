There have been protests across the US after a decision not to charge a white police officer over a "chokehold" that led to the death of an unarmed black man.

Eric Garner, 43, was arrested on a street in New York in July after he was thought to be selling illegal loose cigarettes.
In footage shot on a mobile phone he is heard saying "I can't breathe" as he was restrained by police.
He became unresponsive and later died.
Officer Daniel Pantaleo, 29, who has been on the force for eight years, appeared before a grand jury last month testifying that he did not intend to choke Mr Garner.
He described the manoeuvre as a takedown move and said that he never thought Mr Garner was in danger.
The footage shows Mr Pantaleo and other officers arresting him after an argument in which he refuses to be handcuffed.
Several officers move to restrain Mr Garner, who is asthmatic, with Mr Pantaleo holding him by the neck.
He can be heard shouting repeatedly, "I can't breathe."
Officials found Mr Garner's death was caused by "the compression of his chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police".
Asthma and heart disease also contributed to his death.
After the grand jury decision on Wednesday not to charge Officer Pantaleo over the death of Eric Garner, the US justice department is now launching a civil rights investigation.
It will review how to heal a "breakdown in trust" between police and communities.
The court decision came barely a week after a grand jury found no criminal actions of another white police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man in Ferguson, Missouri.
President Barack Obama said the Garner case spoke to "larger issues".
Activists have called for a march in Washington next week.
