Cameron Lewis, Corey Baldwin, Kieran Williams, Rhun Williams, Rhys Carre, James Botham and Morgan Morris all crossed for the visitors.
Meanwhilem, Wales' Ben Jones added 25 points with the boot.
Scotland replied through Tom Dodd, Fraser Renwick, Callum Hunter-Hill, Andrew Simmers and Robbie Nairn.
It was a non-stop spectacular affair on the artificial pitch in Cumbernauld, with almost every attack resulting in a score, and both sides collected bonus points with time to spare.
Wales got off to a flying start as centre Lewis powered over from close range within five minutes of his first start, before a leg injury cut his evening short.
Two minutes later, debutant wing Baldwin came in from the blindside following a line-out to carve down the middle unopposed.
A glorious Welsh counter-attack from inside their own half saw centre Kieran Williams scorching clear to score after 32 minutes, Jones converting all three and landing two penalties.
But Scotland finally roused themselves in the closing minutes of the half as number eight Dodd and hooker Renwick drove over for close-range scores, with Eastgate's conversion making it 27-12 at the break.
Wales regained the ascendancy as full-back Rhun Williams ran on to an awkwardly-bouncing kick to cross for the bonus-point try a minute after the interval, Jones converting and adding his third penalty.
Lock Hunter-Hill forced his way over for the home side, only for prop Carre to rumble over for a converted Wales score as the scoring feast continued.
Replacement Simmers got the fourth Scottish touch-down, diving over a ruck for Josh Henderson to convert, but Kieran Williams' second and yet another Jones conversion saw Wales past the half-century.
Back-rowers Botham and Morris added to the Welsh tally but replacement wing Nairn hit back both times with unconverted tries to leave the points total one short of the century.
Kieran Williams was named man-of-the-match.
