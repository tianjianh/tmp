A convicted Polish rapist who came to the UK, changed his name and raped two more women has been jailed for life.

Raphael Bargiel, 40, met the women, who lived in London and were also Polish, through internet dating sites where he posed as a wealthy 'sugar daddy.'
St Albans Crown Court heard Bargiel filmed their ordeals for his own perverted pleasure.
The minimum term he will serve before he can be considered for parole is eight years.
Prosecutor Simon Ash said: "The defendant told the women he was doing what he was doing to teach a lesson to women like them."
In the first attack he raped a 19-year-old woman in his car after driving her into a field near Hemel Hempstead late at night.
The woman said he filmed the incident. He was arrested following the attack and, after being charged, was given bail.
Five months later, while still on bail for the first attack, he raped another young woman in a hotel room after making contact with her through an internet dating site.
She told the court he took her to a room, ordered her to strip, tied her up and then took out a knife and forced her to have sex.
Bargiel was again held in custody and a jury later found him guilty of rape.
Sentencing him to life imprisonment, Judge Andrew Bright said: "You subjected them to the most degrading acts. At times they were in fear of losing their lives."
The court heard Bargiel had been convicted in Poland of raping a young woman he met through an internet dating site in 2011.
He had driven his victim to a secluded spot where he attacked her.
The following year he travelled to the UK where he got work as a lorry driver using the name Tomasz Puchalski.
