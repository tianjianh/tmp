The artist behind the controversial Glasgow Effect project, who sparked a row when she was awarded Â£15,000 from Creative Scotland, has spoken in public for the first time.

Ellie Harrison said she was shocked and overwhelmed by the response to her project which involves her deliberately staying within the confines of the city while monitoring its impact on her art.
Speaking to a sell-out audience in Glasgow, she said her project was more complex than media coverage had suggested.
The artist, who has been based in Glasgow since 2008, addressed the subject at an event organised by Imagination: Festival of Ideas: "I was inspired by the idea first raised by the Scottish sociologist Patrick Geddes who said: 'Think global, act local'.
"It would be part experiment, part protest and part strike and as part of that, I'd refuse to travel out of Glasgow for a year," she said.
She said the title the Glasgow Effect which refers to the city's lower life expectancy, was chosen as a contrast to the better known Glasgow Miracle, which refers to the city's successful contemporary artists.
"I don't think anyone is properly addressing the Glasgow Effect, and that's what I want to address. We spend a lot of money on consultants but no one can explain it," she said.
"At the same time, I wanted to draw attention to the elitism and apathy of the art world."
That certainly happened. At the start of January, a newspaper ran an article in which she was accused of taking a "poverty safari".
She was criticised on social media, and became the subject of a radio phone-in.
"The irony is that I normally keep quite a low profile. Why should I feel scared working in my own city? But it takes time to do good work and social media culture has lost all sense of patience. It undermines considered debate."
She said she had no regrets about the project's title or an illustration on her website of a greasy plate of chips.
"I am proud to call myself a Glaswegian artist. I've been here since 2008 and on my very first day I went to buy some chips. I'd lived in Nottingham before and I'd eaten chips but nothing like this. These were white with saturated fat. I found that shocking.
"I didn't set out to create deliberate controversy. I make events like this on Facebook all the time, and it's like tumbleweed rolling through. This one attracted a million people. No-one could have created it. It was the perfect storm."
Despite the furore, Ms Harrison said she would continue to work on her project, expecting it to take a year to complete, but could not confirm what form it would take.
She is also still in discussion with Creative Scotland and Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, where she works as a part-time lecturer, about allocation of money from the Â£15,000 grant and says she plans to make an announcement on her own website shortly.
