[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ex-BBC employee who indecently assaulted a woman more than 30 years ago was told his "past has caught up" as he was convicted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Geoffrey Wheeler, 71, was found guilty of touching a woman's breasts at a BBC office in Milton Keynes in the 1980s.
Recorder Alexander Layton QC told Southwark Crown Court the victim was "palpably vulnerable" at the time.
Wheeler, charged under Operation Yewtree, was cleared of four other charges of historical indecent assault.
It is the sixth conviction for the Scotland Yard sex abuse inquiry - following Max Clifford, Chris Denning, Paul Gadd, who is also known as Gary Glitter, Dave Lee Travis and Rolf Harris, who faces a further trial.
Wheeler, who had denied all five counts, was sentenced to 50 hours of unpaid work, told to pay £150 to the victim and £500 towards the prosecution's costs.
Wheeler - who shares a name with former BBC Songs Of Praise presenter Geoffrey Wheeler who died in 2012 - was employed on the BBC's Open University programme.
Sentencing, Recorder Layton told him: "Your past behaviour has caught up with you."
He added: "You have shown no remorse for your behaviour."
