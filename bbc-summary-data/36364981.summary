County Championship: Surrey collapse to defeat by Lancashire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire skittled Surrey for just 107 to wrap up a thumping innings-and-96-run victory on the third day at Old Trafford and go top of Division One.

Having resumed on 342-9, Simon Kerrigan (32 not out) and Kyle Jarvis (35) shared 63 for the last wicket to give the hosts a first-innings lead of 203.
Openers Tom Curran and Arun Harinath then guided the Brown Caps to 27-0, but a stunning collapse was to follow.
Jarvis took 5-49 for match figures of 11-119, as Curran (53) was last out.
Having batted at number eight in the first innings, the 21-year-old was opening for Surrey in the absence of Rory Burns, who was unable to bat after suffering a mild concussion when fielding at short leg.
And Curran was the only batsman to show any significant resistance, with Harinath's 16 the next best score and no other player able to reach double figures.
Jarvis, backed up by Tom Bailey (2-22) and Neil Wagner (2-17), followed up his first-innings 6-70 with a second five-wicket haul in the match, tearing through Surrey's middle-order to dismiss Jason Roy, Ben Foakes and James Burke cheaply.
The visitors remain eighth in the County Championship, without a win from their opening six fixtures, while Warwickshire will overtake Lancashire at the top of the table if they beat Durham at Edgbaston.
Lancashire cricket director and head coach Ashley Giles:
"Particularly after the disappointment of losing at Durham and also our first T20 game, to bounce back like that was fantastic - against a good Surrey team.
"I don't think they're at their best by any means, but to have lost the toss again at home on what looked a pretty good batting surface up front and to bowl them out for under 200, it was a great effort.
"Alviro's innings was world-class and Jarv has hit his straps again. To win three out of three at home, on what is notoriously a difficult ground to win, is a fantastic start for us."
Surrey captain Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London:
"We got ourselves in a bit of a hole on the first day and full credit to Lancashire, they made us pay for it for two and a half days.
"We're not getting it right. There's no hiding place. I take full responsibility for it because I'm the one that leads the boys out.
"We're not where we want to be or need to be, both individually and as a team, and we will continue to work hard and get that right."
