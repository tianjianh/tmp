The 18-year-old was attacked near Malvern Road and Beeston Road in Leeds at about 22:40 GMT on Friday.
She was dragged into a garden and raped, suffering head injuries and a suspected broken hip in the assault.
Police said they are looking for an Asian man in his early 20s with a slim build and dark receding hair, in connection with the attack.
Det Ch Insp Elizabeth Belton of West Yorkshire Police said: "We believe this woman was standing at the bus stop close to Malvern Road, when she was attacked by the suspect.
"She was approached by an unknown male from behind who assaulted her and dragged her into a garden close to the bus stop and subjected her to a serious sexual assault.
"It has been a very nasty attack that has been sustained over some time.
"The nature of her injuries are that she has suffered facial and head injuries and also a suspected broken hip.
"We are now treating this as an attempted murder because she has been left there for dead."
Appealing for witnesses, the officer added: "I think it is possible that someone will know [the attacker] as there was a considerable amount of blood that was at the scene.
"It's possible that the person responsible will have had blood on their hands and possibly blood on their clothing."
The victim has been taken to hospital to undergo surgery.
