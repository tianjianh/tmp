Clement Desmier stab murder pair given life sentences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have been given life sentences for murdering a pensioner in a brutal stabbing attack in Bradford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clement "Butch" Desmier, 68, was repeatedly stabbed with a knife and screwdriver at his home in August 2012.
David Lawler, 33, and 20-year-old Nathan Jefferson - who turned 17 on the day of the killing - ransacked Mr Desmier's home as they hunted for cash.
At Bradford Crown Court, Lawler was told he would serve at least 16 years, while Jefferson must serve 34 years.
During the trial the jury was told how Lawler, from Shipley, had been given a 10-year extended jail sentence for slashing a man's throat with a Stanley knife nine days after Mr Desmier was murdered.
The jury heard that more than 60 injuries were inflicted on the pensioner, whose face was covered with a cushion during the attack at his home in Rowlestone Rise, Greengates.
Lawler - described as the "dominant personality" of the pair - denied murder and witness intimidation but was convicted last week.
Jefferson pleaded guilty to murder.
The police inquiry into the case lasted more than three years and included undercover work and a Crimewatch reconstruction of the attack.
