Umar Akmal: Leicestershire in talks with Pakistan batsman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicestershire are in advanced talks to sign Pakistan batsman Umar Akmal for part of their T20 Blast campaign this summer, BBC Radio Leicester reports.

The 24-year-old would provide cover for Grant Elliott when the New Zealander is representing his country.
Akmal is an aggressive middle-order batsman who has played 16 Test matches and 111 one-day internationals.
All-rounder Elliott has signed a deal which starts with their opening T20 Blast game with Derbyshire on 22 May.
But the 35-year-old is likely to be involved for his country from 9 June when they begin their one-day series against England.
