[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following a goalless first 45 minutes where neither side looked like scoring, the Blue Brazil took the lead when Ross Caldwell latched onto a long ball from Declan McDaid before drilling home.
Declan Byrne doubled the visitors' lead - converting from Dean Brett's pass - but they were pegged back by two quick-fire headed goals from Colin McMenamin.
However, Milne had the final say with his low strike near the end.
