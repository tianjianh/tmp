Bradley Hudson-Odoi netted the winner in the 11th minute, converting Ross Stearn's cross.
Jordan Maguire-Drew went close to an equaliser for the Daggers when his effort was cleared off the line by Jamie Collins, and Ross Worner produced a fine save to deny Oliver Hawkins.
Both sides were reduced to 10 men late on with substitute Luke Guttridge going off injured after Dagenham had made all three changes, before Simon Downer was sent off for serious foul play for the hosts.
