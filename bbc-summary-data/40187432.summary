The 2017 annual Mull Rally, which sees public roads on the island closed to allow rally enthusiasts from across the country to compete, has been cancelled.

Motor Sport Association said the Act of Parliament that permitted the event had resulted in insurance issues for 2017.
Organisers said they hoped the Scottish government would quickly adopt new legislation, which would help secure the return of the event in 2018.
The world-renowned three-day rally was first held in 1969.
Under new laws in England, local authorities will be allowed to suspend the Road Traffic Act for authorised motorsports events, without the need for an individual act of parliament.
Organisers hope the Scottish government will adopt the legislation, following the conclusion of the Fatal Accident Inquiry into the Jim Clark and Snowman rallies.
Three spectators died at the 2014 Jim Clark Rally, near Coldstream, and a woman was fatally injured at the 2013 Snowman Rally in the Highlands.
Organisers said the Beatson's Building Supplies Mull Rally attracted 150 crews and generates about Â£1m for the local economy.
Motor Sport Association's chief executive, Rob Jones, said: "Whilst the brokers have offered a potential solution for 2017, this is unfortunately totally impractical as each and every claim under the policy would be subject to a very significant excess payable by the organisers, and one which the organisers cannot afford."
Donald Brown, chairman of the Guardians of Mull Rally, said it would have a negative financial impact on the island.
"There's no denying this is a huge blow to the island and its businesses who work hard to welcome the competitors, volunteers and spectators each year in October," he said.
Organisers hope to put on an alternative motorsport event for the same weekend on Mull.
The plans are at a very early stage of development.
