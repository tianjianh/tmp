[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Hugill's fifth goal of the season inside 10 minutes put the Lilywhites ahead when he stole the ball off keeper David Stockdale and scored.
The hosts improved after the break and Sam Baldock turned home Bruno's cross before Glenn Murray's smart turn and finish in the area put them ahead.
However, in the second minute of added time Makienok earned his side a point.
Brighton went into the game with five wins in their last six games and although they failed to secure another three points, the draw kept them fourth in the table.
Before scoring his goal, on-loan Bournemouth striker Murray forced Chris Maxwell into a good save and also hit the side netting.
Preston created few meaningful chances in the rain on the south coast as they conceded twice in the second-half before they were rescued by Makienok's first league goal for Preston as he headed into the bottom corner from Paul Gallagher's ball.
Simon Grayson's side scored their second with only 10 men on the pitch after they used all of their substitutes and John Welsh had to be taken off.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"With games as tough as they are, there is no doubt that this is two points lost."
"Baldock scored with a really good team goal and Murray's strike was a good ball in and a good finish," he added.
"At 2-1 we should be killing the game off and showing more killer instinct as there is always a chance that the opposition will score."
Preston manager Simon Grayson:
"We have taken four points from our last two games against Aston Villa and Brighton and had someone offered that before we would have taken it.
"This can only boost our confidence but we know what we have to do.
"When 2-1 down against a side like Brighton it will test anybody in the league, but you have to dig deep and stay in the game.
"To come here against a real top team, with good individuals, you have to do what you can to get a result, and we did that."
