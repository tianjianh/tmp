Twenty-two people were killed and 64 injured after suicide bomber Salman Abedi detonated a homemade device at Manchester Arena on Monday.
Among those killed was 14-year-old schoolgirl Eilidh MacLeod from Barra.
The silence at 11:00 was observed by people across the country, who stopped for a minute of contemplation in honour of those who died.
Politicians at Holyrood gathered in the garden lobby of the Scottish Parliament to remember those caught up in the attack on Monday night.
Nineteen of the victims have been named.
The parents of Eilidh MacLeod confirmed on Thursday that she had been killed in the attack.
She had been attending the Ariana Grande concert along with her friend 15-year-old Laura MacIntyre who remains in a serious condition in hospital.
A total of 116 people have received NHS inpatient care in relation to the Manchester incident - 75 people have been admitted across eight hospitals. This includes 23 patients who are currently in critical care - 12 of those are understood to be children.
Flags will remain at half-mast on government buildings until Thursday evening, a statement released by the prime minister's office said.
Eight men and one woman have been arrested in the UK since Monday night, including suicide bomber Salman Abedi's older brother Ismail, 23. The woman has since been released.
