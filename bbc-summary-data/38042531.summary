Matt Renshaw: Australia call up England-born batsman for South Africa Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia have called up England-born opener Matt Renshaw for the third Test against South Africa in Adelaide.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old left-hander, who was born in Middlesbrough and moved to New Zealand in 2003 and Australia in 2008, is one of six changes to the squad.
Australia have already lost the series 2-0, part of a run of five successive Test defeats, and are facing a first home whitewash.
The day-night match, the second at the Adelaide Oval, begins on Thursday.
After Australia were thrashed by South Africa in the second Test, Renshaw pushed his claim for an international call-up with scores of 108 and 50 for Queensland against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield.
He will become the youngest specialist batsman to play in a Test for Australia since Phillip Hughes in 2009.
"It is important for people to know that Matt loves Australia and he is as Australian as they come," father Ian told the Courier Mail.
"For a long time it felt as though he couldn't say that, because we, his parents, are English but he is pure Aussie," added Ian, who's friendship with Joe Root's father meant the two future internationals played together as youngsters.
"He left England when he was six years old. He has been back since but says it doesn't feel like home to him.''
Renshaw will line-up in a top six that will also feature debutants Peter Handscomb and Nic Maddinson.
Uncapped seamer Chadd Sayers is also in the squad, alongside recalled seamer Jackson Bird and wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.
Batsman Adam Voges is unavailable with concussion, while batsmen Joe Burns and Callum Ferguson and seamer Joe Mennie have been left out.
Australia squad for third Test: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, Jackson Bird, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nic Maddinson, Nathan Lyon, Matt Renshaw, Chadd Sayers, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade.
The BBC Sport readers had little sympathy for Australia's plight - and made their (rather tenuous) cases to be selected. There were more than enough to make a team...
Simon Morgan: Recently, at an auction, I bought a bat signed by Don Bradman. Just wondered who will be opening with me?
Ted: My dad had a birthmark that vaguely resembled the shape of Australia, my passport is up-to-date and I can get the time off work. I'm so excited that I'm going to Oz.
Scott, Belfast: A kangaroo once threw a piece of fruit my way at Chester Zoo. Could I come in at number 3?
Gary Ford: Could I get a game for Australia? I once had some Vegemite and haven't played for 30 years. A couple of nets and I should be shoe-in for the number four slot.
Martin: My daughter is Alice and her birthday is in spring. The phone is sure to ring at any time now.
Ruth, Bradford: "What's that Skippy, you can catch a ball in your pouch?" Put on a Baggy Green, you're the new wicketkeeper for Australia.
Steve Appleton: My cousin's penfriend's dog once licked the label off a jar of Vegemite. And I used to own a pair of baggy green jeans in the early 90s. Can I open the bowling please?
Danny, Bath: I've grown a Merv Hughes style moustache for Movember. I assume I'll open the bowling.
Eddie: My brother-in-law gave me a jigsaw puzzle picture of Sydney Opera House 27 years ago which I've kept on my living room wall, so I'm definitely on the team.
