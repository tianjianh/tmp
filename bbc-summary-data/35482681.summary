Law firm Davidson Chalmers is to open a new office in the Galashiels development.
It will act as a regional hub for the Edinburgh firm which currently employs 46 staff.
Partner Andy Drane said the move was the "natural progression" of a "long-standing commitment" to the area and would allow it to grow its client base.
"Davidson Chalmers works across a number of core sector areas which are thriving within the Borders, representing a range of clients from individuals to large organisations," he said.
"The new office will help ensure we are ideally placed to do even more to support the growth of the Borders economy.
"As someone whose family lives in the local area, I'm very excited about having a regular presence here to build upon the solid base we have established within the area."
Scottish Borders Council leader David Parker said the interchange was a  "landmark building" for Borderers and visitors using the Borders Railway.
"I am delighted Davidson Chalmers is the first company to move into the transport interchange and hope to see other firms take on office space in this attractive building in the near future," he said.
