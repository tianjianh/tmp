[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason James, 41, of Charles Road, Torquay, previously admitted manslaughter at Winchester Crown Court.
Dave "Chewie" Coxon, from Torquay died after being struck once by his friend as they headed home after a night of heavy drinking.
They had both attended the 40th anniversary rally of the Modrapheniacs Scooter Club near Wareham in Dorset.
The pair, who were both members of the Cyder Commando Scooter Club, were heading back to their caravan on 5 March and stopped off to relieve themselves.
Mr James told police his friend had urinated on his leg and said: "I punched him and knocked him out", describing the blow as a "little whack".
He did not wait to see what state Mr Coxon, who never regained consciousness, was in, the court heard.
Judge Keith Cutler said: "What clearly should have been a weekend of fun and enjoyment turned into this tragedy."
Mr Coxon's brother Jonathan said after the case: "We can see very few circumstances where there would be sufficient provocation to justify this kind of cowardly attack."
