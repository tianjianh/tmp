[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman has called for marijuana to be legalised in US and "across the board".

The Shawshank Redemption star said he had been taking the drug for medicinal purposes since a car crash in 2008.
It "has many useful uses", the 77-year-old said, adding: "I have fibromyalgia pain in this arm, and the only thing that offers any relief is marijuana."
He told the Daily Beast: "How do I take it? However it comes. I'll eat it, drink it, smoke it, snort it."
Following the car accident, the Oscar-winning actor had four hours of surgery to repair the nerves in his arm - but he still has not regained full use of his left hand.
He said: "They're talking about kids who have grand mal seizures, and they've discovered that marijuana eases that down to where these children can have a life.
"That right there, to me, says, legalise it across the board."
Freeman said of the campaign to legalise the drug: "This movement is really a long time coming, and it's getting legs - longer legs. Now, the thrust is understanding that alcohol has no real medicinal use."
The drug has been legalised for use for both medicinal and recreational purposes in four US states - Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Alaska.
In 12 further states, the possession, sale, transportation and cultivation of marijuana is permitted only for medical purpose.
