Scottish League One: Alloa stay top despite mixed afternoon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alloa remain top of Scottish League One but may rue a missed opportunity after letting a two-goal lead slip to draw 2-2 at bottom side Stenhousemuir.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Livingston had been joint leaders but relinquished their place at the top after a 3-1 defeat at East Fife.
Brechin City beat Peterhead 2-1 to move to second.
Stranraer were 2-0 victors over 10-man Queen's Park, while Albion Rovers claimed a 2-0 win over Airdrieonians, who were also reduced to 10 men.
Fraser Kerr's own goal gave Alloa the perfect start and they were in full control after Jim Goodwin's strike early in the second half.
But Goodwin went from hero to villain when he was sent off just minutes later.
Willis Furtado's goal 11 minutes from time set up a tense finish and Oli Shaw netted a stoppage-time equaliser for Stenny.
Livingston were behind Alloa only on alphabetical order heading into the weekend but they slipped to third after an afternoon to forget at East Fife.
Jamie Insall scored either side of Chris Kane's goal to put the hosts 3-0 up at the break and although Josh Mullin pulled one back for Livingston just before the hour mark, there was no way back.
The 3-1 defeat was compounded by red cards to Michael Miller and Alan Lithgow in the closing minutes.
Brechin took advantage, despite Rory McAllister giving Peterhead the lead. Ally Love levelled before Andy Jackson's strike six minutes from time gave Brechin all three points.
Goals from Liam Dick and Craig Malcolm either side of half-time earned Stranraer a 2-0 win at Queen's Park, who had Darren Miller sent off in the early stages of the second half.
Albion won by the same scoreline at 10-man Airdrie courtesy of first-half efforts from Paul Willis and Mark Ferry. Iain Russell was sent off for the hosts midway through the second period.
