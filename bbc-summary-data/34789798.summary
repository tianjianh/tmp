A Kurdish town in Turkey's Diyarbakir province has entered its ninth day under curfew as authorities fight rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

Authorities have banned residents of Silvan from leaving their homes as they carry out operations against the youth branch of the group.
At least six people have been killed, according to officials.
The PKK resumed fighting against the army following a unilateral ceasefire.
Three districts in Silvan, which is home to around 90,000 people, have been under lockdown.
One soldier and five rebels have been killed in operations, the Diyarbakir governor's office said in a statement.
A 75-year-old cleric from Silvan - who did not want to be named - told the BBC he had to escape to Diyarbakir, located 85km (52 miles) west of Silvan.
"There are snipers everywhere; we can't get out from our homes. We can't sleep during the night because of all those explosions," he said.
"We hear occasional artillery fire. My house is completely destroyed. I had to move in to my relatives' place," said Mevlude, a resident from Silvan's Tekel district.
Communication lines with the town have been severed.
There have been six separate curfews in Silvan since the PKK declared self-rule of the town in August.
The latest was announced one day after the general election, which the ruling AKP party won with almost 50% of the vote.
