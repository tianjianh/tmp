[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother accused of murdering her baby boy told a child to shake him when he became unresponsive, a trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rebeka Nazmin, 31, and Mohammed Miah, 37, of Poplar, east London, deny murdering their 13-week-old son Rifat.
He was taken to hospital on 4 July 2016 with 47 broken bones and a fatal brain injury.
Ms Nazmin told the child to shake the baby or put water on him to rouse him and if that failed, to call an ambulance, Old Bailey jurors were told.
Rifat had been in the corner of his parents' bedroom, when the child noticed the baby was "red and hot".
Initially Rifat had been "doing something, then he lies there doing nothing. He didn't even wake up," the child told police.
Under cross-examination the child admitted shaking Rifat the day before his death but said Mr Miah was to blame for the fatality.
Mr Miah hit Rifat and the child with a mobile phone lead, the young witness said.
Both parents have blamed the child for Rifat's injuries.
The child, who has autism and a history of hitting other children, had become "charming" and "delightful" at primary school since receiving specialist educational help, the court heard.
The child cuddled and sometimes carried Rifat when he cried and was "good and caring" towards Rifat because Ms Nazmin had asked the child to be careful when looking after her son, the child said.
Ms Nazmin allegedly told police that her husband had a problem with Rifat's deformed hand and had abused him because of it.
Both parents have been charged with causing or allowing Rifat to suffer serious physical harm between 31 March and 6 July 2016.
Mr Miah is also accused of cruelty towards two other children, who cannot be identified, on 4 July 2016.
The trial continues.
