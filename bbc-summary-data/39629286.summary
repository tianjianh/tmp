Nottinghamshire batsman Riki Wessels scored a magnificent maiden double hundred as his side dominated against Sussex on day one at Trent Bridge.

Wessels finished unbeaten on 202 off 177 balls in Notts' 447 all out, after they recovered superbly from 88-5.
England's Stuart Broad made 57 in an eighth-wicket stand of 132 with Wessels who struck 22 fours and seven sixes.
Paceman James Pattinson then took two late wickets, and Broad one, to reduce Sussex to 11-3 at the close.
It was a fine fightback from Notts after Alex Hales' dismissal for 45 sparked a clatter of three wickets in seven balls, with veteran seamer Steve Magoffin (5-51) also doing early damage.
Batting at number six, Wessels surpassed his previous first-class best of 199 he made against the same county at Hove in 2012.
Broad was equally as destructive, albeit only for 46 balls, hitting nine fours and a six as his partnership with Wessels lasted less than 16 overs.
Sussex's troubles were compounded in the final six overs before stumps when Chris Nash, Harry Finch and nightwatchman Stuart Whittingham all fell.
