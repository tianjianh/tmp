Winger Milan Lalkovic says there is plenty more to come from him now he has been let out of "the cage" at Walsall.

Former Chelsea trainee Lalkovic, 23, started his first game since 1 March and scored as the promotion-chasing Saddlers beat Gillingham 2-1.
"I was very angry when I didn't start against Oldham," the Slovakian told BBC WM 95.6.
"I was ready and just wondering when it was going to happen, but it was a great goal and I should do more of this."
Lalkovic, who is in his second spell at The Banks's Stadium following a season-long loan two years ago, notched his eight goal of the campaign - and first since Boxing Day - at the Priestfield Stadium after seven successive appearances from the bench.
"In my (goal) celebration I was dusting myself off - I've been in the cage for the last five weeks," Lalkovic said.
"All the frustration came out of me. I think I've only played three bad games this season. I was always thinking 'why am I being dropped?'- I was top scorer from midfield.
"Talking to (professional development coach) John Ward really helps me when I'm in this kind of situation.
"People talk about my potential but I think I'm starting to show it now and there's still more to come from me in terms of goals and assists."
Walsall's win against the Gills moved them to within five points of Burton in the second automatic promotion place in League One ahead of Saturday's home game with Southend.
"If we don't win the Gillingham victory will be for nothing," Lalkovic added.
"We want to aim for automatic promotion - no-one really wants the play-offs - but it's out of our hands.
"We just need to keep doing what we're doing and if we can, I don't see why we can't do it."
