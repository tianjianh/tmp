The 17-year-old trailed 6-5 against Georgia's Bolkvadze, having just had her serve broken, before she called for the trainer for advice on a shin problem and subsequently retired.
"I've been struggling with this injury for a few weeks and have been managing it," Swan told BBC Points West.

"Today it was too painful and the doctor told me it would get a lot worse if I kept playing, so I stopped. There is no point taking any risks and making it worse."
