[SN]TITLE[SN]
MSPs pass new law on disclosure certificates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs have passed emergency legislation to ensure disclosure certificates for teachers, doctors and police officers comply with human rights law.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 3,000 people faced a delay in the vetting procedure for criminal records after it was suspended following a UK Supreme Court ruling.
The court said owning up to minor spent convictions breached human rights.
The ruling led to legal actions in England and Wales. The Scottish government acted to prevent any repeat.
Disclosure Scotland services should now resume on Thursday.
