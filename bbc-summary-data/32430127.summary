Sally Shalloe, 52, of Barton Lane, Attenborough, died after her bicycle and a motorbike collided in Middleton Boulevard on Tuesday morning.
The 31-year-old male motorcyclist remains in a serious condition at the Queens Medical Centre.
Rush hour traffic had to be diverted and the southbound carriageway did not reopen until early afternoon.
Ms Shalloe worked as a research fellow at the University of Nottingham and had been worked within the Human Factors Research Group since 2006.
Paying tribute, Sarah Sharples, professor of human factors, said: "Sally Shalloe was a great friend and a very much-loved, respected and valued team member.
"Sally was the heart of the team - always positive and caring, ready to work through any problem and the first to roll up her sleeves to get a job done.
"She was compassionate, supportive, hard-working, tolerant, enthusiastic, great company and an excellent listener.
"Sally was always well-liked and able to communicate and work with everyone. Words cannot express how much she meant to us and how much we will all miss her."
