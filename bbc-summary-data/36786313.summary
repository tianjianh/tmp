The fee is believed to be in the region of US$8m (£6m) and would be the highest paid to an African club.
BBC Sport understands the deal for the 23-year-old will go through this week.
Evouna joined Ahly last summer from Moroccan side Wydad Casablanca. He scored 12 goals in 24 matches to help them win their 38th league title.
He became the most expensive player in Egyptian football history when he signed for the Red Devils for US$2.5m (£1.9m) but is set to ;leave after only one season.
Evouna has scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for his country and played for the Panthers at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations on home soil.
