He has played three Royals games since joining from Billericay Town, where he scored 22 goals in five months.
Liburd, 23, comes in to cover Paris Cowan-Hall, who is likely miss the rest of the season after injuring his ankle.
"I've seen Reading's under-21s play on countless occasions and he's scored virtually every time," said Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth.
"He's a big lad who's very quick across the ground and knows where the goal is, and we're very much looking forward to working with him."
Liburd has also scored 11 times in 14 under-21 games for Reading.
"As with any new player, we have to be careful not to expect too much from him too soon, but he is someone we're confident can give us another dimension up front and I'm sure the fans will warm to him very quickly," Ainsworth added.
