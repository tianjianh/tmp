[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottinghamshire detective cleared of rape can return to work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A detective sergeant who was wrongly convicted of rape has won his appeal to return to work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trevor Gray was sacked by Nottinghamshire Police after he was handed an eight year jail term in May 2012 for attacking a woman in her home.
But the conviction was quashed and he was cleared at a retrial in February.
A Police Appeals Tribunal board has now directed that Mr Gray, who had 25 years experience, be reinstated with Nottinghamshire Police.
He will now be able to return in the same rank as detective sergeant and his service will be considered continuous from the date of his dismissal.
A statement from the board read: "We... having considered the appellant's notice of appeal, relevant evidence and other documents connected with the appeal, hereby allow the appeal against the finding of gross misconduct on the ground there is evidence that could not reasonably have been considered at the original hearing which could have materially affected the finding."
In 2012 Mr Gray was convicted of rape, attempted rape and sexual touching and given an eight-year jail sentence.
He appealed on the grounds that police had failed to find a significant witness who would have assisted his defence.
His wife Alison Gray then traced the witness and their evidence led to his conviction being quashed on appeal.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it was examining Nottinghamshire Police's handling of the investigation and whether steps were taken to identify and locate significant witnesses.
