Scotland's political parties have been campaigning across the country while putting the finishing touches to their list of general election candidates.

All 54 sitting SNP MPs will be put forward for election.
Labour said their candidates for the 8 June ballot will be in place by next week, while the Tories vowed to "put their strongest team out on the pitch".
The Lib-Dems have confirmed they will be operating all-female shortlists in a number of target seats.
Scottish Labour have received 150 applications after issuing a call for prospective parliamentary candidates over Twitter.
Speaking on the campaign trail in South Queensferry, party leader Kezia Dugdale said: "Applications have flooded in from across the country to stand in this election, such is the determination of Labour members to work tirelessly to kick Theresa May out of office and elect Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister.
"Labour will run a positive campaign that rejects the divisiveness of the Tories and their plans for a hard Brexit, and the divisiveness of the SNP's plans for a second independence referendum."
The SNP confirmed all their sitting MPs would be on their list but Michelle Thomson and Natalie McGarry, who have had the party whip withdrawn, will not.
Nicola Sturgeon visited a a new development of fully-accessible flats in Stenhousemuir while campaigning for the 4 May local elections.
She promised that SNP councils would build "their share of at least 50,000 new affordable houses across Scotland by March 2021".
Ms Sturgeon said the party would work with housing associations "to ensure at least 35,000 of these are homes for social rent".
"We believe that everyone in Scotland deserves a warm, affordable home," she added.
"That is why SNP councils will commit to three key pledges to ensure everyone has access to a safe home."
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson launched a poster campaign in Edinburgh.
It highlighted the Tories' message of opposition to a second independence referendum, with the slogan: "We said no, we meant it."
Ms Davidson said: "We are going to fight hard in every seat in Scotland at this election.
"That means putting our strongest team out on the pitch."
Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie also hit the poster campaign trail in Dundee.
The party is operating all-female shortlists in a number of target seats, some of which - Edinburgh West included - may be decided over the weekend.
Mr Rennie said: "In Dundee, we have fantastic candidates taking the fight straight towards the SNP in their heartlands and come May we are ready to claim a few scalps.
"The announcement of the general election last week has only added to that and activists in Dundee and around Scotland are relishing the upcoming elections."
