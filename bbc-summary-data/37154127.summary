Small earthquake felt on Isle of Mull in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A small earthquake has been detected on the Isle of Mull in Argyll.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The British Geological Survey recorded the 1.9-magnitude tremor at 13:38 on Friday, with the epicentre towards the south of the island.
The geoscience organisation said the earthquake was felt at Lochbuie, Kinlochspelve and Gruline on Mull.
There are usually between 200 and 300 recorded earthquakes in Britain each year, but the vast majority are so small that no one notices them.
