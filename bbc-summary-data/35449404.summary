Snow and icy conditions across NI as temperature plummets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Storm Gertrude has moved on and in her wake, very cold air has plunged across much of Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sleet and snow showers affected many parts on Saturday and there are several reports of lying snow, particularly inland.
Warnings for snow and strong winds were in place on Saturday.
The police said driving conditions are hazardous on many roads across Northern Ireland.
In west Belfast, a motorcyclist was taken to hospital after being involved in a crash on the Falls Road.
It happened at about 3.15 GMT.   The man's injuries are not thought to be life threatening.
Conditions are particularly poor on the M1 between Lurgan, County Armagh, and the end of the motorway.
Drivers have been advised to exercise extreme caution in the area.
At Mourneview Park in Lurgan, County Armagh, a match between Glenavon and Glentoran football clubs was postponed because of the snow.
Saturday night will bring further snow showers, along with icy stretches on untreated surfaces.
On Sunday there will be a gradual transition to milder air and rain.
