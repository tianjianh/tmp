The bodies of a Norwegian woman, 29, a British man, 31, and a German woman, 19, were found in a burned-out car south-east of Perth, local media said.
A local farmer was also reportedly killed trying to warn residents of the encroaching fire.
It was the first deadly bushfire of the Australian summer, sparked by lightning over the weekend.
The three European workers reportedly drove away from the property to rescue a horse and took a wrong turn into the fire.
Linda Campbell told the West Australian that all three victims worked for her on the property at Scaddan, near the town of Esperance.
"If they had turned right at the gate and not left they wouldn't have died," she was quoted as saying.
"They had become part of the team and all the staff are taking this very hard."
