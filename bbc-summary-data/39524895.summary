The girl, named locally as Victoria Resetnjova, was shaken "like a rag doll" by the dog in a park - where they are banned - in Chatham, Kent.
She is in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
Her parents said: "The incident has ruined our lives and the lives of our two children."
Kent Police said the dog had been found to be a "pit bull type", which officers said was a banned breed under dangerous dog legislation.
Firearms officers shot it dead after being called to the park at 17:26 BST on Tuesday.
A man, teenager and woman, all from Chatham, were arrested on suspicion of offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act.
They have now been released pending further inquiries.
The family statement added: "We would like to thank all the emergency services and others who helped our daughter by giving first aid at the scene.
"We are also grateful for the continued support of the hospital where she is being treated.
"We ask that people now respect our privacy and give us time to focus on the wellbeing of our family."
The child was taken to a London hospital with life threatening injuries.
Eyewitnesses described the attack as "terrifying".
Amanda Ayres, 52, who called for an ambulance after seeing the attack, said: "I can't get her face out my head - her lips were blue.
"The mum came over screaming and fell to her knees when she saw her little girl. The whole dog's face was covered in blood."
Her daughter Katy Ayres, 31, added: "It had her head in his mouth and was shaking her, treating her like a rag doll."
