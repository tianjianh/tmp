Just over 1,000 people were surveyed for the Welsh government poll, with 77% saying they were worried about developing the condition.
A campaign urging people to take steps to reduce the risk has been launched.
Health minister Mark Drakeford said: "You are never too young to take some simple steps to improve both your physical and mental health as you age."
The Welsh government said almost half of the people surveyed thought there was nothing they could do to reduce the risk of developing dementia, but evidence has shown a healthier lifestyle can reduce the chance.
This includes not smoking, drinking the recommended amount of alcohol and staying active.
An extra Â£30m will be spent on older people's mental health this year, which will include new support for dementia.
