The Airbus A380 will operate on a route run by Middle Eastern airline Emirates between Birmingham and Dubai from Easter Sunday.
The aircraft can fly 15,200km (9,995 miles) and carry 600 passengers.
Bosses hope its arrival can help the airport to keep expanding and serve more passengers.
Bob Graham, airport operations director, said Â£1m had been spent on the infrastructure needed to host the plane.
He said the new service was "a fantastic opportunity" to bring in more passengers to the airport - which handled 10 million passengers in 2015 - as well as more jobs for the region.
"It's the most prestigious aircraft that's currently around," he said.
Craig Burrows, from Emirates, said: "The challenge is trying to turn the aircraft around safely and securely.
"We need extra ground service equipment which we have to ensure gets on the aircraft safely and there's more fuel up-lift and a lot more baggage to be carried on the aircraft due to the bigger number of passengers."
