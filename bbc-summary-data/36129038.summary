The 1938 Brough Superior 750cc BS4 was one of eight bikes of its type found on Bodmin Moor in December last year.
Together, eight bikes - described by auctioneers Bonhams as the "last known collection of unrestored Broughs" - reached £752,625.
Ben Walker, from Bonhams motorcycle department, described the find as "the motorcycle discovery of the decade".

He said: "They've caused quite a stir in the saleroom, with each one far exceeding estimate, allowing us to break our own world record for a British motorcycle sold at auction."

An unnamed German bidder paid £331,900 for the 1938 Brough Superior 750cc BS4.
The bikes, known as the Broughs of Bodmin Moore, had been stored in barns for more than 50 years and were found "submerged under decades of dust, old machinery parts and household clutter".
The motorcycles, which date from between 1926-1939, were collected by Frank Vague, who died in 2015.
