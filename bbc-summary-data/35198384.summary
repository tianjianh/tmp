[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a body was found in a stairwell at a block of flats.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was found unconscious at Appleford Court in Pitsea, Essex, shortly after officers were called to a disturbance at about 00:30 GMT on Wednesday.
The unnamed man, thought to be in his mid-20s to mid-30s, was given first aid before being declared dead.
The 50-year-old suspect was arrested in Rectory Road afterwards, but police are still looking for a second man.
He is described as white, 5ft 5in tall (1.65m), in his mid-30s, with short dark hair, and was wearing dark clothing.
Police have cordoned off the scene and a forensic examination and house-to-house inquiries are under way.
