The New York based singer-songwriter has written songs for Icona Pop, Jennifer Hudson and says Rihanna is currently working on one of her creations.
But she says her process is very different when she is writing songs for herself.
Her debut album Sound of a Woman will be released on November 7th.
Speaking to Fearne Cotton ahead of her Live Lounge performance, she said she knows when she's writing a song for herself.
"I get vulnerable and I'm channelling me. With other artists I use my imagination more, its more hypothetical and I think of scenarios that relate to people."
She says her songs then tend to "find people who they relate to".
In her early career she tried to write for specific singers, but now just "writes a song the way it should be written".
She says that's when people started using her music, including Rihanna.
Although Kiesza hasn't heard Rihanna's song, she's "heard she did an amazing job".
Before performing Giant In My Heart, the second single from Sound of a Woman, Kiesza admitted the album "came together last minute".
Her schedule has been so hectic that much of it was produced "under pressure" and she struggled to find creativity, but says she's "really happy" with how it sounds.
She also did an acoustic cover version of Prayer in C by Lilly Woods, which Fearne described as a "special moment".
And, after Greg James' spoof of her Hideaway video, he may soon be able to add Opera Singer to his CV.  Kiesza wants him to be a part of the opera she is writing.
