Numbers obtained by a prison reform charity showed a decline each year from 2010 to 2014.
The Dyfed-Powys force area had the greatest dip at 70%, with South Wales the smallest at 47%.
The Howard League for Penal Reform said it was down to work done to keep children out of the criminal justice system.
Across Wales, child arrests were down from 13,889 in 2010 to 6,199 in 2014, a response to the charity's Freedom of Information request showed.
There was a fall of 61% in the Gwent Police area and 55% in north Wales.
The Howard League said the figures closely matched an average drop of 54% across Wales and England as a whole. Of those arrested, 83% were boys.
