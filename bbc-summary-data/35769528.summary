[SN]TITLE[SN]
Furness midwives had 'no evidence' pregnant woman was ill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A misconduct hearing has been told there was "no evidence" two midwives knew a woman was ill days before the birth of her son who later died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hoa Titcombe's husband James said he told Furness General Hospital staff "several times" his wife was ill.
Midwives Catherine McCullough and Gretta Dixon are accused of failing to have Mrs Titcombe assessed.
But midwife Caroline Duncan told the Nursing and Midwifery Council there was "no evidence" they knew she was ill.
Mr and Mrs Titcombe's son Joshua died of an infection in 2008, nine days after he was born.
On day two of the misconduct hearing, Ms Duncan said Ms McCullough did meet the standards expected of her.
However, she said that if the patient did tell her she was ill she should have referred her to be assessed in accordance with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and midwifery rules.
She also told the hearing there was also no evidence that Ms Dixon was aware Mrs Titcombe had been unwell.
It is alleged Ms Dixon failed to refer Mrs Titcombe for an assessment when she was told she had been unwell, on 26 October, 2008.
Ms McCullough faces the same allegation, as well as failing to take a urine sample to test for infection.
An independent inquiry into the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust last year found 20 major failures from 2004 to 2013 at Furness General Hospital and concluded there were "lethal failures."
Eleven babies and one mother died after being cared for at the hospital during this time.
The hearing continues.
