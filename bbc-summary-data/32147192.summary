Glamorgan Cricket Club's debts write-off hit by hitch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Efforts to restructure Glamorgan County Cricket Club's multi-million pound debts have been hit by a last-minute hitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chairman Barry O'Brien told the club's Annual General Meeting on Tuesday that an appeal from one councillor could force the matter back to cabinet.
He said it meant that the accounts could not yet be finalised.
Cardiff Council confirmed a councillor has "called in" the cabinet's ruling, as allowed under its constitution.
The club had thought the local authority had already agreed to cancel the sum as it tries to restructure its finances.
If the objection is ruled valid, it would go to the council's policy review and performance committee.
The councillor - whose identity has not been released - would then present objections to the committee, which could then ask the cabinet to consider it again.
That cabinet meeting would then be held next month, where members could either confirm or overturn their decision.
Mr O'Brien told the club's AGM that Glamorgan were "very close to securing our financial future."
Last month, the council announced it had approved writing off Â£4.4m of the Â£6.4m it is owed by the club.
Glamorgan asked creditors to write off 70% of the money and interest owing and agree to a restructuring of the remaining 30%.
Allied Irish Bank and former chairman Paul Russell have also agreed to write off the majority of their debts.
