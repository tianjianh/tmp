The first of a fleet of new trains has been introduced on the Gatwick Express service between London Victoria and the West Sussex airport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£145m fleet of 27 Electrostar trains, built by Bombardier in Derby, will replace the 30-year-old rolling stock currently operating on the route.
New trains are being introduced gradually, with all existing stock expected to be replaced by mid-June.
"We are pleased to be taking the old ones out," said manager Chris Lund.
He added: "There is a lot more space inside to move suitcases up and down the train and into luggage racks and getting in and out of the trains is a lot easier now that we've got two sets of double doors per carriage."
The non-stop Gatwick Express service is run by Govia Thameslink Railway, which also operates Thameslink, Great Northern and Southern services.
