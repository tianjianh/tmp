Betsi Cadwaladr health board: Maternity units shut over safety

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maternity units in north Wales have previously been forced to temporarily shut over safety fears for mothers and babies, a health board boss has said.

Betsi Cadwaladr's Simon Dean said it was due to "extreme difficulties" in recruiting doctors.
He said it was a daily challenge to fill rotas.
On Tuesday, the board will discuss downgrading units at either Glan Clwyd, Ysbyty Gwynedd or Wrexham Maelor hospitals.
The health board favours making the doctor-led unit at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, a midwife-led unit. Mothers needing more complicated care will be transferred to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor.
Critics of the controversial proposal have claimed some expectant mothers would be at greater risk from having to travel further.
The Betsi Cadwaladr board initially argued it did not have time to hold a public consultation on its decision because the changes had to be implemented urgently.
However, campaigners challenged the decision in court and managers backed down.
The consultation document which will be discussed on Tuesday also includes a proposal to maintain services as they are, but Mr Dean told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme that would not be safe.
"Clearly if we thought things were safe as they were - we wouldn't be entering into consultation," he said.
He said it was important to "recognise the warning signs that things are much more difficult before a tragic event happens. We're trying to manage risks in anticipatory way - looking at the things that could go wrong".
If the decision is given the go ahead, the public will be invited to have its say.
Mr Dean took over as interim chief executive after its previous boss stepped aside following the health minister's decision to put the board into "special measures" following a series of scandals.
He said his priority has been to "rebuild the trust and confidence of the public and staff" and "create the conditions which staff could succeed".
