[SN]TITLE[SN]
No public inquiry into North York Moors potash mine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government will not be holding a public inquiry into plans to build a potash mine beneath the North York Moors National Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£1.7bn project was approved by the park authority last month.
The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said ministers had decided not to call in the planning applications.
Almost 30 environmental and leisure organisations had urged rejection of the plans.
The area's three Conservative MPs and two local councils came out in support of the plan, claiming it would "transform" the local economy.
Developers Sirius Minerals plan to build the mine near Whitby and construct a 23-mile (37km) tunnel to transport the potash to a Teesside processing plant.
Chris Fraser, managing director and CEO of Sirius, said: "This is yet another positive step forward on our pathway to developing the project and increasing shareholder value."
Sirius has claimed the mine would deliver at least 1,000 permanent jobs.
Speaking after the park authority approved the application on 30 June, Ruth Bradshaw, from the Campaign for National Parks, said she was "disappointed" at the decision.
"We have long maintained that this project is completely incompatible with National Park purposes and that the promised economic benefits could never justify the huge damage that it would do to the area's landscape and wildlife, and to the local tourism economy," she said.
The group said it was considering a legal challenge against the building of the mine.
The North York Moors National Park Authority said it was working with Sirius on the final details of the plan "with a view to issuing a decision notice by the end of September 2015".
The mine is expected to be operating within five years.
