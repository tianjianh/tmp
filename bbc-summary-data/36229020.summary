[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth-based aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious up for sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decommissioned Royal Navy aircraft carrier that served in Bosnia and the Gulf has been put up for sale by the Ministry of Defence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Invincible-class HMS Illustrious is currently moored in Portsmouth Harbour after 32 years in service.
The Disposal Services Authority (DSA) is looking for prospective buyers to bid on the 22,000-tonne ship for recycling only.
It said the sale could be discontinued should a heritage option become open.
The ship has sailed 900,000 miles on operations across the globe, including the aftermath of the Falklands War, helping maintain a no-fly zone in Bosnia in the 1990s and doing the same in the Arabian Gulf in 1998.
It also helped with the aid mission in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan.
Bids must be in by 23 May with viewings in June, according to the DSA.
