The 24-year-old Poland international has agreed a three-year contract at Loftus Road and is Rangers' first signing of the summer.
Borysiuk started his career at Legia and returned there in January following spells at Lechia Gdansk and German side Kaiserslautern.
"I am very delighted to join QPR," he told the Championship club's website.
"I had some options, but when I was young I dreamed about playing in England and when there was an option with QPR, I didn't need much time to think about it.
"I am a player who gives 100% in every game. I think English fans like players like this. I am a big fan of English football. This is a great step forward for me."
