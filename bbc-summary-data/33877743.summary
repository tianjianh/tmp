Farmers have blocked lorries entering and leaving a supermarket depot in County Antrim in a protest over farm produce prices.

Several tractors and farm vehicles were used to block the entrance to Lidl's regional  distribution centre near Nutts Corner on Tuesday night.
They prevented about a dozen delivery lorries entering and leaving the site.
The protesters said the demonstration marked another stage in their ongoing campaign over prices.
Farmer Johnny Matthews told the BBC that supermarkets were selling milk as a "loss leader" and as a result were putting farms out of business.
Retailers' representatives have denied the loss leader accusation and have argued that global economic forces were affecting milk prices.
But Mr Matthews said the protest was not only focused on dairy farms.
"It's all about agriculture sectors - beef, lamb, cereals, pork, vegetables and milk.
"Every industry in the Northern Ireland agricultural sector is under pressure at this minute in time and we need help and we need it urgently."
When asked what the demonstration would achieve, he referred to recent action by dairy farms in England, that resulted in a major supermarket taking action.
On Tuesday, Morrisons announced it would sell a new milk brand which will see 10p per litre extra paid to farmers.
Mr Matthews said: "England has done it last week, and they've got the milk price risen 10p for doing that, so we've got to start somewhere too."
Hannah Lilburn, from Moira, helps out at the family farm, and was at the protest.
"The farm has been passed down through generations and my brother is now on the farm as well," she said.
"The two of them run the 220 herd dairy cow unit. It is hard, it is hard work. It's costing on average 30.34p to produce.
"Farmers in Northern Ireland are getting paid about 19p so every cow that is milked on our farm we're losing money on.
"No other person would go to their job if they were losing money every day but a cow can't just be turned off like a tap, they have to keep going."
