A young offenders' unit in South Gloucestershire has been praised for its work with the young women it holds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inspectors visiting the Mary Carpenter Unit at HMP Eastwood Park, near Wotton-under-Edge, were pleased to see a high level of individual care.
The report from the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick, also commended the head of the unit and her staff.
However inspectors had some concerns with internal child protection arrangements and visiting arrangements.
The specialist unit for 17-year-old women, who are placed there by the Youth Justice Board, is attached to Eastwood Park women's prison.
Michael Spurr, chief executive officer of the National Offender Management Service, said he was pleased the "very good work" of the unit had been acknowledged.
"The governor, the head of the unit and her staff work hard to provide a high level of care, education and resettlement support."
