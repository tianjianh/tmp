Huge blaze after lorry crash in Fife closes A92

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The A92 was closed following a huge blaze after two articulated lorries crashed at Lochgelly in Fife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash happened when a lorry hit another lorry which was stopped in standing traffic, just before the turn off to the B9149, at about 09:35.
A man was taken to Victoria Hospital for further checks. Police are advising motorists to use alternative routes.
Smoke from the blaze could be seen from the other side of the Forth, at least 20 miles away.
The fire was extinguished by 11:30.
The westbound carriageway was partially reopened at about 14:30 but the accident area remained closed.
Drivers were being diverted via the Lochgelly off-slip before re-entering the A92 at the Lochgelly on-slip.
The Scottish Fire and rescue Service said the road was expected to be closed "for some considerable time".
