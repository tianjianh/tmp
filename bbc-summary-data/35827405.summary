Former WBO light-heavyweight champion Cleverly is chasing another world title after his exciting performance, albeit in defeat, against Andrzej Fonfara.
Braehmer and Cleverly have come close to fighting several times in the past.
It's a big ask, going to Germany and upsetting Braehmer, but I fancy it," Cleverly explained.
Speaking to BBC Sport, Cleverly's promoters Matchroom confirmed that talks are ongoing about a fight with WBA light heavyweight champion Braehmer.
"We are in discussions with the Sauerlands looking at an autumn fight with Braehmer," they said.
"Nathan should be back in action on a bill in May."
Braehmer has won 16 successive fights and has defended his WBA title six times. His first successful defence came against Cleverly's former stablemate, Enzo Maccarinelli.
Cleverly, 29, told Sky Sports: "I've got big plans for the future. I'm in a good place after the Fonfara fight.
"I've gained credibility from that fight and I'm going to take it forward.
"There's the rematch [option] with Fonfara, but we're going for Juergen Braehmer.
"There'll be a little tune-up fight in May, but then it'll be on to Braehmer.
"We were supposed to fight three times in the past but for some reason he didn't fight me. It's time to get it on now. I'm prepared to go to Germany and I can't wait.
"The Sauerlands [Braehmer's promoters] and Eddie Hearn [of Matchroom] have started preliminary talks, so let's hope they can nail down this date for Braehmer's next fight in Germany. "
