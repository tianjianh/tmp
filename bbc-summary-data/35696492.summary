Ministers promised a response after AMs claimed the 2013 Active Travel Act had failed to achieve its potential due to a lack of funding and leadership.
Healthy travel will be promoted in school lessons, public health campaigns, and investment decisions, backed up by monitored targets.
Transport Minister Edwina Hart said there was a need for "culture change".
Local councils are obliged to provide routes for cyclists and walkers and to consider their needs when planning new road and rail links under the 2013 legislation.
But there was "considerable frustration" among supporters of active travel at the lack of progress, the business and enterprise committee reported in February.
Chairman William Graham claimed AMs felt the commitment of ministers had "started to waver before it has properly begun".
The Active Travel Action Plan published by the Welsh government on Tuesday sets out expectations in areas ranging from leadership and infrastructure to skills and training.
An annual progress report will monitor how many more adults and children have been encouraged to take up walking or cycling.
"Increasing levels of walking and cycling offers many health and social benefits," said Mrs Hart.
"We know that most people in Wales currently make no or very few walking and cycling journeys.
"This plan sets out how we can achieve our ambition of making walking and cycling part of everyday life through a culture change, both within organisations, and among individuals, as well as action to reduce barriers to active travel."
