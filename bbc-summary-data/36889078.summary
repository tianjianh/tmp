Dandy Flame, owned and trained by Jose Santos, struggled on debut at Windsor on 11 July, but won by two and three-quarter lengths in the five furlong event on Monday.
Santos, based in Berkshire, said he was "absolutely over the moon".
"I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a bet on him, but I should have had more," he added.
Equinoctial won at Kelso in November 1990 at odds of 250-1 and remains the longest-odds winner in British racing.
Dandy Flame joins the exclusive ranks of those to have won at 200-1 before - the last is thought to be Lights of Broadway at Taunton in 2012.
The horse "looked clueless" when finishing last from eight on debut, according to the Racing Post form guide, which suggested a "massive improvement" was required.
