Rail passenger satisfaction in first rise since 2012

The proportion of people satisfied with their rail journey in Britain has risen for the first time since 2012, a survey of passengers has said.

The bi-annual National Rail Passenger Survey, which asks more than 28,000 people, recorded a 2% year-on-year rise in overall satisfaction to 83%.
The research was carried out between 1 September and 12 November 2015.
Watchdog Transport Focus said railway improvements were "very welcome" but performance was "still patchy".
Rail Minister Claire Perry said overall satisfaction - which is at its highest level since autumn 2012 (85%) - was "a welcome sign that our record investment is starting to deliver results".
"There is clearly much more to be done, which is why we are continuing to invest to reduce crowding, cut journey times, and improve the passenger experience," she said.
Other findings from the survey include:
Jacqueline Starr, managing director of customer experience at the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said there was "more to do to keep improving".
"Our railway is benefiting from one of the biggest investment programmes in its history - major improvement work that is producing better stations, better trains and better journeys," she said.
The headline is positive enough - rail passenger satisfaction in Britain has risen for the first time since 2012, according to a customer survey.
But many commuters will be surprised by that - particularly in London and south-east England.
They've suffered endless delays and cancellations due to the ongoing upgrading work at London Bridge.
The problems have been so bad that MPs have repeatedly raised them in parliament in recent months.
At the start of January - just after commuters saw the price of their annual season ticket increase again - MPs branded Southern's service "a joke" and called for the Southern franchise to be withdrawn.
There is also a petition calling for South Eastern to lose its franchise.
The rail companies blame increased demand and the improvement works but commuters who have no option but to take the train are feeling the strain.
They believe only changes of franchise will get services back on track.
The survey was carried out by independent transport user watchdog Transport Focus, whose chief executive Anthony Smith said: "Punctuality and crowding drive passenger views of the railway."
He also said the value for money scores showed wide variation around the country.
"Passengers rightly expect the train companies and Network Rail to keep to their basic promises with most trains on time, the right length and with few cancellations," he said.
