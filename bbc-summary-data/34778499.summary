Minister Angela Constance says Scots education bill changes to be considered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moves allowing ministers to have a say over who sits on the governing bodies of Scottish universities could be reconsidered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Education Secretary Angela Constance told MSPs that she was listening and would continue to listen.
Worries have been voiced that the new Higher Education Bill would give ministers too much control.
The legislation is aimed at creating greater transparency and openness in higher education governance.
It sets out that universities should have;
Ms Constance said she was aware of the concerns raised by opposition politicians and from within the university sector itself.
In evidence to Holyrood's education committee, she said: "The concerns articulated by Universities Scotland and others are not concerns that I share.
"Nonetheless there is a willingness on my behalf and on behalf of the government to look in detail at those concerns and a willingness to attempt to remove the concerns articulated by others."
The focus of criticism has been on section 8 and 13 of the bill.
Conservative MSP Liz Smith said those sections "allow ministers to modify categories of membership of governing bodies and the number of persons to be appointed", but the Scottish government had not carried out a consultation on these.
She said if the sections were "increasing ministerial power by definition, that means the Office for National Statistics would have to look at that in the light of reclassifying them as public bodies".
Ms Smith added: "All stakeholders, students, staff, academics, business - they are concerned about the aspect of ministerial control and ONS reclassification, as is the Scottish government, so it claims.
"Would it not be sensible to remove sections eight and 13 from the bill to take out any risk whatsoever?"
Addressing whether the bill would be changed, Ms Constance said: "That is being actively considered, whether we should look at amendment or removal."
She went on: "Considerations regarding ONS reclassification have been absolutely central to the work that has gone on around this Bill, and we have considered the issue of ONS reclassification prior to the actual introduction of the bill.
"We're confident that the bill is compliant with the indicators as laid out in the (ONS) guidance."
Following the evidence session, Labour's Iain Gray said the bill "was a mess".
He added: "Angela Constance admitted as much again at committee today, and promised to fix the sections which risk the funding of our universities.
"It is long past the point when she should be telling us exactly how she is going to clear this mess up. It really is not acceptable to be coming to committee at this stage with no answers."
