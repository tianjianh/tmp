Marie Cooke, from Nottinghamshire, said the MP placed the cup on her table during a break at a rally at the Albert Hall in Nottingham on 20 August.
Ms Cooke, who works for Age UK, said she saw it as a "cheeky" opportunity to raise money for the charity.
She said about 4,000 people watched the item on eBay, and it was eventually won after 22 bids on Thursday evening.
Ms Cooke was outside the Nottingham Playhouse when Mr Corbyn asked her if she minded if he put his cup on her table.
"We were happy to oblige," she said.
"[When] he went back into the Albert Hall to deliver his speech we thought we'd be a bit cheeky and take the cup and put it on eBay.
"[On Thursday] it just went mad with over 4,000 people looking at it, and we raised £51."
The fundraiser said she would attempt to get Mr Corbyn's autograph to prove it was his cup.
The cup was won by a student in Oxford, according to Ms Cooke.
"I think they are going to turn it into some kind of relic," she said.
