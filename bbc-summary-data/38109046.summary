The 38-year-old, who won his seventh Paralympic title in Rio this summer, was one of a number of high-profile athletes left off the podium programme.
But his appeal to British Swimming has been successful and he will receive funding from UK Sport.
"I am really pleased that my appeal was heard and I have been reinstated on to the podium programme," he said.
"I'm looking forward now and I'm back in training ready for a long season ahead of qualifying for the World Championships.
"Rio was an incredible competition for me and something I will always remember. I love the sport and it has given me so much in my life and I'm thankful to be in the position that I am in."
Athletes on the podium programme receive funding from UK Sport, and all athletes on the podium, potential and Para-potential squads get access to sports science and medicine services, advanced training camp and competition opportunities. They are also supported by British Swimming performance staff and National Institute of Sport programmes across the country.
Those not on the programme can still represent Great Britain at major international competitions - if they reach the qualifying standards.
