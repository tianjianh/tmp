Esther Hartsilver, 32, was injured in the crash on Denmark Hill on Thursday morning.
Ms Hartsilver, a senior physiotherapist, was taken to King's College Hospital, where she was a member of staff but died later, police said.
She is the sixth cyclist to die on London's roads this year. All have involved HGVs.
Later in the day, in east London, a unicyclist was hurt in a collision with a bus. Bystanders tried to lift it off him after he became trapped underneath.
The crash, involving a number 212 bus, happened in Walthamstow just before 18:00 BST on Thursday.
Cafe owner, Sami Ullah, told London's Evening Standard: "There were so many people gathered there. There must have been about 50 to 100. They somehow managed to pull the bus away a bit.
"We were amazed - it was a heavy bus, a double-decker. Police were here straight away and they took over."
Police said no-one had been arrested in connection with the unicycle crash.
This was also the case with the accident in Denmark Hill, where the lorry driver stopped at the scene.
Other cyclists who have died in London so far this year are:
Last year, Transport for London said it would cut the number of lorries on the roads during peak hours and test equipment on buses to help drivers spot cyclists.
Plans to build two new cycle superhighways, stretching from east to west and north to south London, were given the go-ahead in February.
