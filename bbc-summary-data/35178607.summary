Scottish explorer Luke Robertson has been speaking to the BBC about spending Christmas alone as he walks to the South Pole.

He hopes to be the first Scot to trek solo and unsupported to the pole. He would also be the youngest person from Britain - at age 30 - to do so.
Luke was inspired to undertake his adventure after undergoing brain surgery to remove a suspected tumour.
He said he is preparing to celebrate with a "Christmas breakfast for one".
Luke told BBC One's Breakfast programme: "It's about minus 35 degrees outside.
"Even though it's meant to be summer here, it's certainly like Christmas, that's for sure.
"I've just opened a few cards from friends and family, with some interesting gifts. I've got the stove on, ready to cook Christmas breakfast for one before venturing outside and getting my skis on."
During the venture, Luke has been raising money for Marie Curie.
Last year, when I was twenty eight, I had an operation to remove a suspected brain tumour - which turned out to be a cyst," he said.
"And when I was twenty three I had an artificial pace-maker inserted for complete heart block. So really this expedition is about hoping to inspire others to emerge stronger, and take the positives out of any challenging times.
"And I think this can apply to anyone and everyone. You know, we all go through rough patches in life. And I don't think you have to have my bizarre medical history behind you for this to be applicable."
Luke has completed 20 days alone. The experience of being alone, he insisted, has been largely positive.
He said: "I can see white, and I can see blue.  I can see a blue sky, so Santa's been nice to me.
"He's given me a blue sky for my Christmas skiing day... It's magnificent. I couldn't have hoped for a nicer Christmas really, to be honest."
While many people worry about putting on weight over the festive holidays, Luke is burning off about 10,000 calories each day.
He added: "I'm managing to lose quite a lot of the seventeen or eighteen kilograms I put on for this trip already.
