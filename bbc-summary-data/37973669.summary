John Greig, 51, from Auchinleck, East Ayrshire, was also convicted of raping a woman over a nine-year period and attempting to rape another schoolgirl.
He claimed all three victims were lying but was found guilty of the offences which took place between 1983 and 2003.
At the High Court in Glasgow, sentence on Greig was deferred until next year and he was remanded in custody.
Judge Lord Matthews also placed Greig on the sex offenders' register.
Greig was found guilty of raping the schoolgirl when she was aged between 9 and 11.
He was also found guilty of sexually abusing her and attempting to rape another schoolgirl when she was aged between 9 and 12.
Greig was also convicted of raping a woman when she was aged between 28 and 37.
During his trial, Greig accused all three women of lying and claimed the schoolgirl he raped went to the police years later because she was annoyed that he had refused to let her drive his car.
In evidence, Greig said of his victim: "She's a bit of a poser and wanted to pose in it. She asked to get it and I said no and I'm here in the High Court.
"I just can't believe they are doing this to me. I feel embarrassed and degraded. It is as if they are trying to destroy me."
He said that he never touched either of the schoolgirls and claimed that sex with the woman was consensual.
Prosecutor Mark McGuire asked Greig: "Is your explanation for this woman's allegations that you would not let her have your car," and he replied: "Yes."
Mr McGuire added: "You say all three women are liars. You must be the unluckiest man in the world," and Greig replied: "I must be."
Greig was caught after one victim contacted the police in 2015 and told them he had repeatedly tried to rape her when she was a child.
The schoolgirl he raped also later contacted police and gave a statement.
