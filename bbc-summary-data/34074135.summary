The former Liverpool and Stoke player, 32, has been a free agent since leaving Wigan at the end of last season.
"Because we have had a game every three days we haven't had enough training to test his quality precisely," Luzon told BBC London 94.9.
"He has a lot of experience. We will see and take a decision."
Pennant joined the Latics in February on a short-term deal and scored three goals in 13 outings as Wigan were relegated from the Championship.
The former Arsenal, Birmingham, Real Zaragoza and FC Pune City man was offered a new contract but decided to leave the DW Stadium.
Luzon has signed seven players so far this summer and could still strengthen his squad before the transfer window closes on Tuesday.
"We have time and if we have the chance, financially, to bring quality players to the squad, we will do it," he said.
