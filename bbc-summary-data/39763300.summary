On-loan Newcastle United goalkeeper Freddie Woodman has been lauded as a star of the future by interim Kilmarnock manager Lee McCulloch.

But only after the 20-year-old prompted his boss to give him a mention after the 2-0 win over Hamilton Academical.
"I always forget to mention the goalkeeper," said McCulloch. "He told me that after the game.
"He's a rising star and an under-20 international. It shows you the standard we have in the dressing-room."
Woodman, who has been capped by England at every level up to under-21s, pulled off two important saves from Dougie Imrie in the first half.
Combined with goals from Conor Sammon and Jordan Jones, it extended Kilmarnock's seven-year unbeaten run at New Douglas Park.
"His first save was brilliant," said McCulloch. "He's now got three clean sheets out of his last four.
"He made some great saves to stop Dougie Imrie, the header as well."
Woodman, who came through the Newcastle youth ranks, had previous loan spells with Hartlepool United and Crawley Town.
He has played 14 times for Kilmarnock since arriving in January and is keeping the experienced Jamie MacDonald out of the team.
"Jamie's training hard every day waiting on his chance and, to be fair, he knows Freddie has been on it the last few weeks," said McCulloch of the former Hearts and Falkirk 31-year-old.
