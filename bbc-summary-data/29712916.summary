US mid-terms: Southern Democrats run from Obama to survive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Louisiana is hot, humid and poor - in roughly that order - and all three facts are unmissable.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This poverty has become an issue in the mid-term election race that pits Mary Landrieu, a Democrat who's already been senator for 18 years, against Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy.
Ms Landrieu's supporters insist she has done a lot for poor families. Her opponents say it's not enough and she is just a lackey of President Barack Obama.
In fact, Mr Obama seems to be just as important a figure in this campaign as either of the candidates, and his name isn't even on the ballot.
