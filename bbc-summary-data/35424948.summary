British explorer Mark Evans completes desert trek

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British explorer Mark Evans has successfully crossed one of the world's most inhospitable deserts.

He was accompanied by Omani companions Mohammed Zadjali and Amer Al-Wahaibi.
The trio arrived on Wednesday in Doha, Qatar, after a 49-day trek on foot and by camel across 1,200 kilometres of Arabian desert known as the Rub' Al-Khali, meaning "The Empty Quarter".
They are the first people to complete this coast-to-coast journey, from Salalah in Oman to Doha, in 85 years.
They were following the route of an earlier British explorer, Bertram Thomas.
Mr Evans, 54, told the BBC the worst part was negotiating 250m-high dunes "like Alpine peaks" where their camels sank to their knees in the sand.
In a week that has seen the tragic death of another British explorer, Lt Col Henry Worsley, 55, after crossing Antarctica, this desert journey is a welcome piece of good news.
More than 1,000 well-wishers saw the team off in Salalah when they set out in December, carrying all the food they would need for the seven-week crossing.
Some accompanied the men for the first few kilometres and Evans said they were overwhelmed by hospitality from local tribes people in Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
"Twenty-eight goats, seven camels and three sheep have been slaughtered in our honour," he said.
Snakes and scorpions were frequently sighted and in southern Oman there was plentiful wildlife, which was all protected by law.
But once they crossed into Saudi Arabia, said Evans, there was almost no wildlife to speak of.
Just before halfway through, they reached towering sand dunes that left all three travellers dripping in sweat while the camels bellowed in protest, their knees sinking into the sand, and sometimes refusing to budge.
Throughout their journey their thoughts turned often to Bertram Thomas, who took 60 days to cross the sands with his Bedu guide. When he reached Doha in 1931 telegrams of congratulation poured in, including from King George V.
"Sometimes we went to wells that had been visited by both Bertram Thomas and [legendary British explorer] Sir Wilfred Thesiger," Mr Evans said.
The latter, who undertook a similar crossing in the late 1940s but did not reach as far as Doha, wrote in his book Arabian Sands of the extraordinary beauty and solitude of the desert.
He also complained that the discovery of oil had ruined the region.
He once told me that since it was now possible to drive across the desert in a 4x4 vehicle, "walking across it would be completely pointless".
That is clearly not a view shared by the trio who completed their crossing today.
"I have just sat in a chair for the first time in 49 days," Mr Evans added.
"We're about to have a big meal nowâ€¦ What a great adventure that was."
