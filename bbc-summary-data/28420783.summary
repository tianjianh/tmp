New Shrewsbury pool plans considered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new swimming pool could be built in Shrewsbury under proposals being considered by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The existing centre next to the Quarry park dates from 1864 and was last refurbished in 1994.
Shropshire Council is considering replacing it with a new 25m, eight lane pool, which could cost up to £8m.
Another option is to refurbish the existing facilities. Director of Commissioning George Candler said no final decision had been made.
He said the age of the current centre made it more expensive to run than new pools.
"We can't really stay with the status quo. Clearly we need to look at new facilities," he said.
"We believe a new pool would cost £5-6m, but we would want some additional facilities built on to that, so we estimate at this stage anything between £7-8m."
Another option is to build a new pool elsewhere in the town, with some people suggesting the Sports Village in Sundorne and a site adjoining the Battlefield incinerator as possible locations.
Mr Candler said council staff would now put together business cases for various sites, as well as other options.
A final decision in likely to be made in early 2015.
