Matt Doherty could make Republic of Ireland's Euro 2016 squad - Wolves boss Jackett

Wolves boss Kenny Jackett thinks defender Matt Doherty may still have an outside chance of making Republic of Ireland's Euro 2016 squad.

The 24-year-old Dubliner, who swept the boards with three trophies at Wolves' end-of-season awards night on Tuesday, is yet to be capped by his country.
But the former Under-21 was in Martin O'Neill's squad for the friendlies in March against Switzerland and Slovakia.
"It very much depends on the manager's thinking," Jackett told BBC WM.
"But the fact that he has been involved is a credit to him. It shows he is being thought of by Martin O'Neill and long may it continue."
O'Neill must name his squad for France by 31 May.
"It does seem as if maybe injuries would bring him in but he's earned that and I hope it works out for him," added the Wolves head coach.
"Looking back on his season, he can think positively, as he's shown he has the ability to play on either side, which is a strength, particularly for us when you're thinking the emergency loan window isn't available to us and he can be pleased with himself.
"Most importantly looking forward now, at 24 years old, he's got his best years ahead of him and hopefully his best years for Wolves."
Doherty was voted Wolves Player of the Season, Players' Player of the Season and also won the club's Goal of the Season award, for his long-range strike in the 3-2 win against Fulham in January.
Fit-again Wolves team-mate Dave Edwards is also a contender for one of the midfield berths in the Wales squad.
"Matt Doherty was a deserving winner of his three Wolves end-of-season awards. In a campaign that was largely unfulfilling for most concerned with the club, he established himself as a regular and dependable member of the defence.
"Moved from right to left-back for most of the second half of the season, Doherty appeared to have little trouble settling into his new position, adding life to Wolves' attacks. He was unlucky not to score more than the two goals he managed.
"Whether that form will have done enough to put the thoughtful young Irishman into his country's squad for the European Championships remains to be seen but, at 24, he has plenty of time ahead, and if his current progress continues such opportunities are sure to come his way eventually."
