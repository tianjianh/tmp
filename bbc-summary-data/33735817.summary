[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new vaccination programme for meningitis has been launched for teenagers in Scotland.

The ACWY vaccine was announced earlier this year in response to a rise in the number of cases of meningitis W.
It will be offered to students under 25 who are attending university for the first time this autumn, along with a catch-up programme for 14-18 year olds.
The new vaccine replaces the current one offered to freshers and teenagers in Scotland.
Those planning to go to university are asked to make an appointment at least two weeks before they go - or during freshers' week.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said that the vaccine also protected against meningitis A, C and Y.
"I would urge everyone who is eligible for the vaccine to make an appointment with their GP, or if they're still at school to take up the offer of the catch-up programme there," she said.
"They might be busy preparing to leave for university, working or enjoying their summer break, but a short appointment really could make an enormous difference to their future health."
The release of the ACWY vaccine follows advice from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation.
The chief executive officer of Meningitis Now, Sue Davie, said: "As a charity dealing with the consequences of the disease on a daily basis I would plead directly to parents across Scotland to make sure that their children get the Men ACWY vaccination.
"We are particularly concerned with those going to university in the autumn as they are at a higher risk from what has been called 'freshers' flu'."
