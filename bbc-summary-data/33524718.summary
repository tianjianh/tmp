[SN]TITLE[SN]
Murder accused 'in fear of violence' from PC Neil Doyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering Merseyside PC Neil Doyle and assaulting two other officers said he was "in fear of violence".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Football agent Andrew Taylor, 29, said he became fearful after the officer "went for him" and had to be "physically restrained".
PC Doyle died following an attack in Liverpool on 19 December.
Liverpool Crown Court was told the officer threatened to give Mr Taylor "a good hiding".
Mr Taylor told the court he caught his eye and approached him saying: "Evening officer, are you having a nice night?"
But he said it was "a term of endearment" and he did not know PC Doyle was a police officer.
Mr Taylor told the court he earned Â£40,000 a year as a football consultant at the Wasserman Media Group. He and his co-defendants Christopher Spendlove and Timmy Donovan, both aged 30, deny murder.
Mr Taylor said he had been at a work event in London on 18 December last year.
He travelled to Liverpool to meet Mr Spendlove and Mr Donovan, to celebrate Mr Spendlove's birthday.
He claimed PC Doyle became annoyed when he said "hello" as a joke and when he tried to shake his hand to diffuse the situation, he swore at him and had to be restrained by one of his colleagues.
He admitted hitting his two colleagues in self-defence, but said he did not strike the victim.
Describing police officers as "good people," he told the court he had "no issues" with them. The word "officer" had been used with friends in the month preceding the incident.
He had been: "quite surprised and confused" as to why PC Doyle became angry and swore at him.
Mr Taylor said had he known they were officers, he would have apologised.
But as he retreated, the PC was "physically restrained" by his friends and he "went for me," calling him: "a gobby little so and so or words to that effect."
Mr Taylor said he was in fear of violence and "the last thing I wanted [was] to get into is a fight, at any time." He said he was saying: 'I'll give you a hiding,' "words to that effect."
All three men deny murder, wounding with intent and causing grievous bodily harm.
The two groups came together outside the Aloha bar, arguing over who was in the wrong. Mr Taylor accepts he pulled PC Doyle's colleague Robert Marshall to the ground and punched him and that he struck Michael Steventon once in the face.
The trial continues.
