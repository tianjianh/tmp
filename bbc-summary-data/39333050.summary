The Football Association and the club have both launched inquiries after Blackpool boss Gary Bowyer was struck in his side's 3-1 win at Rodney Parade.
Gwent Police has confirmed an arrest was made and the boy has been bailed pending further inquiries.
It warned supporters they could face a ban from future matches.
Supt Glyn Fernquest, of Gwent Police, said: "The vast majority of supporters on Saturday were well behaved. We want all supporters to enjoy the game and part of that is making sure everyone behaves safely and legally.
"If any football-related arrest is made, the individual may be subject to a Football Banning Order application. Any banning order, if successful, will prevent individuals from attending football fixtures."
