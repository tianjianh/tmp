Captain Billy Godleman and all-rounder Shiv Thakor have signed new contracts at Derbyshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Batsman Godleman, 27, has signed a two-year contract, while Thakor, 22, has agreed a three-year deal.
Thakor has scored 606 runs at an average of 67, and taken 22 wickets at an average of 31, in nine County Championship matches this summer.
Godleman this week scored 100 against former club Essex - his third century in his last eight Championship innings.
He joined Derbyshire in 2012 after being released by Essex, while Thakor was signed from Leicestershire at the end of the 2014 season.
Head coach John Sadler said: "To secure Shiv's services for the next three years is brilliant for the club.
"He is a big player for us across all three formats and someone we can build our team around.
"He worked extremely hard over the winter and he's reaped the rewards this season.
"He has been brilliant and he is only going to get better and better."
