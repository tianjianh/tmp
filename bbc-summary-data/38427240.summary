The pacesetting Crues are six points clear of the inform Reds going into the Solitude showdown.

"It's the biggest game in the country bar a cup final or a league title winning match.
"You get the biggest crowds of the season at any ground and if you can't get up for it or not want to perform then you should hang your boots up and leave."
