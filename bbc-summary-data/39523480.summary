[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green booked their place in the National League play-offs with a well-deserved 2-0 victory over Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers shot out of the blocks as Christian Doidge struck a post inside the first couple of minutes and then Omar Bugiel's header from a corner was cleared off the line by Elliott Durrell.
Bugiel went close again in the 19th minute with a shot which looped over Alex Lynch and struck the bar via a big deflection, although the Chester keeper later made a great block to keep out a mazy run from Daniel Wishart.
Rovers finally went ahead in the 50th minute as Bugiel's through-ball was expertly finished by Doidge for his 25th goal of the season.
The hosts hit the frame of the goal for the third time midway through the second half through Kaiyne Woolery, but Liam Noble wrapped up a third successive win in the 74th minute when substitute Liam Noble curled home from distance.
