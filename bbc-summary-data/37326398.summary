[SN]TITLE[SN]
Falkirk 3-1 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals in the last two minutes gave Falkirk a crucial win to move them to within six points of Queen of the South at the top of the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dundee United defender William Edjenguele diverted a Myles Hippolyte effort into his own net before Lee Miller scored with a stunning header.
John Baird's fourth goal in three games gave the Bairns the lead on 18 minutes, with Tope Obedayi levelling.
Falkirk move up to fourth, overtaking United in the process.
A second league defeat means United are eight points adrift in the race for automatic promotion.
The Tannadice team's central defenders did not look too clever when Baird headed home the opener or a few minutes later when Bob McHugh nipped between them to send another Tom Taiwo cross onto the post.
The visitors were more impressive going forward though and a sweeping move ended with former Kilmarnock winger Obedayi bundling the ball in from close range on 33 minutes.
Those goals were the highlights of an entertaining first half where both sides created chances as they chased victory after early pace setters Hibs suffered an unexpected defeat earlier in the day.
Unfortunately, the realisation of the damage a loss of their own would inflict seem to inhibit their attacking verve for large spells of the second half.
Things picked up again in terms of goalmouth incidents as the match entered the final phase with David McCracken and Hippolyte going close to claiming a winner for Falkirk.
United always looked threatening with their pace on the counter attack but Peter Houston's side seemed to want it more towards the end.
A wicked cross from substitute James Craigan led to Edjenguele's own goal and Hippolyte picked out Miller with the perfect delivery as the hosts were rewarded for a storming finish.
To make matters worse for United, they lost Willo Flood through injury in the second half and the experienced midfielder is unlikely to recover in time for Tuesday's Betfred Cup quarter final away to Morton.
