A number of major supermarkets have recalled some products advertised as gluten-free, saying they may actually contain gluten.

Asda, Sainsbury's and Waitrose issued alerts, covering products including pitta breads, pizza bases and pancakes.
Genius, the specialist food company, has also recalled some of its gluten-free range.
But it said the risk to consumers was very low according to the industry standard.
In a post on its website, Asda said customers who had bought gluten-free pizza bases, garlic and coriander naan breads or white pitta breads with certain best before codes should return them for a refund.
"We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused and will ensure this doesn't happen again", it added.
The Sainsbury's alert applies to pizza bases, multiseeded and white pitta breads, sultana scones, garlic and coriander naan breads and syrup pancakes with certain best before dates.

The supermarket wrote: "As a precautionary measure, we are asking all customers who have bought these products to return them to their nearest Sainsbury's store, where they will receive a full refund.
"No other Sainsbury's products are affected by this issue, and we apologise for the inconvenience this may cause."
Waitrose said customers should return its own-brand gluten-free pancakes, pitta and scones with certain best before dates for a refund.
It said: "Any customers who have a reaction to gluten should not consume these products".
Genius said those allergic or intolerant to gluten should not consume its crumpets, Livwell Garlic Naan or Livwell Gluten Free Crumpets.
The company said the affected products had tested between 5-80 parts per million, the measurement used to test the amount of gluten in food.
Products which test between 21ppm and 100ppm are considered "very low risk, although not officially gluten free", it said.
It added: "If you are Coeliac or suffer from a wheat/gluten allergy and are showing signs of being unwell or a family member is showing signs of being unwell, please contact your local doctor for immediate advice.
"If you do not have Coeliac Disease or an allergy to wheat/gluten these products are safe for consumption."
