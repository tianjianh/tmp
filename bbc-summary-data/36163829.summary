Lambing season well under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four thousand lambs in three weeks - that's the challenge facing one County Antrim farmer.

Campbell Tweed is lambing 3000 ewes on his 1600 acre hill farm near Larne.
This is the business end of the birth season.
Thirty rams did their work months ago. Now it's up to the ewes.
They're mostly Easycare sheep - a low maintenance breed that doesn't need much help.
Most will lamb without assistance on the hills.
But some lambs will be lost - around 10% - to infection or hypothermia.
If they can get to them in time, Campbell's farm hands will fit them with protective plastic coats to give them a helping hand.
These lambs are mostly destined for the dinner table.
Some will be kept back for breeding stock.
But the bulk will be fattened up over the summer and by the end of August will be on the menu in homes and restaurants across Europe to where much of Northern Ireland lamb is exported.
Campbell hopes to get around Â£70 a head for them.
