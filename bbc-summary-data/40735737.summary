Road Policing Sergeant Rob Warnock said: "My thoughts, and that of my officers, are very much with the family and friends of the female who sadly died in this collision.
"Several people witnessed this incident and I am acutely aware that they, and others who assisted at the scene, have also been affected by the tragic circumstances.
"I would appeal to anyone who may have seen the crash or who may have seen either vehicle shortly beforehand and who hasn't yet spoken with police to do so to help us piece together exactly what happened."
