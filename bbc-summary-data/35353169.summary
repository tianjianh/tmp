Jibril Faris dragged friend Tony Chiem, nine, and his sister Karen, eight, from the living room at the St Mary's Drive property and dialled 999 on Friday.
All three were taken outside the house by Tony's mother, who was also inside.
West Yorkshire Fire Service commended Jibril's "quick-thinking actions" and issued safety advice on using the toy.
Jibril described the moment he saw the hoverboard burst into flames while it was charging.
"So much smoke started coming out. Then all of a sudden it went boom and exploded," the teenager said.
"My first instinct was to get out the door so I grabbed Karen because she's the youngest and I shouted 'Tony come on', so I grabbed them and I took them out."
Tony, whose family are now living with friends, said all his possessions had been obliterated.
"Everything in there was a good memory to me... now it's just burnt, all gone," the nine-year-old said.
The fire service said the teenager took the two children to an upstairs bedroom from where he called emergency services and followed instructions to stop smoke entering the room.
Mark Helliwell, from the fire service, said: "The teenager's quick-thinking actions are certainly commendable and he later said that he remembered the fire service advice given in his school talk in Year 5."
He said the fire "quickly took hold of the sofa and spread rapidly throughout the living room".
The fire service said it was difficult to confirm the exact cause of the fire, but it was "likely that lithium batteries in the hoverboard overheated and exploded or ignited".
