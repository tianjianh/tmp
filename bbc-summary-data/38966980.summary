Prosecutor Ann Evans said that after consulting the Maloney family, Thomas McCarthy would not face a retrial. The judge entered a not guilty verdict on the ABH charge.
During the trial, the jury heard of a "simmering feud" between two traveller families.
The court was told how McCarthy drove to the scene of the killing and saw Mr Maloney, who was 6ft 4in tall, attacking a BMW car with his parents and sister inside.
He drove into Mr Maloney and dragged his body in a circular motion over gravel.
McCarthy claimed he had no intention of striking Mr Maloney.
But Judge Michael Kay QC said: "Instead of swerving to avoid him or to brake you drove straight at him. You did not take any evasive action.
"This was a calculated, albeit split-second, decision to drive at Patrick Maloney because you were angry at him for attacking your parents' vehicles."
In a witness impact statement read, Mr Maloney's wife, Margaret, said: "I loved my husband with all my heart. He had a smile for everyone. He was everyone's friend. People said he was a gentle giant."
His son, also called Patrick, said his whole world fell apart when his father died in his arms. Referring to McCarthy in the statement he said: "You have ripped our lives apart. Nightmares wake me up at night."
