Asian markets were mixed on Friday after a lower finish from Wall Street and as investors await key US jobs figures later on Friday.

The figures may help determine whether there will be a US rate rise in December.
Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said earlier in the week that it was still "a live possibility" that rates would go up this year.
In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei index was up 0.42% at 19,198.13.
The index was given a boost as the yen weakened against the dollar, which is good for Japan's big exporters as it makes their goods cheaper to buy overseas.
The dollar was worth 121.74 yen in early Asian trade compared with 121.55 yen a day earlier.
Despite the weaker yen however, Toyota's shares opened lower in Tokyo trade after the firm reported a rise in second-quarter profits but trimmed its annual sales target.
Elsewhere, Chinese shares were mixed, with the Shanghai Composite up 0.45% at 3,539.25 , while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.81% at 22,859.39.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.27% at 5,207.00, while in South Korea the Kospi index was down 0.17% at 2,045.69.
