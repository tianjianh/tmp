A shopping centre in Cheshire has temporarily banned people with mobility problems because they may be unable to escape in an emergency.

The Grosvenor Shopping Centre in Macclesfield said it was not allowing entry to people who could not evacuate unaided via the staircases.
It follows a notice on Wednesday from the Cheshire Fire Authority, which said they had "serious" safety concerns.
A Grosvenor centre spokeswoman said they hoped to resolve the issue "soon".
"We apologise for any inconvenience this is causing to our valued customers," she said.
"We are working hard to resolve the challenges that have been brought to light by the Fire Authority, which require additional measures to be put in place within individual stores to ensure the safe evacuation of everyone, particularly those with mobility issues."
Simon Gibbins, from Cheshire Fire Authority, said they were not responsible for the decision to impose a ban, adding: "We have not prohibited people with disabilities from visiting the centre - we simply need the owners to satisfy us they have effective means in place to ensure the safe evacuation of everyone, particularly those with mobility issues."
He said the organisation had a "duty to ensure that businesses are not putting the public at risk of fire".
"We have been in extensive discussions with those responsible for this building since Christmas over our concerns and we will continue to work with them to resolve the matter and ensure that the building is safe for all groups of people."
