Captain Ellis, 35, and vice-captain Houghton, 27, have already led Hull to Challenge Cup glory this season, with the side now a win away from claiming the League Leaders' Shield.
Winger Solomona, 22, has scored a record 37 regular-season tries in 2016.
The winner will be announced before the Super League Grand Final on 6 October.
The Man of Steel is chosen by a poll of every Super League player and the award is named after ex-St Helens, Hull and Wakefield full-back Prescott, who was diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer in 2006 and died in 2013 at the age of 39.
Prescott raised more than Â£500,000 for charitable causes before his death.
The nominees for the Super League Young Player of the Year award are Wigan Warriors prop Ryan Sutton, 21, Wakefield Trinity Wildcats winger Tom Johnstone, 21, and 20-year-old back-rower Matt Whitley of Widnes Vikings.
