The Scots, who top their Euro 2017 qualifying group, host nearest challengers Iceland on Friday evening.
Midfielder Little, 25, recently won the BBC Women's Footballer of the Year award and is likely to play a key role for Signeul at the Falkirk Stadium.
"It is a really well deserved award for Kim," said Signeul, whose team have five wins from five in Group One.

"Every team in the world would like Kim Little in their team. She is such an ambassador for the game and she is a role model for all young girls in this country.
"She is an amazing player and person. She will be very important for us."
Signeul believes four points from the next two qualifying games will be enough to secure Scotland's place at their first major finals.
After facing Iceland, they will travel to play Belarus on Tuesday. Their final qualifier, away to Iceland, is in September.
Like Signeul's side, Iceland have a 100% record in qualifying, but the Scots have played a game more.
"It is a chance for us to show how good we are, a chance for us to qualify for the Euros," said Signeul.
"We have two games coming up. We need four points to actually qualify. That is what our aim is.
"If we win tomorrow against Iceland, that would be fantastic. However, re-focus, go to Belarus and win there and then we can relax a little bit.
"Iceland are a very strong team. They are physical, tactically very good like their men's team, and technically very good, so it will be a really tough game.
"However, we have a good squad. We have good players, who are also physically very good - maybe not as tall - but who are starting to get taller in the squad.
"I definitely think that we look very good."
