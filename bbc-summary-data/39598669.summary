[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who died in a boating accident in County Fermanagh has been named locally as Luna McKinney.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood that the 35-year-old mother of two, who had been living in Convoy in County Donegal, is originally from China.
Her husband, Stephen McKinney, is from Strabane in County Tyrone.
Police received a 999 call at about 01:15 BST on Thursday from Mr Mckinney who said his wife had fallen overboard near Devenish Island.
They believe Mrs McKinney may have slipped as she was securing ropes to a jetty.
Her body was recovered before 02:00 BST.
The couple's two children, aged 13 and 11, were asleep on board at the time.
Sinn FÃ©in's Liam Doherty, a councillor in Convoy, told the BBC that Mrs McKinney's death had come as a shock.
"The local people here, and the local shop owners who knew Luna and her husband Stephen, just couldn't believe it.
"Stephen is bearing up well but it's very tough on him," Mr Doherty said.
An investigation is under way and a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out.
Police believe the woman was not wearing a life jacket.
