Coleman, 46, guided his side to the semi-finals of Euro 2016, Wales' first major championship in 58 years.
Wales are unbeaten in 2018 World Cup qualifying and will end the year in 12th place in the Fifa world rankings.
Swansea-born Coleman received the award for his achievements in charge of the national team at the ceremony at Cardiff's Hoddinott Hall on Monday.
"We still pinch ourselves the Euros happened," Coleman said when he collected the award.
"I can't say reaching the semi-final was on our mind.
"We needed a little bit of luck, but the players deserve all the accolades, they handled the pressure and thrived in it.

"Now we are focused on the next challenge, which is the World Cup in Russia."
"This special award is a fitting accolade for a man who brought the nation together this summer," BBC Wales director Rhodri Talfan Davies said.
"None of us will ever forget how special it felt to follow the brilliant Wales team that Chris Coleman put together at Euro 2016.
"It will be a thrilling moment to see his exceptional achievements celebrated in style."
Sarah Powell, chief executive of Sport Wales, added: "Chris has provided inspiration to the people of Wales that has even transcended his team's sporting achievements.
"His fist-pumping passion, combined with his encouragement to dream, learn and strive for success have touched people across the nation.
"We will all remember the summer of 2016 for a long time to come. I am delighted we are able to recognise his contribution with this Special Recognition award."
The Wales Sport Awards is an event, organised in partnership by BBC Wales and Sport Wales. It aims to recognise the best achievements at elite and community level in Welsh sport.
