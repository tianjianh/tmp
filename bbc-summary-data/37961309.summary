[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uber has blamed a "banking error" for the late payment of hundreds of its drivers in Scotland.

The company said payments that should have been made to drivers on Thursday would not be available until at least Monday.
The app-based taxi firm apologised for the delay and thanked drivers for their "understanding".
The United Private Hire Drivers group said up to 1,200 drivers were affected by the issue.
In an email to drivers, Uber said: "Unfortunately due to an error from the bank that was just brought to our attention, your payment for this week will be delayed and we expect that you will receive it by the end of the day on Monday.
"Uber submitted the payment on time and we are working with the bank to ensure they are processing your payment reliably.
"We understand how important it is to be paid on time. You have our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused.
"We thank you for your understanding".
The issue resulted in angry scenes at Uber offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh, where the company has been operating since last year.
David Dunn, who has been working as a driver in the Glasgow area for the past 10 months, said the late payment was hitting many drivers.
He said: "It has significant consequences for all the drivers. If you do not get paid till Monday then that affects your standing orders, your bills. For some drivers it will mean they are unable to buy fuel to work this weekend.
"For a multi million pound company to make such a mistake is a disgrace. Was it the bank's fault? I don't know."
Mark Greenhalph of United Private Hire Drivers in Edinburgh said: "It's come as a great shock to drivers in Scotland that a company of Uber's size could miss payroll in this way and not be able to quickly recover the situation."
A spokesman for Uber said the issue had affected "a very small" proportion of drivers who used the company's app.
He added: "We immediately contacted the bank about this and they have already re-initiated the payments to arrive by Monday.
"We have contacted everybody affected to explain what has happened and offer our sincere apologies."
