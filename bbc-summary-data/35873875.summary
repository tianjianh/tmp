Coleman, whose current deal ends after Euro 2016, has discussed extending his, but says he and the Football Association of Wales are "apart" in their talks.
Ledley hopes the former Fulham boss will stay in charge for the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign.
"We want him to be here for many years to come," said Ledley.

"What he's done for us and the whole nation is remarkable.
"It's all new to us, but I'm sure something will be sorted sooner or later."
Wales continue their preparations for this summer's European Championships with a home friendly against Northern Ireland on Thursday, before visiting Ukraine four days later.
Coleman has said wives, girlfriends and family members will be banned from Wales' team hotel during the early stages of their Euro 2016 campaign.
Asked if he was happy with the decision, Crystal Palace midfielder Ledley joked: "Yeah, definitely, peace and quiet!
"We want to be in great shape and if that means sacrificing five weeks of your life then happy days.
"It's going to be a great one and I'm sure everyone will understand. It's a good decision from the manager."
Midfielder Joe Allen has started only three of Liverpool's Premier League games this season.
The former Swansea City player said: "The silver lining I guess in having not played that much this season is going into the Euros I'm hoping that I might have fresh legs and hopefully I can peak a bit later than a lot of other players."
The 26-year-old says his season "has been okay on a personal level, but then it has been incredible from a Wales point of view".
Allen added: "I'm not somebody who needs an extra incentive to go and work hard in training every day, but it has been great to have the knowledge that France was coming up in the back of my mind.
"I think for every player in the squad they have known what is waiting at the end of the season, and that's been amazing for everyone.
"It has made sure everyone has pushed themselves, and sub-consciously or not worked a little bit harder."
