Perseid meteors put on spectacular show over Northern Ireland

Wednesday night was billed as the perfect chance for sky watchers to catch sight of some meteors over Northern Ireland and it seems it did not disappoint.

The Perseid meteor shower appears in our skies every August and peaked overnight.
For once the weather played ball, with clouds clearing at just the right time.
That led to a spectacular show for those prepared to stay out to the early hours of the morning.
"I thought it was great because in previous years we've had moonlight or we've had totally overcast skies. So for me it was one of the best ones," Prof Mark Bailey of Armagh Observatory said.
"For me it really demonstrated two things - firstly the importance of going for it at the time of the maximum of the shower, because then you see two or three times more meteors than you would a day or two before or a day or two after and then choosing the year when the moon is well out of the way.
"So take those two things together and then the only thing is the weather and as it happened it cleared overnight."
The Perseids are pieces of Comet Swift-Tuttle; each August, the Earth passes through a cloud of the comet's debris.
The display was widely anticipated this year as the shower coincided with a new moon for the first time since 2007, creating a darkened sky.
"By the time I got to my home in the country it was very dark and clear and within about 10 or 15 minutes I saw another four or five fairly bright meteors," Prof Bailey said.
"So that was actually rather good - the shower had developed more or less as expected. Four or five meteors in 10 or 15 minutes - bright ones - is quite good going.
"That suggests it was the peak of the shower by about half past one in the morning."
He said a group of about 35 people including some children visited Armagh Observatory on Wednesday night to view the meteors.
"They loved it, they all enjoyed it. It had been so frustrating to see this low, thin cloud practically blocking everything out," Prof Bailey said.
"So, in a way, everyone was prepared to be disappointed and then right at the end, just before the time they would have had to leave, we decided to have one more look because we could see the skies were beginning to clear.
"They stayed for another half an hour until everybody had seen a meteor."
And what of that strangely co-operative weather?
"Clouds cleared across much of NI at some stage last night and as a result a lot of people were treated to an amazing display of meteor showers," BBC weather presenter Cecila Daly said.
"The International Space Station was also visible late on Wednesday evening and in some places the Aurora was on view. An exceptional night for stargazers.
"As a result of the clear night it also got pretty cold and so for anyone who stayed up all night with eyes peeled skyward it would have a been a chilly night and there may be some sore necks today."
The good news for anyone who missed Wednesday night's show is that the meteors will be visible again on Thursday night.
Weather permitting of course.
