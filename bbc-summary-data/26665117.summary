More than 500 buses, costing about Â£100m, are being bought by National Express for the West Midlands.

The vehicles will be equipped with low-emission engines and the latest CCTV systems, the company said.
The fleet will include a mix of double-decker buses and smaller vehicles.
National Express is buying 600 new buses in total across its UK division, but the "lion's share" would serve Birmingham, the Black Country and Coventry, spokesman Jack Kelly said.
The new British-made buses would provide better comfort for customers, he said.
"Inside they're going to have better climate control so they're cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter.
"Every bell and whistle you can have on a bus, these will have."
They would also have LED lighting inside, to ensure the back of the bus would be as light as the front, Mr Kelly said.
The first batch of more than 100 of the new buses is scheduled to be introduced in the region by the end of the year.
