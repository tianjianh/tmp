[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A graduate jobseeker has spoken of her horror at being called a "home-educated oddball" by a prospective employer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anna Jacobs read the description by Tecomak Environmental Services in an email inviting her for interview.
Attached seemingly by accident, the comments suggested Ms Jacobs, of Horsmonden in Kent, was "worth an interview if only for a laugh".
The company said it was investigating thoroughly but added the comments had been taken out of context.
Ms Jacobs told BBC South East Today she was initially excited to be invited for the interview for a position of office administrator.
But then she saw the "absolutely awful summary" and said she was "furious".
Below the formal invitation, the e-mail from Tecomak read: "Home educated oddball. Can't get a job since leaving uni. Forages for mushrooms.
"Difficult to assess from her CV - might be very good but equally could be a biscuit short of a packet or a left-wing loon tree hugger.
"Worth an interview if only for a laugh."
Ms Jacobs said she had a lot to offer and could not believe the firm was considering wasting her time for "a laugh".
So far, she said she has received no apology or explanation from Tecomak.
Employment lawyer Richard Atkins, said all jobseekers are entitled to equal treatment when applying for positions.
"On the face of it, this e-mail does not show that she has been treated with fairness and respect," he said.
