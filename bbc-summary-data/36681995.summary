My England XI: Sterling, Rooney, Hart and Cahill must make way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sorry Wayne, Joe, Gary and Raheem, but the BBC Sport audience have spoken - and you might not find this pretty reading…

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 100,000 of you picked your England team for the 2018 World Cup qualification campaign and captain Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Joe Hart and centre-back Gary Cahill do not make the starting XI.
But it is worse for Raheem Sterling, who is not among the 23 most popular players selected from the 64 available.
Instead, you have gone for youth, with Jack Butland in goal, and centre-back John Stones, midfielder Dele Alli and striker Marcus Rashford all drafted in.
England's campaign begins in Slovakia in September.
Based on the 11 most-picked players, it's definitely a back four say 90% of you, but after that it gets a little messy. Lots of you plumped for a 4-4-2 (45%), but there were plenty of variations beyond that too.
So we've gone with a 4-4-2, but with licence to go all Arsenal and interchange into a 4-3-3, 4-3-1-2 or whatever takes your fancy. It's your team, after all…
Based on the most popular players picked, Rooney is still in the squad, while there is a fair sprinkling of players who did not make Roy Hodgson's squad for France - Leicester City's Danny Drinkwater made 30% of your teams.
But, according to you, James Milner, Jordan Henderson and Ryan Bertrand should join Sterling on the outside of the squad looking in.
Goalkeepers (3): Jack Butland, Fraser Forster, Joe Hart
Defence (6): Chris Smalling, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Luke Shaw, Danny Rose, Gary Cahill
Midfield (8): Eric Dier, Dele Alli, Adam Lallana, Ross Barkley, Danny Drinkwater, Andros Townsend, Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere
Attack (6): Marcus Rashford, Jamie Vardy, Harry Kane, Daniel Sturridge, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck
It seems Michail Antonio's impressive 2015-16 campaign has turned heads as the West Ham player was in 12.87% of teams, making him the most popular choice among all the uncapped options on offer.
In the aftermath of England's Euro 2016 exit and Roy Hodgson's snap decision to resign, we asked the BBC Sport audience their thoughts on who the next manager should be.
More than 22,000 of you voted in our Sportsday service and of the 18 choices we gave you, former Three Lions boss Glenn Hoddle came out on top.
Hoddle, who managed England from 1996-1999, won 60% of his games in charge, a record which betters that of Hodgson, Steve McClaren, Sven Goran Eriksson, Terry Venables, Graham Taylor and Bobby Robson.
