Sale Sharks have appointed ex-England captain and British and Irish Lions prop Fran Cotton as their new chairman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Sale player Cotton, 69, spent time on the board in 2007 but has taken up his new position after Sale's takeover by investment company CorpArq.
Owner of CorpArq, Simon Orange, is confirmed as the Sharks co-owner along with Ged Mason who is chief executive at recruitment company Morson Group.
Director of rugby Steve Diamond also takes a position on a 10-man board.
Former Sale players Mark Cueto, Steve Smith and Mike Blood, along with Mike Ingall, Dermot Power and Jon Dorsett, who will be chief executive, will also work under Cotton.
They all met for the first time this week to discuss their plans for the future of the club.
