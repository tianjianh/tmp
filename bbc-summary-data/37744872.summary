Laverty's performance earned him two more championship points as he remained in 12th place in the series.
He will quit MotoGP at the end of the season and return to World Superbikes, competing on an Aprilia machine.
Crutchlow became the first British rider to win the Australian Grand Prix as he held off Valentino Rossi.
Marc Marquez, who has already secured this year's championship, crashed out while holding a big lead on lap 10 which allowed Crutchlow to clinch his second win of the season after his triumph in the Czech Republic.
Crutchlow finished over four seconds ahead of Rossi with Spain's Maverick Vinales completing the podium positions.
"It's nice to win one in the wet and the dry because people only think you can ride in the rain when you win in it," said the Englishman.
