A man has been charged with the murder of an antique dealer who was found dead at his Oxford home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adrian Greenwood, 42, was found in the hallway of his four-storey house in the city on Thursday. He had been stabbed in the chest and neck.
Thames Valley Police said officers had charged Michael Danaher, of Hadrians Court, Peterborough, on Tuesday.
The 50-year-old was remanded in custody and will appear before magistrates in Banbury later.
A 26-year-old man was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of murder but was later released without charge.
Mr Greenwood was an Oxford graduate who had written two historical biographies and traded rare and antiquarian books as well as art.
In 2011, he spoke to the BBC ahead of an auction of Banksy artworks in Oxford, where he sold a locked 1970s safe stencilled by the artist.
Mr Greenwood was also in the news in 2010 when his limited first edition of a Harry Potter book was stolen from an art gallery in Woodstock.
