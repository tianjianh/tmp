Rayo Vallecano deny match-fixing claims as La Liga investigates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rayo Vallecano have denied any wrongdoing after the Spanish league launched an investigation into suspicious betting patterns around Sunday's defeat by Real Sociedad.

The Madrid club's 2-1 loss took their chances of avoiding relegation out of their hands.
La Liga is investigating, as is routine with significant fluctuation in odds.
All their players, coach Paco Jemez and president Raul Martin Presa attended a news conference to defend the club.
Several newspaper reports claim some Rayo players are suspected of losing the game on purpose - with the odds on Sociedad winning wildly varying in the week leading up to the game.
But a club statement read: "In no instance will we allow the honour, integrity and professionalism of all members of our squad to be doubted, nor will we allow these reports to stain the good name of the club, the players or the fans."
