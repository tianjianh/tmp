Cambridgeshire Police were called at 01:45 GMT to the jail following reports of violence. A 25-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
A police investigation is under way at the category B prison, which is run by Sodexo and has both male and female inmates.
The arrested man is currently in custody at Thorpe Wood police station.
A Sodexo Justice Services spokesman said: "The next of kin have been informed and our thoughts are with the family.
"It would be inappropriate to comment further while the police investigation is under way."

HMP Peterborough is the only prison in the country to have men and women kept separately but on the same site, with the same senior management team and some staff moving between the two prisons.
The male side of the prison, which has space for 874 inmates, was inspected by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons in February.
It was described as "an impressive local prison with a positive staff culture" and praised for its excellent and innovative work to resettle prisoners.
It was criticised for having "too many men still locked up during the middle of the working day".
