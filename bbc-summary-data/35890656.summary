On-loan Reading full-back Andrew Taylor says he will "definitely look at" the opportunity to make a permanent move to the Madejski Stadium next season.

Taylor, 29, has started 14 Championship matches during his season-long loan spell from Wigan Athletic.
"Hopefully I can keep my place between now and the end of the season and then we'll sit down with my agent and see what's what," he said.
Taylor has competed for a place at left-back with Jordan Obita.
"I've enjoyed my time here and really taken to the players, staff and fans," he added. "If an opportunity came to stay, it's something I would definitely look at."
The former Cardiff and Middlesbrough defender says he has heard little from his parent club since making the move south.
"Nobody's been in touch with me from Wigan, apart from a few players I'm friends with," he said. "But, from staff-wise and above, nobody's spoken to me."
