The 43-year-old Mikron Theatre company is stopping in Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire.
Artistic director Marianne McNamara said: "We perform to an average of 100 people a night, it is fabulous."
Monday evening's performance near Southam, Warwickshire, celebrated one hundred years of the Women's Institute.
The company of five live on the boat and perform six nights a week for six months of the year.
