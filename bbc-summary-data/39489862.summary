[SN]TITLE[SN]
Firearms dealer who allegedly 'supplied bullets found at crime scenes' faces retrial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The jury has been discharged in the trial of a firearms dealer accused of making and supplying homemade bullets used in fatal shootings by criminal gangs in the 2011 riots.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Edmunds, of Hardwicke, Gloucestershire, has denied conspiracy to supply firearms and ammunition.
Prosecutors said he used his "almost encyclopaedic" knowledge of firearms laws to smuggle hundreds of guns.
Jurors were discharged after failing to reach a verdict.
A retrial has been ordered at Birmingham Crown Court for the autumn.
