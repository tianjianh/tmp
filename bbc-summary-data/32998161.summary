Medical bodies criticise 'unsustainable' NHS targets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Medical and nursing organisations have united to attack the "unsustainable culture" of targets in the NHS.

Two professional bodies have also called for a "bold and visionary" approach to ensure the health service is "fit for purpose".
The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties in Scotland and the Royal College of Nursing Scotland said tough spending decisions were required.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said substantial improvements had been made.
"Targets" is one of four areas in which the health professionals said a new approach was needed.
A joint statement by the royal colleges said: "The current approach to setting and reporting on national targets and measures, while having initially delivered some real improvements, is now creating an unsustainable culture that pervades the NHS.
"It is often skewing clinical priorities, wasting resources and focusing energy on too many of the wrong things.
"As a matter of urgency, there needs to be a more mature approach to how the NHS uses targets, standards and other performance measures to ensure better and sustainable outcomes across the health service."
The royal colleges also called for a "frank debate" about the pressures the health service is under, new models for delivering care to ease pressure on hospitals and improved collaboration between health professions.
RCN Scotland director Theresa Fyffe said: "Tinkering around the edges and simply putting more and more money into the current system is not the answer."
She said a public debate needs to take place about the future of the NHS.
Academy chairman Ian Ritchie said: "We're seeing day in, day out the immense pressure which the NHS is under as patient demand and public expectations soar, and funding is unable to keep up, even with increases in the NHS budget."
Ms Robison insisted the Scottish government had delivered record staffing and funding.
The health secretary also highlighted plans to integrate health and social care to shift the balance from hospitals to the community.
She said: "While we must consider the future of our health service, we should not lose sight of how far we've come.
"Substantial improvements under this government have led to historically-low waiting times, large reductions in MRSA and C. diff rates in our hospitals, and delivery of some of the most high-quality and safe healthcare anywhere in the world.
"But we fundamentally agree with the proposition that we need to change and evolve our health and social care services to meet rising demand, tackle health inequalities and meet the challenges of an ageing population."
The Liberal Democrats said the concerns were a reflection of "eight years of inaction" by the SNP government.
The party's health spokesman Jim Hume said: "The facts are that the crisis in our A&E units continues, hospital beds continue to be cut and NHS staff do not have the resources they need to meet demand."
Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Jenny Marra said: "On a range of measures from A&E waiting times to delayed discharge and key clinical tests, it is clear our NHS is on the brink of being overwhelmed by demand if it is not already.
"Scottish Labour supports the calls of the experts today to have a public debate on our health service. The Scottish government cannot continue to ignore these warning signs about our health service."
