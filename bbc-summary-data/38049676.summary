[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge United and Wycombe are investigating alleged racist abuse towards Chairboys striker Adebayo Akinfenwa during their League Two game.

Cambridgeshire Police also confirmed its officers are investigating.
Akinfenwa, 34, reported the alleged incident to referee Trevor Kettle, who has included it in his report.
The clubs are now working together to investigate the events at Cambs Glass Stadium and will take "appropriate action" against those involved.
Wycombe won Saturday's game 2-1 through a 95th-minute goal from Aaron Pierre.
Akinfenwa tweeted afterwards: "Good three points, but it's a shame that a small group of Cambridge fans focus on colour rather than the game. #KickoutRacism."
