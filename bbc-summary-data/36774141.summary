Mason Caton-Brown's hat-trick of tries gave Salford victory over Widnes in a pulsating Super League contest.

Salford went six points ahead on three separate occasions, but were pegged back each time by the Vikings.
A Josh Jones try and two Gareth O'Brien penalties stretched Salford's lead to 10 points, before Corey Thompson's score for Widnes set up a tense finish.
However, Caton-Brown dived over with two minutes remaining to seal a third win for Salford over Widnes in 2016.
Hull KR's loss to Hull FC on Thursday meant Widnes were already guaranteed a top-eight spot, while Salford are unable to finish any higher than ninth.
Caton-Brown's opener was cancelled out by the first of Matt Whitley's two scores for the home side, while Justin Carney and Patrick Ah Van swapped tries to make 12-12 at half-time.
The pick of Salford's five touchdowns was Caton-Brown's second, the former London Broncos man finishing a move that started on halfway with Robert Lui's superb offload, only for Whitley to level again.
After the Red Devils had gone 26-16 up, Thompson's try came while both sides were down to 12 men, with Jack Buchanan of Widnes and Salford's Craig Kopczak both in the sin-bin following a scuffle.
But Caton-Brown had the final say, powering over in the corner to complete his treble in the closing seconds.
