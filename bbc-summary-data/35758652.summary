[SN]TITLE[SN]
Terror accused 'wanted to carry out aid work'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of making preparations to travel to Syria to fight for so-called Islamic State simply wanted to carry out aid work, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shazib Khan, 23, told Kingston Crown Court he was moved by the plight of innocent civilians.
Mr Khan said he told friends he wanted to help "by any means" but he meant by providing money and food not violence.
He and nephew Junead Khan, 25, both from Luton, deny engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts.
This is alleged to have happened between 1 August 2014 and 15 July 2015.
A series of messages exchanged between Shazib Khan and friends on WhatsApp in early 2014 were read to the court.
In one, he said there was more to be done for the people of Syria than pray, suggesting they should "get out there and help".
He also said: "I want to go abroad and help the brothers and sisters by any means."
Asked by defence counsel Michael Ivers QC if this meant fighting, Mr Khan replied: "No."
He told the jury: "I never had a physical fight in my life. The closest I get is computer games."
Junead Khan also denies making preparations for attacking military personnel in the UK between 10 May and 14 July 2015.
The trial continues.
