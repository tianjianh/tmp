Carrick, 35, joined the Old Trafford side from Tottenham in an Â£18.6m deal in 2006 and has played 458 games in all competitions, scoring 24 goals.
"I am delighted that my journey with this great club is going to continue," Carrick told the club's website.
Carrick, whose contract was coming to an end in June, has a testimonial on 4 June.
Manager Jose Mourinho said: "I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Michael over this past season.
"Not only is he a great footballer, he is also a fantastic human being and a great role model to our younger members of the team."
The former England international has won five Premier League titles, the Champions League, Europa League, an FA Cup and two League Cups during his time at United.
His side will be playing Champions League football again next season after winning the Europa League with a 2-0 victory against Ajax on Wednesday.
Carrick added: "What a fantastic way to finish off the season, with a new trophy in our cabinet. I am thrilled that the fans will also get to see our shiny new Europa League trophy on 4 June."
