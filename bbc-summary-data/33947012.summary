Uber taxi app 'disastrous' for cab drivers' families

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Taxi-booking app Uber would have a "disastrous" impact on cab drivers' families if it brings its business to the capital, a union has claimed.

The company has advertised two Cardiff-based positions, prompting concern from the GMB, which represents professional drivers.
Uber calls itself "fully licensed" and connects those needing a cab with a background-checked private driver.
It said there was a "huge demand" for the service in the city.
But Steve Garelick, branch secretary of GMB, said: "It is hard to justify adding more drivers to the streets of Cardiff without wondering what effect this will have on existing drivers.
"Rates will potentially fall which may benefit the consumer but will have a disastrous effect on families of established drivers and in the longer term all drivers.
"Quality of life for drivers is key and safety of the public is imperative. A driver who has to work excessive hours without any checks in place is a danger to all."
Uber, a San Francisco start-up company, has created jobs in Cardiff for an operations coordinator and an operations and logistics manager. It typically takes 20% of the fee from its drivers.
It was recently valued at Â£32bn ($50bn) and is the most-funded start-up in the world.
But it has been banned in a number of cities and countries around the world, including Spain, Thailand, several Indian cities and faces partial bans in Germany and the Netherlands.
An Uber spokesman said: "In the last year alone over 25,000 people have downloaded and opened the app in Cardiff, as such we're aware there is huge demand for our award winning service in the city.
"We believe we can add value to any city and compliment the existing transportation network.
"Safety is Uber's number one priority and all partner-drivers in the UK are fully licensed and insured private hire drivers.
"Not only is Uber the most convenient way to get around, we also believe it's one of the safest."
