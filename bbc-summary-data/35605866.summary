A grainy black and white image of a migrant passing a baby under a barbed wire fence from Serbia into Hungary has taken first prize in the 2015 World Press Photo awards.
Taken at night on 28 August last year by Australian photographer Warren Richardson, this man and child were part of the movement of people seeking to cross into Hungary before a secure fence along the border was completed.
"Early on we looked at this photo and we knew it was an important one," says Francis Kohn, chair of the jury.
"It had such power because of its simplicity, especially the symbolism of the barbed wire," Mr Kohn, who is also photo director of Agence France-Presse, added.
"We thought it had almost everything in there to give a strong visual of what's happening with the refugees. I think it's a very classical photo, and at the same time it's timeless."
The World Press Photo awards have been running since 1955. This year, 41 photographers from 21 nationalities were awarded in eight categories.
Sergey Ponomarev, for The New York Times, won first prize in the General News (Stories) category for "Reporting Europe's Refugee Crisis" which included this image of a man in Tovarnik, Hungary, attempting to board a train headed to Zagreb, Croatia.
Mauricio Lima, also for The New York Times, won the General News (Singles) prize for this next image.

In Shanxi, China, men pull a tricycle in a neighbourhood close to a coal-fired power plant. The photo taken by Kevin Frayer won first prize in Daily Life (Singles).

On Sydney's Bondi Beach in Australia a massive "cloud tsunami" looms in Rohan Kelly's photo, winner of the Nature (Singles) category.
