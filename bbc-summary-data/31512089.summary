The government has approved plans for what is believed to be one of the world's largest offshore wind projects.

Dogger Bank Creyke Beck A and B would be built 77 miles (125km) off the Yorkshire coast.
Forwind Ltd said it would consist of 400 wind turbines producing up to 2,400 MW of electricity, enough to power nearly two million homes.
Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said the development had the potential to support hundreds of jobs.
Mr Davey said: "Making the most of Britain's home grown energy is creating jobs and businesses in the UK, getting the best deal for consumers and reducing our reliance on foreign imports.
"Wind power is vital to this plan, with Â£14.5bn invested since 2010 into an industry which supports 35,400 jobs."
Forewind said it believed the project could generate between 4,000 and 5,000 direct and indirect jobs.
The offshore farm would connect into the national grid at an existing substation at Creyke Beck, near Cottingham, East Yorkshire, the developers said.
The company has already spent Â£60m on initial surveys and planning.
Construction on the site is expected to start in 2019.
