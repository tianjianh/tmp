Corrie Mckeague, who is based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds following a night out.
CCTV suggested the 23-year-old briefly slept in a doorway before getting up and moving on, possibly intending to walk home several miles away.
Suffolk Constabulary said he was reported as missing on Monday afternoon.
The RAF said it would not "speculate" on the case and has appointed an officer to support his family.
A statement added: "We can confirm that a RAF serviceman from RAF Honington is currently missing, our thoughts are with his family at this very difficult time.
"The civilian police has primacy in this matter and we understand that the investigation is ongoing.
"It would not be appropriate for the [Ministry of Defence] to comment or speculate on the case at this time."
Mr Mckeague was wearing a light pink shirt and white jeans when he was last seen in Brentgovel Street at about 03:20 BST.
The National Police Air Service helicopter has been assisting with searches in the area.
Police are asking anyone who may have seen him to contact them.
