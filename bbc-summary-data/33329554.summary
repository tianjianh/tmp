Philip Spriggs, 51, from Oxford, was found guilty of a total of 20 charges including 11 counts of rape, sexual assault and making indecent photos.
Oxford Crown Court was told the offences took place in Headington over seven years between 2007 and 2014.
Thames Valley Police praised his victims for being "brave" and "speaking out".
Spriggs was given an additional seven years on licence and placed on the sex offenders' register for life.
Det Sgt Tracey Shepherd said: "The victims in this case have been very brave at speaking out against their abuser.
"They can now begin to rebuild their lives knowing they do not have to suffer further abuse."
Spriggs, who was arrested and charged last October, was found guilty of 20 charges following a trial in April.
The charges were 11 counts of rape, two counts of assault of a child under 13, one charge of attempted rape, two charges of sexual assault of a child under 13, two counts of causing a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, one charge of assault by penetration, and one count of making indecent photos.
