A widow's family has captured the moment she was presented with a teddy bear containing the final recording of her late husband's voice.

Jean Walters' husband Den left a final message on the device before his death from cancer 11 years ago.
But the recording, which had slowly deteriorated over the years, eventually stopped working last month.
Through an online appeal, her family tracked down the original manufacturer, which managed to fix the bear.
When it is squeezed, the bear plays a greeting which says: "I think you are the best girl in the world for me, love Den".
Mr Walters used the message at the end of letters he sent to his wife when he was in the army.
Mrs Walters, 83, who has dementia, said it "broke her heart" when the sound box stopped working.
"Even though 11 years have gone by, it was like he never left me", she said.
Mrs Walters' granddaughter Abbie Webb said: "Having the bear is something which gives her a reminder of him and something about hearing his voice sparks that little bit more.
"When she is having a bad day with her dementia it really helps...hearing something that she heard for many, many years in a row was a comfort to her."
Ms Webb, from Bristol, said they were "utterly devastated" but "got to the point where we though we would have to give up".
After a social media appeal, Ms Webb found the original manufacturer and they agreed to try and restore the voice.
"We then got the most amazing news that the bear had started talking again", she said.
Mrs Walters said: "I think Den's still there sometimes...it's a bear but he's lovely."
