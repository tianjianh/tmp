[SN]TITLE[SN]
NHS fraud doctor Anthony Madu must repay £75,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gynaecologist who defrauded the NHS by working for other health boards while suspended must repay £75,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Madu, 47, of Woolwich, London, must pay the money within six months or face two years in prison.
In October 2014, he was found guilty of six counts of fraud relating to his time at Cardiff and Vale health board.
Cheryl Hill from NHS Counter Fraud Service (Wales) said: "Dr Anthony Madu defrauded the NHS of money which should have been spent on patient care."
Madu was given a confiscation order of £75,620.73 at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday.
In December 2014, Madu was given a two-year sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 150 hours of community service.
He was suspended and put on extended leave by Cardiff and Vale University Health Board in 2009 over allegations about his conduct towards other staff and claims he had falsified his training record.
From January 2010, he submitted sick notes on three different occasions, saying he could not work because of stress.
But Madu, who earned close to £100,000 a year, went on to do locum work worth about £69,000 with three NHS trusts in England while still earning more than £29,000 from his employers in Wales.
This secondary employment was never declared to his employer, as was legally required.
