The staff at Community Safety Glasgow (CSG), an arms-length council body, want better pay for shift work.
The union Unison said 19 members would take part in the action from 19:00 on Thursday until 19:00 on Saturday.
CSG said it had "business continuity plans in place" to ensure monitoring of Glasgow's CCTV network.
Unison Glasgow branch secretary Brian Smith said: "These members work 12-hour shift patterns, providing a 24-hour service every day of the year.
"Other workers in CSG and Glasgow City Council on similar shift patterns receive an additional annual payment of Â£7,500.
"It is just a question of equality and fairness."
CCTV operators staged their first 48-hour strike from 19:00 on Friday 4 March until 19:00 on Sunday 6 March.
A spokesman for CSG said: "Public safety is paramount and we have business continuity plans in place to enable us to continue to monitor the city's CCTV network."
