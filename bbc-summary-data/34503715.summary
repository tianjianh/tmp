The partner of the late motorcycle medic Dr John Hinds has said there could be no better legacy for her "incredible other half" than saving lives.

Janet Acheson was speaking at Stormont on Monday, at an event to promote a Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.
"John would be incredibly proud at the groundswell of support shown for this life-saving cause," she said.
Dr Hinds, 35, died as the result of a motorcycle crash in July.
He had been providing medical cover at a road racing meeting at Skerries, County Dublin, on 4 July. He was known as a "flying doctor" of Irish motorcycle sport.
Shortly after his death, his family announced plans to set up a charity to support his vision of a Northern Ireland air ambulance.
Last month, the then Health Minister Simon Hamilton said he was committed to establishing an emergency medical helicopter service in Northern Ireland.
At Stormont on Monday, Dr Acheson said: "The support for John's work - which he was so passionate about - has been humbling, at times overwhelming, but most of all inspiring. It has also given us strength through some very tough days."
A helicopter emergency medical service should be funded by government in the long term, she said. It should also be based in the Greater Belfast area.
"A properly structured helicopter emergency medical service will make a lasting difference to the people of this country," she said.
Among those at Stormont was Shaun McCann, 7, who suffered a life-threatening head injury as a result of a fall at his County Roscommon home.
Dr John attended the scene along with the air ambulance team from Roscommon.
"Doc John provided Shaun with a general anaesthetic and placed him in an induced coma to protect his brain," said Ms Acheson.
"He provided mobile intensive care level support whilst Shaun was being flown to a hospital with the specialities necessary to deal with his injuries.
"Shaun made a full recovery and two weeks ago welcomed his baby sister, Alana, to the family. But things could have been different.
"Without a pre-hospital doctor, delivered to his home in a timely fashion, Shaun would not have received this intervention until he reached hospital, meaning if Shaun had survived at all, he was unlikely to be the Shaun we have before us today.
"Without an air ambulance Shaun's family would be marking a very different anniversary on 14 July each year."
She urged everyone to do everything they could to make her partner's dream a reality.
A few weeks before he died, Dr Hinds and the leader of the Traditional Unionist Party (TUV), Jim Allister, met with the then health minister Simon Hamilton to discuss the issue.
Dr Hinds was originally from Portaferry, County Down.
He was a consultant at Craigavon Area Hospital, County Armagh, but also volunteered as a motorcycling medic on Ireland's road racing circuit.
