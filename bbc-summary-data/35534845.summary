Champions Glasgow led 5-3 at the break through Lee Jones' early try and Ruan Pienaar replying with a penalty.
Callum Black, making his 100th appearance for Ulster, scored his first try for the province after 53 minutes.
Paddy Jackson's conversion and penalty put Ulster 13-5 ahead before Taqele Naiyaravoro's injury-time try gave the visitors a losing bonus point.
Glasgow finished with 14 players after number eight Ryan Wilson was sin-binned for a dangerous tackle in the 71st minute.
In a fast-paced game, Ulster dominated territory in the first half but coughed up seven turnovers, several in the red zone with the try-line beckoning.
Ruan Pienaar shanked an easy chance to put Ulster ahead, missing a seventh minute penalty in what was his first kick at goal in this season's Pro12 campaign.
After their well-worked try, Glasgow spent long spells on the back foot with the pace of Craig Gilroy and Paul Marshall causing problems.
Gilroy made a great outside break after Stuart Olding carved the visitors open from inside his own 22 before Ali Price made a try-saving tackle.
Paul Marshall, an early replacement for Pienaar who was forced off with suspected concussion, thought he scored five minutes before the interval but was judged to not have grounded the ball.
The defending champions, who won the title on this ground last year, were missing 10 frontline players away on Six Nations duty with Scotland and had only won once away from home this season in all competitions.
Both teams started with inexperienced players at fly-half and Gregor Hunter missed a chance to extend Glasgow's lead with a missed penalty in the 48th minute.
Sam Windsor made his first start for Ulster at 10, but Paddy Jackson was introduced at the break having been released from the Ireland training squad on Thursday and controlled the shape of Ulster's play in the second half.
There were lots of opportunities for the backs to get their hands on the ball in a fast-paced game and yet another break and off-load by Gilroy carved out the all-important try for Ulster.
In the 10th phase after Gilroy's initial break, Black bundled over from close range and Jackson added the extras, and later added a penalty to stretch Ulster's lead.
Glasgow grabbed an all-important losing bonus point when Taqele Naiyaravoro gathered a crossfield kick to score in the corner.
