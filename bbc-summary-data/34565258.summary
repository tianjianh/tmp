New South Wales Police said he swimming alone at Sydney's South Curl Curl Beach at about 19:00 local time on Saturday after fishing with a friend earlier.
Emergency services searched the area overnight and a sea search involving police divers resumed on Sunday.
Police said his last known address was in Manchester and they had contacted his family.
Insp Susan Preston, of New South Wales Police, said the man had only been in the country for a week.
"So we also have the concern that perhaps he's gotten out of the water at some point, not knowing where he's gone and perhaps is wandering around the local area," she said.
The UK Foreign Office confirmed a Briton had been reported missing in Sydney.
"We are in contact with local police and providing consular assistance to family," a spokesman said.
