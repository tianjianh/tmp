Inverness friends complete Kyrgyzstan expedition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six friends, five of them from Inverness, have completed a month-long expedition climbing in Central Asia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group set out to explore poorly documented areas of the Djenghi-Djer mountain range in southern Kyrgyzstan.
Calum Nicoll, 25, Struan Chisholm, Sam Newmark, Neil Smith, who are 24, and Sandy Fowler, 23, are from Inverness, and Mark Chonofsky, 24, is from Boston.
The six opted to travel through the region on horseback and made a journey of 50 miles (80km) using 10 horses.
Often expeditions in the area involve travel by helicopter or 4x4 vehicles.
Their expedition in July was supported Christopher Ward Challengers Programme.
