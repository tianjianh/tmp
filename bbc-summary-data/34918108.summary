John Terry injury: Jose Mourinho blames 'dangerous pitch'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho blamed a "dangerous" pitch for the ankle injury which is expected to prevent captain John Terry from playing in Sunday's match at Tottenham.

Terry, 34, was carried off on a stretcher in the 72nd minute of Chelsea's 4-0 win at Maccabi Tel Aviv.
"The surface was bad and dangerous," Mourinho said.
"For John to leave the pitch with the score at 1-0, I know already that he is in trouble."
Mourinho lost midfielder Ramires to an injury sustained while training at the Sammy Ofer Stadium in Haifa on Monday and criticised the "very bad" pitch before Tuesday's match kicked off.
The surface appeared to cut up heavily throughout the game, with Mourinho replacing a large divot near his technical area at one point.
"My medical department is really good. John is a special guy, with a special desire to recover," Mourinho said.
"But I don't believe too much that he can play (against Spurs). Ramires slid on the pitch and had a muscular injury."
Terry will have a scan on his injury later this week.
