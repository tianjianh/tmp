Prince Charles received numerous presents for his grandchildren, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, during his travels, including a baby rattle, booties, and giant lollipops.
Gifts to the Queen included a bag of salt from the British Virgin Islands.
The items have been named in a list of official gifts given to royals.
Prince Charles received what was one of the year's more unusual gifts - a packet of fairy dust - when he and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, visited New Zealand in November.
Other gifts given during the trip included an organic wool hat, and a vest and blanket for Charlotte.
David Carter, the speaker of the New Zealand parliament, also presented the royal couple with a woollen poncho for Charlotte and a woollen tank top for George.
The Queen was given a marzipan Brandenburg Gate - one of Berlin's most important monuments - from Germany's president, Joachim Gauk.
She also received a black handbag from the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and a framed watercolour of Villa Guardamangia - her former home in Malta.
Other gifts she received during 2015 included a bag of salt from the governor of the British Virgin Islands.
The 1lb bag is given to the British monarch every year as rent for Salt Island - one of the islands in the Caribbean archipelago.
US first lady Michelle Obama gave the Queen a Tiffany sterling silver honeycomb and bee bud vase, as well as a gift box containing lemon verbena tea, a candle, two small pots of honey and a jar of honey butter from the White House Kitchen Garden.
Official gifts can be worn and used, but are not considered the royals' personal property and the royals do not pay tax on them.
They can eat any food they are given, and perishable official gifts with a value less than Â£150 can also be given to charity or staff.
Gifts cannot be sold or exchanged and eventually become part of the Royal Collection, which is held by the Queen for her successors and the nation.
