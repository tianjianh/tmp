Alexander Perepilichnyy, 44, collapsed and died in the road in Weybridge, Surrey on 10 November 2012.
A pre-inquest hearing last week was told he may have been poisoned.
Hedge fund boss Bill Browder said it was possible a "murderer may be running around".  Surrey Police said it would co-operate with the coroner.
The hearing into Mr Perepilichnyy's death was told new toxicology information showed a potential marker for a rare poison called Gelsemium elegans in his body.
A full inquest is due to take place in Woking on 21 September.
Mr Browder, CEO of London-based Hermitage Capital Management, said Mr Perepilichnyy gave information to his organisation about the Sergei Magnitsky affair.
Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage, died on remand in a Moscow prison in 2009 after uncovering an alleged $230m (Â£150m) tax fraud involving Russian government officials.
Surrey Police said in 2013 Mr Perepilichnyy's death was not suspicious and he was believed to have been running before he collapsed.
"He was co-operating against dangerous people," said Mr Browder.
"He thought there was a contract out on his life and now they have found poison in his stomach.
"They absolutely should reopen the investigation and if they don't it seems to me you have a murderer running around having got away with murder."
Surrey Police said the case was handed over to HM Coroner in June 2013.
"Following the hearing, the coroner asked for some additional work to be carried out to seek clarification on some areas.
"Surrey Police will continue to co-operate fully with the coroner.
"The Surrey Police investigation is not on-going at this stage. We would only act further if directed to do so."
