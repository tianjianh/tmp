With Islamic State (IS) militants destroying Palmyra's ancient temple of Baalshamin, the world's eyes are again focused on what may happen to the Unesco world heritage site.

IS closed in on the site in May having previously demolished ancient sites in Iraq that pre-date Islam, including Hatra and Nimrud.
Last week, it emerged that Khaled al-Asaad, the archaeologist who looked after Palmyra's ruins for 40 years, had been beheaded by IS.
Syria's director of antiquities Maamoun Abdul Karim said he had refused to say where treasures had been hidden to save them from destruction.
Palmyra contains the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world. Millions have visited the site and have contacted the BBC to tell us how much it means to them.
