Wales National Survey: Big variations in how councils are seen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in Wales are generally happy with public services but there are big regional variations in how they rate the performance of local councils, a national survey has suggested.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The research found 90% were satisfied with their GP care and 91% with their last NHS hospital appointment.
But only 24% of adults in Blaenau Gwent agreed their council provided high quality services, the lowest figure.
Conwy performed best on that measure - 61% said services were high quality.
Ceredigion was next with 58% and Cardiff 57% in figures released in the latest National Survey for Wales.
Authorities following Blaenau Gwent in scoring badly on how their services were perceived included Anglesey, where 34% said they were high quality, Powys 35%, and Merthyr Tydfil 38%.
The survey was conducted by the Office for National Statistics for the Welsh Government.
On health matters, 87% of respondents said they were satisfied with emergency ambulance services, but that figure had fallen from 90% in 2014-15.
Social care and support services were rated excellent or good by 70% of people, lower than for NHS services but similar to the figure recorded in the 2014-15 survey.
At a personal level, 47% of adults said they had a physical or mental condition expected to last a year or more and 33% stated their condition or illness limited their ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.
Around 59% said they had done some physical or sporting activity in the previous four weeks, with 34% of people saying they had walked more than two miles.
With education, 90% parents said they were satisfied with their child's primary school and 85% with their secondary school.
Asked about their local area as a whole, 72% said they felt like they belonged there and that people of different backgrounds got on well together, whilst 73% felt people treated each other with respect and consideration.
Those figures are lower than in 2014-15, when around 80% answered yes to those questions.
The survey found 17% of people in Wales to be lonely, using an internationally recognised scale of measurement.
Some 15% said they were materially deprived, meaning they could not afford to pay for basic needs such as keeping the house warm.
Around 66% said they had no difficulty keeping up with paying their bills and credit commitments, a big increase on the 48% figure in 2012-13.
The survey found 85% of adults were now using the internet, compared to 77% in 2012-13, and one in five said they could speak Welsh.
On environmental matters, 67% reported they were concerned about climate change - 21% were very concerned and 46% very concerned.
Around 93% believed the world's climate is changing, with 51% saying they thought it was either partly (51%) or mainly (37%) caused by human activity.
Some 9% thought climate change was prompted by natural processes and 2% did not believe climate change was occurring.
Around 97% said they were recycling to protect the environment and 47% reported they were reducing the amount of energy they used at home.
Buying more energy efficient appliances (41%) and locally produced food (39%) were other popular ways people said they were thinking of the environment.
10,493 interviews with adults aged 16+ were carried out between 30 March 2016 and 31 March 2016 by the Office for National Statistics.
