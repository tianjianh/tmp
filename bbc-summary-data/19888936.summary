Panama country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lying at the crossroads of the North and South American continents and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Panama is of immense strategic importance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This has made Panama the frequent object of US attention. The United States supported its secession from Colombia in 1903, and secured a sovereign zone in which to build the Panama Canal - which remained under US control from 1914 until 1999.
The US invaded Panama in 1989 to depose a former ally, military ruler Manuel Noriega, over his repressive rule and use of the country as a centre for drug trafficking.
Panama has the largest rainforest in the Western Hemisphere outside the Amazon Basin.
However, it is for a feat of engineering, the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, that Panama is famous. Every year more than 15,000 vessels make the eight-hour journey through the waterway, which makes a substantial contribution to the country's economy.
Population 3.6 million
Area 75,517 sq km (29,157 sq miles)
Major languages Spanish, English
Major religion Christianity
Life expectancy 74 years (men), 79 years (women)
Currency balboa
President: Juan Carlos Varela
Juan Carlos Varela came from behind to win the presidential election in May 2014.
Panama's vice-president and a former ally of outgoing president Ricardo Martinelli, Mr Varela won a clear majority and easily defeated the president's hand-picked successor, Jose Domingo Arias.
Mr Varela leads the conservative Panamenista Party and helped Mr Martinelli get elected in 2009. But the two had a bitter falling out in 2011, when Mr Varela was fired from his job as foreign minister. He subsequently became one of Mr Martinelli's fiercest critics, accusing his government of corruption.
Mr Varela, aged 50 at the time of his election, is the scion of one of Panama's richest families and studied engineering in the United States.
Panama's media are free to present news and comment.
According to Reporters Without Borders: "Panama stands out as an exception in Central America, which is notoriously dangerous. Cases of assaults against journalists are extremely rare."
