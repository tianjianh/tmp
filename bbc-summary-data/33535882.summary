[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unemployment has risen in Wales by 8,000 compared to the last quarterly figures, the latest statistics have shown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the March to May period showed a rise against the December to February numbers.
But an annual comparison showed there were only 3,000 more people out of work than in the same period last spring.
Unemployment has risen across the UK for the first time in two years.
The number of people classed as in employment, however, is up by 36,000 compared to 12 months ago, and 34,000 fewer people described as economically inactive.
