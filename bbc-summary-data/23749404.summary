The team won six medals, including three golds - Mo Farah (5,000m and 10,000m) and Christine Ohuruogu (400m).
Sprinter Adam Gemili, heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson and 1,500m runner Chris O'Hare also impressed.
"We can see where the future medals are coming from," Black told BBC Sport.
"I saw the disappointed look at Hannah England (fourth in the 1500m), Chris O'Hare (1500m finalist) killing himself and (800m runner) Jessica Judd really making progress. We've got a programme that can help develop medallists."
Gemili, 19, recorded the second fastest time by a Briton - 19.98 seconds - in the 200m semi-finals before finishing fifth in the final.
Johnson-Thompson, 20, took fifth in the heptathlon.
Paula Radcliffe, the 2005 world marathon champion, said she was also encouraged by the performances of the young members of the GB squad.
"I think there were 17 top-eight places," added the 39-year-old.
"I was especially impressed seeing Johnson-Thompson coming through. She's built such a great platform. The likes of O'Hare making a 1500m final - that's not happened in quite a while."
Meanwhile, Radcliffe does not believe that Farah will not choose to run the marathon in future major competitions. The double Olympic and world champion plans to compete in the London Marathon next year, having completed half of the distance in 2013.
"Mo will be trying the marathon, but won't be leaving the track," she continued.
"I wouldn't surprised if he ran the 1500m in the Commonwealths. He has the range and ability to do that. If you're a runner and British you will want to run the London Marathon at one stage.
"I reckon he'll come back and run faster on the track and produce times he is capable of."
Elsewhere, Usain Bolt, who won his eighth career world title on Sunday by leading the baton home for the victorious Jamaica 4x100m team, said his memories of the championships were "not the best".
The 26-year-old said his views were influenced by the fact the Luzhniki Stadium was not once full during the nine days of competition.
"I must be truthful, it's been a different championships," Bolt said. "It's not been the best. Over the days it got better.
"They changed a few things and people got more relaxed, more people started smiling and there were more people in the stands.
"It picked up at the end so I will have to say seven out of 10 . I'm just being real. I'm used to seeing the stadium rammed and absolutely packed."
