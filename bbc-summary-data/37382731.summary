Redruth boss Marek Churcher says their forwards will be the key to the team recording a third successive victory in National Two South.

The fourth-placed Reds travel to Chinnor, who are third, on Saturday.
"It's important we set the cornerstone of the team, so up front we've got a really strong front row.
"Craig Williams, Richard Brown and Tommy Phillips can set us a platform and hopefully the guys in the backs can play off that," he told BBC Cornwall.
The Reds have taken nine points from a possible 10 from their two home games so far this season, the same amount as Chinnor - who Redruth beat twice last season.
"On paper we're probably underdogs, which is a good thing, so the boys can go up there and relax and play what we need to play and hopefully come away with the win," Churcher added.
"We can't get too carried away from what happened last year, but at the same time there's nothing wrong with using that bit of confidence to help us drive and get to what we need to do.
