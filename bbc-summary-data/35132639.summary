Prickwillow's 'ultimate bling' festive gold phone box

A village telephone box has been given an "ultimate bling" makeover for Christmas inspired by giant toffees.

This is the fifth year that artists from Ouse Life Drawing Group have decorated the box in Prickwillow in Cambridgeshire.
Artist Cary Outis wrapped the box in "gorgeous, shiny, cheap gold fabric".
He said: "I just really love those Quality Street toffees so I couldn't resist it - and who doesn't love eating too much sweet stuff at Christmas?"
Fellow artists Caroline Forward and Ricki Outis helped him wrap the phone box in 16m (52.5ft) of fabric, costing 75p a metre.
They put a message on the fabric, but Mr Outis said "getting the letters to stay on was a right nightmare".
He hopes the decoration will stay in place until 12th Night (6 January), but said he has to "tighten it up" every so often, so is not sure it will last that long.
The artists' group has been decorating the box, which the village owns, since 2011 when people were invited to fill it with handmade angels.
Since then it has been wrapped as a giant Christmas present and disguised as a chimney pot with a sleigh on top.
Last year, artist Jane Frost created a giant woven willow Christmas bauble, which she admitted was "not meant to be tasteful".
