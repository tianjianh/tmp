Nigeria's military 'destroys' 10 Boko Haram camps

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigeria's army says it has cleared 10 more camps used by Boko Haram in the north-east of the country.

There was a fierce battle around Dure camp, which a statement describes as one of the most "prominent" hideouts for the militants.
Boko Haram has not yet commented on the army statement and there has been no independent confirmation.
The army has recaptured most of the territory the militants had seized but they remain active.
Thousands have been killed, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria, in attacks carried out by Boko Haram since 2009.
The army says that militants died both in the assault in the Sambisa forest and in an ambush when trying to flee, but did not specify how many.
Last month, the army said it had rescued hundreds of former Boko Haram captives from Sambisa, a vast forest surrounding a game reserve.
The attack on the camps came on the same day as a female suicide bomber killed at least six people at a bus station in the north-eastern town of Damaturu.
The Nigerian police say they are investigating but said it appears to have been carried out by Boko Haram.
The use of female suicide bombers in this way is a worrying sign that the jihadists are not a defeated force, the BBC's Will Ross in Nigeria says.
The fight against Boko Haram has drawn in Nigeria's neighbours as the militants threaten their security as well.
Soldiers from Chad, Cameroon and Niger have helped Nigeria's army against Boko Haram.
