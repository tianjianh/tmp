[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman was seriously injured when she fell from cliffs into a narrow cave, coastguards said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She is understood to have fallen 15ft (4.5m) at Trevaunance Point near St Agnes on Saturday evening.
The alarm was raised shortly after 18:00 BST when the woman's friend came running up the beach calling for help.
The St Agnes RNLI Lifeboat, Coastguard Search and Rescue Team and paramedics were called to the scene.
Coastguards said rescuers had to form a human chain to move the woman from the cave across rocks to a waiting ambulance.
Poor weather conditions meant the casualty could not be airlifted to hospital, they said.
