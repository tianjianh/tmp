Condor Liberation: Company apologies for series of problems

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ferry company has described a series of problems with a new Â£50m vessel as "unimaginable bad fortune".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Condor Ferries' Liberation was damaged when it landed heavily against the quayside at St Peter Port last month.
Sailings were cancelled as repairs were held up by bad weather and an engine later developed an electrical fault.
In an open letter to customers, chairman Russell Kew said it had been a "very disappointing start" to Liberation's service
Mr Kew's letter insisted there had been "extensive preparations and sea trials", before it began operating between Poole, Jersey and Guernsey on 27 March.
It returned to service on Easter Sunday after repairs to damage suffered in the heavy landing in Guernsey on 28 March.
"It was unimaginable bad fortune that Condor Liberation then developed an electrical fault the next day.
"No-one is more disappointed than us that the first two weeks of Condor Liberation's time with us has been affected by the combination of the berthing incident, bad weather and the electrical fault," he said.
He added customer service procedures were being reviewed after "long waits, poor and conflicting information, and a great deal of inconvenience" for travellers.
