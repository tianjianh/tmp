[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beattock Station Action Group has joined forces with the regional transport partnership, SWestrans, to commission a feasibility study.
The move follows a meeting with Keith Brown, who was Transport Minister at the time, in September last year.
Beattock station closed in 1972 when the West Coast Main Line was electrified.
The action group hopes to tap into a Â£30m fund set up by the Scottish government to bring stations back into use.
Supporters claim the station's position, 45 minutes from both Glasgow and Edinburgh, could open up commuter and leisure opportunities and boost the economy of the area.
Findings from the feasibility study are expected to be published early next year.
