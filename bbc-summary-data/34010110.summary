Paramedics missed skull fractures, Nottingham court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "good Samaritan" who suffered multiple head fractures when he was punched was told by paramedics he was not seriously hurt, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Kane was knocked unconscious by a single punch to the face when he was apparently helping two women.
At Nottingham Crown Court earlier Ricky Scott, 29, admitted the attack but said he was protecting his girlfriend.
East Midlands Ambulance Service said it appeared his treatment "fell short of the standard expected".
Mr Kane was described by police as a good Samaritan when they released footage of him being knocked out by the blow in March.
In the CCTV images, shown to the court, he is seen approaching two women before a man runs up and punches him.
Scott, of Albany Road, New Basford, handed himself in to police after an appeal in the media, and at Nottingham Crown Court earlier he admitted the attack.
But he said he was trying to protect his girlfriend who had been racially abused.
Paramedics were called after Mr Scott made his own way back to his hotel but they did not consider his injuries to be serious, the court heard.
But when his condition deteriorated, a friend took him to hospital where doctors discovered he had multiple fractures to his skull and jaw.
In a statement, East Midlands Ambulance Service said: "It would appear that the service experienced by this gentleman fell short of the standard expected, and if this is the case then we are very sorry."
Scott has been bailed on a charge for wounding and will be sentenced at a later date.
