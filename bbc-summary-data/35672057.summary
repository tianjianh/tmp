A group of MPs will visit a firm providing meals and accommodation for asylum seekers in Cardiff following a row over demands they wear wristbands as a condition for receiving food.

Lynx House has scrapped the policy, which some said was dehumanising and made people targets for abuse.
There have also been subsequent claims of overcrowding and poor conditions.
Welsh Affairs Committee chairman David Davies said the MPs wanted to "see the place for ourselves".
"As a committee, we feel it is important to be able to get behind the headlines of news stories about Welsh issues," he said, ahead of Monday's visit.
"We currently house over 1,000 asylum seekers in Wales and it is important that we scrutinise this area now, as the refugee crisis shows little sign of abating in the near future."
The Clearsprings Group, which runs the service, said wristbands were seen as a "reliable and effective way" to guarantee service delivery, but they would no longer be used.
