Spencer, 24, spent three years at Birmingham, who finished sixth last season - 19 points behind Emma Hayes' title-winning Chelsea side.
Bailey, 20, is an England Under-23 international and played in the 2013 European Women's Under-19 Championship.
"I want homegrown, English players who want to grow with us," said Hayes.
"Becky has developed into a top goalkeeper and arrives with Champions League experience and a desire to reach the next level in her career.
"Jade is a player I have known about for some time and for someone who is 20 has fantastic experience, having started for Arsenal for the past two seasons."
