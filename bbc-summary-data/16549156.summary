"It's just as well Earls Court is used to staging some of the world's biggest music acts because volleyball is one of the biggest international sports and will raise the roof as much as Led Zeppelin, Oasis or Kylie Minogue ever did. Great Britain, the lowest ranked nation in the competition, will make their debut at this level. Jason Haldane is a vastly experienced player for the men, while women's captain Lynne Beattie is an inspirational figure. China's women's team four years ago attracted TV audiences as high as 370 million. Expect them to feature strongly again as well as Brazil and the USA, the 2008 finalists. Francesca Piccinini is a pin-up in her native Italy and is set to compete in her fourth Games. The Russian men will be top drawer. Star player Maxim Mikhailov is known as 'The Machine Gunner'."
Russia are the most successful nation in the history of Olympic indoor volleyball with a total of seven golds, four by the women and three from the men. In Beijing, however, they were overshadowed by their old foes the United States in the men's event and Brazil were on top of the podium in the women's tournament.
London 2012 marks the first time Great Britain will have volleyball entrants at the Olympics.
Both a women's and men's team will appear after the British Olympic Association confirmed that the two squads had satisfied their requirements that they could deliver a "credible performance and meaningful legacy".
Both squads have struggled to make an impact at world level and in recent times, however. The men's team only just scraped into the top 100 of the official world rankings - finding themselves ranked along with minnows Belize, St Kitts and Anguilla.
The energy expended playing volleyball for an hour burns approximately 780 calories. This helps lower the body fat percentage of those that take up the game.
Striking the ball strengthens the upper body, arms and shoulders, while the movement around the court builds the thigh and lower leg muscles.
As players have to strike the ball while it moves at speed through the air, volleyball improves hand-eye coordination and develops faster reflexes.
As it is a team game, it is an excellent way to develop communication skills and learn to work effectively with other people.
Volleyball clubs also offer a variety of social events beyond simply playing the sport.
Volleyball is an exciting, competitive team game that forces you to think tactically. It is played regularly by more than 50,000 people in gyms, leisure centres, schools, colleges and universities throughout the United Kingdom.

You can get a casual game going almost anywhere, be it the park, the beach, your back garden, university or even a swimming pool; all that is needed is a net and a ball.
For more regulated play, clubs throughout the UK run training sessions and leagues for players of all abilities.
There are no specific pieces of kit required to play volleyball, with most people choosing to wear a t-shirt, shorts and trainers.
Some players choose to use knee pads and elbow pads to provide protection from falls when playing on an indoor court.

There are six players in a volleyball team. They are allowed a maximum of three touches of the ball between them before it must cross the net.
Crucial is the set and spike, in which a player feeds the ball (the set) for a team-mate to smash it into the opposition's side of the court (the spike).
The Netherlands claimed their first Olympic volleyball gold medal with a thrilling 3-2 victory against Italy at the Atlanta Games in 1996
Matches are played over the best of five sets. Each one of the first four sets is completed when a team wins 25 points, with a lead of at least two points over the opposing team.
The fifth set is completed when one team wins 15 points, having a lead of 2 points over the opposing team.
A point is awarded after every rally, regardless of which team serves. If the serving team wins a rally, it continues to serve. If the receiving team wins a rally, it serves next.
Only the three players at the net can spike or block near the net. The back-court players can only hit the ball over the net from the back half of the court.
In a major change from the Beijing Games in 2008, teams can now earn bonus points whether they win or lose, depending on the scoreline. Previously it was two points for a win, one point for a loss.
Now, a team will earn three points for a win by 3-0 or 3-1 or two points for a win by 3-2. The losing team earns a point if they win two sets (i.e. lose the match 3-2).

Volleyball was created in 1895 by William G. Morgan, athletics director of the YMCA training school in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
