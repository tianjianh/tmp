What did it take to upset India's 'Beliebers'?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When pop star Justin Bieber's Mumbai concert was announced, his Indian fans went into a tizzy.

Each of them wanted a ticket to the concert.
But for some, the venue, a stadium in a suburban area of Mumbai, was too far to travel, and for others tickets were too expensive, the best reportedly priced at 75,000 rupees (Â£905; $1,165).
But that did not dampen the spirits of the fans, popularly known as Beliebers, who chose to follow the concert on TV and social media.
And then local media reported about an exhaustive list  of things Bieber wanted in Mumbai. Some described the list - which included a washing machine, glass-door refrigerators and a jacuzzi - as bizarre.
But this too did not deter his diehard Indians fans from supporting him.
So it seemed nothing could go wrong for Bieber in India... at least not until he performed.
Looking at the euphoria before his concert, nobody expected any negative feedback.
But some felt that the singer lip-synced some of his songs, and that did not go down well with his fans. Many have taken to Twitter to express their feelings about the singer's performance. Justin Bieber has not made any comment.
Some fans, however, chose to defend Bieber, saying Indians should not feel offended because they are used to Bollywood stars lip-syncing songs recorded by professional playback singers.
And some are also upset about the choice of his casual clothes on stage.
And finally, Bieber reportedly left India shirtless, and it didn't go unnoticed in the media... or maybe he was just changing his shirt?
