Hospital waiting times in Cheltenham and Gloucester 'routinely not met'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation has been launched into why A&E patients at Gloucestershire Royal and Cheltenham General hospitals often have to wait too long to be seen.

The government regulator, Monitor, said it would examine why a national target of four hours is routinely not met.
It said Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is "consistently failing" to meet the standard of 95% of patients seen within the timeframe.
The trust said the target was only narrowly missed last month.
Monitor regional director Paul Streat said: "For the benefit of local people in Gloucestershire, the situation needs to improve soon.
"Over the past year we have worked with the trust and local healthcare organisations to identify what could be done to improve healthcare across the area, but we now need to look more closely at what the trust could do for its patients in A&E."
The watchdog said the trust had missed the 95% of patients being seen within four hours target "for the majority" of the financial year 2014-2015.
It said no decision had yet been made on whether action would be needed, and it is to announce the outcome of its investigation once it has been completed.
A spokesman for the trust said a "detailed action plan" had already been implemented and the trust "continued to make good progress".
"In May the trust narrowly missed out on the four-hour wait, having achieved 93.53%"
Clinical chair of NHS Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group, Dr Helen Miller, said: "There is a joint plan in place which includes recruiting additional staff, providing increased access to GP appointments and increasing capacity within community services.
"This plan is supported by significant additional investment in frontline services."
The emergency departments in Cheltenham and Gloucester treat about 120,000 patients every year, according to the trust's website.
