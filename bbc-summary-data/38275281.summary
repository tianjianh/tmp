The spending is part of a new plan to improve the management of type 1 diabetes.
The condition affects about 30,000 people in Scotland.
The government has said a priority will be to increase the use of insulin pumps, which can replace the need to inject several times each day.
There are 3,200 insulin pumps currently in use in Scotland.
In addition to the pumps, additional continuous glucose monitoring equipment is to be made available.
Karen Addington, the chief executive of the diabetes charity JDRF, said: "Evidence shows this type 1 diabetes technology, provided alongside support and training for its use, can improve lives.
"We welcome the announcement of increased funding to improve access to it."
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "We know that insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring kits can make it much easier for some people to manage their type 1 diabetes.
"Proper control is absolutely key to improving outcomes and preventing complications from developing.
"This new investment will increase the provision of this equipment, meaning it's available to many more people, and making it easier for them to lead healthy lives."
