Gardner played 52 times for the Blues between January 2010 and June 2011 after signing from Aston Villa for £3m.
The 30-year-old midfielder has featured in 85 games for West Brom since joining from Sunderland in 2014.
"If there's a deal struck and it suits both clubs, we'll let Craig go," Pulis said. "If not, I won't be kicking him out of the door. He's a great lad."
Meanwhile, Birmingham manager Gianfranco Zola has also said he would like to sign Slovenia international midfielder Rene Krhin, 26, who is currently with Spanish club Granada.
"We're going to keep working on them over the weekend," Zola told BBC Sport. "We will see what we can do. The weekend will be decisive."
However, Crystal Palace winger Bakary Sako, 28, is unlikely to be moving to St Andrews after the Eagles rejected an offer, which BBC WM reports was £4m.
