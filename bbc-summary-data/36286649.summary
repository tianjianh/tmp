He joined former United teammates on Nobby Stiles Drive earlier to see the street sign officially unveiled in his birthplace in Collyhurst, Manchester.
Stiles made 311 appearances for United between 1960 and 1971.
The ceremony follows news that the 73-year-old has recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
Brian Kidd, also from Collyhurst, played alongside Stiles in Manchester United's 1968 European Cup Final win over Benfica.
"It's such a fitting tribute to such a wonderful man," he said. "Couldn't happen to a nicer person or family.
"Nobby was such a clever reader of the game, just like Bobby Moore.
"Some people have selective memories and just think Nobby was a tough tackling hard man. But technically he was very, very good and I honestly think he extended the late, great Bill Foulkes' career."
Former colleague Denis Law played with the diminutive midfielder for the majority of his Old Trafford career before Stiles moved on to play for Middlesbrough and Preston North End.
"It's absolutely fantastic for Nobby," said Law, 76.
"I remember him kicking me at Wembley in one game. We were teammates but that didn't stop him."
Stiles' wife, Kay, said it was a richly deserved tribute.
"[Nobby] is delighted and says he can't believe it. He's a very gentle person, never said anything bad about anybody."
