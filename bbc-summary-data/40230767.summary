Scotland's women are refusing to carry out any media or commercial activity due to a dispute with the Scottish FA.

Players did not speak to the media before and after Friday's 2-0 friendly win over Romania in Falkirk.
Their stance comes as Anna Signeul's squad prepare for next month's Euro 2017 finals in the Netherlands.
The Scottish FA said in a statement that it was "disappointed they have chosen not to undertake their media responsibilities".
But the governing body hopes to resolve the matter before Tuesday's friendly against Sweden in Vaxjo.
"We can confirm that we are in discussions with the Scotland Women's national team players regarding terms and conditions ahead of the women's Euros in the Netherlands next month," it said.
"We will endeavour to resolve this matter at the earliest opportunity through discussions with their advisors."
Scotland's home-based players are being funded to go full-time as they prepare for the finals, where Scotland meet England, Portugal and Spain.
A package agreed between the Scottish Football Partnership, Sport Scotland and energy firm SSE will provide finances until the tournament is over.
Around half the squad are expected to benefit from the scheme.
Head coach Signeul distanced herself from the dispute, saying she feels coaches should not be involved as it is between the players and the SFA.
"I'm not involved at all in that process," said Signeul, who suggested it was the same for men's head coach Gordon Strachan.
"They do this on the men's side as well, they negotiate contracts.
"It is between the SFA and the players and I don't think Gordon has anything to do with this either, it's nothing to do with us coaches."
Signeul will name her squad for Euro 2017 on 20 June.
