[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Caton-Brown ran in an early score and Reece Lyne crossed twice as the visitors made a terrific start before Jake Bibby touched down for the hosts.
Craig Kopzcak and Bibby's second put the hosts in front but Caton-Brown restored Trinity's lead.
Lama Tasi crashed over to put Salford back on top but late tries from Cason-Brown and James Batchelor won it.
Defeat for Salford ended a seven-match winning run and left them four points behind leaders Castleford, who beat St Helens 16-12 at The Jungle.
Wakefield looked to be sauntering to a sixth successive win when they took a 16-0 lead at the AJ Bell Stadium, but Bibby's first score in the final minute of the first half gave the Red Devils hope.
The hosts rallied through Tasi before former Salford man Caton-Brown took a pass from Liam Finn to cross and Batchelor touched down from a Sam Williams kick in the final minute.
Victory for Trinity lifted them up to fourth in the table.
Salford coach Ian Watson:
"In the first half we dominated field position which seems a strange thing to say when you go in 16-6 down. We didn't give Wakefield a sniff of our goal line apart from our errors and invited them to score.
"Little bits of our attack were probably off in certain areas - whether that's a build up of fatigue I don't know.
"Wakefield took their opportunities and we didn't. We haven't defended as we should have. It's up to us now to recover."
Wakefield coach Chris Chester:
"There is plenty of character in this side and I thought it was a really good team performance in tough circumstances.
"We played for the full 80 minutes - even with five minutes to go we still had that belief that we could get over the top of them.
"On the whole we probably edged it. We completed really high in the first half and then gave them a bit of a leg-up at the end of the first half which gave them a big lift going in at half-time. There was some great character shown and some good individual performances.
"Caton-Brown has got pace to burn and he's had to wait for his opportunity. He is an outstanding young British talent and I'm pleased that he's playing some good footy."
