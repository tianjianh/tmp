River could not cope with Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar in Yokohama.
Messi, returning from a kidney problem, scored the opener when he controlled Neymar's pass to finish.
Suarez latched on to Sergio Busquets' brilliant ball over the top to double their lead and added his second with a header from Neymar's cross.
Uruguay striker Suarez finished the tournament in Japan with five goals in two games after scoring a hat-trick in the 3-0 semi-final win over Guangzhou Evergrande.
Less than a year ago Luis Enrique was reported to be on the verge of being sacked, but the club's board stuck by him and since then they have won five of the six possible trophies 2015 had to offer.
Only a Spanish Super Cup defeat by Athletic Bilbao denied them the chance to match the 2009 sextuple under Pep Guardiola.
They are top of La Liga for now [on goal difference from Atletico Madrid, who play later on Sunday], and in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey and Champions League - as they bid to do it all again in 2016.
Barcelona have scored 176 goals this year - a new club record. They have one final game to add to it - at home to Real Betis in the league on 30 December.
River Plate started quite brightly in the Yokohama International Stadium. But once Barca's front three got going, they had no hope.
Messi and Neymar both missed the semi-final with fitness problems, but Suarez had ensured they were not missed with his semi-final treble.
Neymar and Messi both had roles in the build-up before the Brazilian found his Argentine colleague to fire home the opener.
Suarez added a second from Busquets' excellent long ball and headed home Neymar's excellent cross for his second.
Both tried to play in Neymar for a goal of his own, but he will still be happy with his goal-free performance - having lost in the 2011 final to Barca while at Santos.
