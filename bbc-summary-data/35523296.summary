Catalans Dragons will be without hooker Paul Aiton for up to six weeks after he tore a pectoral muscle on his debut, in a defeat by Wigan Warriors on Friday.

Aiton, 30, had scans to diagnose the injury on Monday.
He joined the Dragons from Leeds at the end of 2015, and missed the end of the last campaign with an arm injury.
The Papua New Guinea player played 94 games for both Wakefield and Leeds following his move from Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in 2012.
