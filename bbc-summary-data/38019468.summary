The suspect behind a bombing in New York which wounded 31 people in September has pleaded not guilty to terrorism-related charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ahmad Khan Rahimi was charged with eight offences, including use of a weapon of mass destruction, bombing and use of a destructive device.
Rahimi only appeared in court recently because of serious gunshot wounds he sustained in a police shootout.
He is accused of being behind explosions in Manhattan and New Jersey.
Investigators say Rahimi planted two bombs in Chelsea but one failed to detonate. Another bomb exploded in a New Jersey seaside town earlier on the same day but no-one was hurt.
He is also accused of leaving explosives in a discarded rucksack in a rubbish bin in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
Assistant US Attorney Nicholas Lewin said the government had video clips of Rahimi's movements on the day of the bombings, internet records showing he bought bomb-making materials and proof his DNA was on the explosive devices.
Police also found a handwritten journal in which Rahimi praised Osama bin Laden and criticized US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"Rahimi's goal was to bring fear and destruction to innocent people", the head of New York's FBI office, William Sweeney, said in a statement.
