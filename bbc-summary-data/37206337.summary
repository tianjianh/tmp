Transfer deadline day: Who'll be busy, who won't and who will panic buy?

It is the time of year when agents are glued to their phones, managers have set up camp in their chairman's office and everyone makes that joke about Harry Redknapp doing interviews through his car window.

Transfer deadline day is upon us and Premier League clubs have already broken all known spending records for this summer's transfer window.
Twelve clubs have set new transfer records for single deals, benefiting from the new £5.1bn television deal.
Arsenal's £52m double signing of Lucas Perez and Shkodran Mustafi pushed top-flight summer transfer window spending close to the £1bn mark, which it then passed on deadline day.
It has long surpassed the previous high of £870m set last year.
BBC Sport takes a look at a few big things to look out for on 31 August, including which clubs will be the busiest, which will be quietest and a look at some of the more left-field deadline day signings.
The window closes at 23:00 BST in England and midnight in Scotland.

West Brom manager Tony Pulis said on 12 August that his team needed four or five more players and since then they have added winger Nacer Chadli from Tottenham for £13m and Everton defender Brendan Galloway on loan.
"The club needs a lift. We need five players to come in and make a difference straightaway - we need almost half a team," Pulis told BBC WM.
Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew said his team had lost two "iconic" players with the exits of Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, although the Eagles have fended off a Spurs bid for winger Wilfried Zaha.
Palace have already signed striker Christian Benteke for £27m from Liverpool and Chelsea forward Loic Remy on a season-long loan but could yet do more business. Jack Wilshere has been suggested as a potential addition, with Arsenal keen to give the England international some game time.
Managerless Hull City did not sign anyone all summer and then went and added Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason, Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall and Manchester United striker Will Keane on Tuesday. With only 14 fit senior professionals available last weekend, there could be more to come.
Injury-hit West Ham are also likely to be looking for additions despite their early exit from European football and Everton manager Ronald Koeman could have a busy day after he admitted he would be "disappointed" if he was not able to add a few new faces.
Swansea City chairman Huw Jenkins has told BBC Wales that the club could bring in some new faces on loan.
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has said his business is done for the summer - despite rumours of interest in another centre-back.
"I have 23 players in the squad and in principle nobody is leaving, because I don't want anyone to leave," the Portuguese said last week. "No-one is coming and 23 players is more than enough."
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is only looking at outgoings as he aims to trim his squad.
He said: "We have 30 players, it's enough. I'm so happy with the squad and the team. I'm so confident. I trust a lot in them."
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger - often derided by his own fans for a lack of transfer activity - pushed the club's summer spending close to the £100m mark with a double coup of Germany defender Shkodran Mustafi and Spanish striker Lucas Perez on Tuesday for a combined fee of more than £50m.
Having already added Granit Xhaka, Kelechi Nwakali, Rob Holding and Takuma Asano, Wenger has said there are "no plans for anyone else now".

Dutch striker Vincent Janssen and Kenya midfielder Victor Wanyama have been the two major signings made by Tottenham, and boss Mauricio Pochettino cryptically said the club hopes to sign "one, two or three players or maybe no-one".
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte says he is "pleased to work with the players I have" but acknowledged he would still like to "improve his squad" before the window closes. An incredible Stamford Bridge return for Brazil centre-back David Luiz was being rumoured on Tuesday.
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says he "can't wait for the day when the transfer window is closed," and is surprised by the "obsession". He then added that the club "do not have a preferred position to sign players".
Every year there is at least one move that has fans scratching their heads and asking "where has that come from?"
In January 2014, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed the injured Sweden international Kim Kallstrom on loan. The then 31-year-old went on to make four appearances for the Gunners.
Deadline day in August 2008 saw Manchester City part with £32.5m for Real Madrid's Robinho. The Brazilian was caught so off guard by the transfer that he initially seemed to think he had joined Chelsea.
With their season in freefall, Everton brought in Senegal striker Oumar Niasse for £13.5m from Lokomotiv Moscow on February's deadline day. Niasse, signed by Roberto Martinez, failed to score in 152 minutes of first-team football and was not given a squad number by new Toffees boss Ronald Koeman.
Manchester United fans were also left confused on the same deadline day when the Red Devils brought in Andy Kellet from Bolton on loan for six months. Kellett had only made four senior appearances for Bolton and was used to boost United's reserve team.
Unable to command a place in West Ham's first team, the agent of midfielder Julien Faubert pulled of a coup by convincing Real Madrid to take the Frenchman on loan for the remainder of the season on deadline day in January 2009. He made two appearances and infamously fell asleep while on the bench during a match against Villarreal.
An alcohol-fuelled scouting trip, some dodgy VHS tapes and a case of mistaken identity were some of the theories for Milton Nunez's deadline-day move to Sunderland in March 2000. The diminutive Honduran striker was bought by Peter Reid for £1.6m from Nacional of Uruguay but made just a solitary league appearance for the Black Cats.
In attempt to avoid relegation, QPR broke their club record transfer fee to sign defender Christopher Samba from Anzhi Makhachkala for £12.5m in January 2013. "He's a monster," said then manager Harry Redknapp, sounding a little like cult agent Eric Hall, only to sell him back to the Russian Premier League club six months later.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has a penchant for a left-field deadline-day transfer signing. In August 2011 he brought in left-back Andre Santos from Fenerbahce for £6.2m. After an underwhelming career at Emirates Stadium he headed back to his native Brazil.
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola made it clear that goalkeeper Joe Hart, 29, was free to find himself a new home.
Last week's signing of Claudio Bravo effectively pushed Hart down to City's third choice position and the England man has elected to join Italian side Torino on loan, with the deal set to be announced on Wednesday.
Also likely to be looking at the City exit doors are Samir Nasri, 29, and Yaya Toure, 33.
Nasri has been linked with a move to Spanish side Sevilla while Toure is yet to feature in a league match this season.
This is the first season that teams outside the Premier League will not be able to use the emergency loan window to sign players between the end of August and the start of January.
That means we can expect a lot more action from the teams in the EFL than would normally be the case.
Tuesday saw the biggest Championship transfer ever with Bristol City selling striker Jonathan Kodjia to Aston Villa for a fee of up to £15m.
There had already been some big-money moves in the Championship this summer with Ross McCormack joining Villa from Fulham for £12m, Newcastle signing Matt Ritchie from Bournemouth for the same amount and Derby adding Matej Vydra from Watford for £8m.
Bristol City are now likely to be active on Tuesday in a bid to replace Ivorian Kodjia, while Nottingham Forest received £13m for winger Oliver Burke from RB Leipzig on Sunday and fans will hope to see some of that money reinvested.
In League One, Sheffield United got their first win of the season on Saturday and boss Chris Wilder may well be appealing for funds to kickstart a promotion push, while League Two Portsmouth may be willing to spend in order to avoid a fourth successive season in the bottom tier.
