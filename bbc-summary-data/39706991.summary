The search was launched after Pepsi vanished at Findon on Monday afternoon.
Potential sightings were reported in the Portlethen area, where the dog was located on Tuesday afternoon.
Pepsi's owner Claire Muir, of Aberdeen, told the BBC Scotland news website it was "amazing" news and thanked everyone who had helped.
She said: "Pepsi has been found safe and well in the outskirts of the Portlethen area by my incredible parents.
"She's been checked over by vets and she's safe, well, hungry and as cheeky and hyper as ever!
"Simon, myself and all our friends and family who dote on Pepsi are so thankful from the bottom of our dog-loving hearts. Seeing strangers pull together over social media in such a short time and making such a big difference is unbelievable.
"We'll thank everyone properly as soon as we get this girl home and washed."
