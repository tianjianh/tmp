The FBI seized computers and mobile phones from the home in October, after celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence had pictures stolen - apparently via a hack on their Apple iCloud accounts.
Court papers have identified eight celebrities by their initials only.
The FBI said no charges have been filed at the current time.
Last summer's scandal highlighted the vulnerabilities of cloud computing - which allows personal information to be stored on the Internet and accessed from any device.
The affidavit - a sworn statement to the court - has identified eight celebrities by their initials only: AS, CH, HS, JM, OW, AK, EB and AH.
One of the identified stars learned she was a victim of the leak through the news media. The papers have stated that "all photos were taken with her iPhone and sent through iMessage to her boyfriend".
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has since spoken about the leak. Speaking to Vanity Fair, the 24-year-old said: "It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime. It is a sexual violation. It's disgusting."
