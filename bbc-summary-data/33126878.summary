The album, which includes the singles Dead Inside and Mercy, knocked Florence and The Machine off top spot.
The band's third album, How Big, How Blue slipped to number two, with Collabro's Act Two at three.
Ed Sheeran's X climbed six places to four, with Sam Smith's Lonely Hour up two at five. Leftfield had the highest new entry at number six.
The dance act's first full-length studio album for 16 years, Alternative Light Source, edged out a new deluxe edition of The Rolling Stones 1971 chart-topper Sticky Fingers.
Further down the album chart, Pete Townshend's Classic Quadropenia debuted at number 32.
The Who star launched a protest against the Official Chart Company last week when it decided his record wouldn't be eligible for the classical charts, because it was merely a rock album re-arranged for the orchestra.
As it stands, the album at the top of the classical chart is Andre Rieu's Magic Of The Violin, which only made number 100 on the main chart.
Meanwhile, Jason Derulo achieved a third week at number one in the singles chart with Want To Want Me.
OMI's Cheerleader was at number two, with Major Lazer's Len on FT MO & DJ Snake at number three.
Skrillex, Diplo and Justin Bieber's Where Are U Now and Galantis' Runaway (You & I) took fourth and fifth spot.
But Leona Lewis's much-publicised comeback single, Fire Under My Feet, failed to make the Top 40, landing at number 51.
The Official Chart will move to Fridays from 10 July - after 28 years broadcasting on a Sunday - to tie in with the new global music release day.
The Official Chart with Greg James will kick off the weekend at 16:00 BST every Friday on BBC Radio 1, as part of his drivetime show.
The move coincides with the music industry's launch of New Music Fridays in more than 45 countries.
All albums and singles will now be released globally at 00:01 on a Friday.
