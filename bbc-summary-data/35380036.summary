The ex-Manchester United and England player, 35, had been linked with a move to Plymouth before Jamie Fullarton took over as Notts boss this month.
But Fullarton said: "I am pleased to say Alan's decided that he would prefer to stay here and work with us."
Meanwhile, defender Alan Sheehan, 29, will not be returning to the Magpies on loan and looks set to join Luton Town.
Sheehan joined the Magpies from Bradford City in September but Fullarton now wants to give Blair Adams a chance to prove himself after he returned from a loan spell with Mansfield Town.
Fullarton said: "It is important we give players who are already here an opportunity. It would have been unfair or foolish to bring someone in at this early stage."
