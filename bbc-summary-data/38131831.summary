[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra manager Steve Davis has welcomed a two-week break for his side following their 4-0 loss at Colchester United in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Already out of the FA Cup, the EFL Cup and the Checkatrade Trophy, Crewe do not play again until 10 December.
"Some of the players definitely need a bit of a brain rest," 51-year-old Davis told BBC Radio Stoke.
"It gives us a chance to get three of the lads back fit, who we should have available in a couple of weeks' time."
Crewe are 10th in the table after only two wins in their past 11 league games.
