The grass path was sealed off by police, with a white tent beyond the cordon.
Flowers and cards were left at the scene, with one reading: "Night night my darling princess Katie. Love nana and grandad."
Officers appealed for anyone in the area of Morrell Court, Belhouse Way, Osprey Close and Alness Drive who saw two girls on Monday afternoon to get in touch.
North Yorkshire Police said: "Katie's family are devastated by this tragic event and have asked for their privacy to be respected at this extremely distressing time."
Katie was a pupil at Westfield Primary School in the Acomb area of York.
The school said her death was a "terrible loss which has deeply saddened our school community".
Tracey Ralph, head teacher at the school, said: "Katie was a kind and thoughtful child who was well-liked by both pupils and staff.
"She was hardworking and showed a particular talent for creative writing.
"All members of our school are being offered emotional support at this distressing time."
Rob McCartney, who lives nearby, said he came out of his home after hearing sirens and saw a woman shouting for an ambulance to be called.
"I put my shoes on and went to go up the alleyway. I got halfway up and I could see a body lying on the field, the police were already there attending," he said.
Police vehicles were seen at a semi-detached house about half a mile from the scene, with officers carrying out house-to-house inquiries in the area.
Jon Stonehouse, director of children, education and communities at City of York Council, said: "This tragic incident has shocked the city and the council, on whose behalf I offer our profound condolences to Katie's family at this extremely difficult and sad time.
"Our neighbour enforcement officers are also giving additional support to the police and are offering reassurance."
A neighbour of Katie's family, who did not wish to be named, said: "She was usually playing at the front, in the garden, or round the back of the house playing with some friends.
"She was lovely, really sweet."
