[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Varndell's record 91st Premiership try proved to be in vain as bottom side Bristol were overpowered by Harlequins at Ashton Gate.

Varndell cancelled out Joe Marchant's early Quins score to surpass Mark Cueto's tally, but picked up a knock in scoring and was withdrawn.
Mark Reddish, Charlie Mulchrone and Matt Hopper tries added to Quins' 13-8 interval lead and earned a bonus point.
James Chisholm's score ensured a first away win this term for the visitors.
The home side could have moved off the foot of the table with victory, but any hopes of continuing their improved form were dented when Marchant capitalised on a Ruaridh Jackson grubber to score the first try.
Jackson would prove Bristol's scourge from the tee and out of hand with 12 points throughout, not before Varndell's record-breaking try got Bristol back into the game.
It was not until Reddish touched down just three minutes into the second period that Quins really took control, particularly when Mulchrone finished off a rumbling break by Dave Ward.
Quins looked like they might miss the try bonus when they were denied by the television match official as time ticked on, but Chisholm bustled his way across and Tim Swiel's late penalty merely added gloss to the result.
Bristol captain Olly Robinson:
"It was only a five-point game at half-time and we were well in it but we gave them too much possession and they are a very good attacking side.
"We didn't play very well and they deserved to win but we are still very much in the fight against relegation as we are only a point behind Worcester with eight games to play."
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston:
"It was still a tough game as they had two or three really strong periods of play but we had the rub of the green with the bounce of the ball at crucial times.
"After their performance at Northampton in defeat, we were under no illusions about the task in hand but we were excellent as we made them look ordinary.
"We should have been further ahead at the interval but it was a wearing down process and we were rewarded in that second half."
