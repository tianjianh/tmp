The 22-year-old former Plymouth Argyle man has spent the last two seasons with Truro City, scoring 24 goals.
"We had him watched at Truro and wanted to get him into our own environment to see how he'd adapt," Hatters boss Nathan Jones told the club website.
"He is one to be excited about because he has so much more to prove. We can bring the potential out of him."
