[SN]TITLE[SN]
Child images nurse not struck off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse at a children's hospice who downloaded hundreds of indecent images of youngsters out of "curiosity" has escaped being struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen McCusker, who worked at the Rachel House Hospice in Kinross, downloaded 1,740 images of children, 40 of which were considered indecent.
The 48-year-old, from Glenrothes in Fife, said he could offer no excuses except "curiosity mixed with wine".
The Nursing and Midwifery Council banned him for 12 months.
Panel chairman Brian Yates said McCusker had a 20-year career without any disciplinary action or complaint.
He also said that the images were at the lower end of the indecent image scale.
The nurse pleaded guilty last year to one count of taking, or permitting to be taken, indecent photos of children over a four-year period.
He was given a three-year supervision order by the court and ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work.
The court heard McCusker had been viewing the material for "quite some time" and he had told officers that he would "view it, feel disgusted and then delete it".
McCusker said he was "interested" in young boys and girls but had never sexually abused a child, adding he could offer "no explanation" for his behaviour.
He was not present or represented at the Nursing and Midwifery Council.
He sent a letter which said: 'I was a nurse for 20 years with an exemplary record. I find it difficult to put in words my shame at the damage I have inflicted on the reputation of the Children's Hospice Association Scotland and the NMC."
McCusker resigned from his post at the hospice immediately after his arrest, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told.
Mr Yates said: "Mr McCusker has brought the profession into disrepute as a consequence of his conviction and in particular by reason of the nature of the offence involved.
"Members of the public would be deeply concerned to learn that a learning disabilities and children's nurse, working in a children's hospice had a conviction for offences relating to possession of indecent images of children."
