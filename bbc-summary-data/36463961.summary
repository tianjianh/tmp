Keane, who missed the warm-up games against the Netherlands and Belarus with a calf injury, trained with his leg strapped.
Jonathan Walters and Robbie Brady sat out the session in Abbotstown.
The squad were given the weekend off but resumed training on Monday and will travel to France on Wednesday.
Manager Martin O'Neill put the squad through their paces at their Dublin base with Everton midfielder James McCarthy also taking a full part in the session having recovered from his groin and hamstring injury.
Stoke forward Walters sat out the warm-up as he gets over his Achilles strain, as did Norwich winger Brady.
The pair trained separately but are expected to be fully fit for the Group E opener at the Stade de France.
The Republic face Belgium and Italy after their match against Sweden.
