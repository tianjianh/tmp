The video technology will already be in use for the 2015 World Cup, but World Rugby will now look into expanding the measure beyond that tournament.
Wales Rugby Union will not face sanctions for missing the incident.
World Rugby accepted the Wales medical staff's explanation that they did not see North's second head injury of the game in a collision with team-mate Richard Hibbard in Cardiff.
Wales medical manager Prav Mathema admitted: "Having seen it since, he should definitely have been removed. We've seen where our protocols need to improve."
World Rugby said it would be "immediately investigating, evaluating and promoting"  the implementation of the further safety measures to "minimise the chance of a repeat incident".

It will investigate whether television match official (TMO) technology can be "expanded to identify head injuries as they happen on the field", and will also look at whether medical staff should have pitch-side video in all elite competitions.
North has passed all tests for concussion and could play against Scotland at Murrayfield on Sunday.
The Northampton player left the field for eight minutes during the first half after receiving an accidental kick to the head, but was allowed to resume playing after showing no sign of concussion.
The incident with Hibbard was picked up by television cameras but was not seen by the Welsh Rugby Union medical staff, who did not have access to a video feed.
