Ryan Gosling will star in the as-yet-untitled sequel, which is set several decades after the first story.
Harrison Ford, who played police officer Rick Deckard in the original 1982 cult movie, will also appear.
The film will be directed by Denis Villeneuve, whose films include Sicario and Prisoners.
Blade Runner 2 is scheduled for release in October 2017.
"I've always been attracted to science-fiction films with strong visual signatures that lead us into unique parallel worlds and the original Blade Runner is by far the best of all time," Villeneuve said.
"Ridley Scott had the genius to blend science-fiction and film noir to create this unique exploration of human condition.
"The new Blade Runner is an extension of the first movie a few decades later."
Principal photography is due to begin this month.  The cast also includes Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Carla Juri, Mackenzie Davis, Barkhad Abdi and Dave Bautista.
The first look at the some of the film's concept art was unveiled in Entertainment Weekly.
The original film - set in 2019 - saw Deckard hunting lifelike robots, known as replicants, in a futuristic Los Angeles.
It was based on Philip K Dick's novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?.
