The first impressions of a new-look Saughton Park and Gardens will go on display to the public on Tuesday between 16:00 and 20:00.
Visitors will be able to ask about the plans with designers Ironside Farrar.
The consultants, who were involved in the design of The Helix in Falkirk, have been appointed to develop a design plan for the Â£5.3m park renovation.
Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh city council's environment convener, said: "This is a very important stage in the project to revive Saughton Park and its wonderful gardens, as we get a first glimpse of designers' vision for restoring it to its former glory.
"We have been eager to involve local people throughout this process, and now the community can come along and tell us what they think of these exciting new ideas."
The design team also includes Sutherland Hussey Architects, Peter McGowan Associates, Richard Shorter Architect and David Narro Associates.
In 1908 the park was redesigned for the Scottish National Exhibition, resulting in a range of new features, including sports facilities, a bandstand and winter and botanical gardens.
A project to restore the park secured almost Â£400,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund to develop a design plan.
