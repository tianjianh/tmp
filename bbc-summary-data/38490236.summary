Dover white cliffs bodies: 'Siblings among three found'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brother and a sister are believed to have been among three people found dead at the foot of cliffs in Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Their bodies were discovered at Langdon Cliffs on Sunday during a search for another man, whose body was also found.
Kent Police said the "siblings" were believed to be in their 60s and from the Cheshire area.
Their deaths are not thought to be connected to the death of the first man, who is believed to be in his 40s, from the Greater Manchester area.
Police said the deaths were not being treated as suspicious.
They have appealed for anyone who saw a man and a woman in dark-coloured wet weather clothing at the top of the cliffs in the period between Boxing Day and New Year's Day to contact them.
