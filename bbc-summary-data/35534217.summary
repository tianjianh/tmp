One person treated for flu in NI dies, says PHA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One person who was being treated in hospital in Northern Ireland for influenza or flu has died, the Public Health Agency (PHA) has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The PHA would not confirm whether it was the H1N1 strain formerly known as swine flu.
The PHA's website also states that seven people are being treated in intensive care units for the flu virus.
As in previous years, H1N1 is one of the strains circulating, but is covered by a free vaccination programme.
