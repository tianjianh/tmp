Pro12: Connacht 5-41 Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow kicked off their Pro12 campaign with a thumping six-try win over reigning champions Connacht in Galway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scots laid the foundations for this excellent bonus-point victory with two Tommy Seymour tries while Niyi Adeolokun touched down for Connacht.
Glasgow led 13-5 at the break and they stormed clear in the second half.
Man-of-the-match Stuart Hogg, Tim Swinson, Sila Puafisi and Sean Lamont added further tries for the Warriors as they started the season in style.
Connacht's lack of pre-season fixtures - they only had one game away to Montpellier - was ruthlessly exposed by Glasgow.
With 473 international caps in their squad and the early wind advantage, Gregor Townsend's side started strongly and quick hands from Peter Horne and Hogg put Nashville-born flyer Seymour over in the left corner.
Henry Pyrgos fired over a successful 25th-minute penalty, although number eight Ryan Wilson's late and dangerous tackle on Jack Carty had the visitors a man down.
Bundee Aki provided the momentum for Connacht's only score, the centre powering out of two attempted tackles before neat passes from Denis Buckley, Finlay Bealham and Eoin Griffin sent Adeolokun diving over by the right corner flag.
Carty was unable to convert and Glasgow had the last word before half-time.
Hogg's flat delivery out to the right allowed Seymour to cut in past Cian Kelleher and complete his brace, giving Glasgow an eight-point advantage at the interval.
Hogg exploited a gap between Eoin Griffin and Matt Healy to reach over to the right of the posts, with Pyrgos' boot making it 20-5 barely six minutes after the restart.
The bonus point was bagged in the 53rd minute as second row Swinson piled over following good work by lively Italian newcomer Leonardo Sarto.
The latter also had a hand in the build-up to Puafisi's score on the hour mark, the Tongan replacement prop crashing through after Hogg was held up by Kelleher.
Lamont wrapped up the runaway victory in the 71st minute, scoring from a close-range ruck, with scrum-half Pyrgos slotting his fourth successful conversion in a row.
