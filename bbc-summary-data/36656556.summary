Police said the incident happened in the Orangefield area some time between Saturday evening and Sunday.
Graffiti was sprayed on the house and two cars. It included a swastika and the term C18.
The Lord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Garath Keating described the incident as "shocking and sickening".
"I do understand that it is a house occupied by foreign nationals," he said.
"I'll certainly be trying my utmost to make contact with them through the remainder of this week."
Mr Keating said community relations in Armagh were "excellent, by and large".
"We have people of very diverse backgrounds and cultures living very successfully side by side," he said.
"It's important for this community and all our communities in Armagh to speak out and to say that there is absolutely no place for this sort of behaviour, this sort of crime in Armagh."
Writing on the Police Service of Northern Ireland Armagh Facebook page, police said: "No-one has the right to intimidate or threaten any member of our community."
Police appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact them.
