[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Archer, the victim's brother, has been arrested on suspicion of murder, Greater Manchester Police said.
The 49-year-old victim was airlifted to hospital from Surbiton Road, Newton Heath, with 70% burns after the attack on Monday.
Armed officers arrested Mr Archer, 50, after an off-duty officer spotted him getting off a train at Marple rail station near Stockport earlier.
Detectives believe the victim, who has not been named, was covered in petrol before being set alight.
A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place later to establish the cause of her death.
A 19-year-old woman escaped uninjured from an upstairs window of the house during the fire, which also seriously damaged the building.
Three fire engines dealt with the blaze and several routes around Surbiton Road were closed off.
Police then spent five days searching for Mr Archer, with his mother appealing for him to come forward after revealing he had sent her a birthday card.
