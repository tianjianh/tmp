Valdes, 33, has made just two appearances since joining United on a free transfer 10 months ago.
The Spaniard had a falling out with manager Louis van Gaal in July before a proposed move to Turkish club Besiktas collapsed in August.
When asked about Valdes's future, Gines Carvajal told Radio Marca: "He'll have a chance in January, wherever he goes."
He added: "Victor won't be coming to Spain, unless he decides otherwise. He needs to go to a place he feels is right for him."
Valdes, who was part of Spain's winning squads at the 2010 World Cup and the European Championship in 2012, will be out of contract at United at the end of the season.
During a 12-year spell at Barcelona between 2002 and 2014 he won six league titles, the Champions League three times and the Spanish Cup twice.
