[SN]TITLE[SN]
Five Welsh neglected theatres 'at risk'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five of Wales' neglected theatres need urgent help and have been placed on an "at risk" register, a conservation group has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Llandudno's Grand Theatre, Colwyn Bay's Pier Pavilion and Conwy Civic Hall are all on The Theatres Trust's Theatre Buildings at Risk Register 2015.
They are joined by Muni Arts Centre in Pontypridd and Swansea's Palace.
The trust said, if restored, the theatres could make "significant contributions" to communities.
Mhora Samuel, director of The Theatres Trust, said investment in other at-risk theatres had shown they could be brought back to life and help "re-animate" local cultural life.
"Whilst these buildings sit empty and underused all they represent is an untapped opportunity," she added.
In total, the 2015 register includes 31 buildings across England and Wales.
The Theatre's Trust's assessment of the at-risk theatres
Muni Arts Centre, Pontypridd
Originally a Wesleyan Chapel, which was open between 1895 and 1961, it is a typical turn of the century ecclesiastical building. The venue was converted into a theatre in 1990 and its programme included theatre, stand-up comedy, live music, dances and wedding receptions.  It is a truly multi-functional studio space. On 14 May 2014, Rhonda Cynon Taf Council approved closure of the Muni Arts Centre and it closed its doors that November. However, the Muni Working Group has recently reopened it.
Palace, Swansea
Opened in 1888 as the Pavilion Theatre of Varieties, The Palace has a dramatic exterior and is built on a triangular site in Swansea. It later became a nightclub before closing in 2006. Its exterior became increasingly neglected and plant growth caused some damage to the stonework, while the interior was in a dangerous state. In January 2015, Swansea council offered an emergency grant to the theatre's owners to make the building safe and watertight, and this work is nearly complete.
Civic Hall, Cowny
Situated in the centre of Conwy, the Civic Hall was designed in Tudor Gothic style but had to be rebuilt following a fire in 1966. A report for Conwy council in 2007 suggested the hall had reached the end of its working life. Campaigners proposed to take over the management of the venue but their plans, submitted in late 2013, were rejected by the council. The Civic Hall is now closed, with an unclear future.
Pier Pavilion, Colwyn Bay
The original pier pavilion, in the Moorish style and dating from 1900, was destroyed by fire in 1923. It was rebuilt in a less decorative style and again rebuilt after another fire in 1933. The Pavilion currently stands empty. On 12 December 2013, Conwy council voted in favour of de-listing and demolition the building, stating that a restoration would be too costly. An application for demolition was finally approved on 9 July 2015.
Grand Theatre, Llandudno
The imposing building was used as a theatre between 1901 and 1985 then later as a nightclub. The theatre's under-stage equipment is a particularly rare survival, including original wooden traps in working order and old wind machine. Designed by the internationally renowned Edwardian theatre architect, Edwin O Sachs, this is potentially the best traditional theatre in north Wales not in theatre use. The nightclub closed in June 2013 but the building's new owner intends to reopen it as a nightclub after carrying out repair work.
