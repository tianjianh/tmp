Palmer has yet to make an appearance for Chelsea, but has twice been named on the substitutes' bench.
The 19-year-old was part of the England Under-21 side which won the Toulon Tournament in May.
"I believe we can help Kasey make the next step in his career and send him back to Chelsea a better player," Terriers head coach David Wagner said.
"He is a very skilful player with good football intelligence and we now have the time to work hard with him in training to help him understand our identity on the pitch."
