Barroso outlines plan to resolve eurozone debt crisis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, has set out a plan designed to bring an end to the eurozone debt crisis.

In a speech, Mr Barroso said banks must set aside more assets to help guard against future losses.
Banks supported by the eurozone bailout fund - the European Financial Stability Facility - should be stopped from paying dividends or bonuses, he said.
The commission called it a "comprehensive response" to the crisis.
It outlined five areas of action "designed to break the vicious circle between doubts over the sustainability of sovereign debt, the stability of the banking system and the European Union's growth prospects".
Mr Barroso said the plan "charts Europe's way out of the economic crisis".
"Reactive and piecemeal responses to different aspects of the crisis are no longer sufficient," he said.

The plan calls for five policy actions:
By Andrew WalkerEconomics correspondent, BBC World Service
The proposals set out by the European Commission chief follow a commitment from the French and German leaders to produce a plan for the crisis by the end of the month.
One key element is strengthening the banks. Under the proposals, many of them would have to raise new capital to improve confidence that they could cope with any losses on problem loans. If they can't raise it privately, it would have to come from governments or the European bailout facility.
There has been a welcome in financial markets for Mr Barroso's plan. But it does have risks. In particular, throwing more public money at the problem, for example at the banks, could put further strain on the finances of some governments, notably France.
And it needs more detail and acceptance by eurozone leaders. They in turn will struggle to sell these ideas to voters who are weary of austerity and bailouts for banks and governments.
Late on Tuesday, Slovakia voted against increasing the powers of the EFSF - the only one of the 17 members of the eurozone to do so.
However, internal political wrangling was behind the no vote, and observers expect a fresh vote before the end of this week.
In addition to expanding the EFSF's powers, the measures agreed in July by eurozone leaders also included private lenders taking a 21% hit on loans to the Greek government.
However, investors now believe both these measures are inadequate. They are calling for the bailout fund to be increased towards 2 trillion euros, and believe private investors will be forced to take a much bigger hit than the 21% suggested.
The leaders also agreed in July to a second bailout package for Greece worth 109bn euros.
The commission, along with the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, has been in Athens deciding whether to release the latest tranche of funds from the first bailout agreed in 2010.
On Tuesday, the three bodies agreed measures that Greece needs to take to bring down its debt levels and said they were likely to release the 8bn euros that country needs to pay its bills.
Leaders have been heavily criticised, particularly by investors, for not taking decisive action to end the crisis.
However, there is feeling now that such action will be forthcoming, analysts say, with all eyes on a summit of EU leaders on 23 October and a G20 meeting in Cannes at the beginning of November.
