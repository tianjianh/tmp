A multi-million pound redevelopment of one of south Wales' most famous fairgrounds will go ahead after a deal on the future of the site was struck.

The keys for Barry Island Pleasure Park were handed over to new owner Henry Danter on Monday following negotiations with former owners Hilco.
Mr Danter, who has 50 years fairground experience, said he will move large vehicles onto the site to clear it.
He aims to have a small fair on site by Friday.
"It's taken a long time to get to this point," said Mr Danter, who also runs Treasure Island fairground in Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire.
"But we promised the people of Barry we would have it up and running for Easter."
Mr Danter said he paid a deposit for the site "quite a long time ago" but the deal had been delayed because it was dependant on Hilco being given planning permission for flats to be built nearby.
He plans to invest up to Â£20m in the fairground, including building an arcade to ensure that it is a year-round attraction.
Finance Wales and Barclays have invested in the regeneration project.
Beth Cousins, deputy fund manager at Finance Wales, said "Henry and his family have a strong heritage in the fairground industry.
"We're confident that their passion and experience will put the pleasure park back on the map as one of Wales' most popular seaside destinations."
The park struggled after the nearby Butlins holiday camp closed 18 years ago.
Hilco has been asked to comment.
