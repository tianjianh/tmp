The Grade II-listed London Road Fire Station in the city centre has been empty for about 14 years after plans to turn it into a hotel were shelved.
The building has been sold to developers Allied London.
The firm declined to discuss proposals for the site in detail but said it wanted to "bring the building back to life, and invite the public in".
Refurbishments would be "sympathetic" to the original form of the building, a spokeswoman added.
The Friends of London Road Fire Station group, which has campaigned for the station to be redeveloped, welcomed the move.
Chairman Emma Curtin said: "At the start of our campaign we were told by some politicians and civic leaders that this was an impossible case.
"I hope the developers will now work closely with English Heritage and us to create a sensitive proposal."
The building, opposite Piccadilly Station, was built between 1904 and 1906, and served as the headquarters for Manchester's fire brigade in the first half of the 20th Century, closing in the mid 1980s.
It was bought by Britannia Hotels in 1985, which ran an office there until about 2001, when it was placed on English Heritage's At Risk register.
Allied London developed Manchester's business and retail site Spinningfields, and the Granada Studios site, St John's.
