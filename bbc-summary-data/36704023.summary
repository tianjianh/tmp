[SN]TITLE[SN]
Clones confirmed as Ulster SFC final venue

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clones remains the venue for the Ulster SFC decider between Donegal and Tyrone after calls for the 17 July showpiece clash to be switched to Croke Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Several former players suggested that Croke Park would cater for the wider interest in seeing the match and well above the 36,000 capacity of Clones.
However, the Leinster minor and senior finals are scheduled for Croke Park on the same date.
The Ulster Council confirmed on Monday that Clones will host the final.
