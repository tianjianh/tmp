The Bluebirds are believed to have paid around Â£2m to Japanese side Cerezo Osaka for the 22-year-old midfielder.
Kim is currently with the South Korea squad at the Olympics and will finalise his move to Cardiff after the tournament.
He started in South Korea's 0-0 draw against Mexico at St James' Park.
Kim is Cardiff's fourth summer signing with the club having already recruited goalkeeper Joe Lewis, midfielder Jordon Mutch and striker Etien Velikonja during the pre-season.
Cardiff have also been linked with Liverpool striker Craig Bellamy, who spent the 2010-11 season on loan with club.
But manager Malkay Mackay has refused to be drawn on the possibility of the former Wales captain returning to the club.
Striker Kenny Miller has left the club for MLS side Vancouver Whitecaps but Cardiff have rejected two bids from Premier League side Fulham for Peter Whittingham.
