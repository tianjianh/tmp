Antoine Griezmann has "the world in his hands" at Atletico Madrid and does not need to leave the La Liga side to become a legend, says Fernando Torres.

The France forward has been strongly linked with Manchester United.
Ex-Liverpool striker Torres told BBC Football Focus he faced a similar juncture before a Â£50m move to Chelsea in 2011, but insists the 26-year-old can realise his potential at Atletico.
"Where are you going to go to improve what you have in Atletico?" he said.
"Not many places in the world. I hope he can stay with us forever."
Griezmann scored his 24th goal of the season for Atletico as Diego Simeone's side beat Leicester City 1-0 in the Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday.
Torres, back at the club where he began his career, says it is no wonder interest in the France international is high.
"That's normal when young players become one of the best in the world, everyone wants to sign them," the 33-year-old said.
"You can go to many other places in the world and they cannot offer what Atletico can offer you right now: competing in the league, competing in the Champions League, one of the most respected teams in Europe - so there is no reason to leave."
Torres was the same age as Griezmann, who has yet to win a major trophy, is now when he decided he had to leave Anfield to further his career.
"He's 26, which is a very good age to develop your game and to decide if you want to be a good player or a top player," explained Torres.
"We were in the Champions League final [last season], he played in the Euro final with France, so I think he realises how difficult it is to become champion, but he is right there.
"He has the world in his hands."
Torres spent three and a half prolific years with Liverpool, but it was at Stamford Bridge the former Spain international enjoyed greater team success; winning the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup.
"Talking about Griezmann, I was in that situation where I wanted to be the best and I wanted to go to a team who give me the tools to become the best," said Torres.
"The situation was different because when Rafa [Benitez] left and [Javier] Mascherano left and [Xabi] Alonso left, all the promises the owners made to the team were not true.
"I had everything at Liverpool. But then they sell the best players, the manager. So I had to find my own way.
"We were not building a team to win. That was the reality, the situation changed very much in six months."
