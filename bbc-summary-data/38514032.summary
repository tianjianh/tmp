The 21-year-old arrives in time to play in the League Two match against Stevenage on 7 January.
Manager Graham Westley said the club need to improve in defence.
"Nineteen goals conceded in seven league games tells you that we lack defensive stability. There's no disrespect to any player in that statement," he said.
"I've seen a lot of him [Nelson] in both under-21 and League One football, where he helped his club into the play-offs last year and I'm sure that the Newport fans will love the heart and quality that he will put into defending our goal."
Nelson joins with Newport four points adrift at the bottom on the table.
