A service of dedication has taken place in North Somerset at the official opening of Portishead's new £1.9m purpose-built lifeboat station.

The new base, which has taken a year to construct, will be run by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).
It has been built on the site of a former Masonic lodge near the marina.
An anonymous donor gave more than £500,000 to help fund the project last year.
Mike Roberts, chairman of Portishead RNLI, said it was a "fantastic, exciting day".
He added: "Having this new building, which the RNLI has built over the last year, is fantastic for the crews and the other volunteers.
"It actually has changing rooms and showers, and places to make tea, and things like that."
The RNLI previously adopted the Portishead and Bristol lifeboat from Portishead Lifeboat Trust.
"We've been an independent life boat trust for the last 19 years. In that time we've done over 380 rescue missions but to be part of the RNLI is a big thing for us," Mr Roberts added.
"We still operate an identical boat. We're working to RNLI procedures and so on anyway, but to have the training and the technical resources of the RNLI behind us is fantastic."
