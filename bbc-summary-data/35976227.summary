[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a County Armagh man, who was murdered almost five years ago, have escaped injury in an arson attack on their home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marc Williamson was 21 when he was stabbed to death in August 2011.
This morning, his mother, Barbara, father, Cecil, and brother, Robert David, were in their home in Richhill when arsonists set fire to the car outside.
The blaze spread to a nearby oil tank, which exploded.
The fire destroyed the house but the family managed to escape.
Robert David was awake early for work and raised the alarm.
Mrs Williamson said: "Mark's dead five years in August coming up and if Robert David hadn't been up I'd have lost another son.
"Maybe we'd have all been away, but I'd definitely have lost another son."
Mrs Williamson says she believes she knows who started the fire.
"It's a long story," she said, "but they got the wrong car, I'm sure they meant to burn out my car."
The car was pushed up against the end-terrace house in Elm Park and set alight at around 05:30 BST on Wednesday.
A number of neighbours had to be evacuated while the fire was brought under control.
Mrs Williamson says the family are now homeless.
"We've lost everything", she said.
Police said they were working to establish a motive and appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
