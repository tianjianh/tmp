Welsh holiday parks operator in £960m merger

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A firm running two tourist sites in Wales is set to merge to create one of the UK's biggest holiday park operators - worth an estimated £960m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parkdean - which runs Trecco Bay Holiday Park, in Porthcawl, Bridgend, and Pendine Sands, Carmarthenshire - will combine with Park Resorts Group.
The new firm will have 73 sites across the UK, with pre-tax and interest earnings of £100m a year.
Electra Private Equity, which partly owns Park Resorts, announced the move.
It said the merger would create a "business of real scale".
