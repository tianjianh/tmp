[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Nottinghamshire school once rated as outstanding is about to be placed in special measures, the BBC understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Edmund Campion Catholic Primary School, in West Bridgford, is expected to be criticised in an Ofsted report which is due to be published shortly.
Problems first emerged in January when the head teacher was suspended.
The South Nottingham Catholic Academy Trust, which runs the school, has declined to comment ahead of the report's publication.
St Edmund Campion is one of the top performing primary schools in the country.
In last summer's Sats exams, the 405-pupil school had a 100% attainment in reading, writing and maths.
Longstanding head Dorothy Longley was replaced at the beginning of the year but the trust declined to give an explanation.
The trust has now reportedly dissolved the board of governors.
Outside the school, parents expressed sympathy for Mrs Longley but complained about a lack of information.
They highlighted receiving only two emails since January, one to confirm the removal of the head and another to state no more detail could be released.
Duncan Emerson, who has two daughters at the school and has helped to set up a petition demanding answers from the trust, said he was "shocked and disappointed" at the news.
He said: "I am really unhappy the school is going into special measures but clearly we do not know what the investigation has found because we have no official information.
"I do think the trust has some question to ask about how they prepared the school for the Ofsted inspection but my main source of disappointment is the way this situation has been handled by the trust and indeed the Diocese of Nottingham."
He added: "We have been met with a wall of silence."
The trust and diocese said: "(We) do not comment on rumour but look forward to the post inspection report's publication and will respond to the report once it has been published".
