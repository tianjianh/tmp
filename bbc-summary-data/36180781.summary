[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Lowe scored twice in his final game for Bury as they came from behind to beat Southend and finish above them.

Frank Moussa fired in from the edge of the box to put the visitors in front, before Southend's Adam Barrett turned a cross from Lowe into his own net.
The Shrimpers regained the lead when David Mooney's effort went in off the post, but Lowe side-footed in to level.
Southend twice hit the woodwork and were punished when Lowe converted from the spot after Sam McQueen's handball.
Victory saw the Shakers end the season 14th, one point and one place above their opponents.
Veteran striker Lowe, 37, is set to rejoin Crewe, who have been relegated to League Two.

Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:
"Seeing Ryan Lowe step up in the 92nd minute to score is fitting on a day like this. The guy's an absolute true professional. I think he can keep going until he's 40, 41, 42.
"You never know how the season is going to pan out. You come to the end of it and see teams like Blackpool and Doncaster fighting for their lives. Some of these teams are Championship teams with a Championship set-up.
"Four more wins and a couple of draws and we get into the playoffs. We can possibly achieve that next season. We've consolidated and made staying in this league look easy."
