The 23-year-old took eight wickets in eight appearances in the County Championship last season.
"It was a frustrating year for Adam but it does not diminish our belief that he can reach his full potential," said chairman of cricket Graham Johnson.
"Adam has all the tools to become an international spinner and we hope the environment at Kent is the perfect place to help him realise that aim."
Kent have not disclosed the length of Riley's new deal at Canterbury.
The Sidcup-born right-armer, who came through Kent's youth set-up, said he was "delighted" to commit his future to the club.
"With Sam Northeast taking over as skipper and so many of our other key players also committing their futures, all signs suggest that we are a county heading in the right direction," Riley added.
"The squad is very excited to see what we can achieve next year."
