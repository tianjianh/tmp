Yasir has taken 149 wickets at an average of 29.91 in 26 Test matches for Pakistan, having made his debut against Australia in October 2014.
The 31-year-old, currently 13th in the ICC's Test bowling rankings, could make his debut against Durham on 8 June.
"Yasir is one of the finest spinners in the world," Kent head coach Matt Walker said.
"Taking 20 wickets consistently in red-ball cricket will be key to our promotion chances and a bowler of Yasir's calibre will help to us achieve that and rotate our attack at a key period in the season."
Kent are currently second in the Division Two table, having won four of their opening five games of the season.
The Canterbury-based side have already signed New Zealand's Adam Milne as an overseas player for the second-half of the season.
The seamer is due to arrive after the ICC Champions Trophy concludes on 18 June, but Kent can only play one of their overseas signings in the Championship.
