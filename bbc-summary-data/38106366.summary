Ireland's Taylor, a five-time world and 2012 Olympic champion, was simply in a different class to her Polish opponent.
Her bid to become a double Olympic gold medallist was shattered when she lost her opening bout in Rio in August.
Taylor's next fight is on the undercard of Anthony Joshua-Eric Molina on 10 December and she could challenge for a world title at the end of 2017.
"That would  be the dream, boxing for a world title in Dublin, or anywhere in Ireland," said the 30-year-old.
"I don't want to get too carried away, it was only my first fight as a pro, but I plan to do big things in this sport. I hope to be multiple-weight world champion."
Taylor softened up Kopinska with some stinging hooks to the body and head in the first two rounds before burying her under a barrage of blows halfway through the third.
Promoter Eddie Hearn said: "There was huge pressure on her, not just to get the win but to put in a performance. It couldn't have gone any better.
"She needed a good start to get hold of the non-believers. Forget about whether it is men's or women's boxing, she can fight and entertain."
Also on the bill at the SSE Arena in Wembley, Essex boxer Martin Ward successfully defended his British super-featherweight title with a unanimous decision over Scotland's Ronnie Clark.
In the first defence of his Lonsdale Belt, 25-year-old Ward survived a 10th-round knockdown to remain on course for a shot at the European title.
London prospect Ohara Davies outpointed Italy's Andrea Scarpa to win the WBC 'silver' light-welterweight title.
