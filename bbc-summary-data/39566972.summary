[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Great Britain have made just one change to their women's Olympic team for the European Gymnastics Championships in Romania.

Teenager Georgia-Mae Fenton replaces Amy Tinkler and will compete alongside Rio Olympians Claudia Fragapane, and Ellie and Becky Downie.
None of the men's Rio team, including medallists Max Whitlock, Louis Smith and Nile Wilson, are included.
However, 2012 Olympic medallist Sam Oldham returns to the team.
First-year senior Joe Fraser is set to make his international debut, as is Dom Cunningham. Courtney Tulloch, James Hall and Frank Baines complete the line-up.
Rio Olympians Whitlock, Smith and Kristian Thomas are taking a break from competition.
Wilson is injured, while Brinn Bevan is the other Rio member absent.
Men's head coach Eddie van Hoof said: "As the first European Championship of the new Olympic cycle, this competition gives the unknown a chance to become known.
"There are a number of medal opportunities for the taking."
Fenton, 16, makes her senior international debut having finished fourth in the all-around and winning silver on bars at the British Championships in March.
Tinkler, meanwhile, has been restricted in her start to the year by a calf strain and was not planning to compete.
Amanda Reddin, British women's head coach, said: "For Georgia-Mae, this is a well-deserved opportunity to test herself at the highest level.
"Becky, Ellie and Claudia have all taken medals at World and European level and so will go in to the championships aiming for more success."
The event in Cluj-Napoca runs from 19-23 April and is the first international competition for the GB team since their best ever Olympic haul of seven medals in Rio.
