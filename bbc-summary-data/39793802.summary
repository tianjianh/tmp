The 22-year-old England Under-23 international will be eligible for Wednesday's match against Bristol City.
Walsh was available after Notts folded on 21 April, and Yeovil needed a keeper after first-choice Charlotte Haynes was ruled out for eight weeks.
"What better way to get stuck in than the derby," she told the club website.
