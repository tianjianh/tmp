[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 0-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton and AFC Wimbledon shared the spoils in a 0-0 draw at Sixfields where neither side really did enough to warrant all three points.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors created the better openings in a game in which both defences were on top but were barely stretched.
Northampton started brightly, Kenji Gorre testing former Cobblers goalkeeper Ryan Clarke before John-Joe O'Toole headed over from a corner.
Wimbledon replied with Lyle Taylor heading over but at the other end Gorre skipped past three defenders before being denied by Clarke's flying save.
Wimbledon improved as the half progressed - Darius Charles was off target with a header, Jake Reeves had two efforts deflected past the uprights and Tom Elliott headed wide.
Taylor tested Adam Smith after the restart and Reeves fired wide as the visitors picked up from where they left off.
Cobblers struggled to create anything in the final third with Marc Richards and Alex Revell getting little support and no joy against Paul Robinson and Charles.
Elliott went close to breaking the deadlock with a shot on the turn which flew past the post.
Wimbledon posed the greater threat in a poor second half and Robinson's late header hit the bar before being scrambled clear.
