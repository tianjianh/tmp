[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old former Ghana international was released by the Cumbrian side in the summer after an 18-month spell, but has now returned.
"He has dynamics I like and things I don't think we currently have in our squad," said boss Keith Curle.
"He can still scare the life out of defences and his assets are great assets to have."
