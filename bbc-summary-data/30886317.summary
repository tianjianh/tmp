[SN]TITLE[SN]
Edward Belson denies fatal hockey stick attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man was beaten to death with a hockey stick by a neighbour in the Forest of Dean, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Cooling, 44, died after allegedly being attacked by Edward Belson at his home in Berry Hill, Coleford last August.
On the first day of the trial, Bristol Crown Court heard the men had both been drinking before the "vicious and sustained" attack.
The accused denies murder and the trial continues.
Prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees told the court there was a "history" between Mr Belson and Mr Cooling, who had been arrested and charged by police the previous week after an argument with Mr Belson's partner.
The accused, of Aston Close, Berry Hill, had drunk eight pints of lager and was confronted by the victim at his house on 3 August, the court heard.
He picked up a hockey stick and beat him "severely" with it, causing Mr Cooling to stagger back to his house, the jury was told.
The court heard he was incapacitated and the door had to be forced open by paramedics, who were unable to save him.
He died three hours later in hospital.
