[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police say burglars who stole a safe from a church may have been exposed to asbestos in its lining and should seek medical help.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The thieves stole the safe containing silver plates, chalices and other silverware from Pip and Jim's Church in St James Place, Ilfracombe, Devon on Saturday night.
The safe was found ripped open nearby.
Churchgoers held their Sunday morning service in a nearby pub while police investigations at the church continued.
Vicar's wife Alison Rogers, who discovered the burglary, said: "I was going to church to lead an act of worship and the back door was all in slivers where it had been damaged.
"I called the police and 10 minutes later they said they had found the safe. The burglars had put it on a trolley and taken it about 300 yards to Capstone Hill."
The service was held at Wetherspoon's pub in the town.
"It's just outside the church gates," said Mrs Rogers.
"It was a fabulous service. They have always been very kind to us."
No value has been put on the stolen silverware but Mrs Rogers said: "At least no-one was hurt."
Insp Ian Dawson of Devon and Cornwall Police said: "We would stress that the risk to the public is very low, as the safe was in an open area but it is clear the offenders may well have exposed themselves to any asbestos the safe contained when they forced it open,.
"As such they should take steps to ensure their own safety and the safety of family members or associates they have visited after the crime."
