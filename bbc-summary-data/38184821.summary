No further police action is being taken against a boy arrested in connection with the sexual assault of two girls at Legoland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The six-year-olds were "touched inappropriately" at a playground in the Windsor theme park on 11 August.
Thames Valley Police has re-issued an e-fit image of a man officers would like to speak to in connection with the investigation.
The case was the subject of a BBC One Crimewatch appeal in September.
The boy had been been released on bail after being arrested in November.  Thames Valley Police had refused to give his age or say where he was arrested, citing "safeguarding issues".
The assaults happened between 12:15 BST and 12:30 BST in the Pirate Shores area of the attraction on a day when about 14,200 attended the theme park.
Police described the suspect as white, in his teens or early 20s, possibly under 5ft 8in tall. He was wearing dark-coloured slim-fit trousers, a dark T-shirt and trainers.
A man in his 20s, from Bracknell, was later arrested on suspicion of sexual assault but released without charge on 31 August.
