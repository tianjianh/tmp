Emergency services were called to the flats in Aberfoyle Street, in the city's Haghill area, at about 06:20.
A 64-year-old man is being treated for serious injuries at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Residents have been given shelter at Haghill Sports Centre.
Fire crews and police remain at the scene. The cause is not yet known.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: "Around 0620 hours on Thursday 17 March 2016, police and emergency services responded to reports of a fire breaking out within the top floor of a block of flats on Aberfoyle Street, Glasgow, causing extensive smoke damage to the property.
"Police and emergency services attended and approximately 30 people were removed from their homes for safety.
"A full multi-agency response was initiated, with a rest centre established at Haghill Sports Centre to provide support for those who have been removed from their homes."
The police spokesman added: "Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service remain at the scene. A joint investigation will begin once the fire is fully extinguished."
The fire service said local crews from Springburn and Cowcaddens had been deployed to the scene.
The incident commander later requested additional crews from Calton and Easterhouse to help with the operation.
The fire service said the blaze was still ongoing "with crews working extremely hard" to extinguish it and "protect surrounding properties".
