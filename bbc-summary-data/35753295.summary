Aberdeen Bay offshore wind farm works under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Site investigations for a planned wind farm off Aberdeen - which has been opposed by Donald Trump - have begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developers hope to site 11 turbines off the coast, with full offshore construction scheduled to start in late 2017 or early 2018.
The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC) is close to US presidential hopeful Mr Trump's golfing development at Menie.
Geotechnical site investigation will take place at each turbine location.
Vattenfall and Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) - the partners behind Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm Limited (AOWFL) - said the work keeps the scheme on schedule.
Mr Trump's legal challenge to the offshore wind farm was rejected by the UK's Supreme Court in December.
The businessman was taking on the Scottish government, which approved the plan.
He said the turbines would spoil the view.
Mr Trump made a series of legal challenges in the Scottish courts and then took the fight to the UK's Supreme Court in London.
