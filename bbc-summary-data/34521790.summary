[SN]TITLE[SN]
Reaction to formation of Loyalist Community Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A round-up of reaction to the launch of a new Loyalist Community Council (LLC)

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"The government is willing to give a cautious welcome to proposals aimed at moving different groups away from crime, but the initiative need to be judged on its results.
"There is no justification for the existence of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, and we need to move forward to a time when they all disband"
"The fact that three paramilitary groups have given their backing to this initiative is a positive statement of intent that they are prepared to look at how we can move forward in Northern Ireland.
"Any proposals which can help in a transition away from the issues which have blighted many communities must be welcomed. If we are to have a more normal society here, then that should be one free from paramilitary activity on all sides"
"The continuing criminality of loyalist paramilitary groups remains a scourge in loyalist working-class areas.
"So, while I welcome today's initiative, I do have some reservations.
"All paramilitary groups - including so called republican ones - need to embrace our peace and political processes and develop their own political projects through solely peaceful and democratic means.
"This raises the issue of the demobilisation of such groups, an issue which requires further consideration and discussion."
"Any genuine attempt to move paramilitary gangs away from violence is to be cautiously welcomed but there is something worrying about formalising and co-opting these organisations in order to have them leave the stage.
"The success of this new Loyalist Community Council will only be measured by tangible evidence that loyalist paramilitaries have disappeared.
"There are a number of problems with this new body, not least that the council will include members from each the UDA, the UVF and the Red Hand Commando which are all proscribed organisations that are still active in racketeering, intimidation and violence across Northern Ireland.
"Decades on from the ceasefire, the message to young men in loyalist communities is still being given that whether through extortion or a designated conflict transformation job, being a paramilitary is an acceptable way to make your living."
"We would much prefer that all paramilitary groups left the stage completely.
"We give this statement a cautious welcome.
"If genuine, it could be a significant step on that road."
"Twenty-one years after ceasefires and 17 years after the Good Friday Agreement, all paramilitary organisations should have long since ceased to exist instead of subverting democracy, the rule of law, good relations and development through illegal means.
"Paramilitary violence and criminality does nothing to tackle inequality or support re-imaging and regeneration in areas that need it the most in our community.
"The message must be very clear - there is no place for paramilitarism or violence of any kind in a new and shared Northern Ireland. There should be no need for anyone to clarify a commitment to purely peaceful, democratic and law-abiding means at this stage."
"We acknowledge the efforts made to encourage loyalist paramilitaries to participate constructively in an ongoing process towards a better society.
"This has to be a society in which more people feel included and engaged and where educational underachievement and other disadvantages are tackled.
"Mindful of those who have suffered and continue to suffer much hurt and pain, it also has to be a society in which violence and criminality have no place whatsoever.
"Such activity needs to stop, if communities are not only to live in peace, but to flourish."
"I am proud of the Unfinished Work initiative that David McNarry has undertaken alongside others over the past 18 months.
"I welcome these positive steps and fully support both the initiative, and the drive towards a fuller, lasting peace that it represents.
"As we have seen recently, there is unfinished business in the peace process and David has been indefatigable in working to ensure there will be no loose ends
"This initiative and today's announcement broadens the democratic process in Northern Ireland and I believe it will give further confidence to the Unionist community that decisions are taken with their concerns taken seriously."
"We welcome the fact that the LCC have rejected all violence and criminality, and we welcome the announcement that it is their desire to work in their communities with the objective of eliminating social and economic difficulties which impact on working class people.
"Congress will, wherever possible, assist in the endeavour."
