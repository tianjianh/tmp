[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd back in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former drummer with rock band AC/DC Phil Rudd has appeared in court accused of consuming alcohol in breach of a home detention sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rudd, who was arrested on Saturday, made no plea and will appear again at the New Zealand court in two weeks.
Earlier this month, Rudd, 61, was sentenced to eight months in house detention for drug possession and making threats to kill.
Rudd will not be taking part in AC/DC's current world tour.
After his latest arrest, Rudd must undergo drug and alcohol testing when required.
He stuck two fingers up at on looking media as he arrived in court, stuff.co.nz reported.
Rudd was sentenced to house detention just under two weeks ago for threatening to "take out" a former employee and possessing marijuana and methamphetamine.
Judge Thomas Ingram said home detention was the most appropriate punishment - but warned that he would be closely monitored and jail would be the next step if the drummer stepped out of line.
"I stone-cold guarantee that's where you'll end up," the judge said during sentencing.
"The temptations of the rock star lifestyle have caused your downfall here."
