The celebration of literature takes place from 11 to 14 June in Melrose.
Among those appearing for the first time are Patricia Hodge, Celia Imrie, Andrew Marr, Jonathan Miller, Dom Joly, Michelle Mone and Terry Waite.
Politicians Alex Salmond and Gordon Brown are also included in the line-up, as well as regulars like James Naughtie, Peter Snow and Rory Bremner.
In addition, there is a culinary theme with the Year of Food and Drink in 2015 being celebrated with the launch of a new venue "Eat Your Words".
To mark the 150th anniversary of the publication of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, the festival will be "embracing all things Alice".
Events for adults include an exclusive one-off performance featuring Rory Bremner, John Sessions, John Bird and Patricia Hodge.
Children can take part in treasure hunts, storytelling, and the White Rabbit will be appearing in costume to meet them throughout the weekend.
Alistair Moffat, festival director, said: "We're proud to present our biggest, most diverse and most tasty book festival programme ever.
"We can, hand on heart, say there is something to entertain everyone over the weekend, whether its opera, politics, adventure, history, cookery or simply superb fiction."
