Over 15,000 competed in categories including singing and dancing at the Urdd at Llancaiach Fawr in Nelson.
The Urdd began in 1922 to help young people learn and socialise in the Welsh language. It has become one of Europe's biggest youth festivals.
Next year's week-long event will be held in Flintshire.
