So what exactly has this 47-year-old luminary done in her career?
She was born into the British establishment where her mother and father both served in Sir John Major's government.
Ms Hogg's father is Douglas Hogg, 3rd Viscount Hailsham, a barrister and a former Conservative MP between 1979 and 2010.
He gained some notoriety when it emerged that he claimed Â£2,000 in expenses to clean the moat at the family's country estate of Kettlethorpe Hall, near Lincoln.
Her mother Sarah Hogg, Baroness Hailsham, is an economist and former journalist.
She was the first woman to chair a FTSE 100 company - the private equity firm 3i - and is a former governor of the BBC.
She is a non-executive member of the Financial Conduct Authority and a non-executive director at the John Lewis Partnership.
The family's heritage is deeply rooted in British politics, specifically with the Conservative party.
Ms Hogg's paternal grandfather, Quintin Hogg, 2nd Viscount Hailsham and barrister, was leader of the House of Lords when Harold Macmillan was prime minister and later served as lord chancellor.
Her maternal grandfather, John Boyd-Carpenter, was transport minister then minister of pensions and national insurance under both Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan.
Her brother, Quintin, works in the strategy unit of Barclays' investment bank.
Ms Hogg is a graduate of Oxford University where she read economics and history and won a Kennedy scholarship to study at Harvard. She began her career in 1992 at the Bank of England as a graduate trainee for two years.
She then spent 14 years working in the US, first at consultancy firm McKinsey, whose alumni includes the likes of Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Dido Harding, the outgoing chief executive of telecoms group TalkTalk.
Between 2001 and 2008, Ms Hogg moved to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley before returning to the UK to become managing director, UK and Ireland, for the credit checking company Experian.
In 2011, Ms Hogg was appointed as head of Santander's UK high street banking operation. The following year she was paid Â£2.5m.
Ms Hogg returned to the Bank of England in 2013 in the newly created role of chief operating officer and was, at that point, the most senior female employee in the institution's 309-year history.
She is a former director of BBC Worldwide and, while in the US was a board member of Partnership with Children, which provides mental health support for students and works with families across New York City.
A keen horse rider, Ms Hogg is married to Steven Sacks, chief customer officer at luxury fashion group Burberry and chairman of the English National Ballet School. They have two children.
