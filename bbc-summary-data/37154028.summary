Three rescues for holidaymaker cut off by Cornwall tide

A young woman holidaying in Cornwall was rescued by the same lifeboat crew three times in four days after being cut off by the tide.

She was saved by the RNLI on Tuesday, Thursday and again on Friday.
In each case, she had been cut off by the tide while out walking and the D-class inshore lifeboat crews had to go into the water to rescue her.
She has since been given a "comprehensive safety briefing", the RNLI said.
It said sea and weather conditions last week meant none of the rescues had been particularly easy.
"The spring tides can catch people out, especially holidaymakers, who are unaware of the tidal cycles and speed that the tide can come in," said Brian Bowdler, helm of Looe lifeboat.
Despite her triple rescue ordeal, the woman was unhurt and said to be "fine".
