The teenager was walking along St Winning's Road in Kilwinning at about 22:30 on Saturday when he was confronted by the men near St Winning's Primary School and assaulted.
Det Sgt John Deans said the boy was badly injured in the attack.
"It's imperative we find those involved - they clearly have no qualms about attacking children," he said.
The first man was aged 30-40, about 5ft 3in tall, of slim build. He was bald and wearing glasses.
The second man was aged 20-30, about 6ft 2in tall and was well built. He was wearing a black beanie hat and tracksuit top.
The third man was about 5ft 9in tall, of slim build and was wearing a dark hooded top.
Det Sgt Deans, of Police Scotland, said: "I'm appealing to anyone who may have been in the area around the time of the incident to contact us. You may know who the men are, or you may have heard some information about the incident, please do get in touch."
