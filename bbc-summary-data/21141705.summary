Guns N' Roses have followed U2, Katy Perry and Metallica by announcing a 3D concert film of a show from their 12-night residency in Las Vegas last year.

A release has been promised in theatres, on TV and DVD later this year, via an official Facebook page.
Appetite for Democracy is being captured by 3D company Rock Fuel Media.
"It doesn't quite feel like being at the concert but it does feel like the next best thing," said Screen Daily editor Wendy Mitchell of the 3D format.
"It brings so much more to a concert film to have that third dimension," she said. "It goes from being something we've all seen and experienced a lot, to an event, an experience, especially when you're going to the cinema to see it.
"It's very immersive, you get more of the staging of a big concert."
Concert films featuring established artists can be big business.
Miley Cyrus and fellow teen act Jonas Brothers have released 3D concert films, while Justin Bieber's Never Say Never holds the title for the highest grossing music concert movie in the US, with worldwide sales of $98.6 million (Â£74.3m).
However, the film split critics with one unimpressed reviewer calling it a "promotional documentary" and "an unimaginative concert movie."
Katy Perry: Part of Me, a documentary which chronicled the US pop star's life on stage and off, was released in July 2012.
It made a total of $32.4m (Â£24.4) worldwide and is the fourth highest-grossing music concert film of all time.
However, it is not just the commercial pop acts that are choosing to release their concert footage in 3D.
In 2008, U2 3D charted the Vertigo Tour of 2006 and rock band Metallica have announced the release of Through the Never on 9 August this year.
It is a combination of concert footage and a mini-film featuring actor Dane DeHaan, directed by Nimrod Antal, whose credits include Predators.
Mitchell said it seems like a natural progression for Axl Rose and his bandmates to put out a 3D film, after 27 years.
"For a band like Guns N' Roses, it's not trying to be pop perfection like Katy Perry. People want to see them rocking out and sweaty even if they are a bit older.  A lot of their fans grew up with them, they don't have to be perfect."
She added: "These Vegas shows were well received, so it just seems that more people around the world will be able to experience that."
