Footage apparently showing development squad members Tom Hopper, Adam Smith and James Pearson - son of manager Nigel Pearson - was obtained by the Sunday Mirror.
One of the men in the video, which was shot in Thailand, can be heard using a racist insult against a woman.
The club said they would be conducting a formal process of investigation.
A club statement said: "The board of Leicester City is deeply concerned about an incident involving three of our young professionals during a recent trip to Thailand.
"Following a preliminary meeting in consultation with the three players earlier today, the players involved in the incident are now returning to the UK, in advance of the rest of the squad.
"Tom Hopper, James Pearson and Adam Smith would like to convey their sincere apologies for their behaviour - to the women involved in the incident, to the club and its owners, to the club's fans and to their families."
The Premier League team were on tour in Thailand, home of the Foxes' billionaire owners father and son Vichai and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha.
The club are in a "strategic partnership" with the Tourism Authority of Thailand, and the Amazing Thailand branding appears on the back of player's strips.
Manager Pearson has campaigned against racism and is a patron of the charity Show Racism the Red Card.
A spokesman for football equality charity Kick It Out said it was aware of the allegations and was awaiting a response from the club before it would comment further.
Of the three men, only Pearson has made a first team appearance in the Foxes' Capital One Cup defeat by Shrewsbury Town.
