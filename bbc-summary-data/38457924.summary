The 35-year-old victim was woken up by repeated knocking at her front door in Heald Green, Stockport on 20 December, and attacked after opening it.
Police said it was a "terrifying attack" and the woman's children could hear her screaming.
The suspect is described as about 20 years old, 6ft (1.8m) tall, of a slim build and Asian, wearing a hooded top.
Det Insp Julia Bowden said: "Incidents of this nature are horrifying but rare and we are doing everything in our power to find the man responsible.
"I would urge anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area at the time to please contact us immediately."
