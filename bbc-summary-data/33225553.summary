[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Craig Walker admitted engaging in sexual activity with a 15-year-old boy in May 2014 while he was his tutor.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard the boy had previously been a pupil at a school in the town where Walker worked.
He was convicted of sexually assaulting the other teenager between 2006 and 2013. The court heard the attacks took place after the boy had left care.
Sheriff Seith Ireland said that due to the gravity of the offences, custody could not be avoided.
He jailed Walker, who is from Paisley, for 24 months and told him he would be monitored in the community for two years after his release.
