The crash happened in Granges-pres-Marnand in Vaud canton, about 50km (30 miles) south-west of the capital, Bern.
The regional trains collided head-on in the early evening.
The driver of one of the trains died in the incident and his body was recovered from the wreckage early on Tuesday morning, Swiss police said.
Emergency workers had succeeded in separating the two locomotives and found the driver's body in one of them.
An autopsy has been ordered to formally establish his identity, a police statement said.
The other driver was among the injured.
The most seriously injured passengers had earlier been taken to hospital by helicopter or ambulance. Others were treated at the scene.
One of the trains involved was bound for Lausanne, about 38km (22 miles) to the south, while the other was travelling north from the same city, AFP news agency reports.
There would be no trains on the line between the towns of Lucens and Payerne on Tuesday, local police said.
Investigators are at the scene to try to determine the cause of the crash.
Switzerland's rail system is considered among the best and safest in the world.
Earlier this month, 79 people were killed in a high-speed derailment in north-western Spain.
