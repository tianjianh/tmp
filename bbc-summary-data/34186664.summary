[SN]TITLE[SN]
Radical preacher Anjem Choudary leaves prison

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Radical preacher Anjem Choudary, who is awaiting trial for allegedly encouraging support for the Islamic State group, has left prison after being granted bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Choudary, 48, from Ilford, east London, was bailed last Friday when he appeared at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh Prison.
A judge said Mr Choudary had found someone to stand surety of Â£15,000.
At an earlier hearing he indicated he would plead not guilty to the charges.
Another man, Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, is also accused of inviting support for so-called Islamic State (IS).
He remains on remand but has been granted bail in principle on the same conditions, should a suitable individual be identified to offer surety.
Both men have already spent months on police bail following their arrest last September. They were remanded in custody after being charged in August.
The charges against Mr Rahman, from Whitechapel, also in east London, and Mr Choudary relate to social media activity between 29 June 2014 and 6 March 2015.
Mr Rahman has also indicated he denies the charge.
Mr Choudary and Mr Rahman are due back in court for a plea and case management hearing on 11 December, with a provisional trial date set for 11 January 2016.
The trial is scheduled to be heard by a High Court judge and is expected to last three to four weeks.
