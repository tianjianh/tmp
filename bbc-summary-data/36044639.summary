Low turnout in Bognor Regis to 'abolish' Arun Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people in Bognor Regis have voted to abolish their district council in a non-binding referendum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They voted three-to-one in favour of ditching Arun District Council but only 435 people (2.8%) turned out.
The Parish Poll was proposed by town councillor Jan Cosgrove who said cutting districts and boroughs would save millions of pounds.
But fellow councillor Adam Cunard said the poll cost Â£20,000 and was a "complete waste of time".
He said turnout was "disastrous" and predicted Arun "would take very little notice".
The council's Chief Executive Nigel Lynn said the result was non-binding and would be considered in the context of "the lowest ever recorded turnout in Arun's history".
Mr Cosgrove said it would have been higher if the campaign was longer.
Voters were also in favour of merging Bognor's six parish councils and a seafront regeneration plan, which was recently rejected by Arun councillors.
A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: "The government is willing to listen to any proposals which deliver better local services, greater value for money and stronger local leadership."
