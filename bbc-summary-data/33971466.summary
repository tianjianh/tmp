The system Scotland uses for the testing of pupils in the classroom will be re-examined, the country's first minister has pledged.

Nicola Sturgeon said there needed to be a "national improvement framework" as councils had different approaches.
She believed an improved system would help lead to better pupil attainment.
Ahead of Ms Sturgeon's speech in Wester Hailes, Scottish Labour said there needed to be "bold changes" to improve education for the poorest children.
The first minister promised that her government would "close completely" the attainment gap between poor and rich pupils.
She believed every young person should receive the "same advantages" that she did when growing up in Ayrshire.
Ms Sturgeon said: "If they [pupils] have the talent and work hard enough, they can achieve their dreams.
"This is a challenge for local government, the Scottish government and society as a whole, and I am determined that my government will show leadership."
However, Labour's Iain Gray said that despite eight years of an SNP government the "reality" was that pupils from richer backgrounds still performed "much better" than those from deprived areas.
He added: "It's just not right that three quarters of S2 pupils from the poorest backgrounds don't have the counting skills they need.
"A child starting high school this week will have spent every year of their education under the SNP government.
"Instead of yet another speech from the first minister, it's time the SNP government actually did something to close the gap between rich and poor in Scotland's schools."
On the subject of standardised assessments, Ms Sturgeon said that local authorities recognised their importance but because they used different systems it made it "much more difficult to get a clear and consistent picture of progress".
She added that she would provide greater detail in her legislative address to the Scottish Parliament in two weeks' time.
However, Ms Sturgeon said the basic purpose of the review was to:
Responding to the speech, the Scottish Conservative's Liz Smith said the SNP's record in education "was a miserable failure".
She added: "When they [the Scottish government] see falling rates of literacy and numeracy, a widening attainment gap between rich and poor, cuts to teacher number and 140,000 fewer college places, they know something is very badly wrong and the blame lies entirely at the door of a Scottish government which has become obsessed with the wrong priorities."
The leader of Scotland's biggest teaching union, the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), welcomed Ms Sturgeon's comments.
Larry Flanagan, said: "This was a very positive speech from the first minister, in which she spent a good deal of time praising the work of Scotland's schools and teachers.
"Ms Sturgeon also highlighted the progress that has been made in the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence, and gave very welcome recognition to the improvements that have been delivered for pupils across Scotland."
