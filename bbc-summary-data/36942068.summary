Thousands of fans crowded bookstores for the midnight release of the book, with many dressed as their favourite characters from Rowling's novels.
Based on a story by JK Rowling, playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany, 'The Cursed Child' picks up the story 19 years after the end of the last book, featuring Potter as a 37-year-old employee of the Ministry of Magic and father of three.
Newsround asked for kids, who have read the latest Potter story, to send in their reviews.
