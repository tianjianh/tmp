[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tries from Coenie Oosthuizen, Cobus Reinach and Bryan Habana helped South Africa beat Italy in Padua despite a laboured performance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Heyneke Meyer's side, who beat England last weekend after losing to Ireland, went behind to Kelly Haimona's penalty.
Pat Lambie's kick levelled before Oosthuizen ploughed over from a scrum.
Haimona kicked three more points before the break, but Reinach finished an excellent move before Handre Pollard raced clear to set up Habana late on.
Despite competing well in the scrum against a South Africa side showing four changes to the one that had won 31-28 at Twickenham, Italy could not break down the visiting defence.
Habana's try was his 57th in 105 Tests and ensured that the Springboks head to Cardiff for next Saturday's match against Wales on the back of two victories.
