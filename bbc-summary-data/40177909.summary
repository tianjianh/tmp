Scott Baldwin: Wales have 'better blend' for 2017 summer tour

Hooker Scott Baldwin says there is a "better blend" to Wales' squad for this summer's two Tests compared to the group he was part of during the last British and Irish Lions tour.

Ospreys' Baldwin was in a vastly inexperienced Wales side that could only draw the series in Japan in 2013.
But the 28-year-old says Wales have more experience in their squad four years to face Tonga and Samoa.
"That's only going to bode well for us," he said.
"There has been a lot more players that have been in and around the environment for probably the past 12 to 18 months if not longer.
"There's a lot better blend this time and we've got the senior boys - in the backs we've got Scott Williams and Jamie Roberts."
Harlequins centre Roberts is captain of a squad which contains 12 uncapped players with a further 12 players on Lions duty in New Zealand.
Wing Steff Evans is among the uncapped players in the squad, linking up with the national team after featuring in Scarlets' Pro12 final win over Munster.
The 22-year-old was part of the 2016 Six Nations squad and although he did not feature in the Championships he feels he benefited from the experience.
"I was happy to be involved in the Six Nations set-up and wasn't really frustrated," said the Pro12 top try scorer for 2016-17.
"It was good to gain experience and I came out of the Six Nations scoring six tries after it so obviously I gained other attributes in my game coming out of that.
"I'm still waiting but if the time comes I'll take it with both hands.
"If not I'm here to gain experience and build myself as a player inside the Welsh environment."
