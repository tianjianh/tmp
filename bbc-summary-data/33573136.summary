Nathaniel Hamilton, 31, from Acacia Avenue, Walsall, was found guilty of attempted murder, rape and assault earlier at Birmingham Crown Court.
One woman, who was 18 at the time, was left with a perforated eardrum and bruises on her neck which "were matched to the trainers Hamilton wore".
Hamilton had previously been the subject of a BBC film Bad Boy about his attempts to "go straight".
The court heard Hamilton attacked the women because he thought they had been unfaithful.
His sentencing also took into account several other occasions when he had beaten the 18-year-old so badly she had needed hospital treatment.
She was left with a perforated eardrum, severe bruising to her neck and a permanently disfigured jaw after Hamilton forced his way into her flat on 9 November last year.
He dragged her on to the floor before grabbing her around the throat and strangling her until she lost consciousness, the court heard.
Following the sentencing, Sgt Alisha Reavley, of West Midlands Police, said: "The force that Hamilton used could easily have killed his victim.
"The degree of injury caused was so severe that bruising on her neck could be matched to the trainers that Hamilton wore.
"This was the last straw for this young girl who had suffered months of abuse from Hamilton."
He had also assaulted a previous ex-girlfriend after "luring her to his home under false pretences" and threatened her with what was said to be a sawn-off shotgun.
"The 24-year-old was hit across the neck with the gun and strangled until she almost lost consciousness," said Sgt Reavley.
"The sentence handed to Hamilton today is testament to the bravery of his victims."
He will remain on the sex offenders register for life.
The 2004 BBC documentary Bad Boy followed Hamilton's release from prison for a previous offence and charted his integration back into society.
