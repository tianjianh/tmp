The 24-year-old was part of the Great Britain team who took gold at the European Championships in Italy in December.
Griffiths will hope to get closer to world record holder Steve Jones' record of nine Welsh cross country titles.
"I believe in my own ability and I've been number one this season," Griffiths told BBC Wales Sport
He continued: "I've beaten everyone. It's just about producing the win on the day.
"Cross country is what gives you the strength on the track. All the best track runner have always done cross country in the winter to build their strength and stamina up so when you get to the track you can do the speed."
Griffiths competed in the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014 but was hampered by a stress fracture.
"I think in Glasgow I was still pretty raw in a way," he added.
"There was only really one year of good training in me as a senior then and I had a big injury unfortunately.
"But I've had two or three season now of consistent training where I'm getting quicker every year. Hopefully in the next couple of years I can get quicker again."
