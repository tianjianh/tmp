The 30-year-old originally joined the Premiership side on trial after leaving regional side Newport Gwent Dragons.
He has won nine caps for his country, the most recent in June 2012, and helped Wales win the 2009 World Sevens.
"He was looking for a fresh start, and will give us some more experience and depth to the squad," said Bath director of rugby Todd Blackadder.
