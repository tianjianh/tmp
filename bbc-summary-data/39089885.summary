Fourteen tries were scored on the artificial pitch at Cumbernauld but Wales were always in control after leading 27-0.
Wales' Wales have nine points from three Six Nations matches following an opening win over Italy and home defeat against England
"After the England game, I thought a lot of individuals put in outstanding performances," Strange said
Wales recorded their fourth try for the bonus point after just 41 minutes and went on to score eight, but Scotland hit back with six of their own.
The superb goal-kicking of Ben Jones, who landed 11 goals from 12 attempts, allowed Wales to stay well ahead throughout.
Strange was "pleased overall" with the performance of his side, who are third in the Championship table.
"I think it was excellent to watch, a pleasure to see some of the tries we scored and full credit to the players," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"There's bits of work to do (in defence) but we turned the ball over on a number  of occasions that led to counter-attack tries."
Ospreys centre Kieran Williams was man-of-the-match after scoring two of Wales' eight tries.
"It was a fast, frantic game, but I think we controlled it for most parts although it was disappointing the number of points we conceded" said Williams.
"But that's something we can work on in training and against Ireland we'll be way better."
Strange hopes Wales are now back in contention for the title despite a home defeat by England at Colwyn Bay in round two.
They return to Parc Eirias to host Ireland on Saturday, 11 March.
"We've put ourselves back in the hunt, we've got crucial games against Ireland and France," Strange added.
"But it's just about getting better, we did that (against Scotland) and it's something to take forward not just for the Six Nations but also the World Cup."
