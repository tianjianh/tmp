Austria's double European champion Janine Flock won gold by 0.8 secs after breaking the track record in heat one.
Canada's Mirela Rahneva secured her first World Cup podium finish in third, while Britain's Laura Deas finished in 10th place.
Yarnold, 28, leads the World Cup standings by eight points from Jacqueline Loelling of Germany.
The 2014 Sochi Olympic champion finished fourth in the first World Cup meeting of the season in Whistler on 3 December, her first race in 18 months following an extended break after winning World Championship gold in March 2015.
Yarnold was well in contention for gold after the first heat, but her second heat was 0.7 secs slower after a skid through the chicane.
