Uruguay profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uruguayans can access a wide range of views via more than 100 private newspapers, more than 100 radio stations and some 20 TV channels. Cable TV is widely available.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
State-run radio and TV are operated by the official broadcasting service, SODRE. Some newspapers are owned by, or linked to, the main political parties.
Freedom of speech and media are guaranteed by the constitution, with qualifications for inciting violence or "insulting the nation".
Rights body Reporters Without Borders says Uruguay "stands out as an exception on a continent with a very marked media polarisation".
More than 1.8 million Uruguayans are online (Internetworldstats.com, June 2012). Facebook is the top social media platform.
