[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The annual budget for promoting tourism in Wales would be doubled, from £7m to £14m, under a Plaid Cymru Welsh government, the party has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plaid said boosting Visit Wales' budget recognised tourism's importance for jobs and attracting investment.
Plaid Cymru ministers would designate 2018 a "Year of Welsh Food and Drink" and 2019 a "Celebrate Wales" year.
Plaid leader Leanne Wood said a Welsh tourism academy, with a conference centre and hotel, would also be built.
Ahead of campaigning in Caernarfon for May's assembly election, she said: "A Plaid Cymru government would promote Wales as a world-class, sustainable tourism destination with activities and experiences based on our natural resources, our produce, our unique coast and landscape and our language, culture and heritage."
