It will be the fourth time the thrash metal legends will have taken the top spot at both sites, having first topped the bill 18 years ago.
Lars Ulrich from the band said: "We're obviously beyond thrilled to be returning to headline the magnificent and mighty Reading & Leeds.
"We are practically the house band. Bring it!"
It's all much less controversial than when they were announced as one of Glastonbury 2013's main acts.
Some argued they were too heavy for the "hippy" vibe of the festival and others complained about frontman James Hetfield's apparent love of bear hunting.
The first wave of other artists has also been announced.
Jamie T, Pierce The Veil, Wilkinson Live and Run The Jewels are all on the line-up for the August bank holiday 2015.
"We've been dying to do these Festivals ever since we started touring in the UK," said Vic Fuentes from Pierce The Veil.
"It's such an honour to be a part of something that people wait all year round to see."
There has been no word on when the rest of the line-up will be announced but organiser Melvin Benn promises "brilliant acts from across the genres."
"I'm looking forward to revealing the rest of the festival line up, which will feature the absolute best of rock, indie, dance and hip hop."
This year's festival was headlined by Queens of the Stone Age, Paramore, Arctic Monkeys and Blink-182.
