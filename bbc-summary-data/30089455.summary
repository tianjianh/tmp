France U21s 3-2 England U21s: Gareth Southgate's side beaten

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England Under-21s squandered a two-goal lead as their 11-game winning run was ended with a 3-2 defeat by France.

Gareth Southgate's side led when Harry Kane lifted a clever finish past home keeper Alphonse Areola, then tapped in a second from Tom Ince's cross-shot.
But Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo scored two tap-ins for France to level by half-time and substitute Kingsley Coman struck a winner into the top corner.
Danny Ings headed wide as England suffered a first defeat in over a year.
That previous defeat was a 1-0 loss to Israel at the European Under-21 Championships in 2013, and Southgate now only has two matches to work out his best line-up before taking part in the same competition next June.
He opted to shuffle his pack for this latest test at Stade Francis-Le Ble in Brittany, making five changes from the 3-1 win over Portugal on Thursday.
It would prove costly as France, with Marseille youngster Florian Thauvin influential in midfield, looked as impressive as they had in European Championship qualifying - prior to their surprise play-off defeat by Sweden.
Spurs forward Kane filled in ably for top scorer in qualifying Saido Berahino, elevated to the senior squad, and lifted the opener over the on-rushing French keeper from Ince's smart pass before profiting again within two minutes when Ince swivelled in the box to create a tap-in.
But the lead looked harsh on France and they responded when Sanogo got a faint touch on Antoine Conte's volley.
Tauvin burst through England's defensive line to force a brave block from Middlesbrough's Ben Gibson - who later went off injured - but the equaliser arrived when Sanogo, who is yet to score for Arsenal, converted Paul-Georges Ntep's cut-back.
France sealed a deserved win over Southgate's side when Coman produced a confident side-foot finish into the top corner on 74 minutes.
Burnley's Ings headed wide from a corner late on but England did not threaten meaningfully again.
