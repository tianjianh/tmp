Scarlets have injury worries over prop Samson Lee and fly-half Rhys Patchell ahead of their key Pro 12 match with Ulster on Friday.

Wales prop Samson Lee left the field with a tight calf muscle during  Scarlets' 15-10 win over Cardiff Blues while Patchell rolled an ankle.
Coach Wayne Pivac says both will be assessed as his team face a six day turnaround.
"We'll know more in 48 hours," Pivac told BBC Wales Sport.
He continued: "Samson's calf was tightening and you leave him out there and it could have been a lot worse potentially" said Pivac.
"We've just got to be careful that we don't push that too hard too soon but obviously the next 48 hours are going to be pretty important for Samson.
"Patch has rolled his ankle so again the next 48 hours it'll be on ice.
"He'll go into a moon boot now and just do everything he can to reduce the swelling and then hopefully he will be available for selection.
They are likely to be without forward Tadhg Beirne against the Irish province after he failed a head injury assessment following a big tackle by Blues prop Taufa'ao Felise.
Scarlets moved into fourth place in the Pro 12 after their win against the Blues, but after a five-day break following their 19-9 defeat by the Ospreys will have only one training session before they face fifth-placed Ulster.
"That Ospreys match was a fair-dinkum test match," said Pivac.
"And it probably took its toll today. In this day and age to come off a game like that it does take its toll and the Blues had an extra 24 hours which is a lot in these short turnarounds.
"The attention turns now to a big game on Friday. Ulster could be the team we're vying with for the top four so it doesn't get an easier.
"We only had the one training run ahead of the Blues game - the players had two recovery days - and we'll do the same again now for this Ulster game.
"It's just being smart really and we think that's the best thing to do at the moment."
