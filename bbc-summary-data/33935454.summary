The former Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside is to get £8m to make progress with redevelopment of the site.

North Tyneside Council plans to turn the 32 acre (13 hectare) site into a centre for the renewable energy, advanced engineering and offshore sectors.
The authority expects the completed site will create about 1,000 new jobs.
North Tyneside elected mayor Norma Redfearn said the site was "very much open for business".
"We've got the infrastructure in place, a development partner actively working with us to provide premises and employers for the site and now this extra funding that will open up even more space for investment," she said.
The money, secured by the North East Local Enterprise Partnership, will be used to fill a redundant wet berth at the old shipyard, creating more space for potential businesses.
It is part of an £100m investment by development funds, the local authority and the private sector.
