[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh tax collection authority law proposal published

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A proposed law to create the first tax collection system for Wales in 800 years has been published.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tax Collection and Management Bill will create a new Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA) with the power to collect and manage taxes.
The legislation paves the way for the devolution of tax powers - the first Welsh taxes since the Middle Ages.
From April 2018, Welsh ministers will be responsible for landfill tax and a replacement for stamp duty.
This will be called the Welsh land transaction tax.
The bill creates a taxpayers' charter, putting duties on people to pay penalties as well as setting out their rights and responsibilities.
It also outlines the duties of the WRA, but gives no estimate on the cost of setting up the authority.
No extra funding is being provided by Westminster.
Finance Minister Jane Hutt has already said the WRA will work with existing authorities to smooth the introduction of the taxes.
HM Revenue and Customs will be involved in the collection of the land transaction tax while environment body Natural Resources Wales will help collect the landfill tax.
Ms Hutt said: "Businesses and taxpayers deserve a system of taxation that is fundamentally simple and transparent.
"The tax arrangements we are putting in place provide consistency and minimise the burden on taxpayers whilst enabling tax compliance."
