Skipper Chloe Watkins got the Irish off to a great start with a fifth-minute field goal and Anna O'Flanagan doubled the lead in the 52nd minute.
Malaysia scored through Hanis Onn but the late goal wasn't enough to deny the Irish victory.
They complete their group series fixtures by facing Hong Kong on Tuesday (10:15 GMT).
Ireland opened the event with a thumping 12-0 win over Kazakhstan.
The tournament is Ireland's first round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup and they want a top two finish to qualify for World League 3, where they could play in either Belgium (21 June-2 July) or South Africa (8-23 July) depending on rankings.
Ireland are the second highest ranked team in the tournament as they sit 16th, with only Italy, 15th, ranked above them.
Pool A has Italy joined by Thailand, Wales and Singapore with rankings of 15, 31, 32 and 43 respectively.
