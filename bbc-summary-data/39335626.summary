Dundee United 2-1 Ayr United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United claimed their first Championship win since 4 February and moved back to within a point of second place by beating Ayr United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Murray struck from a difficult angle to put the Tangerines ahead midway through the first half.
However, Ayr won a penalty when Tony Andreu fouled Brian Gilmour and Gary Harkins converted.
Mark Durnan edged the hosts back into the lead, sending a left-foot shot past Greg Fleming.
The Tannadice side had won the Challenge Cup on Saturday with victory over St Mirren and the defeat of Ayr gets their push for promotion back on track.
However, Ray McKinnon's side trail leaders Hibernian by 11 points and are one behind Morton, who have a game in hand.
Falkirk, who are ahead of Morton on goal difference, have played a game more than Hibs and the Tangerines.
McKinnon's men also have a game in hand and an 11-point advantage over Queen of the South.
The sides finishing second, third and fourth will enter the Premiership play-offs, which culminate in a two-legged final between one of the Championship sides and the team finishing second bottom of the top flight.
