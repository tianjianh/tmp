Sark in the Channel Islands was named a Dark Sky Community by the International Dark Sky Association in 2011.
The Sark Astronomy Society (Sastros) has raised the money for the observatory, which is costing about Â£10,000.
Chairwoman Annie Dachinger said it would house the group's Â£1,500 telescope.
She said: "None of this could have happened without the support of Sark residents and the generosity of members of Sastros."
The group, which was set up when the island was awarded its Dark Sky status, now has more than 30 members.
The one-storey wooden structure will have a sliding pitched roof, broadband, two rooms - one for the telescope and a "warm room" - with the telescope mounted on the only concrete used in the building.
Ms Dachinger said the warm room would have a screen linked to the telescope allowing comfortable viewing on cold nights.
The site, a field in the middle of the island, has been cleared and foundations prepared for work to begin in July or August and due to be completed by the end of the summer.
The only other Dark Sky Island in the world is also in the British Isles - Coll in the Inner Hebrides, which was awarded its status in 2013.
