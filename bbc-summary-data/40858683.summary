[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cards had suffered back-to-back away defeats since opening their campaign with a home victory over Gateshead, but they made it two wins from two at the Laithwaite Community Stadium after coming out on top in an eventful encounter.
The hosts rode their luck in the first half, though, with Eastleigh hitting the woodwork through Ben Williamson and Callum Howe while inspired home goalkeeper Nathan Baxter denied Chris Zebroski on several occasions.
Baxter's efforts were rewarded as Woking scored twice either side of the half-time break to take control, striker Inih Effiong opening the scoring before turning provider when his ball across the box was turned into his own net by Gavin Hoyte.
Eastleigh spurned a great chance to get back into the match soon after when the in-form Williamson saw his penalty well saved by Baxter, but the visitors were awarded another spot-kick seconds later and this time Ayo Obileye slotted home.
Eastleigh could not find an equaliser, however, and had to play out the final 13 minutes with a man less after losing Hoyte to injury having already used all their substitutes.
