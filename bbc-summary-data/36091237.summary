Kenya thrown out of under-20 qualifying for overage players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kenya have been kicked out of 2017 Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying for using overage players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Confederation of African Football (Caf) ruled that the five players all featured in the first round first leg in Sudan on 3 April.
Caf rules state only players born after 1 January 1997 are eligible to participate in the qualifiers.
Sudan qualify automatically for the second round as they try to reach the finals in Zambia next year.
The decision can be contested with the Caf's Appeal Board within three days of being notified.
