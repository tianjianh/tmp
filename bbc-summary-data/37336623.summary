Armed officers surrounded the Gurdwara Temple in Leamington Spa after reports men entered the building in a row over inter-faith marriages.
The Sikh Federation pressure group said the Sikh community had concluded Warwickshire Police had "overreacted".
Officers "assessed the situation and responded accordingly," the force said.

A statement from Sikh Youth UK said its members were peacefully protesting against an inter-faith marriage that was to be carried out as a Sikh marriage at the temple.
People were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and a "significant number of bladed weapons" were seized, Warwickshire police said.
The force later confirmed the majority of these were Kirpans - one of the five physical symbols of faith worn by Sikhs.
A Warwickshire Police spokesman said it responded to a report a group of masked men, initially thought to be about 20, who had forced their way into the temple.
He said: "These were reported to be carrying a range of bladed items, some of which were initially described as not being for ceremonial use.
"Blades seized so far have been ceremonial. Another non-ceremonial weapon was seized."
He said police would be investigating the initial claim that other weapons were involved.
Last year a resolution saying inter-faith couples could not have a Sikh marriage in Gurdwareh was approved at meeting called by the Sikh Council UK and represented by 300 Sikh organisations, Sikh Youth UK said.
Sunday's protest was an example of a "rogue Gurdwara committee creating discord among the UK Sikh diaspora" and it described the committee's behaviour as "inexcusable".
The Sikh Federation is a non-governmental organisation set up to promote the Sikh religion, philosophy and way of life.
"Most" of those arrested had been released on bail, but some were still being questioned, police said.
