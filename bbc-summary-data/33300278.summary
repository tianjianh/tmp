There is a "possibility" some of those killed in the Tunisia terrorist attack came from Wales, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned.

At least 15 of the 38 people shot dead during the attack on a beach in the popular resort of Sousse were British.
None of the victims have been formally named by the Foreign Office.
Meanwhile, the family of a Trehafod man shot while protecting his fiancee say he is now "stable" and "comfortable" in hospital, after flying home.
Many British tourists returned on Saturday on special flights while the first of two scheduled flights to Cardiff arrived on Sunday morning.
Mr Jones said: "It has been shocking to hear the details of the horrific attack in Tunisia. My thoughts are with all those who have been affected by this senseless act of violence.
"I am being kept informed about the situation in Tunisia as we learn more about the identities of those killed.
"We know that at least 15 of those killed have been British, and while there have not yet been any confirmed victims from Wales, we must prepare ourselves for that possibility.
"The Welsh government is ready to offer any assistance it can as we deal with the aftermath of this tragedy."
Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui, 23, who has reported links with Islamic State (IS), opened fire on tourists at noon on Friday.
Matthew James, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, used his body as a human shield while trying to protect his fiancee Saera Wilson, 26, when the gunman began firing.
He has since flown home, his family confirmed on Sunday.
In a statement released by police, his family said: "Matthew is currently in a stable and comfortable condition - and he and his fiancee Saera are doing well, and are happy to be back in the UK.
"They wish to thank all of the medical teams in both Tunisia and the UK for all of their professional assistance, care and support."
More details have emerged of the attack, which saw Rezgui shoot at people on the beach near the Imperial Marhaba and Bellevue hotels.
He entered at least one of the hotel lobbies, where grenades were also detonated.
He then walked through the streets of Sousse where he was reportedly chased by local Tunisians, firing shots at them.
It has also been reported that local builders threw rubble down at him from rooftops as he passed by in the street. The attack eventually ended when he was shot dead by police.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered close to the scene a day after the attack for a rally against terrorism, with some holding candles and others carrying flags of the UK and Tunisia.
One of the survivors who was flown into Manchester on Saturday, has arrived back in Wales and posted on social media her family was "totally traumatised and in total shock and disbelief".
Leiha Shaw, 28, from Swansea, said: "I cannot explain to you how terrifying and frightening the past 24 hours have been for myself and my family.
"I have never in all my life been so scared and I honestly thought that we were going to lose our lives to an out of control gunman that had totally devastated so many peoples lives throughout the country.
"Although I didn't see anyone being shot I will forever be haunted by the noise of bullets and explosions that seared through the beach. My thoughts and prayers are with the families that have had loved ones murdered in cold blood."
Several other tourists from Wales have also been caught up in the attacks.
Elsewhere, Wrexham FC footballer Wes York, 22, left Sousse just 48 hours before the killings.
The striker told the Daily Post he would have been at the targeted beach, had he not cut his holiday short to prepare for pre-season training.
"I have been watching what has happened on TV and it just sends chills down your spine to think I was only just there," he said.
