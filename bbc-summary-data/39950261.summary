NHS Highland said three patients have tested positive for flu and there are further patients experiencing respiratory symptoms.
It said flu was circulating at an "increasing rate" in the local community.
Visits to the affected ward has also been temporarily restricted.
Anne Boyd-Mackay, rural general hospital manager for the hospital, said: "By restricting visiting to the affected area it helps hospital staff protect the health, privacy and dignity of our patients.
"We fully appreciate that there will be circumstances when visiting is of benefit to both patients and their families which we will look at on an individual basis and these can be discussed with the nurse in charge."
NHS Highland said that flu symptoms could usually be managed at home by resting, keeping warm and drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.
Paracetamol can also be taken to help ease some of the symptoms, it said.
