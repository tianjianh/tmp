[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rugby clubs can resell Wales international tickets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rugby clubs are now allowed to resell a portion of their allocated tickets for Wales games above face value.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A limited number can be sold by clubs, which will be allowed to keep the profit, through Ticketmaster's resale business, Seatwave.
The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said it had "reviewed its position" on the secondary market.
Resold tickets will be verified by the WRU and reissued to the new buyer via its ticket office.
Clubs will be given guidance on the resale price by the WRU and Seatwave, based on average selling prices.
This new scheme only applies to home matches at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.
WRU head of sales and marketing, Craig Maxwell, said: "The WRU have taken the decision to follow supporter demands and provide a service that is clearly being used already, but with the guaranteed safety and security for the ticket purchaser that only the WRU can offer."
