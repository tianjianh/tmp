Sevilla, who beat Liverpool in the Europa League final four days earlier, were a man up over Barca for 50 minutes after Javier Mascherano's dismissal.
But they failed to take their chances in Madrid and lost 2-0 in extra time, ending up with nine men themselves.
"If we were fresher, in the final quarter of the pitch we would have been able to win the game," he said.
Ever Banega, who is expected to join Inter Milan, was sent off in injury time for Sevilla as they relinquished their man advantage.
Jordi Alba gave Barca the lead in extra time with his first goal of the season then Sevilla had Daniel Carrico sent off towards the end before Neymar sealed the domestic double for Barcelona.
"In the second half we had two good chances," said Emery, who is a reported target for Everton.
"I don't think we lacked luck, and the team has a lot of ambition. We lacked freshness, which would have allowed us to respond more [after Barcelona scored]."
It was Sevilla's first defeat in a major cup final since 1962, during which time they have won five Uefa Cup/Europa Leagues and two Spanish Cups.
