Litvinenko inquiry: Key suspect will not testify

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A suspect in an inquiry in London into the death of the former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko has told the BBC he will not give evidence.

Dmitry Kovtun is one of two men British authorities believe poisoned Mr Litvinenko with radioactive polonium at a London hotel in 2006.
He said he had been unable to get permission from Russian authorities to give evidence.
Mr Kovtun, who denies involvement, was due to appear by videolink from Moscow.
But he said he needed permission because testifying would risk violating an obligation of confidentiality to a Russian investigation into Mr Litvinenko's death.
Sir Robert Owen, the chair of the inquiry, gave Mr Kovtun a deadline of 09:00 BST on Tuesday to begin giving evidence.
During a meeting with Mr Kovtun and his co-accused Andrei Lugovoi, Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of the radioactive substance polonium-210.
Mr Litvinenko, 43, had been an officer with the Federal Security Service - the successor to the KGB - but fled to Britain where he became a UK citizen and a fierce critic of the Kremlin.
Attempts to extradite Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi have failed and they remain in Russia.
Mr Kovtun originally refused to take part in the inquiry, but changed his mind in March.
Speaking to the BBC in Moscow on Monday, the former Soviet army officer said he had been unable to contact the relevant Russian investigator.
"Even if the investigator, who I have not been able to reach, gave me permission he would still have to make a decision on how much information I could disclose,"  he added.
Mr Kovtun dismissed the suggestion he was never serious about giving evidence.
If British authorities contacted investigators in Moscow on his behalf, they could still get permission for him to testify at a later date, he said.
But the BBC's Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford said that seemed unlikely as the inquiry had already been delayed from the spring - specifically to allow Mr Kovtun to take part.
On Friday, the Royal Courts of Justice in London heard Mr Kovtun had emailed to say he felt bound by obligations of confidentiality.
At the time, Robin Tam QC, counsel to the inquiry, said: "There's a very strong argument for saying they've had far too much time already."
And Richard Horwell QC, for the Metropolitan Police, said Mr Kovtun's actions did not come as "any surprise".
"It appears Kovtun's request to give evidence was nothing more than an attempt to become a core participant and obtain as much information about these proceedings as he could," he said.
Mr Kovtun denied that claim on Monday.
A lawyer for Mr Litvinenko's widow claimed Mr Kovtun's actions implied he was guilty of her husband's murder, along with Mr Lugovoi, who also denies involvement.
