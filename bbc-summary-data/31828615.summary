It said dates for the rapper's Great Escape tour, due to start in April, have been moved to September.
The announcement comes after the singer recently handed control of her Twitter and Instagram accounts to her management.
The last tweets she posted herself said she was finding social media "too negative and draining".
Regarding the tour, a spokesperson for Def Jam Records told Billboard: "To accommodate for creative team availability and tour production plans, it was determined that the tour will not be ready.
"It's important to Iggy that she delivers the show she envisaged to share with her fans and that requires more time in development."
The tour begins in California and ends in Arizona. There are no UK dates scheduled at the moment.
Her support act was due to be Nick Jonas but he's now said he won't be able to join the rescheduled tour.
Iggy Azalea's been involved in several Twitter spats with high-profile names such as Eminem, Nicki Minaj and Snoop Dogg.
She's also criticised the media for posting photos of her on holiday and her final Instagram post hinted that she was felt her privacy at home was being compromised.
She wrote: "No-one should be made to feel like their own home is a prison... It is illegal to post images of someone in their home or property with a long-range camera."
In an Instagram post by her management, fans were told that Iggy "loves all her Azaleans".
