Zlatan Ibrahimovic: 'To Zlatan' and your best sporting verbs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The word "Zlatan" - meaning supreme skill coupled with audacious confidence - has long been part of the football lexicon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
How many five-a-side footballers have described their own moment of breathtaking quality as "doing a Zlatan"?
Indeed, Ibrahimovic is so good he has his own verb in the Swedish dictionary - "zlatanera", which translates as "to Zlatan" and means "to dominate".
But sport is not just sublime beauty and outrageous ego. We asked BBC Sportsday readers to add to our sporting dictionary.
