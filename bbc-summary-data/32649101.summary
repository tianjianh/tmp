[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
House prices rose 1.6% last month, according to the latest survey from the Halifax, with the annual rate of increase rising slightly to 8.5%.

The increase means the average house price has risen to Â£196,412.
The Halifax said demand for housing was being supported by several factors, including the improving economy, rising employment and low mortgage rates.
At the same time, it said supply remained "very tight" with a general shortage of properties for sale.
