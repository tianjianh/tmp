More than £2m has been spent searching for a new site for Jersey's general hospital since 2011, according to the health department.

At the end of 2013 politicians voted to make money available to build a new hospital as the existing site was considered outdated.
Health Minister, Senator Andrew Green, said four sites were on the shortlist.
He said it was a complicated process but a final decision on a site in St Helier had not yet been made.
A Freedom of Information (FOI) request revealed that £2.2m had been spent so far with the bulk, £1.17m spent this year.
The money was spent on working with external suppliers as well as paying staff, overheads and administration.
£2,209,547
Total cost so far since 2011
£220,708 in 2012
£413,485 in 2013
£396,160 in 2014
£1,179,220 so far in 2015
A new site for the hospital has been discussed for years, with more than 50 sites considered by officials.
Earlier in 2015, Mr Green rejected a previously proposed two-site hospital, saying it should all be on a single site.
The four locations under consideration are the current hospital site, the Overdale hospital site, People's Park and the St Helier Waterfront.
The health authority has argued the existing hospital building is out of date, and needs to be replaced.
About £300m has been made available for the redevelopment of the hospital, which is expected to include building costs and new equipment.
