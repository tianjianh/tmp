Jones, meanwhile, beat Eva Calvo Gomez to win taekwondo's -57kg division.
With three days of action left in Rio, Britain are nine medals short of the record 65 they secured at London 2012.
GB got off to a great start on day 13 after failing to win a medal on day 12.
Alistair Brownlee and brother Jonny won gold and silver respectively in the triathlon, with Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark triumphing in the sailing.
Liam Heath and Jon Schofield added a silver in the men's 200m kayak double, while Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took a surprise bronze in badminton's men's doubles.
GB have now won medals in 18 events, with the promise of more to come.
Nicola Adams has secured at least a silver as she attempts to become the first British boxer to retain an Olympic title in 92 years.
Bolt, who won the 100m title on day 10 of the Games in Brazil, once again dominated a 200m Olympic final.
He has now won the Olympic sprint double three times, having repeated his exploits in 2008 and 2012.
Silver went to Canada's Andre de Grasse, who clocked 20.02, while France's Christophe Lemaitre won bronze in 20.12, edging out Briton Adam Gemili, who was fourth, just 0.003 behind.
Bolt, who celebrates his 30th birthday on Sunday, was unhappy with his winning time and added it was unlikely he would compete in the event at the World Championships in London next year.
"I said it would be 100m and that's it," he told BBC Sport. "My coach has a way of trying to convince me, but personally I believe this is my last one."
Welsh fighter Jones demonstrated her superior taekwondo skills to beat Spaniard Calvo Gomez 16-7.
"It feels unbelievable," said the 23-year-old from Flint. "I didn't realise how much pressure I'd feel. My coach is a psycho, so it's all down to him!"
The man in question - Paul Green - told BBC Sport: "She's the most successful British taekwondo athlete and probably the best there ever will be."

Victory for Alistair Brownlee meant the 28-year-old became the first athlete to win successive Olympic triathlon titles.
As for 26-year-old Jonny, he improved on the bronze he won at London 2012.

"I was pretty confident we would get first and second, but I didn't know which way round it would be," said Alistair.
Mills and Clark needed only to finish Thursday's medal race to win gold in the women's 470 sailing event.
They came home eighth to improve on the silver medal they won in London.
"I can't believe it," Mills told BBC One. "It has been the best feeling ever.
"We have forgotten all about London. We are so proud to come back after it and we've worked so hard to get the upgrade to gold."
