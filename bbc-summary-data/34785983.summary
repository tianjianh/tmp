Paul Hollywood City Bakes will see the celebrity chef explore pastry and bread recipes in Europe and North America.
"Food culture can reveal so much about a nation," said the 49-year-old, who has been a Bake Off judge since 2010.
He said it would be "a privilege to be able to delve into the lives of fellow bakers and discover some really amazing international bakes."
The new show will begin in April and be broadcast on the Food Network in the UK.
Richard Farmbrough, of production company Reef Television, said the "mouth-watering project" would show "a different side" to the "baking megastar".
Hollywood has been a baker since his teenage years, when he became an apprentice at his father's bakery.
He has been head baker at some of Britain's most exclusive hotels and runs an artisanal baking business.
Earlier this week The Great British Bake Off was nominated for a Rose d'Or award in the reality and factual entertainment category.
