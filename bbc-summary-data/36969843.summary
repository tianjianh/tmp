Russia's Pavel Sozykin has had his doping ban overturned by World Sailing.

The men's 470 class sailor was banned when his name appeared in the World Anti-Doping Agency report into state-sponsored cheating in Russia.
But after new guidance from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the sport's international federation said it was unsure Sozykin had cheated.
His case now goes to the three-person IOC panel making the final decision on all of the country's athletes in Rio.
World Sailing issued a statement which revealed Sozykin had passed two subsequent anti-doping tests and said although he was named in last week's Wada-commissioned McLaren report, it "did not include specific information as to whether the positive test occurred in-competition or out-of-competition".
It added: "Further, the substance for which he tested positive is not prohibited out of competition and, if the sample had been taken out of competition, would not have resulted in a sanction."
