QPR boss Ian Holloway says the English Football League should use video technology after his side had a goal ruled out in losing 1-0 at Blackburn.

With the game at 0-0, Rangers striker Conor Washington's header hit the bar and appeared to cross the line but it was not given by the officials.
"It is very difficult to take for my lads," Holloway told BBC Radio London.
"Unfortunately we are left bemoaning a decision where we scored a goal and it wasn't given."
Having lost their Championship fixture thanks to Sam Gallagher's stoppage-time winner, Holloway thinks its time that technology is used to help the officials in the second tier.
"We scored today but we lost 1-0. Can you please explain that to me Fifa, Uefa or whoever you are?" he questioned. "I'd like us to stand up for ourselves and actually take over our own game. It would make sense.
"The officials can only do the job they are asked. The fourth official doesn't need to be stood in between myself and (Blackburn boss) Owen Coyle as we are never going to have an argument - he should be watching a screen.
"You just need to see what the company I used to work for can show the fourth official. He'll have seen clearly it's a goal and could have said it within five seconds, and we'd have been 1-0 up and in a much better situation."
