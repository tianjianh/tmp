The 24-year-old suffered the injury in Monday's 20-12 win at Widnes, in which he scored one of his side's three tries.
"We're all gutted for Tommy," said Saints coach Keiron Cunningham.
"He is one of the most professional players we have and will be dedicated to his rehab. But we are experienced at dealing with long-term injuries."
Makinson, who is nine short of a century of career tries for Saints, has crossed the whitewash four times in Super League this season.
Saints currently stand sixth after eight games, four points off top spot.
