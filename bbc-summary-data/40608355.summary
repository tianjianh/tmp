Newport's M4 Brynglas tunnel closed for upgrade work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stretch of the westbound M4 motorway has been shut in Newport from Saturday evening until Monday morning as the Brynglas tunnels upgrade continues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Westbound traffic will be diverted via the A48 Southern Distributor Road between M4 junctions 24 and 28.
The carriageway, through the Brynglas Tunnels between junction 25A and junction 26, closed at 20:00 BST on Saturday to reopen at 06:00 on Monday.
The tunnels are closed during the night occasionally as engineers upgrade them.
The Welsh Government said the tunnels were built under old design standards and were no longer compliant.
The Usk River bridge and Malpas viaduct, either side of the tunnels, also require maintenance.
