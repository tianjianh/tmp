Two teenage drug dealers stabbed a man to death in a park after he tried to rob them, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, attacked Lee Briggs in St Marie's Park in Widnes, Cheshire, in May, Chester Crown Court heard.
One boy, now aged 16, waved a machete at the 43-year-old as the other boy, aged 15, stabbed him, the jury heard.
Mr Briggs "held a knife to the younger boy's throat" to try to steal their money and drugs. The boys deny murder.
Gordon Cole QC, prosecuting, said the boys, from Liverpool, had admitted being in the park to deal cocaine and heroin on the day of Mr Briggs' death.
He said the killing had been witnessed by Nicola Riley, who had gone to purchase drugs from the pair.
Ms Riley told the court she heard Mr Briggs say "give me the bits", which she took as a reference to the drugs and money, as he threatened the boys.
Mr Briggs was treated by paramedics and police but later died in hospital.
A post-mortem examination found he had died from a single stab wound to the chest.
Mr Cole said after the attack, the boys had fled the scene and returned to Liverpool in a taxi.
He told the court CCTV footage showed them re-enacting the stabbing.
He added that the boys knew where weapons were hidden around the park in case of a "violent confrontation".
"When there was that confrontation by Lee Briggs, their immediate reaction, both of them, was to be armed," he said.
"Both of them were prepared to brandish and use weapons."
The case continues.
