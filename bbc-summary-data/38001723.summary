A Flintshire medical products firm has announced plans to cut almost 100 full-time jobs by spring 2017.

ConvaTec, which employs 498 people at its Deeside manufacturing plant, will shed 93 jobs due to "restructuring".
Alyn and Deeside AM Carl Sargeant said he was "massively disappointed" by the news.
The company said it was "offering voluntary redundancy packages to qualified employees".
The company, which began consulting with employees on Monday, said the facility would be turned into a "centre of excellence" for advanced wound care, and other production will be moved elsewhere.
The firm's manufacturing site in Rhymney, Caerphilly county, is not affected by the changes.
Mr Sargeant said he has written to the Welsh Government, who gave the firm a Â£100,000 grant in May 2015, to ask what support they can offer.
"I'm obviously massively disappointed to hear about such a large number of redundancies in the constituency," he said.
"My thoughts are with those affected by this announcement. I wrote to ConvaTec on Monday to tell them how disappointing it is.
"I told them that while I welcomed the investment they have planned for Deeside and the creation of 10 new highly-skilled jobs, nevertheless this only slightly mitigates against the 93 redundancies."
A statement from Convatec said the firm started a programme to "improve efficiencies" and "help fuel growth-focused investments" in 2015.
It added: "We are committed to treating all employees affected by these decisions with fairness and respect and in compliance with applicable requirements.
"We are proud of our heritage in Wales, as the home of our global research and development headquarters and excellence in advanced wound care production."
The firm cut 100 jobs in January 2010.
The BBC has asked the Welsh Government for comment.
