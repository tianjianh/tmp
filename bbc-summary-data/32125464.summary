On-loan Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao has equalled Colombia's national scoring record with his 24th goal for his country.

Falcao, at Old Trafford on a season's loan from Monaco, drew level with Arnoldo Iguaran's record by scoring a penalty in a 3-1 win over Kuwait.
It was his third goal in two friendlies in the Middle East, having hit two in Thursday's 6-0 win against Bahrain.
The 29-year-old has four goals in 22 games for United so far this season.
Colombia, who are warming up for the Copa America to be played in in Chile from June, took the lead with an Abel Aguilar volley in the 22nd minute.
Kuwait defender Mesaed Al Enezi equalised at a corner on the stroke of half-time, before substitute Edwin Cardona and Falcao sealed the win for Jose Pekerman's side.
Falcao's loan deal at United, worth £265,000 per week, expires at the end of the season, when the club must decide whether to take up a £43.5m option to buy him.
