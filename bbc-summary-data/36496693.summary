The road remained closed on Friday following the incident on Thursday night.
Mr Graham's family said: "He was a beloved father, brother, grandfather, uncle and friend."
They added he would be "sorely missed by all who knew him. He is reunited at last with his wife, Sian Graham, who was his first love."

Ch Insp Darren Wareing said: "I am appealing for the driver of the vehicle involved to come forward.
"I am also appealing for any witnesses who would have been in the area at the time or who may have witnessed the collision to call police."
