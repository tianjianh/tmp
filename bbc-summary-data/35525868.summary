A Swiss skier has captured a breathtaking video using just his phone and a piece of string.
Nicolas Vuignier found a cool way to film himself without needing a professional film crew.
He tied his phone to a piece of string, and swung it round and round above his head as he sped down the slopes.
It means he could film himself from lots of angles to give some amazing video of himself skiing.
The tricky trick is pretty impressive but don't try this one yourself.
