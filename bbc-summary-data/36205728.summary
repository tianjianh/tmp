Former Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb is facing a lifetime ban from football after Fifa's ethics committee opened proceedings against him.

In November, Webb, 51, pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy, three of wire fraud conspiracy and three of money laundering conspiracy.
The former president of Concacaf, who is from the Cayman Islands, was one of seven people arrested in Zurich in May last year before Fifa's annual congress.
"The final report was transmitted to the [ethics committee] adjudicatory chamber on 26 April 2016, with a recommended sanction of a lifelong ban from all football-related activities," Fifa's ethics committee said in a statement on Wednesday.
Webb will now be invited to submit his version of the case to chief ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, whose chamber will decide on sanctions.
