Priaulx, who won three successive world touring car titles, left BMW after 13 years last month to join the Ford Chip Ganassi Racing team.
"The car, from a sporting angle, is going to make history," Priaulx told BBC Radio Guernsey.
"There's no compromise, we're here to win, whatever it takes."
The 41-year-old will join Marino Franchitti, Stefan MÃ¼cke and Olivier Pla on Ford's team for the World Endurance Championship, which was won by Mark Webber and Porsche in November.
He will make his debut for the team at the opening round at Silverstone in April, but says his focus is round three at the iconic Le Mans 24-hour race.
"It's the big one of the year," Priaulx said. "Fifty years ago Ford won it and not only did they win it, but they scored first, second and third
"I think everything at the moment focuses on Le Mans and once we've got Le Mans out of the way then, of course, we can focus on the rest of the season.
"We've got a couple of races before Le Mans and I think this car is good enough and has the potential to make history."
