[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After drawing their opening-day fixture at Torquay, goals from Andy Cook, Olly Norburn and Jay McEveley earned Rovers the three points.
Cook got the ball rolling in the 18th minute when he rounded the goalkeeper and slotted home and it was 2-0 just after the half-hour mark when Norburn fired in a low effort from 20 yards.
Woking gave themselves hope just before half-time when Charlie Carter headed home but McEveley's header from Jack Dunn's corner made the game safe for Micky Mellon's men.
