Masham Steam Rally will see 800 exhibits arrive from all over the UK help mark its landmark anniversary.
The annual event made just Â£5 profit when it launched in 1965 to raise funds for the town hall.
The two-day show will feature 40 steam traction engines, 100 tractors, 60 classic cars and vintage agricultural equipment.
Saturday's highlights include a parade in the market place and on Sunday there will be a flypast from a Dakota of the Battle of Britain memorial flight.
Organiser, Flo Grainger, said: "The fact that this event has been carried on for half a century bears testament to the hard work and determination of a group of volunteers, young and old, who return annually to produce a colourful and vibrant event."
