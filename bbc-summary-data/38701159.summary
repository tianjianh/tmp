[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defeat leaves the Tynesiders nine points off the top five, down in ninth place.
The home side took the lead when winger David Fitzpatrick foraged down the right, cut inside and beat Dan Hanford with a powerful angled shot.
Paddy McLaughlin stroked home a second-half penalty to bring Gateshead level, but substitute Paul Rooney poked Torquay back in front soon after, getting on the end of Dan Sparkes' excellent free-kick.
The away side were desperately unlucky on occasion, James Bolton's header came back off the bar and Danny Johnson's effort hit a post as they pressed for a leveller.
Late on, however, Brett Williams intercepted Luke Hannant's misplaced pass and added a flattering element to Torquay's win.
