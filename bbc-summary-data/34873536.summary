A hat-trick from Mark Wilson as well as tries from Zach Kibirige and Marcus Watson saw the hosts secure a bonus-point 29-7 lead at the break, Denis Simplikevich with the Siberians' score.
Kibirige grabbed his second try before former England sevens winger Watson scored three more in the second half.
