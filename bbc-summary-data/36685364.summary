China's Wu, 30, and Shi were in the lead from their opening dive and comfortably beat Italy's Tania Cagnotto and Francesca Dallape by 31.77 points.
Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith of Australia recovered from a poor start to take bronze.
British pair Rebecca Gallantree and Alicia Blagg were sixth.
Gallantree and Blagg, who won Commonwealth Gold in Glasgow in 2014, were in joint third after the first two dives but were overtaken in the final three dives.
"We're a little bit disappointed to be honest," Gallantree said.
"It didn't quite come together for us and it's frustrating to see we weren't too far off the medals."
Wu, who first won this event in Athens in 2004 before medals at Beijing 2008 and London 2012, added the Rio title with some superb diving as the pair scored 345.60 points.
She also won the 3m individual springboard in London.
