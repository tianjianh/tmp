Bristol rental scam conman sought by police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A conman who posed as a landlord and swindled several people out of thousands of pounds in a rental scam is being sought by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four people each paid about Â£1,100 in rent and deposits for the same studio flat in Bedminster, Bristol.
However, when they came to move in, the so-called landlord had disappeared with their money. The property is owned by someone entirely different.
Police are trying to locate Arkadiusz Sylwester Nader who rented it out.
The BBC understands that Mr Nader, a Polish national, secured the flat through an intermediary because he does not speak English.
Mr Nader owes a month's rent, with the flat left empty apart from a few possessions.
All the victims hail from Eastern Europe, with Mr Nader targeting them online, and were told they could move in on 3 December.
However, none have heard from Mr Nader since and he has not responded to the BBC's inquiries.
One victim, Damian Nartowski, a forklift truck operator, said the money he paid was his "full monthly wage".
"It [had] a big impact on me because I was struggling to get to the end of the month because I have no money or anything," he said.
Another victim, Joanna Kedziora, who works as a cleaner in a bank, said she has lost all her savings to Mr Nader.
Speaking through a translator, she said: "He harmed a lot of people just before Christmas, and he made himself a Christmas present out of some other people's misery."
She had planned to move into the studio flat on North Street with her daughter.
Avon and Somerset Police said it is currently investigating allegations of fraud, and is urging anyone else who thinks they may have been a victim to contact the force.
