Robinson, who has directed at the National Theatre in London and Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, will take up the role in June.
He said it would be a "privilege" to lead such a "unique and vital place".
The theatre's chief executive, Mathew Russell, said Robinson had a "proven track record" and a "firm commitment to new audiences".
The theatre's last artistic director, Chris Monks, left in December after six years in the role.
Robinson said he hoped to "extend the legacy of my hugely talented predecessors, including Stephen Joseph himself, Chris Monks, and of course Sir Alan Ayckbourn".
"I am thrilled to be directing and curating at the theatre, and forging close ties with our audience," he said.
"It will be a privilege to lead this company at a moment when it is bursting with such opportunity."
Robinson is currently artistic director of Theatre503 productions, a critically-acclaimed new writing theatre in south London.
A spokeswoman for the Stephen Joseph Theatre said he would join the company on 1 June and would be "moving into the area with his family over the summer".
