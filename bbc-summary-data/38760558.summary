[SN]TITLE[SN]
Judge declares Ohio lethal injection process 'unconstitutional'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A federal court has found Ohio's three-drug lethal injection process unconstitutional, putting three impending executions on hold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Magistrate Judge Michael Merz ruled against Ohio's use of a sedative that has caused problems in executions in other states such as Arizona.
The state was also banned from using drugs that paralyse inmates and stops their hearts.
Next month's execution of Ronald Phillips was subsequently delayed.
Phillips' lawyers had argued that the new method, announced last year, was worse than a similar procedure used years ago.
The state contended the three-drug process was constitutional, citing a US Supreme Court ruling last year.
Phillips would have been the first inmate to be executed in the Midwestern state since January 2014.
