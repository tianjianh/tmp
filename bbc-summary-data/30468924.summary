Two men approached the car in Croxteth Hall Lane, Croxteth, on Friday afternoon.
A passer-by saw what was happening and shouted at the men, giving the woman time to close the door and drive away.
A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery.
Merseyside Police said the suspect, from Norris Green, was arrested on Saturday after three raids at addresses in West Derby and Norris Green.
Det Insp Phil Mahon, of Merseyside Police, said: "This was a highly unusual incident.
"The woman has been left incredibly shaken up by what has happened to her and is being looked after by her loved ones."
