A knitwear designer has described the "surreal" experience of knitting a Christmas jumper for the Queen.

The festive knit - which sports a corgi dog with a jauntily placed crown - is being worn by the waxwork of Her Majesty at Madame Tussauds in London.
All the wax figures of the Royal family are sporting Christmas jumpers to help charity Save the Children.
Designer Amber Hards, from Bristol, said she was a fan of the Queen and hoped she saw her design.
Ms Hards, who studied at the University of the West of England and now has her own knitwear label, said: "I had the most surreal conversation with Madame Tussauds.
"They wanted a corgi with a crown but nothing tacky and no shoddy lights - it had got to be more tasteful," she added.
Made by hand from lambs wool, Shetland wool and gold lurex - the one-off "slightly baggy" Royal sweater took about 20 hours to create.
"Before I got the measurements of the wax work sent to me - I tried to find out what size the Queen was on Google but it didn't say," she said.
"They [Madame Tussauds] didn't say it was top secret - but I better not say.
"But the jumper is nice and breathable, which is always important for a waxwork."
The royal wax figures can be seen in their knits throughout December at Madame Tussauds, with visitors encouraged to take selfies.
The attraction will also give visitors the option of donating to help Save the Children.
