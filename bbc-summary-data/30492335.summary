Rupert Murdoch has been criticised after tweeting congratulations to his newspaper, the Australian Daily Telegraph, for being awake to cover the "bloody outcome" of the Sydney siege.

The businessman, who owns Sky News and The Sun, wrote: "AUST gets wake-call with Sydney terror.
"Only Daily Telegraph caught the bloody outcome at 2.00 am. Congrats."
He was labelled "heartless" and "insensitive" by Twitter users.
Two people and the gunman died after commandoes stormed the cafe.
One was 38-year-old barrister and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson. The other was Tori Johnson, the 34-year-old manager of the Lindt cafe.
The hostage-taker has been identified as Man Haron Monis.
Who is Rupert Murdoch?
Many people expressed disbelief at Rupert Murdoch's tweet.
Responding to his post, comedian Adam Hills tweeted: "I'm sorry is this real?"
Harry Shearer, who voices (among others) the character for Mr Burns in The Simpsons, also tweeted about the post, suggesting that being woken up by a siege was nothing to boast about.
Actor Stephen Hunter, who plays Bombur in The Hobbit, replied to Rupert Murdoch too.
There's been no response from Rupert Murdoch since he tweeted on Monday.
