The 30-year-old was shot dead on the door step of his home on 28 November 2004.
Father-of-two Mr Wilson was shot with a German-made handgun by a stocky man in a baseball cap who had handed him an envelope.
A massive police investigation was launched but the murder remains unsolved.
Police Scotland's new Major Investigation Team North is investigating the case. MIT North involves officers based in Inverness, Aberdeen and Dundee.
Det Supt Malcolm Stewart, who is leading the inquiry, said Mr Wilson's family deserved answers and justice.
He said: "We cannot lose sight of that and we are determined to get it for them.
"We have kept them aware of developments throughout the investigation and they are supportive of our efforts.
"Our investigation remains firmly open. As with all long running cases, it is good practice to periodically take a fresh look at the evidence and identify any new opportunities or lines of enquiry."
Det Supt Stewart said experiences from other investigations suggested that the passage of time could lead to new evidence.
He said: "Those who may have been reluctant to come forward with information nine years ago, for whatever reason, may be more willing to do so now.
"That is why the public appeal for information is so important and in particular why we have released pictures and details of the murder weapon."
The gun involved was found on 8 December 2004 in a drain on Seabank Road, Nairn, by council workers carrying out gully cleaning.
Forensic analysis identified it as the murder weapon.
Det Supt Stewart said: "The weapon is a significant age - dating back well over 60 years - so piecing together its history could very well help provide us with new leads.
"It is a Haenal Suhl Model 1 Schmeisser's patent handgun, manufactured between 1920 and 1945 at the Schmeisser factory in Germany.
"The ammunition was .25 calibre made by Sellier and Bellot in the Czech Republic between 1983 and 1993."
He added: "Someone out there has information about what happened that day and I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who recognises the weapon or thinks they may know anything about it at all.
"No matter how small or insignificant it may seem, please let myself and the enquiry team make that assessment - it may be that it is the vital piece of information we are looking for."
