[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford University's history changes 'do not go far enough'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moves to make non-European history compulsory at Oxford University do not go far enough, an anti-colonial campaign group claims.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhodes Must Fall Oxford, which seeks to address Oxford's "colonial legacy", said the history syllabus remains "hugely Eurocentric".
It reacted after Oxford made completion of one paper in non-European history compulsory for history undergraduates.
The university said it was pleased to be diversifying its curriculum.
It said the move "followed years of discussion" and was not a response to any campaign.
The likes of the "Why is My Curriculum White?" campaign have been encouraging UK universities to cover more "non-white" topics.
Neil Gregor, professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton, described the move as "long overdue", and said there was a "widely acknowledged need to make history less Eurocentric".
But, he also criticised some of the media reaction to the changes, which he said carried "an implicit accusation this is PC [political correctness] gone mad" based on the assumption global history means black history.
He added it was a "delusion" to think British or European history could be taught without some consideration of global history.
Femi Nylander, from Rhodes Must Fall Oxford, said the "real question" was why non-European history did not become compulsory on the syllabus of "the world's supposedly best institution" until 2017.
