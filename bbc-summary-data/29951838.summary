Movember money moustache mission for Earls Barton boy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A schoolboy has decided to raise money for a men's health charity by dressing up as a different moustachioed famous face every day for a month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Heath, 12, from Earls Barton, has so far disguised himself as Ali G, Hercule Poirot and Groucho Marx as part of his Movember campaign.
He is raising money in memory of his grandfather, who died from cancer in February.
William came up with the idea as he cannot grow a moustache himself.
His granddad, Robin Wickham, died from pancreatic, testicular and prostate cancer, and William is now asking people to donate to The Movember Foundation, via his own "Mo Space" page.
William has already dressed as seven famous moustachioed men, including Biggles, Keith Lemon and Magnum PI.
His costumes were sourced from a combination of a local fancy dress shop and items around the home.
"My granddad and I were very close," he said. "He used to come on holiday with us and was always having fun."
His mum Clare said William had wanted to do something that would help, but was also fun.
She said: "We needed to fill 30 days. When you try to think of 30 people with moustaches it is harder than you think.
"The overriding thing is that it has been fun, but it has serious implications."
William said his favourite character so far had been Ali G, but he had struggled to create a successful Ned Flanders outfit.
He said: "I tried to paint my face yellow, but it didn't really work."
