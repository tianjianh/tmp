Sean Seawright, 26, targeted the properties in housing developments across Glasgow and Lanarkshire over a number of days in March and April 2015.
The court heard that householders had been selected mainly so Seawright could steal their expensive cars.
A jury heard evidence of petrified children in tears as Seawright stormed into houses.
During one incident, he and an accomplice claimed to be police armed with dangerous stun guns.
One couple were left so traumatised after being raided that they sold their home.
Seawright was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow after being convicted of 18 charges including theft, assault and housebreaking.
Judge Lady Stacey told him: "You stole cars and damaged property. You also terrified people who were in their own homes at night.
"You left people feeling frightened and stressed for many months afterwards.
"To me, you are a danger to the public."
Seawright, who had denied the offences, will also be supervised for a further two years on his release.
Seawright, who already had a history of violence, was joined by an unknown accomplice.
Two homes in Crossford, South Lanarkshire, were initially targeted when car keys were stolen from one of the properties.
Seawright then raided the luxury house of Mandeep and Pritpal Hoonjan in Robroyston, Glasgow.
When Mr Hoonjan went to investigate "rummaging" downstairs, he shone a torch and was met with yells of "armed police".
The 45-year-old told the court: "My first thought was to get my child out of the way. I locked my wife and child in the bathroom. My daughter was crying and my wife was panicky."
His wife's Volkswagen Golf was stolen.
The family have since sold their home and Mr Hoonjan has sold his own car fearing they could be targeted again.
He said his wife was left "absolutely distraught".
When Steven Stewart's home in Cumbernauld was targeted, and his Mercedes stolen, the raiders shouted: "Police...we have Tasers and we will used them."
During a masked raid at a house in Kilsyth, Kevin Coyle's door was repeatedly battered with a hammer as he pleaded: "You have got the wrong house - you have the wrong people."
Mr Coyle installed CCTV and an alarm following his family's ordeal. He told the court: "It is just not the same house any more."
Seawright went on to steal an Audi from a property in Kirkintilloch.
During a raid at Gordon and Carol Anne Stevenson's home in East Kilbride, which had a £35,000 Volkswagen Golf and £20,000 Renault on the driveway, Seawright and his accomplice threatened to stab and shoot the couple.
Mrs Stevenson, who still suffers flashbacks, said: "The glass in the front door ended up smashed. The noise was horrendous. I thought they must have mistaken identity, but I thought they were coming to get us."
Seawright was also part of an attack on Garry Gallagher's home, when armed with a crowbar and a hammer, he stole a Volkswagen car from the property.
Following a police chase, he was caught in Hamilton.
But while on bail he carried out another raid.
Last December, he teamed up with John McAuley, 30, and James Muirhead, 19, to storm a house in Coatbridge.
Victim Brian Lamb was stabbed before a Volkswagen Golf R and £500 cash was stolen.
Prosecutor Shanti Maguire said Seawright was guilty of "escalating violence" showing "indifference" to the victims.
She added there had been "fear and intimidation instilled in people in their own homes".
McAuley was jailed for six years and Muirhead for five years after they were convicted for their roles in the attack on Mr Lamb.
McAuley will be supervised for a further three years on his release with Muirhead monitored for 18 months.
