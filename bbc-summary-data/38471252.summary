The zoo and Wild Place Project are home to around 500 species, from tiny fish and insects to gorillas and hippos.
The count is done at the start of each year to verify audit records and check vulnerable populations are thriving.
John Partridge, senior curator, said: "The last 12 months have been very successful in terms of animal births, so the count is a big job this year."
