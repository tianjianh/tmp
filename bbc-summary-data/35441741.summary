The Reds impressed in last weekend's 2-0 win over Ballinamallard, leaving then eight points behind leaders Crusaders.
"We were fantastic against the Mallards and we have to continue that when we play Portadown," said Lyttle.
"We'll never give up on going for the title - our squad is in good shape and we'll just keep going for it."
He added: "We are not worried about Crusaders, our focus is only on what we do.
"We have brought in quality players and we have quality players coming back from injury so the squad if getting a bit bigger now.
"Our aim on Saturday is simple - three points and a clean sheet."
The Ports have bolstered their attack by signing striker Mikey Withers from Lisburn Distillery on an 18-month deal.
Crusaders visit Coleraine while third-placed Linfield, who have brought in forward Michael McLellan from H&W Welders, welcome Carrick Rangers to Windsor Park.
Ballymena United will be without the suspended Tony Kane for the Ferney Park clash against a Ballinamallard side sitting just one point above the bottom.
The Mallards are under pressure from inform Warrenpoint Town, who remain the basement team but are eyeing safety after an unbeaten run of six league games.
However, Warrenpoint's game at Dungannon has been called off because of snow while Glenavon's contest with Glentoran has also falling victim to the winter weather.
