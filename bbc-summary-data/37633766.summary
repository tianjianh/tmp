Marine experts are asking the public to help them find a dead shark that was briefly washed ashore on a beach in Fife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The five-foot long blue shark was discovered by a passer-by walking his dog on Tentsmuir Beach on Monday.
However, when wardens went to the body it had disappeared, and had possibly been washed back out to sea.
Scientists are hoping to find the remains again so that they can establish how the shark died.
Dr Andrew Brownlow, of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme (SMASS), said: "It is not unusual to see this species around the Scottish coast, yet finding these animals washed up in such a fresh condition does not happen very often.
"It is from more temperate waters and we are the most northerly place that blue sharks reach.
"Although blue sharks officially do not fall under the SMASS remit, we would like to get the animal recovered for necropsy to hopefully learn a little more about what happened
"However the Tentsmuir wardens were not able to locate it on the beach this morning, and we think the high tide may have moved it elsewhere.
"If you are walking the beaches at Tentsmuir/surrounding areas please do keep an eye out for it, and if you see the animal, please phone us on 07979245893 or email strandings@sruc.ac.uk."
