Farnborough Airshow to receive £4.5m council loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Farnborough International Airshow is to receive a loan of £4.5m from Hampshire County Council towards building permanent facilities for the event.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Extra revenue is expected to be made by holding events all year round through conferences and exhibitions.
Council leader Roy Perry said it was "high time" permanent buildings were built, which could go up by 2018.
The decision was made at the authority's policy and resources decision meeting earlier.
Mr Perry said the aerospace and defence sectors were worth £1.5bn each year to Hampshire and employed 16,500 people.
"The airshow is reported to bring in £35m to the local economy.
"The county would be in a position to showcase the UK aerospace industry to global markets - and benefit from the additional events which could be hosted all year round, as a result of having a permanent conference and exhibition facility in Hampshire," he said.
In 2014 about £22bn of UK orders were announced at the airshow.
Its organisers are aiming to raise £29m towards the cost of developing new facilities.
A council report recommends its loan be repaid by 2028.
