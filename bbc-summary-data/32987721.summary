Investigation into police officer's death under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police watchdog in the Republic of Ireland is investigating the death of a sergeant who took his own life.

But the body that represents senior Irish police officers wants the Irish government to appoint a High Court judge instead.
Sergeant Michael Galvin, based in Donegal, killed himself at Ballyshannon police station on 28 May.
He was being investigated by the police ombudsman over his statement about a woman's death in a traffic accident.
The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has now said it is conducting a review into both his death and the initial GSOC investigation of which he was the focus.
However, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) wants an independent investigation by a judge.
Sgt Galvin was a father of three and was a hurler, footballer and coach with his native Sligo. He was buried in Manorhamilton on Sunday.
In a statement on Tuesday, the AGSI said Sgt Galvin had not been aware he had been cleared of any wrongdoing by the ombudsman when he took his life.
The association called the investigation "heavy-handed" and said he had spent 10 weeks in dread when he had done nothing wrong.
General Secretary of the AGSI John Redmond said the Galvin family were devastated and had no confidence in the GSOC.
Speaking on Irish broadcaster RTÉ's Morning Ireland on Wednesday, Kieran Fitzgerald, GSOC, said the sergeant's death had been referred to them by the Garda Commissioner last week.
He said that on 27 May, the watchdog had concluded its investigation into the allegations concerning Sgt Galvin and had found no evidence to support wrongdoing.
Mr Fitzgerald said these inquiries were normally forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions, but he said the DPP would not be bound by the ombudsman's findings.
The GSOC greatly regretted the tragic death of Sgt Galvin, he said.
"The original matter, which we were investigating, was the death of a young lady in Donegal.
"The gardaí were the last people to interact with that lady. So the Garda Commissioner referred the matter to us for investigation under the law and that is appropriate and right.
"I think people being investigated by gardaí can find it intimidating. But I would imagine that most gardaí are well used to that environment and used to answering questions," he said.
"I think it is right and proper and where we are investigating fatal incidents that we do ask appropriate questions to clarify circumstances."
He said that they have started to activate an external process to ensure there was some review of GSOC's relationship with Sgt Galvin because it is a factor in this particular investigation.
