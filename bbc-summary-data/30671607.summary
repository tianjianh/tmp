The turbine, valued at more than Â£500,000, was one of eight on the Screggagh wind farm on Murley mountain.
It collapsed on Friday night, scattering debris over a wide area. Winds were said to be light at the time.
The director of Screggagh Windfarm Ltd said they were working with the suppliers to ensure the site was safe.
"We are currently investigating the circumstances that led to the collapse of the turbine at Screggagh wind farm," Doreen Walker said.
"We are however satisfied that the site's precautionary health and safety alert processes worked well with local emergency services in attendance within minutes of the incident taking place.
"There were fortunately no injuries and no personnel on site at the time."
The turbine has a tower height of 60 metres, an 80 metres rotor diameter, and an overall base to blade tip height of 100 metres.
People in the area said the rotor blades were spinning out of control on the evening the turbine buckled.
The sound of the failing mechanical structure was heard more than seven miles away.
Some people said the sound was like thunder. Others report grinding and the sound of metal against metal.
Debris from the stricken turbine was scattered across the mountainside and a large spike remains impaled in the earth several hundred yards from the turbine site.
The turbine is one of eight on Screggagh farm which was commissioned in April 2011.
The site operators have fenced off the site.
