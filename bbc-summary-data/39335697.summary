[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 1-0 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cole Stockton's second-half header proved enough as Tranmere beat Dover at Prenton Park to move level on points with National League leaders Lincoln.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The away side had the first chance of note, but Joe Healy sent his long-range thunderbolt wide 12 minutes in before Andy Cook found the side netting from Liam Ridehalgh's cross at the other end.
Rovers were awarded a penalty three minutes after the break when Connor Jennings was brought down in the box but James Norwood failed to convert as former Brighton goalkeeper Mitch Walker denied him an opener.
Tranmere's pressure finally paid off as they broke the deadlock in the 68th minute when substitute Stockton found space at the far post and got his head on the end of Ridehalgh's free-kick to hand his side their third straight win.
