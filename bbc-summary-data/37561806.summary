The budget airline, which has not flown from Aberdeen since September 2014, will operate three flights a week to the Latvian capital of Riga from May to September next year.
The launch is due to coincide with the completion of phase one of Aberdeen's Â£20m terminal redevelopment project.
The airport recently announced new flights to Faro in Portugal.
Ryanair will operate a twice-weekly service as part of its summer schedule next year.
Aberdeen Airport managing director Carol Benzie said: "This is brilliant news from Air Baltic and it will be fantastic to welcome them back to Aberdeen next summer.
"We are continually working to strengthen our route network and I'm delighted to add the vibrant, cosmopolitan city of Riga to our ever-expanding list of leisure routes."
