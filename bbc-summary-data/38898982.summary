[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The NHS "failed" a woman whose fatal spinal cancer went undiagnosed for months, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patricia Ann Whitehouse visited her GP seven times in two months complaining of back pain, her family said.
She also went to hospital but was discharged with Paracetamol. The 62-year-old was eventually diagnosed with multiple tumours and died on Tuesday.
University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust said it would "immediately investigate".

Trent Vale Medical Practice said it was a "tragic" case but it could not comment.
In a video recorded before she died and released to the BBC, Mrs Whitehouse said: "The doctors have failed me, the NHS has failed me."
Her son, Chris, said he wanted medics to admit they had made mistakes.
GPs diagnosed Mrs Whitehouse twice with a urinary tract infection, and later a twisted spine, between September and October 2016.
During that time she was also sent home with painkillers after spending nine hours on a trolley at Royal Stoke University Hospital A&E - a centre which has previously struggled with waiting times.
Mrs Whitehouse, from Stoke-on-Trent, was eventually told her condition was terminal in November after being diagnosed with two tumours on her right lung and one on her spine.
She underwent an operation in which she had rods fitted in her back, but was later paralysed by a fall during recovery at Bradwell Hospital while she was being moved, her brother Anthony said.
It made her ineligible for further treatment due to the risk of contracting an infection, he added.
