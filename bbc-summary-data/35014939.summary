[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trial of free overnight parking has started at some tram stops in Greater Manchester.

The three-month trial will operate at weekends at 15 Metrolink stops on Fridays and Saturday nights.
The trial is being introduced at car parks with 30 or more spaces so customers can still find a space at smaller car parks, Transport for Greater Manchester said.
At the moment, drivers face a Â£60 fine if they park overnight.
Motorists will have to pick up their cars before noon the following day.
