The facility is set to be built on land near Byron Street, Royton. The site is opposite the current Royton Sports Centre.
Oldham Council said it will include a six-lane 25m swimming pool, a learner pool, a gym and two dance studios.
A spokesman added the current site will close when the new site is completed. The new complex is due to open in October 2015.
A planning application for the latest design proposals will be formally submitted in February.
