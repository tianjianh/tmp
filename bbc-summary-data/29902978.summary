Some Girls cast say they are 'just as funny as boys'

The Some Girls characters spend a lot of time in cafes, so it is fitting that Newsbeat meets them in a cafe too.

This time it's a bit of a reunion for the four actors, who later on in the day are going to watch the first episode of series three.
Mandeep Dhillon, who plays Saz Kaur, has brought drinks to share later, in case there aren't any at the screening.
"There's no way to say this without sounding so cheesy," says Alice Feldgate, who plays Amber.
"So cheesy," chorus the other three, laughing.
"We're literally like best friends," says Alice. "We film all day and then on our break we're walking together, talking together, we're in each other's trailers, we eat lunch together, we eat off each other's plates, we wind each other up.
"We are closer than close can be."
Some Girls, which is airing on BBC Three, features four best friends, Saz, Amber, Viva, played by Adelayo Adedayo and Natasha Jonas in the role of Holli.
It has been described in numerous reviews as a female version of hit comedy series, The Inbetweeners.
The Some Girls cast believe they are making a positive difference in showing young women being humorous.
"It's really important going forward in the world that males and females are equal in all sorts of work, especially on TV and comedy," says Alice
"I think comedy is driving that forward, showing that girls are just as funny as boys. They can do just as much.
"One of the main things we're pleased about is that it's great being us girls that are part of this."
Natasha adds: "You also don't realise that girls are as crude as guys and I think Some Girls brings out the elements that females are not as innocent as everyone portrays."
Mandeep, who also appeared in 24: Live Another Day earlier this year, believes it reinforces their friendship, both off and on screen.
"It's so much fun to be able to say the stuff you would want to say in your head. I love the confidence they have," she says.
"But then friends are like that. I used to talk about naughty stuff like that, we all do."
Alice agrees, saying: "It's also about being young and not really having that fear or self-consciousness and just taking what you think is yours and going for it and making a bit of a fool of yourself.
"But it's ok because you'll get over it tomorrow."
The cast say they can feel like role-models for their young audience and that many of their fans like coming up to them to say which of their friends are like characters in the programme.
"It allows girls to feel like their irregular, that every girl goes through the same thing and they've got nothing to worry about and every little stress that we go through in Some Girls, it's the same stress they're going through right now," says Natasha, who previously featured in the 2011 film Attack the Block.
"It makes them feel more comfortable and like they're not the odd one out."
Some Girls is coming to an end after this series but it is clear that the stars would like to work together in the future - and that the success of the The Inbetweeners has inspired them.
"It's left very open. It doesn't end on a note that means it's gone," says Adelayo.
"I'd be happy to make another series," says Mandeep. "To be honest, I feel like a film would be amazing. I don't want it to be over just yet."
