Principality Welsh Premiership: Sponsors extend deal for one last season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh Premiership will continue to be sponsored by the Principality Building Society, which has extended its deal for the 2017/18 season.

The company, which took over naming rights of the former Millennium Stadium in January 2016 on a 10-year deal, will then cease to sponsor the competition.
That will bring an end to 13 seasons supporting the semi-pro league.
However, next season Principality will enter a new agreement putting its name to the WRU National Youth Leagues.
Welsh Rugby Union chief executive Martyn Phillips said: "Everyone involved in Welsh rugby's semi-professional league will be delighted by the prospect of another year of Principality Premiership action and, perhaps even more significantly, we welcome Principality Building Society on board as the new title sponsors of the WRU National Youth Leagues.
"Principality's commitment to Welsh rugby plays a vital role in helping us to safeguard the future of our national game and their direct interest in the grass roots and community end of the game is particularly significant."
This season's competition reaches its peak this weekend, when Aberavon face Merthyr in the 2017 Principality Premiership final at the Talbot Athletic Ground on Sunday, 21 May (ko 1530 BST).
The Tier Two final between Neath and Newport takes place at the Gnoll on Saturday night (ko 1930 BST).
