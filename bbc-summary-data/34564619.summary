Well-wishers gathered to congratulate the 23-year-old who set a record as Ireland's first male gold medal winner at the World Amateur Championships in Doha earlier this week.
The Belfast boxer and Ireland team captain beat Murodjon Akhmadaliev of Uzbekistan on a unanimous points decision in Doha.
He said his win had not "sunk in".
"I can't thank the supporters enough, they really, really mean a lot to me," he said.
"It's unbelievable and the support I've been getting from back home has been fantastic.
"The amount of people from back home who were in Doha in the venue shouting and singing was phenomenal."
Conlan had already qualified for next year's Olympic Games in Rio.
