Wem swimming pool: Improvement plans as new operator takes over

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new operator has been chosen to run a Shropshire swimming pool where there are plans to improve facilities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The current operator of Wem pool has told the town council it will stop managing it in December.
The council has awarded a two-year contract starting in January to the Severn Centre Trust, which runs a leisure and community complex in Highley.
Peter Broomhall, mayor of Wem, said the trust had a "proven track record".
Mr Broomhall said the town now hoped to get grants to build a fitness suite and improve other facilities at the pool.
The Friends of Wem Swimming Pool group also put in a bid to run the pool.
Mr Broomhall said he hoped the Friends group would still "have some input" in its running.
The pool was closed briefly two years ago before the current operator took over.
