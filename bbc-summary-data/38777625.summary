London 'super head' Greg Wallace wins High Court ban appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "super head" has won a High Court appeal against a teaching ban following allegations of financial mismanagement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greg Wallace, of Best Start Federation schools in Hackney, east London, was accused of awarding contracts worth more than Â£1m to C2 Technology, a company run by a friend.
He was banned for a minimum of two years by the Department for Education (DfE) in 2013.
The court ruled a "less intrusive measure" should have been implemented.
A panel of judges said there was a public interest in maintaining his "exceptional contribution to education".
Previously, former education secretary Michael Gove described Mr Wallace as one of a "magnificent seven" of head teachers running outstanding schools in deprived areas.
He was not initially banned, but the DfE overruled a recommendation from the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) that a ban should not be imposed because of his "inspirational example" as an educator.
Mr Wallace was accused of awarding contracts without seeking approval from school governors to a firm owned by a friend and partner, and attempting to cover up evidence by deleting emails.
He was also accused of receiving payments from the firm, including one of Â£4,000.
Mr Wallace went to the High Court in a statutory appeal against the DfE's insistence on a teaching ban.
He won his case in a ruling handed down in Birmingham by Mr Justice Holgate on Friday.
