Barnsley 1-0 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Williams scored a late winner to secure a vital three points for Barnsley against Peterborough in their pursuit of a League One play-off spot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The win moved Barnsley level on points with sixth-placed Gillingham.
Posh were reduced to 10 men when Chris Forrester picked up two bookings in the space of 20 first-half seconds.
Ben Alnwick looked to have denied the hosts the win with a string of fine saves before Williams nodded in Adam Hammill's cross with seconds to go.
