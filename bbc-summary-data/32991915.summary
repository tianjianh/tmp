The European Central Bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 0.05% as latest economic reports suggest improvement in the eurozone.

The ECB has held rates at this level across the 19 countries that use the euro currency since September 2014.
Since February, it has turned to its monthly â‚¬60bn bond-buying programme, or quantitative easing, to stimulate the economy.
On Wednesday the OECD lifted eurozone growth forecasts from 1.1% to 1.4%.
It credited bolder-than-expected monetary easting by the European Central Bank for the increase.
For next year, the think-tank now expects growth in the euro area to be 2.1%, up from 1.7%.
Other data released on Wednesday showed eurozone unemployment improving.
Official figures showed the jobless rate fell to 11.1% in April, down from 11.2% the month before.
Separately, an influential survey from Markit indicated eurozone companies created jobs at the fastest pace in four years last month.
May was the seventh month in a row that firms in the eurozone had increased employment, Markit found.
Job creation accelerated last month in Germany, France and Spain, Markit said, with job growth in Spain hitting its fastest rate for more than seven years.
However, the survey also indicated that economic growth in the eurozone's private sector lost steam last month.
Markit's composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) dipped to 53.6 in May from 53.9 in April. A figure above 50 indicates growth.
"The eurozone recovery lost some of the wind from its sails in May, with growth of output and new orders both slowing to three-month lows," said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
He added that the weak euro was boosting manufacturing, but the still-high unemployment in the region continued to limit spending on goods and services.
In addition to the monthly unemployment statistics, the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat also reported that retail sales rose 0.7% in April.
That brought the year-on-year increase to 2.2%, which was higher than analysts had forecast.
