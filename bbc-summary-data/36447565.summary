HMS Ganges: 40th anniversary of Royal Navy leaving training base

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For decades, HMS Ganges in Suffolk was the first taste of naval life for generations of Royal Navy recruits. But 40 years ago, on 6 June 1976, it was decided that the training base would close.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the years since its future has been the subject of much debate and remains unclear even now.
HMS Ganges was the name given to several Royal Navy ships since from 1779, but in 1905 it was chosen as title for a new training base at Shotley Gate, near Ipswich where about 500 boy recruits were stationed.
In 1907, its famous 143ft (44m)-high training mast was erected on the parade ground for recruits to climb.
Recruit numbers rose to 2,000 during World War Two, but dropped to about 1,000 by the late 1960s and declined further until the base closed for good in June 1976.
In 1967, the then Blue Peter presenter John Noakes made his ascent of the mast for the BBC's programme in an attempt to emulate the "button boy" who would reach the very top of the mast and stand hands-free with only a supporting bar between his legs.
More footage shows the button boy standing, hands-free, on the button, with a support bar between his legs.
Plans for a development of 285 homes by Galliard Homes were approved by Babergh District Council in 2013.
The plans also include a hotel, a 60 bed nursing home, retail and commercial units and a commitment to restore the listed ceremonial mast, which has fallen into disrepair.
In 2009, the Ipswich Maritime Trust estimated the cost of the mast restoration would be at least Â£400,000.
Woolverstone Parish Council lodged an application for the judicial review on the grounds that traffic flows on the B1456 had not been fully taken into consideration.
The hearing is due to take place next month.
