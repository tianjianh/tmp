The 24-year-old Brighton & Hove Albion player was accused of attacking Gregor Jurcic, 27, outside Atik nightclub in Windsor on Christmas Day 2015.
The midfielder was found not guilty by a unanimous jury at Reading Crown Court of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
His solicitor, Steven Barker, said Mr Ince was "glad the ordeal is over".
"He's looking forward to getting his career back on track," he said.
During the trial, the court heard the doorman suffered a "nasty" head injury that required seven staples and resulted in scarring.
Up to 500 people had gathered outside the nightclub, on Victoria Street, between 03:30 and 04:00 GMT on 25 December 2015.
Ince, who is currently on loan at Swindon Town, was accused of jumping up and hitting Mr Jurcic, who was helping police disperse revellers at the time.
The footballer denied carrying out the attack and insisted it was a case of mistaken identity.
Forensic expert Helen Davies cast doubt on whether a bloodstain found on Mr Ince's jacket was caused during or after the attack.
In a statement, she said: "In my opinion I would not expect a transfer of Gregor Jurcic's blood on to Rohan Ince's jacket as a result of hitting Mr Jurcic over the head with a bottle from behind, as alleged."
She said it could have got there when Mr Jurcic, by then bleeding heavily, approached Mr Ince as he was being restrained on the ground by a police officer and another doorman.
In police interviews played and read to the court, Mr Ince said he was "gobsmacked" at being arrested.
