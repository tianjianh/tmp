Luke Morton, from the West Midlands, was washed off rocks at Mwnt on Sunday, 7 August.
Coastguards said Mr Morton and another man had been out walking when they were cut off by the tide and he was caught by the waves.
Extensive searches were called off after three days.
Dyfed-Powys Police said the force and other emergency services had since carried out periodic checks of the coast in the area.
