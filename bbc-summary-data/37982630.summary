[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield United 1-0 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield United needed an injury-time goal from Ethan Ebanks-Landell to beat nine-man managerless Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-Bury player scored from close in, just as the visitors looked set to hold on for an unlikely point.
Stefan Scougall hit the bar as the Blades dominated before Jacob Mellis was sent off for a foul on Matt Done.
They had two second-half efforts cleared off the line and Leon Clarke had a goal disallowed before Greg Leigh was sent off for a second yellow.
The win kept United in second place in League One, six points off leaders Scunthorpe, while Bury are just two points off the relegation places after their ninth consecutive league defeat.
