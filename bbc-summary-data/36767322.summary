The 23-year-old right-back also rejected offers from Dundee and Polish top-flight club Jagiellonia Bialystok.
Thistle manager Alan Archibald told the club's website: "It's great to bring Ziggy to the club.
"He has a wealth of experience at Premiership level and I'm sure he'll be a great addition to the squad."
Thistle were looking for right-back cover after Mustapha Dumbuya suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon and Gary Miller left for Plymouth Argyle.
Gordon, who came through the youth ranks with Accies and made 40 appearances last season, had been viewed by Dundee as a replacement for Paul McGinn, who moved to Chesterfield this summer.
"Paul Hartley is a fantastic manager and he's a great guy as well, but my gut feeling at the time was that it wasn't the right path for me to go on," the Scottish defender told BBC Scotland ahead of Thistle's announcement.
Jagiellonia, from Bialystok in the east of Poland, finished 11th in last season's Ekstraklasa and had a transfer bid for the defender rejected in January 2015.
"These two were really good offers," said Gordon, whose mother's family hail from Krakow. "People would bite your hand off to go to either club - massive clubs with massive opportunities.
"Dundee are a big club here and I'm sure they'll do well this season and Bialystok in Poland, they are a big club and have just got a new stadium as well - 17,000 fans every week.
"So it was a very tough decision and I don't take it lightly. It just didn't sit well enough with me to sign."
Gordon admitted that it was a difficult decision to leave New Douglas Park.
"I'm the kind of person that really needs to think about the decision he makes and I've been at Hamilton for a long time - 13 years, since I was 10 years old," he added.
"This next step is really crucial for my development and my career, so it is not one I take too lightly.
"It is very emotional, especially with the season we had last season. It was a really up and down season - in some parts we looked like a top-six team and then in other parts we looked like relegation candidates.
"It made it more emotional helping to keep them in the Premiership."
