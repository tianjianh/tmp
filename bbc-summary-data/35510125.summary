[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts' Premiership match against Patrick Thistle has been postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Referee Bobby Madden inspected the pitch around 13:15 GMT and judged it to be unfit for play, with several areas covered in water.
Hearts, 11 points clear in third place but 11 behind Aberdeen in second, were aiming to continue a run of just one defeat in 16 Premiership matches.
They face Hibs in a Scottish Cup fifth-round replay at Easter Road on Tuesday.
Partick, in eighth place after a run of just two defeats in 10 matches, host Aberdeen in the Premiership next Friday, 19 February.
