It has announced a price drop of up to 9.75% that follows last week's announcement by SSE Airtricity to cut gas bills.
The price drop is for those living in the greater Belfast area.
The company is to make an announcement for other customers in the "ten towns" area in the coming days.
Michael Scott, Firmus Energy's managing director, said: ""We monitor all costs and global wholesale fuel prices on a daily basis to ensure our prices offer the best value possible and any savings are passed on as soon as we can to our customers."
Richard Williams, of the Consumer Council, said: "This is great news for Firmus Energy customers who will save around Â£50 on their annual gas bill."
Mr Williams said all gas consumers in greater Belfast would benefit from recent cuts.
"We would encourage all gas customers in the greater Belfast area to shop around to get the best possible price and service," he said.
"Even switching payment or billing method can save money."
"We have lots of resources to help, from our online gas price comparison tool to our step-by-step guide to the switching process."
Earlier in February, Power NI announced electric bills for its 500,000 domestic customers would fall by 10.3% from April.
