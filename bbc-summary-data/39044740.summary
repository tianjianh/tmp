Luke Johns, 19, from Llantwit Fardre, near Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, suffered fatal head injuries in a fall at the building in Cobourg Street, Plymouth, at 02:30 GMT on Sunday.
Police have said he fell "a number of floors" in the communal stairway.
Officers are not treating his death as suspicious.
Mr Johns was a Cardiff City Football Club supporter who followed the team home and away.
The team's supporters' club posted on Twitter: "On behalf of all at the supporters club, I send my deepest condolences to Luke's family and friends. Such sad news #RIPBluebird."
A crowdfunding page launched by Mr Johns' friends has so far raised more than Â£3,000 to help cover the cost of his funeral.
Sam Roberts, who set up the page, described him as "a friend, a brother and a loving son".
"We are going to raise as much money as possible to help Luke's family really give him the send-off he deserves," he added.
