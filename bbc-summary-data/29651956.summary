Vinyl sales on course to top one million this year

A relic for music geeks and collectors only?

A by-product of a musical age that's long been forgotten?
For years, vinyl records have been seen by many as a thing of the past, but are they?
New figures out today are another indicator that the tide could be turning for the once "near extinct" format.
Earlier in the year we told you that 18 to 24-year-olds are buying more vinyl records than any other age group under 50.
Today there's more good news for fans of the LP.
Data collected by The Official Chart Company shows that 800,000 records have been sold so far this year.
That's already more than were bought during all of last year (780,674).
The figures suggest that vinyl sales are on track to top one million this year.  The last time that happened was all the way back in 1996.
That year the Fugees' LP The Score was the top-selling record. In 2014 it seems it's the Arctic Monkeys' album AM that has helped drive sales.
The Indy rockers' fifth studio album is the biggest-selling of the year on vinyl, following up its success as 2013's best-seller.
But it's not just down to one band. Jack White, Oasis, Led Zeppelin and newcomers Royal Blood make up the top five best-selling vinyl artists of 2014.
In total 112 LPs have sold more than 1,000 copies - more than double the number of titles compared with this time last year.
The figures released today by the Official Charts Company show just how far the format has come in the past few years.
Back in 2007 when vinyl was at its lowest ebb only 205,292 records were sold.
Lynne McDowell from the British Recorded Music Industry (BPI) said: "Vinyl may once have been considered a by-product of a bygone era but it is now well and truly a flourishing format making a comeback in a digital age.
"It appears that music fans still crave a tangible product that gives them original artwork, high audio quality, and purity of sound".
So don't be surprised if your mates start turning up to parties with a stack of LPs as well as their MP3 player.
