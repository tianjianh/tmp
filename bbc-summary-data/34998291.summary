[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Firefighters in Wales have been delayed more than 500 times in three years between arriving at the scene of a fire and starting to tackle it.

Figures obtained by BBC Wales show South Wales Fire and Rescue Service recorded the highest number of delays - 460 - since January 2013.
Reasons included access problems and being sent in the wrong direction.
Firefighter David Bound told the BBC delays were "a daily occurrence, sometimes several times a day".
Mid and west Wales firefighters were delayed just 11 times in three years and the north Wales service 57 times.
Crews across Wales have tackled more than 9,000 fires since January 2013.
The main reason for delays was access problems, with firefighters held up 364 times, and there were 114 delays due to crews not being able to find the blaze.
Firefighters were sent in the wrong direction 47 times and on three occasions "civil disturbances" held up crews in south Wales.
Mr Bound, watch manager at Tonypandy in Rhondda Cynon Taff, said access problems happened daily.
"Engines are quite long and wide and some streets are so narrow, with cars parked. Once we arrive we have got to get the equipment and get out of the fire engine ourselves.
"We understand it's difficult for people to park by their own houses but [it would help] if more people did think to acknowledge tight corners in their locality.
"Delays because of access are a daily occurrence, sometimes several times a day."
Mr Bound said poor or a lack of directions can also cause problems.
"We had a call recently for Penrhys and the only information we had was 'Penrhys estate' so the vehicle had to search through the estate for the fire.
"We will always attend as quickly as we can, and force entry quite quickly.
"But if there is a delay for whatever reason it delays us in our duties which could have an impact on people's lives."
The number of delays fell over the three years in south and north Wales, but rose in mid and west Wales.
Firefighters in south Wales were delayed 187 times in 2013, 138 times in 2014 and the most recent figure for 2015 was 135.
In north Wales there were 26 delays in 2013, which dropped to 14 by 2015. Mid and west Wales fighters were delayed just once in 2013 and five times in 2014 and 2015.
Some parts of Wales - including Carmarthenshire - did not record any delays in three years while Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire only recorded one each.
