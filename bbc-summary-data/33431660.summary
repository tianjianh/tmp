A schoolgirl who almost died in a freak bicycle accident has been reunited with the paramedics and police officers whose quick actions saved her life.

Alanna Casement ripped an artery when she landed on top of her bike and the handlebar gouged into her leg.
The 12-year-old suffered severe blood loss after the crash in Castlewellan Forest Park, County Down, in July 2014.
Doctors believe that without the first aid Alanna received at the scene, she may not have survived.
Now, at a special event in Belfast one year on, the schoolgirl has thanked her friend's father Raymond Rice and the emergency services staff who helped her and flew her to hospital by helicopter.
Alanna, from Annacloy in County Down, also got to take another trip in the police helicopter, but this time in much happier circumstances.
"It's just really a huge thank you to every single one of them who participated in me being here today," she said.
"I can't really thank them enough for it. They helped me be here today."
Mr Rice said he still had nightmares about what he saw when he rushed to the crash scene.
"There was blood everywhere, I grabbed my hands around her leg and held as tight as I could until the paramedics came along," he said.
"Things didn't look too good then but fortunately today she's here to tell the tale and we are all glad it has turned out the way it has."
Rapid response paramedic Brian Lynn said it was one of the worst injuries he had ever seen sustained by a child.
"In 30 years' experience, dealing with traumas through the Troubles and stuff like that, it was quite a bad, serious wound."
He recalled an emotional exchange he and Alanna shared as they flew in the helicopter to hospital in Belfast.
"At one point she just turned up and looked at me and said was she going to die. I said: 'Not today.'"
Ronan Moore, of the PSNI's air support unit, said Alanna's case showed the importance of being able to transport a patient by air.
"Whilst the helicopter took approximately 10 minutes to transport Alanna to hospital, the same journey by road would have taken 45 minutes. That 35 minutes has made the difference," he said.
"Everyone saw that big beaming smile today, it makes it all worthwhile."
Alanna's mother Colette said her daughter had travelled a "long road" to recovery.
"She was in hospital for three weeks and left hospital in a wheelchair.
"We didn't know if she would ever walk again, but now thankfully she is back on her feet after a lot of hard work and determination," she said.
Mrs Casement said the event was an opportunity for Alanna to say thank you because she did not have the chance to do that last year.
"Hopefully this day will be the memory that lasts in Alanna's memory and not the memories of 19 July last year."
