County Championship: Sussex rally to earn draw with Worcestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sussex pulled off an unlikely escape at New Road as they and Worcestershire each shared a fifth County Championship Division Two draw of the season.

Resuming on their overnight score of 137-3, Sussex still needed a further 76 to make Worcestershire bat again.
But youngster Harry Finch scored his first Championship half-century (57).
And both Matt Machan (66) Ross Taylor (62) added to the lead set by Ed Joyce the previous day before declaring on 411-9, 158 runs ahead.
Despite the threat of early-morning rain, the weather remained kind, but Worcestershire still failed to finish the job off as Sussex comfortably cleared their overnight deficit for the loss of only nightwatchman Lewis Hatchett.
Matt Henry finished with 4-122, while his New Zealand international team-mate Taylor completed his second half-century for the county.
Worcestershire now visit Grace Road to face Leicestershire this Sunday (22 May), although they will be in T20 Blast action before then, at home to Durham on Friday night (20 May).
Sussex start their T20 campaign against Gloucestershire at Bristol the same night before an eight-day break ahead of their next Championship game, at home to Derbyshire, starting on Saturday, 28 May.
Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"Both teams deserve a lot of credit. Worcestershire for bossing the game. We got a score on the board and made them follow on.
"But then you have to take your hat off to the opposition. They dug deep and made life very difficult for us.
"We really tried hard. I couldn't fault the efforts of the bowlers. We went through quite a lot of overs and there were a few tired and sore bodies afterwards."
Sussex head coach Mark Davis:
"After day one it was going to be hard work. We wanted to see character and skill out there.
"To get five points out of the game was not easy. We had to grind it out.
"Leaving with a draw is almost like a win. We played with heart, which is what I am after."
