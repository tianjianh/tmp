The 34-year-old hit four sixes and two fours, while Sussex's Luke Wright made 45 off 37 balls in a total of 148-7.
But Tim Ludeman hit the fastest Big Bash fifty, off 18 balls, making 92 as Adelaide won by eight wickets.
Pietersen led the Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League this year but was released when they finished bottom.
He made 294 runs in 11 games at an average of 29.40, with a highest score of 58.
In February, he was told he would no longer be selected by England.
