A spokesman said officers were called to Waverley School, in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, at about 10:30 BST.
A Year 11 pupil suffered a minor head injury, a force spokesman said, with another in the same year being shot in the hand, West Midlands Police said.
Both pupils refused medical treatment and left school shortly after.
The suspect was later arrested on suspicion of assault and criminal damage.
Police said they were investigating what happened but believe it was "an isolated incident and that the pupils involved are known to each other".
Waverley School said they were "unable to comment" as it was a "police matter".
