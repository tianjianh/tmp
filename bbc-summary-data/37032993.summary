Rio Olympics 2016: David Oliver Joyce bows out to increase Irish boxing woes

Ireland's Olympic boxing woes continued as lightweight David Oliver Joyce bowed out in the last 16 of his division against Azerbaijan's Albert Selimov.

The Azeri fighter, silver medallist at last year's World Championships, proved far too elusive for the Mullingar man.
Selimov won on all three judges cards and the Irishman could have few complaints with the unanimous verdict.
Joyce's defeat came after news that team-mate Michael O'Reilly had opted not to contest a failed drugs test.
Middleweight O'Reilly, 23, is now out of the Games after being handed a suspension.
In a statement handed to Irish broadcaster RTE, O'Reilly said he unintentionally took a supplement that may have contained a banned substance.
On Monday, big Irish medal hope Paddy Barnes made a shock exit in the light-flyweight division as he was edged out by Spain's Samuel Carmona.
Barnes, who won bronze medals at the last two games, said that difficulties in making the 49 kilogram limit had left him totally bereft of energy during the contest.
Joe Ward will hope to give the Irish boxing team a badly needed boost by accounting for Ecuador's Carlos Mina in the light-heavyweight division on Wednesday evening (23:15 BST).
Westmeath fight Ward reached the final at last year's World Championships in Doha and is regarded as a strong Irish medal hope in Rio.
Ireland's other fighters still in the tournament are defending women's lightweight champion Katie Taylor and Northern Ireland trio Michael Conlan, Steven Donnelly and Brendan Irvine.
