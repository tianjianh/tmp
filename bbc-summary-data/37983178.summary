Boreham Wood 1-0 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Upwardly mobile Boreham Wood edged into the top seven of the National League with a hard-fought win at home to Sutton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Meadow Park club picked up the pace midway through the first half and took the lead when Anthony Jeffrey beat Ross Worner with an effort from a tight angle.
Craig Eastmond nearly equalised just before the break with a block challenge that forced goalkeeper Grant Smith to scramble and save on his line.
Paul Doswell's side contributed fully to a combative affair, and Chris Dickson was unlucky not to ruffle the roof of the net with a header.
The U's battled well, but failed to end a run of six league matches without a win.
