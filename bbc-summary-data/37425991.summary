Iceland women 1-2 Scotland women: Anna Signeul eyes improvement after win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anna Signeul says Scotland must strive to be at an even higher level once Euro 2017 comes round next summer, following Tuesday's 2-1 win over Iceland.

The Scots had already qualified but showed their appetite for success had not dissipated with an impressive showing against the group winners.
But Signeul hopes it simply marks another step on an upward trajectory.
"We're not happy with this. We want to improve and be even better," the Swede told BBC Scotland.
"But this is a really good start on our journey towards Rotterdam.
"Hopefully we'll have a game against very good opposition in October and every game now will be important for us to improve, to get high intensity, fast decisions and to play really physically."
But the victory did go some way towards making up for the 4-0 defeat at the hands of Iceland in June - Scotland's only defeat of the campaign.
"We were so disappointed after that because we thought we could win that game. We have rectified it now," added Signeul.
"I'm so proud of them and most of all they're proud of themselves. They really stepped up to the plate and showed what they are about. Everyone took huge responsibility and it was a great team effort."
Jane Ross scored both of Scotland's goals and she too believes the team can get better before Euro 2017 kicks off in the Netherlands next July, with the draw taking place on 8 November.
"Our preparations for the tournament have already started so to come here and put in the performance we did, we can only take confidence from that and hopefully build on that," she told BBC Scotland.
"Every game's going to be challenging when you go to a tournament but as we showed today we're capable of putting in good performances, both defensively and attacking-wise.
"Anna's brought the team forward in leaps and bounds. We have a very good, strong squad at the moment, not just a strong starting XI, and we've got competition for places all over the park and there's obviously improvements to be made.
"We want to go there to show Europe and the world we're able to compete with these teams, so we want to get out the group once we get there."
