British Canoeing confirms new investigation into abuse allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British Canoeing and UK Sport will hold a second investigation after new abuse claims against a coach.

The coach has been suspended since December and an initial investigation has now been concluded.
But when new and separate claims of a historical nature emerged in April, British Canoeing approached UK Sport to help commission a second investigation.
British Canoeing said: "We take these matters extremely seriously and will ensure that they are fully dealt with."
It added that it would not be commenting on the results of the initial investigation until a hearing had taken place.
A statement from UK Sport said: "We are able to confirm that we are working with British Canoeing to establish a second and separate independent investigation about further allegations which were received in April 2017. This investigation will commence shortly."
The latest revelations come amid mounting concern over the culture of high-performance programmes at British sports, and whether medal success has come at the expense of athlete welfare.
Earlier this year, BBC Sport revealed British Swimming is conducting an investigation after bullying complaints were made by a number of Paralympians about a coach.
Last month, British Cycling apologised for various "failings" after an independent review into allegations of bullying and sexism. The long-awaited report will be published on Wednesday.
British Canoeing enjoyed its most successful Olympic Games in Rio last year, with competitors winning two gold medals and two silvers.
ParalympicsGB then claimed three gold and two bronze medals at the Rio Paralympics, where they topped the medal table.
