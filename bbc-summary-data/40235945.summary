Somerset v Yorkshire: Steven Patterson checks hosts' run chase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three Steven Patterson wickets put Yorkshire in a strong position as Somerset reached 101-4 chasing 262 to win their Division One game at Taunton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patterson dismissed both Somerset openers and captain Tom Abell.
Earlier, Somerset spinner Dom Bess (5-80) was helped by Jack Leach (3-53) as four Yorkshire batsmen fell in 30 minutes after lunch.
Visiting skipper Gary Ballance (98 not out) top-scored but ran out of partners as they were all out for 283.
The loss of experienced duo James Hildreth and Marcus Trescothick was a key blow for the hosts, who need another 161 runs for a first County Championship win of the season.
Somerset will resume on Monday with Adam Hose and Steven Davies, who steadied the ship with a 50-run partnership.
Peter Handscomb (70) was one of the batsmen dismissed by 19-year-old Bess, who has four five-wicket hauls from five County Championship matches this season.
England batsman Ballance seemed destined for a fourth century of the campaign but was left stranded two runs short as Karl Carver was run out and Ryan Sidebottom was trapped lbw for a duck before tea.
At that stage the match looked evenly poised, but seamer Patterson's inspired spell means the Tykes go into the final day as slight favourites.
