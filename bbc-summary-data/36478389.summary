Wigan head coach Shaun Wane believes there is much more to come from his squad in the second half of the season.

The Warriors have won three Super League games in a row and sit just two points behind leaders Hull FC.
"I think we're off it at the moment, I don't think we're anywhere near our potential," Wane, 51, told BBC Radio Manchester.
"I was asked a few weeks ago and I said we're four or five out of 10 and I still think the same."
He added: "I don't mean to say that in an arrogant way, I genuinely believe that. I know what the players are capable of."
Wigan winger Josh Charnley has impressed during their recent run, including a hat-trick in Friday's win at Salford.
He has now scored 15 tries in 17 outings in what is his final season with the club before a cross-code switch to Sale Sharks.
"I think he's been great," added Wane. "I do think his performances have improved and that shows you the mental strength of Josh Charnley.
"He'll be sorely missed by us, but he wants to go out of this season with a bang and the way he's playing at the moment, he's been outstanding.
"He has my mentality that we want to win things every single year, and he's playing that way."
