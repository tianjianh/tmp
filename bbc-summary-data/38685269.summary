Pte John Fielding, of Cwmbran, received the Victoria Cross for his part in the 1879 defence of Rorke's Drift.
A band and parade of veterans marched from Abbyfields to St Michael and All Angels church, Llantarnam, where a service marked the battle's 138th anniversary.
Pte Fielding joined the 24th Regiment of Foot at the age of 20 in 1877.
Two years later, he was one of about 140 British troops who fought hand to hand with 4,000 Zulus.
He lived to the age of 75, dying of heart failure in 1932.
Newport Road was closed for a short time for the event which was organised by Cwmbran and District Ex-Service Association.
