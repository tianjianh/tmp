Mourinho, Conte, Guardiola & Klopp: Which newcomer will prosper?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jose Mourinho's arrival at Manchester United cements the Premier League's status as the home of the superstar managers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
United, Chelsea and Manchester City will all start next season under new management in the shape of Mourinho, Antonio Conte at Stamford Bridge and Pep Guardiola at The Etihad.
Jurgen Klopp is a relatively new arrival at Liverpool after joining in October as the cream of the coaching crop - as well as Arsene Wenger and Mauricio Pochettino in situ at Arsenal and Tottenham respectively - prepare to battle it out next season.
So who will come out on top in the Premier League's own version of Fantasy Football Manager? We assess the credentials of the superstar coaches who will be moulding new teams in 2016/17.
The 46-year-old Italian brings domestic and international experience to Chelsea, both as a player and a coach.
He won five Serie A titles as an energetic midfield player with Juventus along with the Uefa Cup and the Champions League in 1996 before winning three Serie A titles in charge of 'The Old Lady'.
Conte is a serious coach of real substance who has enhanced his reputation with the Italian national team. He will feel he has all the tools to transform Chelsea from the struggles of last season.

Guardiola is the most celebrated and coveted coach in European, perhaps world, football. He is respected to the point of being idolised by many of his peers, who admire his brilliant work with Barcelona.
He won the treble of the Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey in his first season in charge in 2008-09.
Guardiola repeated the Champions League win in 2011, with Manchester United suffering on both occasions as they were swept away by the Catalan team's attacking football.
The former midfielder, who won the European Cup with Barcelona as a player in 1992, moved to Bayern Munich after a sabbatical following his Nou Camp success.
His spell in Bavaria was regarded as unfulfilled by some because he failed to win the Champions League, yet he won the Bundesliga in three successive seasons, adding the German Cup twice too.

Klopp, 48, is the great motivator and rejuvenator of clubs. He did it first at Mainz, where he was a player, getting them into the Bundesliga, and then even more successfully at Borussia Dortmund.
He took over in 2008 and unseated the mighty Bayern to win the Bundesliga in 2010-11 and 2011-12. Borussia also became a force in Europe, losing the Champions League final to big-spending Bayern in 2013.
Klopp was one of the most coveted coaches in world football when Liverpool tempted him away from a sabbatical in October 2015 and his impact was felt as they reached the League Cup final and Europa League final, although they lost both to Manchester City and Sevilla.
Verdict: 7
The self-appointed 'Special One' may not have been an outstanding player but his CV extends to several pages owing to a bulging list of honours.
One of the most decorated coaches the game has ever seen, Mourinho came to prominence by winning the Uefa Cup and Champions League with Porto before moving to Chelsea in 2004 and winning the Premier League twice.
At Porto, he defied the odds by winning the Champions League without huge financial investment, knocking Manchester United out along the way, before delivering Inter Milan's first triumph in the tournament for 45 years when they beat Louis van Gaal's Bayern Munich in 2010.
La Liga and Copa del Rey wins followed at Real Madrid before another title at Chelsea in 2014-15 - now Old Trafford awaits.
Verdict: 9
Quiz: How well do you know Mourinho?
Media playback is not supported on this device
There is a talented squad at Chelsea, but a tough task lies ahead.
Can he get Eden Hazard playing in the way that inspired their title win in the 2014/15 season? Will the decision to keep captain John Terry on a one-year contract prove to be an inspired choice or delay transition into a new era? Can he get Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas firing again?
This is a squad that needs re-energising - and arguably an injection of new, younger blood.
Conte will undoubtedly get the usual hefty financial backing from owner Roman Abramovich but there is no Champions League football to entice the bigger names.
Verdict: 7
Guardiola will surely overhaul a City squad that underperformed badly last season, despite winning the Capital One Cup and reaching the Champions League semi-final.
The core of the side remains the same as that which won the Premier League in 2011-12: Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Sergio Aguero.
Yet Kompany's fitness is increasingly unreliable and Toure's time at City is surely over.
Other than Kevin de Bruyne, the most recent purchases have not come up to the mark, with Raheem Sterling, Nicolas Otamendi and Eliaquim Mangala so far failing to justify combined transfer fees in excess of Â£100m.
Guardiola must strengthen in all areas to breathe fresh life into a stale squad.
It is a big task - but he will be backed by one of the biggest transfer budgets in world football to ensure he achieves success.
Verdict: 8
Klopp's task has been made a lot harder by the absence of Champions League football following defeat in the Europa League final - but he will have a full summer to get Liverpool's players at the fitness levels required to play his high-intensity 'Gegenpressing' style.
He will have a considerable budget at his disposal but improving Liverpool won't be easy as others try to strengthen and succeed at the same time.
It is likely he will look to the familiarity of the Bundesliga to sign some lesser-known players he hopes he will be able to mould into a superstar team.

Like Klopp at Liverpool, Mourinho must also rebuild a disjointed squad at United. There will surely be a large summer turnover as Bastian Schweingsteiger, Michael Carrick, Morgan Schneiderlin, Juan Mata and others wait to discover their future.
Where goalkeeper David de Gea - arguably United's most important player - begins next season is also intriguing.
The Portuguese will want to bring in his own players, and the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Everton's John Stones have been touted as potential arrivals. Certainly, there will be no wasted time - Mourinho always wants to hit the ground running.
He will demand a more coherent transfer strategy than United have had under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal - but even the ultimate 'supercoach' is unlikely to be an instant fix.
Verdict: 7
No European football, but Chelsea will be able to offer big money and a London location. They may struggle to attract the names they did previously though, and will have to shell out a lot to get them in their current circumstances.
Verdict: 7
The full package is on offer here. Guardiola is revered in footballing circles as the coach who improves players and wins honours. He is also at a club with limitless ambition and finance.
Guardiola has been brought in to improve the squad he inherits and to entice the cream to City. They will make offers that will be difficult to refuse. He will also be able to put Champions League football on the table - unlike Conte, Klopp and Mourinho.
Verdict: 9
It is hard to imagine anyone not wanting to play for Klopp after spending time with the charismatic German. If Liverpool get their transfer targets in a room with their manager, he will surely work his magic successfully.
His life will be made harder without Champions League football, but Liverpool can offer history, finance and ambition - and the Anfield club will hope Klopp's force of personality can do the rest.
Verdict: 7
Again like Klopp, Mourinho will rely on personal pulling power at Old Trafford to haul in new signings. The lure of 'The Theatre Of Dreams' and his track record of success will also be an attraction.
It will be a case of promising 'jam tomorrow' for Mourinho, with no Champions League football - and this is what Manchester United will be banking on as they rebuild after Louis van Gaal's sacking.
Verdict: 8
Former Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo once said of Conte: "When he speaks, his words assault you. They crash through your mind, often quite violently, and settle within."
This is not a shrinking violet. He is not afraid to bruise egos or be trifled with. Conte will certainly stand his ground in the verbal exchanges in the Premier League; he will be happy to fight his corner with his own players and opposition managers alike.
Conte is a man of stature who can handle himself on this stage.
Verdict: 6
The dynamic between Mourinho and Guardiola in Manchester will be a narrative running through next season.
Mourinho got under Guardiola's skin when they were in opposition with Real Madrid and Barcelona in La Liga.
Mourinho chipped away at Guardiola, who sarcastically called him "the one who knows more than anyone else" before Barcelona beat Real 2-0 in the Bernabeu in the 2011 Champions League semi-final.
Guardiola, deeply analytical and intelligent, will be ready for what might come from across the city this season and will try to make sure it is a case of 'once bitten, twice shy' in his battle with Mourinho.
Verdict: 7
Klopp is not one for mind games but is hardly behind the door in the technical area and has already clashed with fourth officials and opposition managers in his first months in England.
He will not be verbally bullied by any of his contemporaries or intimidated on the touchline. He has an imposing presence - and will certainly not shy away from perceived mind games.
Verdict: 7
The master manipulator and agitator supreme. Will he rein in the confrontational style that has brought endless brushes with opposition managers and authority throughout his career, and therefore cool some of the reservations inside the club about his approach?

Old habits die hard, though, so expect him to fire a few jabs in the direction of Guardiola. He will need to ensure it does not become a sideshow as it did last season, deflecting him from the task in hand.
Verdict: 8
Conte's abrasive style will make him watchable while as a coach he can be flexible - either pragmatic or entertaining. His teams are compact and he will expect the likes of Hazard and Willian to do their share of defensive duties.
He secured his success at Juventus with a 3-5-2 formation, but will adopt whatever style he feels will bring victory.
Verdict: 7
Guardiola's touchline demeanour and body language is on the edge, almost literally, as he stalks the technical area in constant search of perfection.
The world knows what he wants on the pitch - passing, movement and goals. When it works, there is nothing more pleasing on the eye.
Guardiola will have to do some fast work to produce that by the early stages of next season but City fans know their new manager will want both aesthetic appeal and successful results.
Verdict: 8
Watching Klopp is often as entertaining as watching his teams. The charismatic German lives every moment of a game, often gesturing wildly at his own fans if they are not entering into the spirit of the occasion.
Klopp has grown to detest the term 'heavy metal football', which he coined about his Borussia Dortmund side, but he loves a full-on pressing approach from his teams.
It is exciting when it comes together, chaotic when it develops fault lines. Whatever it is, it will not be dull.
Verdict: 8
Mourinho believes winning is the ultimate entertainment and everything else are merely events around the edges.
He can, though, produce entertaining teams and did so when winning La Liga with Real Madrid and certainly in the first months of his last title-winning season at Chelsea in 2014-15.
Mourinho will face demands to play in an expansive style that fits Manchester United's image - but he will not change so much that he will deliver that at the expense of victory.
Verdict: 8
Antonio Conte - 34
Pep Guardiola - 41
Jurgen Klopp - 35
Jose Mourinho - 40
