Orica-BikeExchange's Chaves, 26, narrowly beat Italian Diego Rosa and Colombian Rigoberto Uran in a sprint over the final 300 metres of the 241km race from Como to Bergamo in Italy.
"I lived in Bergamo for two years, just one kilometre from here, and now I've won it is really special," said Chaves.
Team Sky's Peter Kennaugh, the only British rider to finish, was 26th.
