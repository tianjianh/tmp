A 25-year-old man was raped during a "terrifying" attack in Dumfries in the early hours of Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was walking on Brooms Road near to its junction with Millburn Avenue at about 01:00 when he was approached by another man he did not know.
The attacker forced his victim to a nearby grassy area and subjected him to a serious sexual assault.
The suspect then walked off towards the nearby Morrisons supermarket. The area was cordoned off for several hours.
Police described the attacker as about 6ft 1in tall, of stocky build and possibly with a foreign accent.
He was wearing dark clothing and a hooded top.
Det Insp Scott Young said: "A young man has been subjected to a terrifying sexual attack and extensive enquiries are under way to find whoever is responsible for this utterly despicable crime.
"I would like to speak to anyone who was in the area near to where Brooms Road meets Millburn Avenue between 0000 hours and 0200 hours on Sunday morning.
"Whether you saw a man matching the description of the suspect, a man following another man, or a man in a state of distress - if you saw anything out of the ordinary at all then please come forward."
