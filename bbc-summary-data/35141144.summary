The man, in his 50s, was walking in the mainly loyalist Castlemara estate at about 19:30 GMT on Friday when he was approached by three masked men.
He was treated in hospital for a single gunshot wound to his calf.
Appealing for information, police said they believed the three men had run away after the attack.
Alliance Party assembly member Stewart Dickson said: "This was a shocking incident, which I utterly condemn.
"Attacks like this have no place in our society and I hope the victim is able to make a full recovery. My thoughts are with him at this difficult time."
