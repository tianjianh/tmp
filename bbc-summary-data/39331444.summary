Bristol forwards coach Mark Bakewell has said he will stay on the club's coaching staff when Pat Lam joins as head coach at the end of the season.

Connacht's Lam will join this summer as the long-term replacement to former boss Andy Robinson, who was sacked in November, and will be assisted by Connacht backs coach Conor McPhillips.
Bakewell, who signed a two-year deal at Bristol in 2016, will work with them.
The New Zealander was previously Bath's forwards coach between 2006 and 2009.
"I've spoken to Pat," Bakewell told BBC Radio Bristol. "I'm here next season, so I'm really looking forward to that.
"At this stage, what I would love to be able to do for Pat and everyone is keep Bristol in the Premiership. That's our focus at the moment."
Bristol are bottom of the Premiership with five matches remaining, having won three of their 17 league games since returning to the top flight.
In February it was confirmed that Mark Tainton - interim head coach since Robinson's departure - is to become Bristol's chief operations officer at the end of the season, overseeing recruitment once Lam arrives.
