[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick as Paris St-Germain warmed up for their Champions League tie with Manchester City with a comfortable win over Nice.

Ibrahimovic put the French champions ahead from an awkward angle after David Luiz's pass before Hatem Ben Arfa equalised with a deflected effort.
However, the Swede curled in a free-kick to restore the hosts' lead and Luiz headed in a third from a corner.
Ibrahimovic netted his third goal after being put through by Adrien Rabiot.
It means the 34-year-old striker, who has been linked with a move to the Premier League in the summer, has now scored 30 goals in 26 Ligue 1 games this season.
PSG - who clinched the Ligue 1 title in March with eight games to spare - are 25 points ahead of second-placed Monaco and are next in action on Wednesday when they take on Manchester City at home in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.
