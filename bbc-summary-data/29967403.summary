An internet troll has targeted Claudia Winkleman and husband Kris Thykier after their daughter Matilda was burnt while out celebrating Halloween.

It's thought her costume caught fire while she was out trick-or-treating.
A Twitter user, who Newsbeat is not naming, has posted five messages including one which says: "What's your daughter's favourite dance? I'm guessing the #HotStep."
Another one says: "I fancy a bacon sarnie, extra crispy."
The account now appears to have been deleted.
It's thought eight-year-old Matilda's Halloween costume caught fire after it brushed against a candle flame.
Other Twitter users have also sent abusive messages about Claudia Winkleman.
In reply to the tweets, another user said: "At least she won't have to fork out for a Halloween costume next year....#ClaudiaWinkleman."
Another person wrote: "Claudia Winkleman isn't presenting Film 2014 tonight. I don't want to suggest her daughter being burned was a good thing, but..."
Twitter's own rules state that users "may not make direct, specific threats of violence against others, including threats against a person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, or disability. Targeted abuse or harassment is also a violation of the Twitter Rules and Terms of Service".
A spokesman for the social media service told Newsbeat: "We review all reported accounts against our rules, which prohibit violent threats and targeted abuse."
Claudia Winkleman, 42, and her film producer husband Kris Thykier, who's also 42, said in a statement earlier this week that they were hopeful their daughter would get better quickly.
It said: "Matilda is having the best care possible and we are hopeful of a full recovery. We would like to thank everyone that has been so supportive."
Claudia Winkleman also used the statement about her daughter's burns to warn other people about the dangers of using or handling fireworks, especially at this time of year.
"We would like to remind anyone taking part in fireworks parties or Guy Fawkes celebrations to be vigilant about the dangers of candles, open fires and fireworks," she said.
"Please have the appropriate safety measures in place and to hand."
Claudia Winkleman misses her second lot of Strictly Come Dancing shows on Saturday and Sunday night.
It's unclear how long she'll be missing from the BBC One show.
Zoe Ball will again replace her on this weekend's episodes as she co-hosts with Tess Daly.
At the start of Saturday night's BBC One show, Tess Daly said: "Claudia can't be with us again this week.
"All our thoughts go out to her and her daughter and we're wishing her a speedy recovery."
