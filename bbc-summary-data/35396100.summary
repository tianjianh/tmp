Didier Drogba is to remain with Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact, ending speculation the striker could return to former club Chelsea.

Montreal announced that Drogba would join their pre-season training camp.
And the 37-year-old tweeted: "On way to Qatar to do some preparation work for pre-season."
Drogba held talks with Chelsea in December amid rumours he could join the club's coaching staff.
At the time, Montreal admitted that Drogba had expressed a "desire to help" Chelsea and that the situation was "out of our control".
But Drogba subsequently denied reports that he was ready to end his playing career, tweeting: "I have not yet announced my retirement."
And it now appears the Ivorian will see out his contract with Montreal, which runs to the end of this year.
Last season Drogba was top-scorer for Montreal with 11 goals as they reached the MLS Eastern Conference semi-finals.
