Awema trustees left it vulnerable, says Charity Commission

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trustees of a defunct charity whose chief executive bought rugby tickets and hotel stays on expenses have been criticised by the Charity Commission.

Over a decade, the All Wales Ethnic Minority Association (Awema) received £7m, much of it from Welsh ministers.
On Wednesday, the commission said Awema was vulnerable because trustees did not put the right safeguards in place.
Chief executive Naz Malik was cleared of two counts of fraud against the charity at Swansea Crown Court in 2014.
Awema, which was based in the city, was created to help people from ethnic minorities access public services and give them more opportunities in life.
But in January 2012 serious concerns were raised about how the charity was run by Mr Malik.
That year, BBC Wales revealed how allegations were raised by staff members about sexual harassment as well as a conflict of interest arising from Mr Malik's daughter being employed and promoted within the organisation.
A Wales Audit Office (WAO) report into the scandal in that year concluded it should be seen as a "wake up call" for the Welsh Government's grant funding approach.
The report said warnings about Awema were not heeded for a decade and millions of pounds were awarded.
On Wednesday, a Charity Commission report highlighted its concerns about Awema's trustees.
The report said: "The failure of the trustees to put appropriate safeguards in place left the charity vulnerable to its resources being misused, which did in fact materialise."
The 2012 WAO report highlighted how Awema funds were used to pay for gym membership for staff worth £2,120, rugby and cricket tickets totalling £800, and a £110 parking fine for Mr Malik.
Other revelations included:
In 2014, Mr Malik was cleared of two counts of fraud against the charity at Swansea Crown Court.
A jury failed to reach a decision on a third count, relating to the credit card debts.
Mr Malik insisted that the payments were made to himself for expenses.
On Wednesday, the Charity Commission also revealed that Mr Malik had used the charity's expenses to pay for "luxury hotel" stays and would "spend large sums at business cost at restaurants on food and alcohol".
The report said: "Records and invoices examined as part of the inquiry indicate that whilst travelling on charity business, the CEO [chief executive officer] and other staff members would stay in hotels costing in excess of £150 per night, whilst staying overnight in places such as Kent and Llandudno.
"They would simultaneously spend large sums at business cost at restaurants on food and alcohol."
The Charity Commission said Awema's trustees were not given enough training about their roles and responsibilities, and this led to a "lack of clarity amongst the trustees over who had authority to authorise the CEO's expenses".
The report continued: "This uncertainty resulted in poor controls over the authorisation of expenses resulting in a situation where the CEO was potentially able to issue himself cheques for large sums, including projected future expenses, with no meaningful oversight from the trustees."
