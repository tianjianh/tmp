Shaun Whiter, who had played for Soham Town and was training with Newmarket Town when he was hit last July, used a hand-pedal bike.
He was joined by former Ipswich Town players Russell Osman, Mick Stockwell and Titus Bramble, setting off on the ride from Portman Road on Sunday.
It was held in support of several local charities, including the club's own.
Before setting off Mr Whiter, who is 28 and lives near Newmarket, said "It was good to be getting back into sport again.  I was part of a team before. I want to be part of a team and this is it."
He was struck by a car while helping his friend change a tyre near Newmarket in Suffolk. Both his legs were crushed and had to be amputated.
Jan Adamec, 40, was jailed for three years in September for causing injury by dangerous driving.
Mr Whiter's friend, Soham Town Rangers player Joey Abbs, suffered serious leg injuries in the crash.
Speaking after finishing the two-day ride to Potter's Resort in Hopton, Norfolk, and back, Mr Whiter described the event as "amazing".
On using his arms instead of his legs to cycle he said: "It's difficult but it's what I have to now use so it's something that I've got used to and what I now enjoy.
"To get out there with all these hundred people, raising money for different charities is the best thing."
He raised Â£2,500 for the East Anglian Air Ambulance, which airlifted him to hospital after he was injured.
