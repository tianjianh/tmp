[SN]TITLE[SN]
Teeth-pulling multiple rapist Donald Jeffrey jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who raped two women and used pliers to rip out one of the victim's teeth has been jailed for 10 years and given a lifelong restriction order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donald Jeffrey was convicted of three rapes, a murder bid and four assaults against a woman between 2008 and 2014.
The 44-year-old, from Glasgow, was convicted of five offences on the other woman - two rapes, indecent assault and two assaults, between 1994 and 1998.
Jeffrey denied the crimes but was found guilty after his victims gave evidence.
Jailing him at the High Court in Paisley, judge Lord Matthews told Jeffrey: "You were found guilty of a catalogue of appalling offences against two vulnerable women who had the misfortune to be your partners.
"The relationships were characterised by jealousy, serious violence and rape.
"You dominated the lives of these women and subjected them to extreme emotional and physical cruelty as well as sexual aggression."
The judge added: "It is obvious you are a very dangerous man and it is my duty to protect the public from you for as long as you are able to lift a finger, I propose therefore to make an order for lifelong restriction."
The order imposed means Jeffrey will be supervised for the rest of his life.
During his trial, Jeffrey's 47-year-old victim said that during one attack he pulled her teeth out with pliers then made her pose in front of a mirror.
He also repeatedly raped her, tried to drown her in a freezing bath and threatened to throw her out of a 17th-floor flat window.
The victim said: "He had me over his shoulder. He opened the window, I was screaming. But, then he dropped me beside the window."
She also recalled how Jeffrey dropped heavy dumb-bells onto her body after demanding she lie on the ground.
The woman never spoke to police about the abuse until last year after which an investigation uncovered Jeffrey's victimisation of another woman.
The 44-year-old woman who was raped and battered by Jeffrey recalled in court how he once smashed her arm with a martial arts weapon while she was heavily pregnant.
She also told how he hit a young boy who was living at her house with a belt, then made her do the same.
She said: "I felt sick. It should not have happened, but I felt it was the only way to stop it at the time."
The jury heard after the guilty verdicts that Jeffrey already had three high court convictions.
He was previously jailed for robbery, firearms offences and drug crimes.
