Jim Wells Rathfriland incident investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have confirmed they are investigating after an incident during an election canvas in County Down was reported to them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood it involved the DUP candidate Jim Wells and a lesbian couple.
It is believed the PSNI are trying to establish if an offence has been committed.
It follows Mr Wells's remarks at a hustings where he linked same-sex relationships to child abuse.
He later apologised for those comments.
The PSNI said they had received three complaints regarding the conduct of an individual in Rathfriland on Saturday evening.
It is alleged that Jim Wells, who was doing door-to-door canvassing, called at a lesbian couple's house, and during a conversation was critical of their lifestyle.
The daughter of one of the women said her mother was upset.
She said Mr Wells had gone back to the house twice saying he wanted to apologise. But the couple would not accept the apology, because, they claimed, Mr Wells said he did not agree with their lifestyle choice.
"Jim Wells was trying to get in, trying to see mum and her partner said 'no she's not coming out to see you, she doesn't want to see you'," the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said.
"He really wanted to try and get in to apologise to her, but she didn't want it.
"He kept saying about lifestyle choices and how it was wrong, how his party didn't believe in lifestyle choices.
"My mum's partner actually told him she'd voted DUP all her life and he's now lost her vote."
The PSNI have said they are currently investigating and it would be inappropriate to comment further.
It is understood they are trying to establish if any offence has been committed. The DUP have not yet responded to a request for comment.
