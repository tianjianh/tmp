Tens of thousands of German football fans have given a heroes' welcome to the World Cup-winning team in Berlin.

The main celebrations were at the Brandenburg Gate, where players displayed the cup on a large stage while performing an impromptu dance.
Many had gathered since dawn to welcome the players, who touched down from Brazil on Tuesday morning. Huge crowds lined their bus route into the capital.
It was the fourth German cup win and the first since reunification in 1990.
The team's 1-0 victory over Argentina in Sunday's final sparked delirious scenes across Germany, culminating in Tuesday's celebrations in central Berlin.
The team arrived in an open-top bus emblazoned with the years they have won the competition - 1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014.
The BBC's Lucy Hockings in Berlin says there was a carnival atmosphere in the city, with thousands taking the day off to witness the spectacle even though Tuesday is not officially a holiday.
Speaking on the stage near the Brandenburg Gate, coach Joachim Loew paid tribute to his team and the German people for their part in its victory.
"For our sakes the fans suffered with us. They were nervous with us.  In the end they cheered with us.  Without you we would not be here," he said.
Mario Goetze, the man who scored the winning goal on Sunday, said the experience of winning the cup was "dreamlike".
Earlier fans gathered on a viewing stage at Tegel airport to witness the arrival of  the plane, a Lufthansa jet rebranded "Fanhansa" for the team.
"This is a historic event," 34-year-old supporter Bernd Hesse told AFP news agency.
He said that fans of the team had waited 24 years for a German World Cup victory.
Those members of the team who play for Bayern Munich will also get a separate welcome parade in Munich later.
The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says that Berlin was transformed for the arrival, with the old sponsors' logos for the tournament torn down and new ones for the homecoming put up.
Commercial opportunities were maximised, our correspondent says.
The German victory in Brazil was the first time the competition had been won in South America by a European nation.
