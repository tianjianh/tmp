Jonny Evans: Leicester City have a second offer for West Brom defender rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City have had a £23m offer rejected for West Brom defender Jonny Evans before Thursday's transfer deadline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Foxes had a £10m bid for the former Manchester United player, 29, rejected earlier in the summer but have followed it up with a second offer.
West Brom say it is substantially below their valuation.
The Baggies have also rejected two bids from Manchester City, including one for £18m, for Northern Ireland's Evans.
Evans was absent from West Brom's squad for Sunday's 1-1 Premier League draw with Stoke City.
Manchester City are trying to offload France defender Eliaquim Mangala, 26, to create space in their squad.
Evans has joined up with the Northern Ireland squad in Manchester before Friday's World Cup qualifier with San Marino.
