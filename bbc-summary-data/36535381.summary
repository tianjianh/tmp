The contest might have lacked the six goals shared between Portugal and Hungary in the other Group F game, but there were ample opportunities to score that many, plus a scintillating - if cruel - conclusion.
There was always likely to be despair for one of these teams - and it happened to Austria after substitute Arnor Ingvi Traustason slid in at the far post to seal a victory that lifted Iceland from third to second in the group.
The signs of an entertaining contest were there from the start when Johann Gudmundsson rattled the woodwork in the second minute, before Jon Dadi Bodvarsson ended a sequence of 19 international games without a goal when he controlled a flick-on before shooting low past Robert Almer from eight yards.
Austria should have equalised from the penalty spot - there could have been three spot-kicks given in the match, with both sides denied decent second-half shouts - after Ari Skulason was judged to have pulled back David Alaba.
Aleksandar Dragovic, back in the side after suspension, took responsibility but struck the same part of the goal frame as Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo did against his team on Saturday.
Substitute Alessandro Schopf equalised with a crisp low strike after a mazy run into the area during an increasingly open second half - and should have found the net again but was denied by Hannes Halldorsson.
Kari Arnason made several crucial blocks close to his goal-line, but the decisive third goal came at the other end of the pitch.

Portugal's Ronaldo accused Iceland of having a "small mentality" after they drew 1-1 in their opening game.
But Iceland showed huge courage and determination to resist wave after wave of Austria attacks in the second half at a hot and humid Stade de France - and fully earned the scenes of jubilation they enjoyed in front of their mass of supporters at the final whistle.
They have picked up five points from their group games and have shown the level of match-craft and organisation you would expect from a team coached by former Sweden boss Lars Lagerback.
England struggled to open up all their opponents during their group campaign and can expect to face another team with the emphasis on defence on Monday (Iceland had 30% of the possession on Wednesday after averaging 28% across their opening two games).
But nonetheless, a nation of 330,000 qualifying from the group stage at their first major tournament is a feat that must be applauded after finishing second in Group F with five points.
Austria came into this tournament having won nine of their 10 qualifying matches and with one of the potential stars of Euro 2016 in Bayern Munich's talented and versatile midfielder David Alaba.
But they were awful against Hungary in their opening match, fortunate to draw with Portugal in their second and it was not until they threw everything at Iceland in the second half on Wednesday that they finally showed the sort of ability that had some describing them as potential dark horses in France.
Boss Marcel Koller - showing shades of England boss Roy Hodgson - did not seem to know his best side and deployed Alaba in a series of different positions, including a very advanced role against Iceland.
His team certainly created enough chances to win on Wednesday, with 23 efforts to Iceland's 11, but only after they brought on Schopf and Marc Janko at the break did they really start to dominate.
By that stage they were already chasing the game - knowing that only a victory would give them a chance of qualification - and having been struck on the counter-attack at the end they finished bottom of Group F with just a point to show for their efforts.
Austria head home after a disappointing campaign, but for Iceland the dream lives on. England can expect another stern test of their ability - or otherwise - to break teams down when they meet in Nice on Monday.
