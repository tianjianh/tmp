Up to 250 jobs could be created under an energy firm's plan to expand its offshore wind farm facility in Grimsby.

Dong Energy said it wanted to construct a second operational hub next to its existing building on the Royal Dock and would invest up to £20m in the project.
It would "support and maintain" three wind farms off the coast of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, the firm said.
Its UK chairman, Brent Cheshire, said the hub would be a "game-changing, industry first".
"It will generate direct and indirect job opportunities in the Humber region, as well as opportunities for the local supply chain," he said.
Last month, the government approved plans for Dong Energy to build an offshore wind farm 55 miles (88 km) east of Hornsea.
But the RSPB said it would pose an "unacceptable risk to nature" as the development was "in the flight path" of two threatened species of seabirds - gannets and kittiwakes.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the design and construction of the project had been adjusted in order to reduce impacts on birds.
