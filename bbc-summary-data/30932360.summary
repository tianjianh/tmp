[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oaklee Trinity and Ulidia housing associations merge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's largest social housing provider is to be created in a merger.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oaklee Trinity and Ulidia housing associations are to become a new 10,000-home landlord, with property assets of Â£656m.
It will be called CHOICE Housing Ireland, employing almost 300 staff.
The security of tenancies and rents "should not be affected as a result of the merger," a statement read.
"CHOICE Housing Ireland is already committed to building 500 new social and affordable homes in Northern Ireland, which represents more than a third of the government's target new builds."
The merger had been mooted since last year and will complete in the "near future".
Tony Kennedy, the chairman of Ulidia, said: "We are not-for-profit organisations and the operational savings gained from the merger will be used to improve our services to tenants and build more homes."
