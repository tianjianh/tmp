Hockney is being directed by Randall Wright, who made the acclaimed film Lucian Freud: A Painted Life.
The documentary will be shown in cinemas in November before being screened on BBC Two in 2015.
Controller of BBC Two, Kim Shillinglaw, said the film "will be a riveting and inspiring watch".
"David Hockney stands as one of Britain's seminal and most important artists, and I'm delighted to be showing this major film on him on BBC Two."
With access to his personal archive of photographs and films, the documentary will aim to be a "frank and unparalleled visual diary of his long life".
Mark Bell, head of arts commissioning for the BBC, called it an "unprecedented" portrait, "with unique access to his work, his archive and reminiscence from the people who know him best".
Randall, who won a Royal Television Society award for his Lucian Freud film, met David Hockney while directing the award-winning series Shock of the Old.
