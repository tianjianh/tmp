MPs declare Wimbledon and Glastonbury tickets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MPs have enjoyed free activities from Wimbledon to Glastonbury, according to their latest register of interests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Speaker John Bercow, a tennis fan, got two Royal Box tickets for Wimbledon, with an estimated value of £8,590.
Labour deputy leader Tom Watson also got two cheaper Wimbledon tickets while Tory Damian Collins and Nigel Adams declared Glastonbury tickets.
Meanwhile Theresa May registered a discount card from shoe shop Russell & Bromley.
The prime minister, whose love of shoes is well documented, has worn the retailer's shoes to Conservative Party conferences and registered a discount card valid from January 2017 to January 2018 - without details of what it entitled her to.
The Labour Party said Mr Watson had received his tickets in his capacity as shadow sport secretary. Conservative Mr Collins is chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee while Mr Adams is also a committee member.
Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn - whose speech on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage drew thousands - had previously declared two tickets worth £476 but said they were given to a family member. As a speaker at the event, he did not need a ticket.
Among other freebies declared by MPs in the latest update to the register are two tickets for the England v South Africa test match at Lords for Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon, while Labour's Richard Burden got two tickets for the Grand Prix at Silverstone.
Conservative Mims Davies got a ticket to Royal Ascot while Labour's Stephen Doughty and Tory John Howell got tickets to the Royal International Air Tattoo.
Conservative backbencher Philip Davies declared several tickets for horse racing at Royal Ascot and the Coral Eclipse at Sandown as well as the League One football play-offs.
Former Labour leader Ed Miliband declared an expected £2,500 payment for hosting Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show for a week.
Conservative backbencher Nadine Dorries declared a £50,000 signing fee for a new book deal - she had previously declared a regular £13,000-per-month payment from her publisher.
MPs are required to declare any financial interest which "others might reasonably consider to influence his or her actions or words as a member of Parliament" within 28 days.
