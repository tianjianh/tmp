Hundreds of people have attended the opening of a £4.3m pedestrian and cycle bridge across Rhyl harbour.

Pont y Ddraig (Dragon's Bridge) provides the final link in 15 miles (24km) of traffic-free cycling across Conwy and Denbighshire.
It was named by Rhyl pupil Leon Jones following a schools competition and local children were invited to the opening.
Work was delayed earlier this year after cables were stolen from the site.
About 200m (656ft) of cable was taken in April from the bridge, which boasts a 45m-high (about 148ft) mast.
There are two sections of deck which lift up, with the underside lit up with lights that change from green to red and back.
It provides a car-free alternative route to the nearby Blue Bridge, which Sustrans Wales said was very congested and deterred cyclists and walkers from using it.
Pont-y-Ddraig now also forms part of a long-distance cycle route across the north Wales coast.
Jane Lorimer, director of Sustrans Wales, which partly financed the bridge, said it was one of 10 schemes in Wales which was bringing investment to the local area.
"Here in Rhyl the bridge is very much part of a regeneration scheme which is opening up an extension along Rhyl seafront and really putting this area, which is an area of deprivation, into the limelight as a place which is a joy to visit in its own right.
"It's unlocked the whole of the harbour areas. There has been additional investment and there will be a visitor centre and public squares.
"It's really about creating a destination where people can come and enjoy their time, spend money and get out and about."
