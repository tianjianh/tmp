Lewis and Sally Tonkinson, aged 50 and 44, of Cookhill, Worcestershire, died in the crash in Hampshire on Saturday.
Their son George has been receiving treatment at Southampton General Hospital for serious injuries.
His school, King's Hawford in Worcester, said in a statement he was conscious and recovering.
Headmaster Jim Turner said the school was "deeply saddened" by the accident.
"George is a lovely boy. He will need the support of those close to him at this difficult time," he added.
"Our thought and prayers are with them all."
The company Mr Tonkinson co-founded, Pinnacle Marketing Communications, said the couple's death would leave "a big gap in the lives of the great many people that knew and loved them".
Simon Flatt, director of the company, said: "Lewis and I were close friends for more than 30 years and for over half that time we were also business partners.
"I will miss him more than words can say, both personally and professionally.
"Our thoughts are with their families and, in particular, for George's speedy recovery."
The aircraft came down in Blackwood Forest, south of the A303 near Popham airfield.
It had taken off from Bembridge on the Isle of Wight earlier on Saturday afternoon, police said.
Post-mortem examinations will take place on Tuesday.
Mr Turner said staff at the school would talk to the children and hold a special assembly.
