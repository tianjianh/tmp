[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torquay United 1-0 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nathan Blissett's late winner against Southport saw Torquay move out of the National League relegation zone for the first time in six months.

The striker, whose absence over the past three matches coincided with the Gulls failing to score in those games, tapped in from close range.
Managerless Southport deserved a point as Louis Almond and Josh Thompson went close before Blissett's winner.
The win extended the Gulls' unbeaten run to eight league games.
Experienced striker Andy Bishop took caretaker charge of the visitors following Dino Maamria's exit earlier in the week.
