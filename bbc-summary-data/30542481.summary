The 23-year-old Wales international was temporarily paralysed in June after being tackled during a 10-a-side tournament in Singapore.
Williams now has some movement in both arms, but no feeling yet in his legs and torso, and says he cannot afford to have negative thoughts.
"It's just about the future," he said.
"I try not to think about what's gone on."
Williams, capped four times by Wales, was injured in the first half of the Blues' 26-17 defeat by Asia Pacific Dragons in the third-place play-off of the World Club 10s.
He was initially treated in Singapore before being transferred by air ambulance back to Wales and then onto the Welsh Spinal Injuries and Neurological Rehabilitation Unit in Cardiff in early July.
Speaking publicly for the first time since suffering the injury, Williams said he was focused on the future rather than dwelling on the past.
"I don't want to go thinking about being angry with anyone. You've just got to crack on with it," Williams told Scrum V.
"The past is the past now. I just want to look to a positive future. I've been tackled like that a hundred times before andâ€¦ nothing.
"It was just a stroke of bad luck really; a bit unlucky on the day."
Williams has been spending time out of hospital and was a guest at Wales' autumn Test against New Zealand at the Millennium Stadium in November.
He revealed he will be making his first visit to the Arms Park on Boxing for the Blues' Boxing Day Pro12 derby against Newport Gwent Dragons.
