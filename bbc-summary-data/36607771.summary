The 30-year-old joined the Championship side on loan in January last season and scored seven goals in 18 league games.
Graham netted just once in 42 matches for the Black Cats after joining them from Swansea in January 2013.
The former Watford player also had loan spells with Middlesbrough, Wolves and Hull during his time on Wearside.
Since Owen Coyle was appointed Rovers' new manager in June, Blackburn have added former Celtic striker Anthony Stokes to their squad, while West Ham defender Stephen Hendrie joined on a season long-loan.
