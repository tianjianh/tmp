Lundh failed to score in five appearances for Lillestrom last season, having joined on an initial loan deal from AIK Stockholm in August.
The 26-year-old has won 11 caps for Sweden, scoring two goals.
"She is a hard-working striker who will offer us a real goal threat and I am delighted to have signed her," manager Scott Rogers told the club website.
Details of Lundh's contract with the Reds have not been disclosed.
