Yorkshire v Hampshire: Ballance and Coad star as hosts take control

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Ballance scored a century in his first game as captain and Ben Coad took five wickets to help Yorkshire take control on day one against Hampshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ballance struck a vital 120 from 190 balls, including 17 fours, to anchor his side's first-innings score of 273.
Yorkshire had slipped to 152-7, but his 106-run partnership with Steven Patterson (37 not out) steadied things.
Coad (5-18) then produced career-best figures to leave Hampshire reeling on 58-5 at close.
At an uncontested toss, Hampshire captain James Vince elected to bowl first, but may have been worried as Yorkshire's opening pair of Adam Lyth (30) and Alex Lees (20) put on 41 for the first wicket at a rate of five runs per over.
However, Edwards bowled Lees and Gareth Berg (2-50) had Lyth caught behind by Lewis McManus to slow the scoring.
Australia batsman Peter Handscomb made 25 on debut before Edwards got through his defences and exposed the middle order, with Jack Leaning and Tim Bresnan falling in quick succession.
England left-hander Ballance, who played the last of his 21 Test matches against Bangladesh in October, battled on throughout in an innings that spanned nearly four hours.
He found a willing partner in Patterson in a crucial stand before 23-year-old seamer Coad - in just his fourth first-class game - turned the match on its head with a remarkable eight-over burst.
He pinned Jimmy Adams lbw in his first over, had Vince caught at mid-wicket, Michael Carberry taken at slip and Sean Ervine caught at mid-off, before debutant Rilee Rossouw (23) fell lbw to leave the visitors in real trouble at stumps.
