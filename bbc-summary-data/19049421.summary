A journalist held by police investigating a suspected conspiracy to gather data from stolen mobile phones is Sun chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker, the BBC understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 51-year-old was released on bail having been arrested at a London police station by appointment on Monday.
Mr Parker was also arrested in February by police investigating allegations of corrupt payments to public officials.
He remains on police bail for that alleged offence.
Mr Parker was arrested on Monday by Met Police officers from Operation Tuleta, which is probing allegations of computer hacking.
Scotland Yard later said he had been bailed to return to a central Lodnon police station in late September.
It is the eighth arrest in Operation Tuleta and comes less than a fortnight after a Sun journalist was arrested in the same investigation.
The investigation is running alongside Operation Weeting, into phone hacking, and Operation Elveden, which is looking at corrupt payments by journalists to public officials.
It is thought as many as 16 current or former Sun journalists have been arrested as part of Scotland Yard's investigations into corruption and computer misuse.
