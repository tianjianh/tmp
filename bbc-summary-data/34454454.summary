[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belfast Telegraph building could be converted to hotel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of the Belfast Telegraph building could be converted into a boutique hotel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In August the newspaper announced it would sell its famous city centre building.
An advert for the building lays out two potential development options, both featuring a hotel in the listed part of the complex.
The hotel would have either 45 or 69 rooms, alongside retail and restaurant units.
One of the development options also includes a 414 bed student housing scheme.
The other option has 222,000 sq ft of offices.
The development options are not binding but give potential purchasers an idea of how the site could be used.
The existing building  is 153,000 sq ft but the selling agents, Lisney, say there is the potential to develop a scheme of almost 354,000 sq ft.
The Belfast Telegraph has occupied the building for about 130 years.
It is leaving due to the closure of the printing operation within the Royal Avenue premises.
New premises will be sought for the newspaper in the "very heart of the city", although a timescale has not been put on any move.
