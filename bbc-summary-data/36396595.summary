Muhammadu Buhari’s first year as Nigeria's president in quotes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, who marks one year in office on 29 May, has battled endemic corruption in government, an insurgency in the north by militant Islamists, a resumption of conflict in the oil-rich south and a worsening economic situation.

Here are five quotes in which he outlined his leadership style, and how he intended to tackle the problems in Africa's most populous state and biggest economy:
"I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody"
"I cannot change the past. But I can change the present and the future. I am a former military ruler and a converted democract"
“If Boko Haram continues with suicide bombings, we might consider banning wearing the hijab”
We cannot build an economy where corruption is the working capital"
"I am not going to demand any apology... What I am demanding is the return of assets"
