Defending champion Walkden, 24, beat Turkey's Nafia Kus 5-4 in the final at the Salle Omnisports Perrier.
It is GB's third gold medal in three days in Switzerland, after successes for Lauren Williams and Jade Jones.
"I'm honoured to win here for a second time," said Walkden, who now holds world and European titles. "Hopefully I can become Olympic champion."
Walkden handed a couple of points to Kus in warnings, but was consistently more aggressive than her opponent and finished strongly with decisive punches in the third round.
