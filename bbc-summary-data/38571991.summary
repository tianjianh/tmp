[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police failed to spot pedestrians walking beneath a fallen tree before it fell further and crushed a housekeeper, an inquest has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Teresita Sison, 58, of Ladbroke Grove, died when the tree fell as she made her way to work in Kensington Road in October 2014.
The tree had fallen across the road in high winds as the UK was hit by the remnants of Hurricane Gonzalo.
Police prioritised controlling traffic at the time, the inquest heard.
PC Matt Durrant, who was called to the scene on the morning of 21 October 2014, told the Royal Courts of Justice he thought the tree was "in a fixed and stable position" resting on railings.
He said pedestrian safety was considered but, as the pavement was blocked, the five officers present worked to control the flow of traffic on the road rather than taping off the path.
However, CCTV showed several pedestrians walking through the natural archway formed by the tree before it fell  further, killing Mrs Sison.
Lukas Rootman, representing the owner of the land where the tree was growing opposite Hyde Park Barracks, suggested PC Durrant could have seen that pedestrians were walking under the tree.
Mr Rootman said the officers had "missed the opportunity to change what you were doing as your attention was elsewhere."
Coroner Shirley Radcliffe previously told the jury Mrs Sison was "killed by the weight of falling masonry" as she walked under the tree at 11:35 BST.
The inquest is expected to last until Wednesday.
