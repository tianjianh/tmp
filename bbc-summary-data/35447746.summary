It was a match of few chances and little free flowing football in the torrential Tayside rain.
Partick had their chances but they lacked the killer touch in front of goal.
It leaves Mixu Paatelainnen's men dreaming of Hampden and celebrating their second win in a row.
The last time these two faced each other in the Scottish Cup United went all the way to win it in 2010.
Distant and almost unbelievable memories for the Tannadice faithful who have gone from celebrating silverware to praying for top flight survival in a relatively short space of time.
Alan Archibald's Partick started with the confidence of a side with two league wins against their opponents already this season.
Sean Welsh in particular fancied his chances from distance against Eiji Kawashima in the United goal - his first effort blazed over the bar but his second was spilled before Gavin Gunning swept it clear.
After initial signs of promise though the first half descended into drudgery - occasional flurries of football broke out in-between the ball being bludgeoned from end to end but serious chances dried up as the rain began to fall.
Simon Murray had the best of the home side's efforts but his shot on the angle was saved comfortably by Tomas Cerny.
The second half started as the first ended, with wayward passes and niggling fouls conspiring to stifle any threat of free-flowing football.
Alan Archibald threw on Mathias Pogba on the hour and the visitors instantly looked more of a threat.
But despite four corners in quick succession, United dealt with the pressure.
They started to create a few chances of their own as the game started to open up.
John Rankin flashed a ball across the six yard box after great running on the left hand side but it eluded everyone including the onrushing Billy McKay.
Minutes later substitute Scott Fraser watched in frustration as his 20 yard goal bound effort was deflected past.
But frustration turned to delight shortly afterwards when he put the home side ahead.
Blair Spittal found him in space at the edge of the box and he shaped and curled a sumptuous strike low past Cerny and into the back of the net.
The fans jumped to their feet to celebrate knowing if their side held on, it would be back to back wins and Scottish Cup progression.
They did and it is.
Dundee United manager Mixu Paatelainen: "It was a fighting performance from both teams.
"I'm quite surprised really. I was hoping one or two players would be a bit calmer and put their foot on the ball, be a bit more patient instead of that very quick football.
"The attitude again was the most important thing."
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "It was a great opportunity today to go and have a good run in this cup.
"We've seen other teams do it and we had good backing from our fans today as well. So we're bitterly disappointed."
