Manannán Mac Lir was taken from its spot on the mountain near Limavady, County Londonderry, last year.
Its disappearance was deemed a mystery, until it was found by a rambling group who then sought the help of soldiers on a training exercise.
However, it had been badly damaged, so Limavady Borough Council agreed to replace it.
Manannán Mac Lir is a sea god from Irish mythology and the statue had become a popular tourist attraction in the area.
Thousands of people joined a Facebook page when the statue was stolen called 'Bring back Manannán Mac Lir the Sea God', and  police launched a missing persons appeal.
The cost of replacing the original sculpture, which was found about 300m from Gortmore viewpoint, was £10,000.
The statue and its replacement were created by John Sutton, who worked on the Game of Thrones TV show.
