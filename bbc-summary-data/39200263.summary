Scott Pittman and the dangerous Nicky Cadden both went close before Todorov poked home the opener before half-time.
The Bulgarian, on loan from Hearts, twice fired wide in the second half and saw an effort saved by Ross Stewart before Danny Mullen grabbed the second.
He chested home Josh Mullin's cross before Todorov added his second.
Victory put Livi 10 points clear of second-placed Alloa with 10 games left, while Rovers remain just a point above bottom side Stenhousemuir, with two games in hand on Peterhead and Stranraer above them.
In League Two, Berwick Rangers beat Clyde 4-3 in a seven-goal thriller at Shielfield.
Gary Phillips volleyed home the opener for Rangers at the back post after a cross from Greg Rutherford.
Rutherford then cut inside off the right flank and slotted home the second before Clyde centre-half Chris Smith pulled a goal back.
Two minutes later striker David Gormley equalised only for Berwick to go back in front when Steven Thomson rifled in his 11th goal of the season from a tight angle.
Rutherford dinked home his second on the resumption to make it 4-2 before Gormley grabbed his second with 10 minutes left to set up a tense finish.
Victory moved Berwick, in seventh, four points clear of Clyde, who are under the interim management of Peter MacDonald and JP McGovern.
