[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A national event to remember the loss of 450 British military casualties in Suez, Egypt, has been held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 100 members of the Suez Veterans' Association and their families took part in a service at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.
Wreaths were then laid at the Suez Memorial.
The service was to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the ceasefire in the Suez canal zone.
A spokesman said the veterans had commented on the anniversary's importance and recognising the service of their comrades.
The military was sent to Egypt to defend British interests in the Suez Canal in 1951.
The canal, which runs through Egypt, remains an important shipping link between Africa and Asia, and Britain at the time already had a military presence in the area.
But tensions with Egypt and a rise in nationalism in the area led to the declaration of an emergency period until 1954 and military action, by Israel, Britain and France began in 1956 as they tried to maintain Western control. It ultimately failed.
