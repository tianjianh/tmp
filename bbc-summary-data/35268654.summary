Southern Health NHS Trust is holding an emergency board meeting after being severely criticised in an official inquiry last month.
A report published by NHS England found it had failed to investigate hundreds of deaths over a four-year period.
The trust has apologised for previous failings and said its systems have since improved.
Southern Health covers Hampshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire and provides services to about 45,000 people.
But its critics have blamed a lack of leadership and demands have grown for the chief executive Katrina Percy to resign.
Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the trust's failings as "totally and utterly unacceptable".
Several families will attend the meeting to confront Ms Percy and the rest of the board.
They are led by Sara Ryan, the mother of Connor Sparrowhawk, an 18-year-old with learning disabilities who drowned in a bath in Oxford in 2013 while under the care of Southern Health.
They want the leadership of the trust to resign or be sacked by regulators.
The official inquiry covered a period from April 2011 to June 2015.
It found that many deaths were not investigated, and the quality of the investigations that were carried out were described as poor and much delayed.
The trust was said to have missed opportunities to learn from deaths and to have suffered from a lack of transparency.
BBC News has learned that a former director at the trust has a role at NHS England looking after patient safety.
Dr Martyn Diaper was medical director (quality) at the trust for a year from July 2014.
During the same time, he held two posts at NHS England - head of patient safety (primary care) and chairman of national patient safety expert group for primary care. He retains both posts.
NHS England said it continued to have confidence in Dr Diaper and said his actions had improved systems at the trust, which was recognised in the official report.
In a statement to BBC News, Dr Diaper said: "As a result of my efforts, rapid and significant improvements were made in the way the trust looked at failures in care."
