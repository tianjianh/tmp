Surrey seamer Tom Curran says he is "more hungry" for success this season after his first senior England call-up.

Curran joined England's limited-overs tour of the West Indies in February after an injury to Nottinghamshire's Jake Ball, but did not make his debut.
The 21-year-old also featured for England Lions in their winter tours of Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.
"Obviously I was disappointed not to play, but I wasn't expecting it to be easy," he told BBC Radio London.
"Getting an international debut is not easy and it's definitely just made me more hungry."
Curran, the son of former Zimbabwe all-rounder Kevin Curran and brother of Surrey and England Lions teammate Sam, averaged 27.66 with the ball in 50-over cricket last season, but 42.29 in first-class games.
"I see myself as an all three-formats cricketer," he continued.
"But obviously if one-day cricket for England comes first, then that's my way in."
