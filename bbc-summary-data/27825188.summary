The 28-year-old, who made 16 appearances for United last season, is new head coach Robbie Neilson's first signing of the summer.
Hearts had their SPFL transfer embargo lifted on Wednesday after officially exiting administration.
"He's got a lot of experience and is a good player," Neilson told the club's website.
"He's got a great attitude and a great work-rate. His mentality for coming in and doing things properly is what we need from the older players.
"They need to set an example and he certainly does that.
"I took the under-20s against Dundee United in January and Morgaro was playing. He was fantastic.
"It was a cold Tuesday night, it was bucketing down and blowing a gale but he worked really hard and helped the United youngsters.
"For me, that sold me on him. If he can do that for them then he can do it for us."
Gomis spent five years at Tannadice over two spells, and has been capped twice by Senegal.
He goes into a Hearts squad looking to bounce back to Scotland's top-flight, after they were relegated to the Championship in season 2013-14.
