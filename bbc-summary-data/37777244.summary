'Moving matches to the Arms Park is exciting for Wales women'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moving Wales' matches to Cardiff Arms Park shows that women's rugby is definitely being taken seriously.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh Rugby Union has really stepped forward and now we've got our own home for rugby it's exciting times.
Everything is moving in the right direction for us, and that's only going to build heading into the World Cup next year.
The squad that coach Rowland Phillips has picked to play Scotland on Saturday has a lot of experience - there are a lot of girls who have been out for two or three years that are back.
Rebecca de Filippo has been missing since the 2014 World Cup, having taken some time out from the game, while Charlie Murray played her last international game in 2013 along with Rosie Fletcher.
Between them they've got a lot of international experience but they're just coming back so it will be exciting to see how they perform against what will be a strong Scotland.
Our last autumn international was in 2009 and it's exciting that we have matches at this time of the year against international squads.
I'm on the bench, and naturally disappointed not to be starting.
But I've been in this position before and the game has changed. It's not about the starting XV; it's about all the squad players playing a part in the bigger picture.
When I get on to the field - whether it's 40 minutes or 10 minutes - I have to make sure I perform and that's the best thing I can do for the squad.
We want to play at a ground like Cardiff Arms Park - it's huge for us girls.
It's a perfect place for us to play at. There's such history behind it and the atmosphere you get there on a match day is phenomenal, so it's only going to make more people interested in coming to watch our games.
It's going to be a step up for us to play at that stadium and really make it our home.
There's nothing better than Cardiff on a Six Nations match day. It's not just in the stadium but in the city itself.
That atmosphere is special, so hopefully that will carry into our games at Cardiff Arms Park and create an atmosphere that's been missing in the past.
It's something special and we've not had that feeling before, so it will increase the energy around the match.
Hopefully they'll be played at a time when it's accessible for more people - they won't have to travel to Swansea separately on a match day when the men are playing and that makes it easier for people to come and watch.
I'll be representing the UK Armed Forces against Wales on Remembrance Day - Friday, 11 November.
It's a huge time of the year for the armed forces and, as a group, we're really honoured that Wales have arranged that fixture for us on that day and we're able to go out there and remember the people we've lost. It should be a great occasion.
It will be a strange feeling playing against Wales, but it's good.
You get to go up against the girls you are competing with for a spot in the team. There is plenty of competition between us because we all want to wear that Wales shirt.
So for me and some of the other girls it's exciting that we can go against our counterparts in Wales and hopefully give them a really good game on the day.
Wales players Gemma Rowlands, Charlie Murray and Bethan Dainton are also in the Armed Forces squad, so I won't be going out there alone. It will be exciting for all of us.
My older brother Rhys Williams is an international rugby league player and is currently in the Wales squad for their game against Italy.
They are fighting for World Cup qualification so it's exciting for both of us.
There's no rivalry between us. He's a very good professional rugby player himself and I'm extremely proud of what he's achieved.
