Cross-border trade: NI shoppers travelling south to make savings

Irish border towns in the Eurozone are experiencing a Christmas bonus with many shoppers from Northern Ireland travelling south in search of value.

The continued strength of the pound can, in some instances, result in savings on the same items bought in euros in the Republic of Ireland.
Dundalk retailer Gerard McEvoy said: "It is a nice change to see them coming down.
"There is a big difference, especially on Saturdays."
BBC Newsline carried out a price comparison of sample products selected at random.
The programme found that the identical bottle of perfume at £68 in Newry is available at £4 cheaper in Dundalk.
A leading brand's tablet computer, priced at £319 in Northern Ireland, is for sale in the Republic of Ireland at £25 less, once converted from euros.
Recent research by the Automobile Association (AA) suggested that only 7% of southern shoppers intended going north for Christmas purchases - its lowest level since 2008.
That is not great news for places like Newry, County Down.
The manager of Newry's Buttercrane shopping centre, Peter Murray, said: "At the minute we are under the cosh [in respect of currency] but seven or eight years ago we were the beneficiaries."
"We just get on with it."
While numbers are lower than years gone by, Mr Murray said that about 12% of the centre's visitors still travel from the Republic of Ireland.
Retailers have already battled hard to survive the recession.
Now border traders in Northern Ireland face another challenge to ensure Christmas delivers the bumper payday that shops bank on.
