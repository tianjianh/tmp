Truro City boss Lee Hodges has criticised his side after they lost 4-0 at Winchester City in the FA Cup.

Winchester are in the relegation zone of Southern League Division One South and West - two tiers below National League South side Truro.
Truro trailed 3-0 at half-time before conceding a fourth after 70 minutes.
"I've asked them to look each other in the eye and say to them: 'Have I put in a shift today?' I don't think there's too many who can," Hodges said.
Truro have won just one of their last nine games, with Hodges only getting two wins since returning to the club to succeed Steve Tully as manager in the summer.
"After the last three games, where we've looked strong and organised, and working for each other, I think they felt they were just going to turn up and it was going to happen," Hodges told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"You want them to make sure that when they go into every game it's going to have to be an absolute war. They've got to be ready for it and do that horrible nasty side and battle before they can get the opportunity to play.
"But they never got going, we looked like we were still on the coach in the first 15 or 20 minutes, but they've got to be ready and up for every single challenge that's put in front of them.
"I'm bitterly disappointed because the FA Cup is a great competition to be in and I'm gutted to be out of it."
