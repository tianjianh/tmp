The FTSE 100 share index was up 13.99 points at 7,121.64.
Shares in Royal Dutch Shell were up by about 1.6% after the oil giant reported its latest results. Profits for 2016 fell to $3.5bn from $3.8bn.
However, Shell said cash inflow during the final quarter of last year had been $9bn, more than covering its dividend, and that it had been able to repay $4.5bn worth of debt.
Vodafone shares fell 1.4% after the mobile phone giant said growth in full-year earnings was set to be at the low end of its range of 3% to 6%.
In the final three months of 2016, Vodafone said its UK revenues had fallen, citing tougher price competition in its business services division.
On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.25% against the dollar to $1.2691, but slipped 0.1% against the euro to 1.1740 euros.
