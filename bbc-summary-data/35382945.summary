Repairs to a Liverpool bombed out church will be completed two years ahead of schedule.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grade II* listed building, on the corner of Leece Street and Berry Street, was damaged in a 1941 air raid.
A survey found St Luke's Church needed to be made safe following damage caused by winter storms last year.
Liverpool City Council approved further phases to be completed by November subject to a funding grant to ensure repairs are "cost effective".
It would also prevent disruption to events that would be held in the church.
The council is awaiting final approval for a £350,000 grant from Historic England.
The first £150,000 phase to repair crumbling stonework, currently being held up by metal supports, is under way.
Full restoration work valued at £500,000 includes work to the tower, masonry, low-level stonework, a roof to be put on to the church tower and decorative stonework.
The council - who will retain freehold of the site - is expected to appoint an operator to run the venue in the summer.
