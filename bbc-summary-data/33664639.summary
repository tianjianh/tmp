They are Richmond Park and North Kingston MP Zac Goldsmith, London Assembly Member Andrew Boff, MEP Syed Kamall and London's deputy mayor for crime and policing Stephen Greenhalgh.
Former England defender Sol Campbell has not been put forward by the party.
Official hustings will take place in September with the winning candidate announced by the end of that month.
Westminster City Council leader Philippa Roe and businessman Ivan Massow, who described himself as gay, ex-alcoholic and dyslexic, also failed to make the cut.
London regional chairman Ian Twinn said: "We have four excellent candidates who will now campaign across London over the summer before all Londoners will get the opportunity to vote in our primary in September."
Boris Johnson announced he would continue as the mayor of London for one year after he was elected as the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in May.
He is also a minister without portfolio in David Cameron's cabinet.
The Labour Party has shortlisted six potential mayoral candidates including the MP and former Olympics minister Dame Tessa Jowell and the shadow minister for London Sadiq Khan.
