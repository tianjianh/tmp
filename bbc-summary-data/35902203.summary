The visitors took the lead when Paul Caddis' cross took a deflection and reached Jon Toral who turned it home.
Charlton equalised six minutes later through Johann Berg Gudmundsson whose shot bounced off Paul Robinson and in.
The hosts sealed all three points in added time when Teixeira rose to meet Ademola Lookman's corner.
Teixeira's goal was his second in his last three matches for Charlton, who remain next to bottom of the Championship table and six points from safety despite the victory.
Birmingham's outside hopes of making a late charge into the play-off places looks unlikely as they stay ninth in the table, eight points below sixth-placed Derby County.
The match was delayed by four minutes when Charlton fans threw hundreds of small sponge footballs on to the pitch seconds into the match and chanted against owner Roland Duchatelet.
Addicks supporters carried out a similar protest at their 2-0 win against Middlesbrough on 13 March when a number of beach balls were thrown onto the playing surface.
Charlton head coach Jose Riga:

"I know that there are two stories from today's game and I want only to be involved in the sporting one, but we really felt that the fans were pushing us today for the whole 90 minutes.
"When you show your passion sweating for the club and fighting for the club, English fans will be behind you.
"We cannot master the other results and we can't expect help from the other teams, but today I just want to share my happiness with the players and the crowd.
"We knew from Birmingham's results that all of their games are very close, but at the end I think we deserved the win today."
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett:

"It was a hugely frustrating afternoon to lose right at the end, but that was the state of the game.
"Both teams were doing everything they could to try and get a winner. They had breakaways, we had lots of breakaways in the second half and really should have made more of them.
"I would rather concede a counter-attack than from a corner when everyone is back and two or three players were stood watching while their player heads it in. That was particularly galling but a point wouldn't have been a lot of good for us either.
"We've got a hell of a lot to do to make the play-offs now, but I have a really honest bunch of players here so I can't be too disappointed with them."
