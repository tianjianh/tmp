Jake Ball: Scarlets lock a doubt for Wales Tests against Tonga and Samoa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets second row Jake Ball could be a doubt for Wales' two-Test tour to face Tonga and Samoa in June because of a shoulder injury.

The 25-year-old has been ruled out of Scarlets' Pro12 play-off semi-final at Leinster on Friday.
Ball may now struggle to be fit in time for Wales' opening Test against Tonga in New Zealand on 16 June.
"It's just a fight against time. We'll know more in a week or two," said Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac.
"But he's doing everything he can to play some more rugby this season.
"Hopefully should we make the final then he'll be reassessed."
Scarlets could also be without flanker James Davies against Leinster.
The 26-year-old has a shoulder injury and the Scarlets will decide on Wednesday whether or not to include him in their squad.
Davies and fellow Scarlets back-rower Aaron Shingler failed to make the Wales squad for June's Tests against Tonga and Samoa.
Wales' first-choice flankers Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric have been selected for the British and Irish Lions' tour of New Zealand.
But there was still no place in the 32-man squad for Davies and Shingler, much to Pivac's disappointment.
"Wales is blessed - they've obviously got some brilliant players both seven and six," said the New Zealander.
"Aaron got our management player of the year and for us statistically he's been very, very good, not only on the field but off the field.
"James is in the top two or three at the breakdown but he's really improved this year in terms of his decision-making. I think he's very unlucky."
Pivac also explained why Scarlets backs coach Stephen Jones has decided to pull out of Wales' tour.
"Stephen would dearly love to do both roles, but he's that sort of person. What he does do, he wants to do with 100% commitment and to the best of his ability," said Pivac.
"He obviously feels he can't do those roles to that level. He doesn't want us to get this far and taper off in terms of the work we're doing here at the Scarlets and also he doesn't not want to do the job to 100% of his capabilities for Wales."
