Housing association Peabody said Thamesmead could be the the next major garden suburb in London.
The company said it plans to improve existing housing and public spaces and create thousands of new homes over the next 10 to 15 years.
Stephen Howlett from Peabody said the London Crossrail project will also improve transport links in the area.
The group's chief executive added: "Thamesmead has the potential to be London's major garden suburb, with beautiful green space, first-class amenities, excellent schools, and rapidly improving transport connections."
Bexley Council along with Gallions Housing Association and Trust Thamesmead have held a number of public consultations on regeneration plans for the area and said residents had been "overwhelmingly enthusiastic".
Thamesmead was created in the 1960s to house the capital's growing population.
It was built on a marshland site formerly used by the Woolwich armoury.
