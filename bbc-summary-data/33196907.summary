Two men have been arrested on suspicion of arson following a fire that badly damaged a 60-year-old playground in north Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old men, from Southmead, have been released on bail while the police investigation continues into the fire at the Ranch on 8 June.
Residents were in tears as the fire took hold of the play structure which had recently been renovated.
A fundraising effort has since been launched to rebuild the facility.
Learning Partnership West estimates it will cost Â£10,000 to replace the burnt-out structures. More than Â£2,000 has already been raised, including Â£500 from an anonymous donor.
The Ranch, used by generations of children in Southmead, featured climbing walls, an outdoor classroom and a zip wire.
