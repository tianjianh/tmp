The event doubled up as the Northern Ireland & Ulster Championship for the distance.
O'Flaherty clocked 16 minutes and 18 seconds to finish nine seconds ahead of QUB's Emma Mitchell, with Jessica Craig [17:13] in third.
Bradley held off Letterkenny man Danny Mooney by four seconds to win the men's race in 14:44.
Mooney was second as he was given the same time as third-placed St Malachy's athlete Ben Branagh.
The 5K event started on the Annadale Embankment  in south Belfast and covered two and three quarter laps before the finish at the Queen's PEC in Stranmillis.
O'Flaherty, who competed in the steeplechase at last year's Rio Olympics, plans to race in the Great Ireland Run in Dublin on 9 April before heading for a three-week training stint at Font Romeu in the French Pyrenees.
