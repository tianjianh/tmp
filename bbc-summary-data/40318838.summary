[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hundreds of tarantulas found in van on M5

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traffic officers had a hairy moment when they stopped a van to find it was full of tarantulas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 200 of the large arachnids were packed in tubs in the back of the van, the Central Motorway Police Group said.
Officers drew straws on who should investigate, a spokesman said.
The van was stopped at a junction near West Bromwich on the M5. A spokesman said the spiders were healthy and had been on their way to what officers said was a "reptile show".
The van was allowed to continue on its journey.
