Mr Kerry, 71, was injured in a biking accident in the French Alps last week and was flown to Boston for treatment.
Surgeon Dennis Burke said the operation went well and Mr Kerry should make a full recovery.
"I do not anticipate this will interfere with his duties as secretary of state," he added.
Dr Burke said Mr Kerry was conscious throughout the four-hour operation, which took place under local anaesthetic.
"The procedure was uncomplicated, the fracture was fully repaired, and we plan to get him up walking on Wednesday," he said.
Mr Kerry had been attending talks in Switzerland over the future of Iran's nuclear programme prior to the accident.
It happened some 40km (25 miles) south-east of the Swiss border in Scionzier, France.
The diplomat, who is a keen cyclist, is believed to have hit a kerb before falling off his bike and fracturing his right femur.
Shortly before undergoing surgery Mr Kerry phoned in to address a high-level conference in Paris, about the ongoing Islamic State crisis.
He had planned to attend in person but was forced to cancel. He also pulled out of a visit to the Spanish capital Madrid.
White House spokesman John Earnest said Mr Kerry would "approach his recuperation and rehabilitation with uncommon zeal" and would work to shorten his recovery time.
He said he remained "confident" the secretary of state would "play a leading role" in the Iran nuclear negotiations as the 30 June deadline for a deal looms.
