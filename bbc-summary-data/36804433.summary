[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Brokenshire said the Common Travel Area pre-dated the countries' membership of the Common Market.
He said he had already had conversations with Irish Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald.
Mr Brokenshire has replaced Theresa Villiers as secretary of state.
'Strong commitment'
He said it was "an absolute priority for me that we don't see border controls coming into place.
"Indeed, I think there is a very strong commitment from the Irish government as well as ourselves to see that that doesn't happen".
The new secretary of state said he had an important role as discussions on Brexit developed "in advocating very firmly in the the heart of government in terms of the best interests of Northern Ireland".
Mr Brokenshire said his previous experience of visiting Belfast had been "very positive", and he would be travelling to Northern Ireland on Monday.
