[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falling debris has closed the northbound lane of the A82 south of Inverness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the problem had affected the trunk road between Drumnadrochit and Invermoriston, half a mile north of Altsigh. Traffic lights are in place.
The same stretch of road was shut for several days in March after two large rocks fell on the road.
An old oak tree falling into a boulder field was believed to have caused the rocks to slide down onto the A82.
Following the latest incident, Police Scotland has said motorists should check Traffic Scotland for updates.
