The man, who was in his 50s but has not yet been named, was injured on Friday.
His climbing companion raised the alarm at about 18:00 that day and members of Lochaber and RAF mountain rescue teams mounted a rescue operation.
The injured man, his climbing companion who was uninjured and mountain rescue personnel were airlifted from the scene by a helicopter at 02:00 on Saturday.
Police Scotland said: "Sadly the casualty, who was in his 50s and from outwith the area, died as a result of his injuries. Officers are liaising with next of kin and a further update will be issued in due course.
"Members of the mountain rescue teams are thanked for their courageous efforts during the rescue, carried out in dark and difficult conditions."
Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team has described the rescue effort in the dark and cloud on dangerous terrain as "one of the most difficult and technical" it has ever been involved in.
Eighteen members of the Fort William-based team and 13 from the RAF team were involved in the operation on a route known as the Long Climb, the longest climbing route in the UK.
