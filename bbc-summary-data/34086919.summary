Brian Óg Maguire, 24, from Lisnaskea died after being hit by a steel cable.
It snapped at the Quinn pre-stressed concrete factory in Derrylin on 13 September 2012.
Liam McCaffery, a Quinn Building Products Ltd director, admitted it had failed to ensure the health and safety of an employee.
He also admitted it had failed to maintain work equipment.
A barrister for the firm said Mr Maguire was a popular work colleague and the "very significant sense of loss" had not diminished with the passage of time.
Mr Maguire was a senior Fermanagh GAA football player.
Members of his family wept in the public gallery during the court proceedings.
The company will be sentenced on 7 October following the preparation of victim impact reports.
In a statement on Friday, the company's management said the "tragic event" had occurred prior to the acquisition of the business by Quinn Industrial Holdings Limited.
However, it said the company accepted that there "were failings in its maintenance of appropriate Health and Safety regulations at the time of the accident".
"Brian's death remains a tragic loss to his family, his community and his work-colleagues and he is sadly missed by all his friends throughout the business," the statement added.
"The company has worked closely with the Health & Safety Executive, implemented significant changes to work practices and made every possible effort to ensure that no such incident ever occurs again."
