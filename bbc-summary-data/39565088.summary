[SN]TITLE[SN]
Robbie Henshaw likely to sit out Connacht-Leinster derby match

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leinster centre Robbie Henshaw is likely to sit out his side's Pro12 interprovincial derby against Connacht in Galway on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Henshaw was left out of the Christmas meeting between the sides and is now set to miss out on a return to his old Sportsground stomping ground.
Leinster coach Leo Cullen rested several of his Ireland players for last week's narrow win away to Ospreys.
His remaining Irish internationals are likely to be left out this weekend.
The Irish province are rotating their squad as they chase trophy success in both the Pro12 and Champions Cup.
Johnny Sexton, Luke McGrath, Cian Healy, Garry Ringrose and Sean O'Brien were all omitted from the win at Liberty Stadium.
Cullen is set to give his remaining Ireland internationals, Jack McGrath, Dan Leavy, Devin Toner and Tadhg Furlong, a break for the trip to Connacht as he manages his resources with the 23 April Champions Cup draw semi-final with Clermont Auvergne in mind.
Leinster will still be without Rob Kearney (bicep) and Jamie Heaslip (back), while Jack Conan (shoulder) and Adam Byrne (hamstring) are both doubtful.
Sean Cronin, Rhys Ruddock and Dave Kearney all came their return to action through seemingly unscathed at the weekend.
The sides met in last year's Pro12 final, with Conancht emerging as victors on that occasion.
