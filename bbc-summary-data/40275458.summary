The 26-year-old made 33 appearances and scored two goals for the Devon club last season to help them win promotion from League Two.
He has previously had a loan spell at Victoria Park in 2011, appearing 12 times for Pools.
Meanwhile, Hartlepool defender Carl Magnay committed his future to the club by signing a new contract.
The 28-year-old has played 51 games since arriving from Grimsby in 2015.
Magnay suffered a cruciate ligament injury in September last year, but recovered in time for the end of the season, when Hartlepool were relegated to the National League.
The length of the contracts signed by the two players have not been disclosed.
