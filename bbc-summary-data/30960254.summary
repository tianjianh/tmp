Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken, who brought us Disney's Aladdin and The Little Mermaid has revealed he's working on the project.
The Golden Globe-winning film, which starred Robin Williams, was a huge hit and took $441m (Â£262m) at the box office worldwide.
Menken confirmed actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein is writing the book.
Fierstein played Williams' make-up artist brother in the film.
A sequel to the 1993 film was said to have been in development before Robin Williams died in August 2014.
'I am writing now, a musical of Mrs. Doubtfire,' Menken told Entertainment Weekly Radio.
He said "it's going very well".
Lyricist David Zipple is also on board - he's previously worked on Disney's animated musicals Mulan and Hercules, also with Menken.
"It's in its early stages, and that's probably all I can say. We're really enjoying working on it" Menken added.
In case there is anyone out there who hasn't seen the film (and you really should) it's a story about dad-of-three, Daniel Hillard, (Williams) who dresses up as a "hip old granny" so he can secretly spend time with his kids.
Alan Menken's back catalogue of hits is pretty impressive.
In addition to the musicals already mentioned, he composed the music for Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Enchanted, Little Shop of Horrors and Sister Act the Musical.
He has won 8 Academy Awards, 11 Grammys, seven Golden Globes and a Tony Award.
Fierstein wrote the book for the musical La Cage aux Folles, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical.
He also wrote the book for the Tony Award-winning Kinky Boots.
