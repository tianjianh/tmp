Since Brazilian Diego Lemos took over in September, the co-chairman has left, wages were paid late and concerns have been raised about the club's future.
The embargo is because the Professional Footballers' Association have stepped in to help pay wages.
"We've got another situation with regards a transfer embargo," Bentley, 40, told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"We've had a couple in the past anyway and we've always done everything in the regulations.
"We're working hard at the minute with the EFL, the board are working hard.
"There will be rules and regulations we have to stay within in this transfer window, but we're hoping we can do some business."
Bentley has also confirmed that on-loan Tranmere striker Cole Stockton will return to his parent club in January.
