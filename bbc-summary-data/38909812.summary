Six Nations 2017: Wales' Faletau fit for England, North and Biggar doubtful

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales number eight Taulupe Faletau is available for Saturday's Six Nations match against England in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old Bath back-rower has not played since Christmas Eve after suffering a knee injury.
George North and Dan Biggar will be given time to prove their fitness after suffering injuries during the 33-7 win in Italy.
Biggar injured ribs and North played on after taking an early blow to the thigh in Sunday's win in Rome.
Lock Luke Charteris is also a doubt for Saturday's game at the Principality Stadium having missed the opening match because of a slight fracture to his hand.
"We are giving Dan Biggar and George North as long as possible to make the game," defence coach Shaun Edwards said.
"They're two vital players for us, it's no pulled muscles or anything, just bruising so it's whether they can handle the pain.
"There's really bad bruising on George's leg and the flight home didn't help. We are worried about both of them."
Biggar's replacement, Ospreys team-mate Sam Davies, played a part in two of Wales' second-half tries.
It was his adventure deep in Wales' own 22 which set up North's score and took Howley's team within touching distance of the tournament's first try bonus point.
"We had the ball when he came on," Edwards added.
"He put in some lovely sublime touches that contributed to creating tries. Sometimes the best attacking players are best in the last 20 minutes."
Wales will announce the team to face England on Thursday at 13:00 GMT.
