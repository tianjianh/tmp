[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rangers took an early lead from the penalty spot, Henderson converting after Steven Notman had been felled.
Henderson nodded inches wide and was then denied by a flying stop from Mark Hurst before Elgin finally threatened as Mark Nicolson sent a header from a free-kick against a post.
But Henderson sealed the points near the end with a towering header.
