Former All Blacks Dan Carter and Joe Rokocoko have attended a French Rugby Federation anti-doping hearing following reports they tested positive for banned drug corticosteroids.

Carter, Rokocoko, and Argentina's Juan Imhoff failed the tests after June's Top 14 final for Racing 92.
Last week, Racing denied the players had breached anti-doping rules.
They also denied that the players had therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) for "anomalous" drugs tests.
The hearing on Wednesday took place at the French national team's training base in Marcoussis.
Racing said the case relates to "treatment by an authorised channel", and added they are "on the side of law, ethics and love of a clean sport".
Their statement came after Carter and Rokocoko's agent told the New Zealand Herald he had assurances "all the documents around TUEs were in place".
TUEs allow sportspeople to take prescribed medicines - which would otherwise be banned for their performance-enhancing properties - if there is a medical need.
