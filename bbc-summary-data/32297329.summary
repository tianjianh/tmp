Northern Ireland voting to Seanad proposed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Voting to the upper house of the Irish parliament should be extended to Northern Ireland and abroad, a working group on reform has recommended.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Working Group on Seanad Reform has also recommended a majority of Seanad seats be elected by popular vote.
The Seanad has existed for more than 90 years.
In 2013, voters in the Republic of Ireland rejected a government proposal to abolish it.
The Working Group on Seanad Reform's recommendations include:
The group said its principal objective was "the restructuring and reforming of Seanad Ã‰ireann to bring it into line with international best practice for second houses of parliament in the 21st century".
The report also included timelines and processes for the implementation of its recommendation.
The working group included a draft bill as part of its final report, which will be available within the next four weeks.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said the report will not sit on the shelf along with others on the same topic.
