Emergency services were called to the fire outside Tesco on Wellington Road at about 22:15 on Monday. The fire was extinguished and there were no injuries.
Police Scotland said four youths - two aged 12 and the others 13 and 14 - had been charged.
The incident is not believed to be connected to a fire at Grampian Court on the same evening.
A three-month-old baby boy was treated for the the effects of breathing in smoke after the wilful fire in the block of flats.
In addition to the baby, two men and a woman were taken to hospital. They were not seriously hurt.
A further 17 residents were checked at the scene by paramedics before being allowed to return to their homes.
Police Scotland is continuing to investigate.
