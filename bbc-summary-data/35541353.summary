Stan Kroenke: Arsenal shareholder spends £500m on Texan ranch

Arsenal fans have long complained about the club's lack of spending.

But the Gunners' largest shareholder Stan Kroenke has certainly splashed some cash - on a Texas ranch worth about £500m.
The property is spread over six counties and Kroenke, who is worth about £5bn, now owns more than 865,000 acres of land in the United States - an area three times the size of Los Angeles, or four-and-a-half times the size of New York.
Only eight people own more land than Kroenke in the United States.
But the American entrepreneur - who now owns 11 ranches - isn't the only sports owner who's enjoying the finer things in life....

Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovic has built up quite a fleet thanks to his £5.2bn fortune, and is the proud owner of the largest super yacht in the world  - the Eclipse.
The £1.5bn vessel boasts a 16 metre swimming pool, space for three helicopters and, of course, a dance floor.
And just in case Abramovic needs a speedier form of transport, he's also got a customised Boeing 767 private jet.
Can he park that at Stamford Bridge?
In 2014, ex-Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer fancied a new toy, so he had a root behind the back of the sofa and found £1.3bn to buy the LA Clippers basketball team.
It is the highest price ever paid for an NBA team, but a mere drop in the ocean for a man worth £16bn.
