[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wilfred Isaacs Sr, 50, died and his son, Wilfie Isaacs Jr, was injured at Chubbards Cross caravan park, near Ilminster, Somerset, on 5 May.
Charlie Broadway, 24, was jailed for 34 years at Bristol Crown Court after being found guilty of murder.
John Broadway, 38, was jailed for 15 years and William Broadway, 18, for 12 years, for Mr Isaacs Sr's manslaughter.
During the trial, the court heard Charlie Broadway fired his double-barrelled pump-action shotgun at his neighbour Mr Isaacs Snr at close range after a long-running feud between the two traveller families.
The court heard a row had broken out and John Broadway had given the order to younger brother William to fetch a gun.
He then passed the weapon to Charlie who shot Mr Isaacs Sr in front of the victim's partner, two sons and young granddaughter.
Charlie Broadway was also found guilty of the attempted murder of Mr Isaacs Jr.
Det Insp Lorna Dallimore, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: "Tragically, what started out as a verbal disagreement between members of the two families, resulted in the horrific shooting of two men.
"Our investigation showed Charlie Broadway used a sawn-off shotgun to inflict fatal injuries on Wilfred Senior and cause serious injuries to his son.
"It was a senseless act which has ultimately destroyed the lives of two families."
The family of Mr Isaacs Snr said: "We miss Wilf more than words can express and his humour, love, happiness will never be replaced."
Three other people were also convicted of offences following the trial.
Bonnie Wilson, 30, was sentenced to 18 months in prison suspended for two years after being found guilty of assisting an offender.
Charlie Broadway's brothers-in-law Joseph Finney, 33 and Riley Joe Jones, 21, were convicted of unlawful wounding and ABH and were both sentenced to 15 months suspended for two years.
