Emergency services were called to reports of a boy in difficulty in a dock near Mermaid Quay at 13:45 BST.
He was taken to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff but his injuries are not known.
South Wales Police and Cardiff council warned about the dangers of swimming in the water.
On Friday, Insp Tony Williams, of South Wales Police, said people were putting their lives at risk by venturing in at Cardiff Bay.
"The docks are deep, but those who jump in have no idea what may be lurking beneath the surface," he said.
"They have little concept of just how cold the water can be and once they are in, they are surrounded by high, sheer walls with limited means of escape.
"Our message to youngsters is simple: 'If you want to go for a swim, then go to the swimming baths where the environment is organised and safe. And keep out of the docks.'"
Cardiff council said swimming was strictly prohibited in the area due to the "severe dangers including submerged objects, water temperature and high speed boats".
A spokeswoman said the harbour authority regularly issued warnings of the risks, which include underwater currents, uneven riverbeds and "the height of the fall or jump if tombstoning".
