Hundreds of members of union Aslef voted "overwhelmingly" to take industrial action after rejecting a 2.6% pay deal.
On Friday, a spokesman said it had received an "improved offer", believed to be about 3.2%, and would recommend that its members accepted it.
Southern runs services between London, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Kent.
"Plans for a strike, put in place after members voted overwhelmingly for industrial action because of the company's failure to make a satisfactory pay offer, have been suspended until this process is complete," said a spokesman for Aslef.
"Following constructive talks with Southern management, Aslef has received an improved pay offer from the train operator.
"The offer will be put to our membership on Southern as a referendum, with a recommendation for acceptance by Aslef's executive committee."
