Syria: How Welsh MPs voted on military action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
So how did your MP vote?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We've been poring through the division lists to get a Welsh breakdown of the House of Commons vote in favour of air strikes against so-called Islamic State targets in Syria.
The 11 Welsh Tory MPs voted with the government. Four Welsh Labour MPs - Stephen Doughty, Chris Bryant, Wayne David and Susan Elan Jones - voted with the government.
Twenty of the 25 Welsh Labour MPs voted against air strikes, including shadow cabinet members Nia Griffith and Owen Smith. They were joined by Kevin Brennan, Geraint Davies, Chris Evans, David Hanson, Paul Flynn, Carolyn Harris, Huw Irranca-Davies, Gerald Jones, Stephen Kinnock, Ian Lucas, Madeleine Moon, Christina Rees, Jo Stevens, Nick Smith, Mark Tami and Nick Thomas-Symonds,
Wales's only Liberal Democrat MP, Mark Williams, defied his party leadership to vote against military action.
Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams and Jonathan Edwards voted against bombing and Liz Saville Roberts was a 'teller' for the noes (technically, her vote isn't counted).
Ann Clwyd is unwell and was absent from the vote.
Cardiff South and Penarth MP Mr Doughty told me afterwards: "We have to respect that the Labour Party is a broad family. People have genuine and principled views, including Jeremy. I respectfully disagreed with them on this occasion, but that doesn't mean that people don't think these things through very carefully."
Delyn MP David Hanson said: "It took a lot of deliberation but I didn't believe in the prime minister's plan for after the air strikes."
"I still support action against IS if it was under a concerted UN resolution with a proper ground plan. I also still support the action against IS in Syria."
