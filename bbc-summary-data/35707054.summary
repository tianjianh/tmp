Peterborough manager Graham Westley is confident his side can recover from a run of five League One defeats.

Posh dropped to 16th in the table after losing 3-1 at Bury on Tuesday.
"We've given the fans some massive highs and now we're giving them a ridiculous low," said Westley.
"I hope people understand the reality of the situation. We had a team in November that won six straight and we're sick of talking about it, but we've lost eight of those in this run."
He told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "We've been blooding players, given them their debuts and we've looked a bit disjointed - the little errors are adding up and costing us dear.
Westley's side were in the play-off places in mid-January, but since selling top scorer Conor Washington to QPR, Posh have only scored six league goals.
And they have lost every game since their FA Cup fourth round penalty shootout defeat by Premier League West Brom on 10 February, with injuries to midfielder Chris Forrester and striker Lee Angol proving untimely.
"Two or three weeks ago we were playing a Premier League side and matching them. We've had an awful period since then," said Westley.
"We have to take responsibility for what we are serving up, but we will get it right. We're all hardworking people, we know what we're doing, we're good at our jobs."
