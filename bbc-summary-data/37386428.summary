The hashtag #DataMustFall has been trending nationwide on social media over the past 24 hours.
This is despite South Africa having the most affordable mobile internet in Africa, according to the International Telecommunication Union.
The hashtag is a play on other campaigns such as #RhodesMustFall.
This was a call to topple a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes.
It was followed by a campaign against President Jacob Zuma - #ZumaMustFall.
