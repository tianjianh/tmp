She is the second Welsh woman to seal gold in Switzerland after Olympic champion Jade Jones won on Friday.
Williams, 17, was fighting in just her second competition of 2016 following two major ankle operations.
"I didn't expect a medal, let alone gold," said the Blackwood fighter and 2014 world junior champion.
"I can't even explain it, I'm just overwhelmed.
"I've just come back from injury so it's my second competition [and] to win a major it's insane, I can't explain it."
It was a dramatic afternoon for the youngster who beat Ukraine's Tetiana Tetereviatnykova 11-10 on golden point in the quarter-final, before edging out Croatia's Matea Jelic 13-12 in the last four.
Williams made her return to competitive action in April's President's Cup after having two ankle reconstruction operations in the last two years.
She has not qualified for the Rio Olympics, but is targeting success at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.
