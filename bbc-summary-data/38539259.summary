Plymouth Argyle 4-2 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth came back from a goal down to beat Stevenage 4-2 in League Two ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup third round replay at home to Liverpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From 2-2 at the break, on-loan Bristol City striker Arnold Garita turned in playmaker Graham Carey's goal-bound 25-yard drive for Argyle's third goal on 54 minutes at Home Park.
Substitute David Goodwillie made it 4-2 in stoppage time with a close-range tap-in, keeping the second-placed side four points behind leaders Doncaster.
Plymouth may have kept a clean sheet at Liverpool but they conceded after two minutes against Stevenage as Matt Godden turned in Luke Wilkinson's nod down from close range.
Argyle levelled on 35 minutes through Jordan Slew, again from close range, as he turned in Jake Jervis' effort from Graham Carey's corner.
Jervis put Argyle ahead for the first time in the 42nd minute, swivelling on Connor Smith's flick-on after Slew's cut-back from the bye-line.
Stevenage restored parity in first-half stoppage time when Steven Schumacher's 30-yard free-kick bounced up to beat Luke McCormick.
