[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 4-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth forward Jake Jervis scored twice as the League Two leaders beat Yeovil Town 4-1 at Home Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Argyle striker Jimmy Spencer scored a superb 39th-minute opener, shimmying his way past two defenders before sending an angled strike from the right into the far top corner.
Jervis doubled Argyle's lead four minutes later when his 20-yard effort spun off a defender's boot to wrong-foot keeper Artur Krysiak.
Yeovil's response was swift as skipper Darren Ward tapped in from a few yards out as Argyle failed to deal with a low 45th-minute cross from the right-hand side of the penalty area.
The Glovers should have levelled in the 50th minute when Ward's far-post cross fell to unmarked left-back Nathan Smith, whose diving header flew wide.
Playmaker Graham Carey nonchalantly swept the ball home on the run from 25 yards into the top corner as he spotted Krysiak out of position after 71 minutes to make it 3-1.
Jervis then profited from substitute Craig Tanner's unselfish play to claim his second goal four minutes from time.
