She was found with serious injuries at about 14:55 on Sunday.
A 30-year-old is expected to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court on Tuesday. Police Scotland said there would be a continued police presence in the area. Tributes have been paid online to Miss Low by friends and family.

"My sister was strong and beautiful and will be sorely missed by us all.
"She was one of the best people I knew.
"She was a very, very strong woman. She always looked great."
One friend has also started a crowdfunding page.
