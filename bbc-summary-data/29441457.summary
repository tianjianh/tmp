Pre-loading a 'dangerous epidemic' says top A&E; doctor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There's been a big rise in the number of 15 to 29-year-olds ending up in hospitals across England because of alcohol problems.

Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show nearly 40,000 were admitted in 2012/13, a rise of 58% from 10 years ago.
Cliff Mann is one of the UK's most senior A&E doctors and says pre-loading is a major factor in the increase.
He told Newsbeat it's now becoming a "dangerous epidemic".
Government figures estimate the annual cost of alcohol to the NHS at £3.7bn and around £21bn to the wider society.
Mann is president of the College of Emergency Medicine which represents A&E Doctors and says pre-loading is the biggest behavioural change in drinking in the last decade.
"The real danger with pre-loading is that overall people drink far more in one evening, and drinking to that excess means it's much more likely they'll suffer the harmful consequences of alcohol," he said.
"In the short term they're that much more drunk, they're that much more likely to be ill or injure themselves and they're also much more likely to suffer long-term effects."
Friends Lewis Foster and Andreas Nichola, both 22 and from Northampton, don't think it's a problem.
On nearly every night out they and their friends begin with a couple of cases of cheap, supermarket beer and wine at home.
Lewis says they usually meet up at around 8pm and don't head out until around 11pm.
"It's a lot cheaper to do that than to go down to the pub all the time, so instead of say, once a month, we can meet up once a week.
"We want to save money to go to Glastonbury and things like that.
"You need to save money. You can't be spending half a Glastonbury fee on a night out in town."
Andreas agrees: "It's just easier, we all live in the same area, we can share cabs... and as long as you're sensible about it there are no worries.
"[Pre-loading is] more sociable because you've got your close mates around you and you can spend £10 here and £50 out in a pub."
It's not always that simple though.
Another of their friends, Greg Walding, admits sometimes it can be easy to drink too much.
"I have maybe four or five pints before I go out, then another four or five when I'm out.
"You can get a bit too drunk but it just saves money."
But Cliff Mann has no doubt that alcohol abuse is a serious problem and he wants to see minimum unit pricing introduced to try to tackle it.
The Scottish Government has already done that but it's being challenged in the courts so hasn't come into effect yet.
Politicians in Westminster are now waiting to see the outcome of that court case before making a decision about whether or not to introduce it in England and Wales.
In the meantime they have stopped supermarkets from selling below cost alcohol and stopped manufacturers from making super strength beers and ciders.
