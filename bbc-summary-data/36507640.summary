Aiden Webb, 22, of Norwich, went missing six days earlier after setting off alone to climb Fansipan mountain.
Aunt Lisa Shaw Webb said the family are in "shock" and paid tribute to him as a "wonderful, gorgeous, inspirational young man" in a Facebook post.
Local media have reported his body has been released to his father and a post-mortem examination carried out.
Ms Shaw Webb thanked everyone who had helped in the campaign to find him and said they had been "overwhelmed".
"Without the huge amount of shares and publicity we got, we probably wouldn't have found him," she wrote.
Mr Webb had been staying in nearby Sapa with his girlfriend Bluebell Baughan when he set off to climb Vietnam's highest mountain on Friday 3 June.
The keen climber had planned to conquer the 3,100m (10,300ft) mountain in a day, but later called his girlfriend to say he had fallen, cut his arm open, hurt his knee and lost his way.
The pair were in contact through the night, but Mr Webb's phone stopped working the next morning.
On Thursday, his body was spotted by park rangers at the bottom of a deep ravine close to the location he gave her.
His aunt launched a Facebook campaign to help find him, found a translator and, with a friend, turned "overnight into detectives", she said, while his father Trever and uncle Michael flew to Vietnam.
"This is the worst tragedy in our lives, when the news came to me it knocked me to the ground," Ms Shaw Webb said.
"Aiden was loved so much and he's going to be missed so badly, the loss is indescribable.
"His smile, his personality, his love, his acting, his love for adventures, just makes him truly memorable."
The Anglia Ruskin University drama graduate was halfway through a four-month backpacking trip with Ms Baughan, a fellow graduate, from White Notley, Essex.
