He later died in hospital. His 29-year-old male passenger was not injured.
The shots were fired by an occupant of a dark-coloured Audi Q5 that later sped off into Scotland Street heading for the M8 motorway and Kingston Bridge.
Police said that just before midnight on Tuesday, officers were called to a report of a car on fire in Bracken Street, in the Parkhouse area, in the north of Glasgow.
The car is currently undergoing forensic tests to establish if there is any link to the murder in Shields Road.
Detectives have appealed for anyone was saw a vehicle being driven at speed in the area to come forward.
Det Supt Jim Kerr, from Police Scotland's major investigations team, said: "Our priority remains tracing whoever is responsible and a team of highly experienced detectives are working on this murder inquiry.
"Although we do believe that this was a targeted, planned attack and Euan Johnston was the intended target, the shooting was carried out with absolutely no regard for public safety, and I completely understand that people will be concerned regarding this.
"I would stress that everything is being done to track down whoever is responsible for this shooting and this includes a number of officers examining CCTV footage from the area around the scene of the shooting."
Police said that forensic and search inquiries hand been completed at the scene of the shooting on Shields Road and the area had fully reopened.
Supt Kerr added: "We are doing everything we can to trace whoever is responsible for this murder, but we would appreciate any assistance that the public can provide, as the even the smallest piece of information could be vital to our investigation.
"We have support mechanisms in place, should people feel vulnerable about contacting us and I would urge people to do the right thing and report any information they have."
Police have set up an incident room at Baird Street Police Office in Glasgow to deal with information.
Supt Kerr revealed on Wednesday that Mr Johnston, who was from the Maryhill area of Glasgow, was "known to police" but he did give details.
He said the victim had been returning home after a meal when he was targeted.
The 29-year-old man who was a passenger in Mr Johnston's car is being treated as a "significant witness", the detective said.
He also revealed that the shooting had been witnessed by members of the public.
