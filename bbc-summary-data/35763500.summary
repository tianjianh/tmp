Staff at Charlton House, in Toddington, will handle an average of 750,000 calls a year from 33 countries.
The new building joins Vauxhall's existing operations in the Luton area, including its headquarters.
Vauxhall also has a manufacturing plant nearby which builds Vivaro vans and the UK parts distribution centre.
Rory Harvey, managing director of Vauxhall Motors, said: "This is a fantastic move for our business. Having a multi-lingual, cutting-edge team working within hi-tech facilities, will  empower staff to focus on operational excellence."
