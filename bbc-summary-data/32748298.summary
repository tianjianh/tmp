Pupils at a Swansea school have been given an extra lesson in French by a Premier League footballer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis took questions in English from 40 pupils at Ffynone House School and answered in French.
The visit was also used to help the 29-year-old improve his English as he was taught by the school's French teacher Francoise Robert.
"When I first came to Swansea I could only say 'hello'," said Gomis.
