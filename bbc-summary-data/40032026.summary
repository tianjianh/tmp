Handyman Adrian Jewell was also convicted of voyeurism after secretly filming another girl in a bathroom.
Exeter Crown Court heard one victim was 12 when he first raped her, in Devon. The abuse continued until she was 13.
The crimes were first reported to police in 2006 but Jewell went on to commit further offences before being arrested in 2015.

Jewell, 42, of Joan Moffat Close in Liskeard, Cornwall, was convicted of of five rapes, two sexual assaults and voyeurism.
The other teenager he raped was 18 at the time of the abuse, while his third victim was 17 when he secretly filmed her.
The first victim initially gave video evidence to police 10 years ago, when she was 15.
Det Con Nick Rowell, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: "Sadly, due to a lack of evidence at the time, the investigation did not reach a courtroom.
"It is only now, after that victim has lived with the horrendous crimes for so long, that further evidence from two more victims has led to these convictions.
"I can only praise the bravery of each of the three victims for coming forward."
Judge Geoffrey Mercer told Jewell: "These were serious sexual offences committed by you against three victims over a period of more than 10 years.
"You have caused the victims untold damage."
