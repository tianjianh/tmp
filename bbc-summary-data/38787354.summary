The Breeders' Cup Classic winner, ridden by Mike Smith, won by nearly five lengths from Shaman Ghost at Gulfstream Park in Florida.
The expected challenge from California Chrome, racing for the last time, did not materialise as he finished ninth.
"I'm so relieved," said Arrogate's trainer Bob Baffert, who added he "felt bad" about California Chrome.
"He just didn't bring his race so that match-up never came about," said the American.
"It's great to be here. I never thought I'd be here in a $12m race. I'm a little emotional."
Arrogate was last week named Longines World's Best Racehorse after earning a rating of 134 for his half-length victory over California Chrome at Santa Anita in November.
Smith said his mount had produced "another incredible performance" to secure the $7m (£5.58m) first prize.
He added: "That's not the California Chrome I know. He didn't fire."
