The fire at the Churchill Square shopping centre in Brighton started at about 12:30 BST.
East Sussex Fire and Rescue said it affected three cars, and was quickly extinguished. No-one was injured but a dog had to be rescued from a car.
Smoke could be seen billowing from the building at the height of the fire. The centre was reopened a short time later.
The fire, tackled by four crews, is not being treated as suspicious.
The shopping centre was evacuated as smoke had started to set off alarms in shops, the fire service said.
Staff were permitted back into shops and offices at about 14:15 BST with the public allowed to return about 20 minutes later.
The centre was fully reopen by 15:10 BST, with the exception of the car park where the fire took hold, although people were able to recover their vehicles, police said.
An investigation to establish the cause of the fire will be carried out.
