Louise Hunt said it related to an allegation that security services had some notice of the attack on 21 November 1974, which killed 21 people.
The senior coroner said she was not aware of the material appearing in the public domain before.
She concluded today's hearing saying a final decision will be made on 1 June.

Ms Hunt said:  "It's significant and does raise concerns in relation to potential advanced notice, that's as much as I can say."
The Birmingham and Solihull coroner has been hearing an application to resume inquests into the 21 deaths.
The bombings in Birmingham city centre also injured 182 people.
It is widely acknowledged the IRA orchestrated the attack.
Six men were jailed but released in 1991 after their convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal.
