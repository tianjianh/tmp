The internal structure of Capel Aberfan, built in 1876, was destroyed and four homes evacuated after the fire at 01:51 BST on Saturday.
The chapel was used as a temporary mortuary following the Aberfan disaster in 1966 and housed a memorial organ.
Jennie Griffiths of the fire service tweeted it is "in danger of collapse" and Aberfan Road remains closed.
Merthyr Vale councillor Darren Roberts said: "This is devastating for the community as it has so much history."
Although it closed in 2012, occasional services still took place and renovations were ongoing to try and modernise it and bring it back into community use.
Mr Roberts said the building had been "totally gutted".
One fire engine was still at the scene on Aberfan Road on Saturday morning, with most of the nearby residents having returned to their homes.
A South Wales Police spokesman said the force is working with South Wales Fire and Rescue Service to investigate the cause.
Wales and West Utilities are also at the scene.
