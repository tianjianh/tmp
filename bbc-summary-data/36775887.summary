The 24-year-old played in the Dutch second tier last season, where he scored 17 goals.
Kip came through the Ajax youth system where he earned a one-year deal, but moved to Almere in 2013.
"Ricardo's history last season was very good and we are hopeful that he can adapt to English football," manager Steven Pressley told the club website.
He has signed an undisclosed-length deal with the Lancashire side.
