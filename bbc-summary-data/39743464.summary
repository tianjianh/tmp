Darren Young: Albion Rovers manager to exit Cliftonhill at end of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Albion Rovers are to part with player-manager Darren Young at the end of the season - even if he keeps them in Scotland's League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Coatbridge club have announced that "terms for a contract for next season could not be agreed".
"Darren will remain in charge to ensure the club's League One position," the club added in a website statement.
The Wee Rovers lie seventh in the table, five points ahead of second-bottom Peterhead.
There are two games remaining and a win away to Brechin City on Saturday would ensure another season in the third tier of Scottish football.
Former Aberdeen, Dunfermline Athletic and Alloa Athletic midfielder Young has been in charge at Cliftonhill since June 2014.
The 38-year-old led his side to the League Two title in his first season as player-manager and they finished sixth last season in League One.
Rovers say they have started the process of finding a successor as manager to Young, who made the last of his own two appearances this season as a player in September.
