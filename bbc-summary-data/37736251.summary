[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glenn Murray's hat-trick helped Brighton extend their unbeaten Championship run to nine games with an impressive victory over Norwich.

The hosts took the lead when Murray dispossessed keeper Michael McGovern and slotted in to an empty net.
Jiri Skalak crossed for Murray to head in his second, before he picked out Lewis Dunk to nod in the third goal.
Murray tapped in to complete his hat-trick and Anthony Knockaert completed the rout with a fifth late on.
Norwich never seriously threatened the Brighton goal, mustering only two shots on target as the hosts kept their 10th clean sheet of the season - the most of any team in the top four tiers of English football this season.
The Canaries, meanwhile, have not kept a clean sheet in 12 league games, with goalkeeper McGovern at least partially at fault for three of the five Brighton goals.
Their form has seen them drop to fourth in the table after leading the division earlier in October.
Brighton are second, still three points behind leaders Newcastle.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"This is a big win, an unusual win. Come 15:00 BST next Saturday it'll be forgotten about.
"The significance of this game is that it is a very, very good victory against a top, top team. On Monday, all thoughts will be on our next game at Bristol City.
"The win is right up there with my best (Brighton victories); it would be silly of me to say anything different. It was against a top team who are pushing to try and achieve what we're trying to achieve."
Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"Certain players have let themselves down and have not performed at anywhere near what they're capable of. I apologise to the fans.
"Now it is about getting into work and working as hard as you can. After the game, the players said more to each other than normal which is not a bad thing.
"It was my worst defeat as a manager - a humiliating defeat. The players need to try and play better it's as simple as that.
"We defended really well in the first half and up until the second goal it was a tight game. The way we ended the game I don't associate with my teams."
