[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport football expert Mark Lawrenson is predicting the outcome of every game at the 2016 European Championship.

Lawro picked the winner in six of the eight last-16 ties.
He enjoyed a 42% success rate in the group stage, correctly guessing the outcome of 15 of the 36 games.
The only group he failed to get a single result in was Group F, which saw Hungary and Iceland spring a surprise by finishing first and second.
Before the tournament Lawro chose 11 of the 16 teams that are through to the first knockout stage, including France, his pick to win the tournament on 10 July.
Along with almost 350,000 of you, Lawro is taking part in the new BBC Sport Predictor game. He is going head-to-head with pundits, presenters and commentators from across BBC Sport. He's doing well, though he's not top as things stand:

Match report and highlights
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Italy were so impressive in their win over Spain in the last 16, even just by the way they made the pitch bigger for themselves when they had possession but made everything narrower for Spain when they had the ball.
It was a very clever way to play against the Spanish and Italy had a lot of chances - they could have won a lot more comfortably than the 2-0 scoreline.
The Azzurri have got momentum too but the most important thing about them is the backbone to their side.
Even when they are not dominating matches, with their back three and the goalkeeper, they buy themselves time.
It is widely recognised that this Italian team is not one of the most talented they have taken to a major tournament but they have a distinctive way of playing. Unlike, say, England every single one of them knows their job and what is expected in every single situation.
Italy will love being the underdogs and I would fancy them against pretty much every other team in the last eight - but they are playing Germany, who have basically strolled through the tournament so far.
Germany have always had a very fluid style but they look a lot more like scoring now they have Mario Gomez as a focal point up front, which was the one thing they were missing at the start of the competition.
This will be a very tough test for them but they have got the quality and mindset they need to beat Italy, and go on to win Euro 2016.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Wales have done brilliantly to reach the quarter-finals but when you look at what Iceland have done, it is the story of the tournament.
Whatever happens now, they have made themselves heroes. They completely deserved it too - they did not just beat England, they humiliated them.
That was the fourth time they have picked the same starting XI in France, and I would imagine they will pick the same team against the hosts.
France got a little bit lucky against the Republic of Ireland in their last match, because until N'Golo Kante went off at half-time, they were short of ideas.
But with just Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi in the middle - rather than Matuidi out right  - they looked much better balanced. With Kante suspended, Kingsley Coman should come in again, so the same should apply.
We know France are not great at the back but they will have seen what happened to England, and will not make the same mistakes.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
