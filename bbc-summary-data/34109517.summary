DUP defeated in assembly adjournment bid over Stormont crisis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been defeated in an attempt to adjourn the assembly for four weeks to try to resolve the current political crisis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The assembly is due to return next Monday after the summer recess.
First Minister Peter Robinson said after allegations of an IRA role in the murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr, it "cannot be business as usual".
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said he took strong exception to anyone who questioned his commitment to peace.
The DUP's attempt to stall assembly meetings was overruled by other parties.
Mr Robinson is meeting Prime Minister David Cameron and will ask him to intervene in an attempt to solve the crisis at Stormont.
Their discussions will centre on the political fall-out from Mr McGuigan Sr's killing and the subsequent decision by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) to leave the executive.
Mr McGuigan, a former IRA man, was shot dead in east Belfast last month. The police believe IRA members were involved.
In the wake of the shooting, the head of Northern Ireland's police service said that the IRA still exists.
But the chief constable added that there was no evidence that the murder had been sanctioned at a senior level in the organisation.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Robinson said: "These issues will not be resolved unless there is a talks process, but to allow that talks process I think we have to recognise that we can't simply do business as usual in the assembly, nor will we.
"Our view is that the prime minister and the government should suspend the assembly to allow the talks to take place."
Mr McGuinness said his party had a strong record of condemning violence and said those who went armed with a gun were "no friend of Sinn Féin".
He described the killers of Jock Davison and Kevin McGuigan as "criminals" and "violent dissidents".
He also criticised the UUP's withdrawal from the executive and said Mr Nesbitt's party were "playing fast and loose with the peace process".
He said the UUP action was "all about the election" and said if the DUP followed suite and left the executive it would show a "massive failure of leadership" which would leave a "vacuum" of a "very real prospect of an increase in violence on our streets".
The DUP's proposal for an assembly adjournment was brought before Stormont's business committee on Tuesday.
Stormont's power-sharing government returned in 2007, headed by then Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley as first minister and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness as deputy first minister.
The two men had been bitter enemies for many years, but the decommissioning of IRA weapons in 2005 and Sinn Féin's endorsement of policing in Northern Ireland paved the way for Stormont's return.
In the last assessment by the Independent Monitoring Commission, an official body that monitored paramilitary activity that was wound down in 2010, it said it believed the Provisional IRA had "maintained its political course" and "would continue to do so".
With Northern Ireland's chief constable now saying the Provisional IRA still exists and some of its members were involved in the murder of Kevin McGuigan, renewed focus has been placed on the stability of the institutions at Stormont.
Q&A: UUP withdrawal
But it was opposed by the UUP, Sinn Féin and the SDLP.
UUP leader Mike Nesbitt said his party did not support it as "other parties need to get on with governing".
DUP MLA Peter Weir said the UUP opposition was hypocritical.
"On the one hand, Mike claims to have withdrawn [from the executive] because of Sinn Féin denials on the IRA while on the other he is happy to vote with them to continue a normal business approach," Mr Weir said.
The UUP's sole minister Danny Kennedy submitted his resignation from the executive on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers met the Irish foreign and justice ministers in Dublin to discuss the crisis.
She said it was important that political parties in Northern Ireland had "real dialogue" and worked together to resolve the future of the executive.
She added that it was "well worth considering" bringing back a body similar to the International Monitoring Commission to monitor paramilitary activity.
She also said it was important to bring paramilitarism to an end.
After the two-hour meeting, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said "no best interest was served" in allowing Northern Ireland's political institutions to collapse.
He said "a number of options" were on the table over how to rebuild trust among the parties, and added that there was a need for them to re-commit to "the spirit and the letter of the Good Friday Agreement".
