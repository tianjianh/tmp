County Championship: Rain forces Essex to settle for a draw against Northants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Essex were denied the opportunity to push for a third Division Two victory after rain saw just six overs bowled on the final day against Northamptonshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors required six wickets at the County Ground to clinch the win and nightwatchman Ben Sanderson fell lbw to Ravi Bopara (2-25) off the final ball of the fourth over of the day.
Rain halted play at 11:25 BST with the hosts on 75-5, still trailing by 121.
The match was abandoned at 16:50 BST, as both sides settled for a draw.
Essex remain top of Division Two, while Northants' sixth Championship draw in seven matches leaves them seventh.
