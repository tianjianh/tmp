Anthony Stokes went to ground in the box as he was challenged by Killie's Michael Nelson but referee Willie Collum waved away spot-kick appeals.
The incident took place after Dieter van Tornhout headed the only goal.
"You've got to take your chances and we missed simple chances. We should've had a penalty," Lennon told BBC Scotland.
"It's a penalty and a sending off at a big moment in the game. I'm not saying we would've scored the penalty but I think the referee's got that one completely wrong."
Lennon cited missed opportunities for Gary Hooper and Stokes as he reflected on Celtic's defeat, which ended his side's hopes of completing a domestic treble.

"If we had got one, we might have gone on to win the game comfortably," Lennon told BBC Scotland. "We conceded a poor goal from our point of view.
"We dominated the game so Kilmarnock can count themselves pretty fortunate that they've won the game. And maybe that's down to a lot of luck on their part and poor finishing from us.
"We couldn't have played that bad. He [goalkeeper Cammy Bell] has made six or seven great saves to keep Kilmarnock in it. That happens in a cup final.
"I'm very disappointed for our players but we've got a league championship and a cup to win so we'll lift them again and go again."
Lennon also said news of a suspected heart attack for Kilmarnock midfielder Liam Kelly's father had put things "into perspective".
"My sympathies go to [Liam] and his family," added Lennon. "All my thoughts go with the family.
"It makes my pain pale into insignificance to what he's feeling."
