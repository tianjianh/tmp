The left-hander made 52 not out off 35 balls as Sri Lanka chased down India's 131 to win by six wickets in Mirpur.
Sangakkara, 36, had scored only 19 runs in five previous innings in the tournament.
"The side carried me to the final and I was pleased I finally did something for the team," he said.
Victory ended a run of four defeats in global finals for Sri Lanka, who lost the 2007 and 2011 World Cup finals and the 2009 and 2012 World T20 finals.
"It was my fifth final and I can't be happier or prouder. It's been a long time coming," said Sangakkara.
"It means everything to me. My family and playing for Sri Lanka are the two most important things in my life. We wear these colours with a lot of pride."
"A thumping victory for Sri Lanka. Sangakkara is bowing out in some style with 52 from 35 balls - and we will see him this summer in England.
"That will be a popular result. India were very much nailed on as favourites but hadn't really been tested so far in this tournament. Everyone likes to see the underdogs win."
Sangakkara retired from international T20s with 1,330 runs in 55 matches at a strike-rate of 118, while long-time team-mate Mahela Jayawardene also ended his T20 career with 1,493 runs in 55 games at a strike-rate of 133.
"We have been waiting such a long time; we just hadn't been able to get across that hurdle," said 36-year-old Jayawardene, who made his Test debut in 1997, three years before Sangakkara.
"This is for all the fans in Sri Lanka. There were a lot of emotions; it will take a few days to really know these feelings."
Sri Lanka captain Lasith Malinga, who bowled brilliantly under pressure in the final overs of the innings to restrict India to a modest 130-4, said: "Jayawardene and Sangakkara are two world-class players.
"For the young players looking up to them, we hope they can get all the experience they can before their last few years in Sri Lankan cricket."
India batsman Virat Kohli made a superb 77 off 58 balls to take his tally for the competition to 319 at an average of 106 and win the player-of-the-tournament award.
He said: "Congratulations to Sri Lanka, especially the two guys in their last match. God was smiling on them.
"We had one off-day and can be very proud with what we have achieved and the way we played."
India captain Mahendra Dhoni added: "Virat was the only one who looked fluent. He has been brilliant for the last one and a half years.
"He has taken his opportunity with both hands. He plays authentic cricketing shots and scores runs."
