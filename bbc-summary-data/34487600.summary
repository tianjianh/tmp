[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Before the third goal had been scored against Greece on Thursday night, flights were being booked and hotel rooms reserved - Northern Ireland fans are nothing if not optimistic.
So with the Green and White Army leading the march towards Paris, BBC News NI compiled some linguistic support.
After all, speaking loudly and slowly in English doesn't always work, which is why we've come up with a few key translations to tide you over.
There were a couple of phrases our French friends struggled with - apparently there's no Gallic version of wind your neck in.
Consider this our alternative phrase book, our little 'je ne sais quoi' for the NI bon viveur...
Green and White army. Armée verte et blanche.
We're not Brazil, we're Northern Ireland. Nous ne sommes pas le Brésil, nous sommes Irlande du Nord.
Our wee country Notre petit pays.
Wind your neck in Vent votre cou dans.
Are you blind ref? Vous êtes aveugle, monsieur l'arbitre.
That was definitely off-side. C'était sans contest hors-jeu.
My granny could have scored that. Ma grand-mère aurait pu marquer ce but.
Where can I park my campervan? Où puis-je garer ma caravane?
There's only one Michael O'Neill  Il n'y qu'un seul  Michael O'Neill.
That's a yellow card. Ca, c'est carton jaune.
Send him off. Expulsez-le!
No way is that a penalty. Ca ne peut pas être une pénalité.
Park the bus. Garer le bus.
You're having a laugh. Tu rigoles.
Get wired into them. Foncez les gars.
I'm scundered they missed that goal. C'est la honte qu'ils aient  raté ce but.
Catch yourself on ref. Ne soyez pas stupide répondant.
Let's all do the bouncy. Faisons tous "le bouncy".
Wee buns. Petits gâteaux.
