The agreement means the Grand Slam remains free to air across BBC television, online and radio.
"Wimbledon is the pinnacle of the sport," said BBC director general Tony Hall.
Earlier this year, a peak audience of 13.3 million watched Andy Murray win his second Wimbledon title on BBC One.
Next year, the longest partnership in sports broadcasting history celebrates 80 years of television and 90 years of radio coverage.
Wimbledon will continue to be broadcast across BBC One, BBC Two, BBC online and on BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 live sports extra.
"We greatly value the BBC's commitment to delivering large national audiences for the championships across a multitude of high quality platforms," said Philip Brook, chairman of the All England Club.
Hall added: "Wimbledon on the BBC will continue to unite the nation through must-see sporting moments, captivating audiences of all ages."
