London Ambulance Service compensates over woman's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a woman who died after two trainee paramedics refused to take her to hospital has accepted compensation from London Ambulance Service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sarah Mulenga, 21, who had sickle cell anaemia, became ill at her home in Barking in 2011.
A coroner said there was a "gross failure" to make "basic medical checks" and neglect contributed to her death.
Her family's solicitors said the ambulance service had apologised.
Student Ms Mulenga called an ambulance after falling ill on 9 January 2011.
Two further calls were made before two trainee paramedics who had failed recent exams arrived and then failed to check her. They claimed she had been deliberately uncooperative.
Her condition worsened and another crew was sent. Ms Mulenga was transferred to Newham University Hospital but she died after a cardiac arrest.
In 2013, a coroner said although her death was due to natural causes it was "contributed to by neglect".
At the time the ambulance service said: "Their actions are not reflective of the hundreds of caring and compassionate medics who provide a high level of service to our patients every day."
Ric Traini of BL Claims Solicitors, which represented Ms Mulenga's family, said: "This is a positive result for Sarah's family, who were left devastated by the shocking circumstances of her death and suffered significant anguish in knowing that more could and should have been done to help her.
"The family were determined that the coroner's findings, and their own concerns, should not be ignored."
Neither London Ambulance Service or the family's solicitor were able to reveal the amount of compensation accepted.
