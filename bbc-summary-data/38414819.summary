Dumfries Whitesands flood protection plan reversal bid lodged

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bid is being made to overturn the decision to adopt a major flood defence plan for Dumfries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Earlier this week Dumfries and Galloway Council agreed to formally publish the scheme costing £25m.
However, councillor Ian Carruthers - who had tried to delay a decision until after May elections - tabled a recall notice with the backing of 12 members.
It means the issue will now be brought back to an emergency meeting of the full council on 29 December.
The costs of the project have risen to £25m from previous estimates of between £15m and £17.8m.
The Scottish government would meet 80% of the bill with Dumfries and Galloway Council required to find the remaining figure of about £5m.
The increase in costs prompted the move to look again at the decision at a full meeting of the council.
Mr Carruthers was able to gather the level of support required from other councillors in order to force the issue to be examined once more.
