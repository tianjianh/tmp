Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez says defender Jamaal Lascelles is "in a good position" to become captain.

The Spaniard is yet to name his skipper after Fabricio Coloccini's departure to his hometown side San Lorenzo.
"There are two or three players that could be there (captain)," Benitez told BBC Newcastle.
"But [Jamaal Lascelles] is in a good position because what I have seen from him, I'm pleased with - he has the character and the right mentality."
Coloccini skippered the Magpies for five seasons during his eight-year spell at the club, making 159 appearances in the captain's armband.
Lascelles, 22, has captained the side throughout pre-season since the Argentine's departure and former Real Madrid boss Benitez is confident other players will support him should he be named captain for the upcoming season.
The 56-year old continued: "Still he's a young player, so I think the other players are ready to help if necessary.
"I think there are two or three players that maybe can be there and can help."
Newcastle begin their Championship campaign on Friday away to Fulham as they begin their attempt to return to the top flight at the first attempt.
