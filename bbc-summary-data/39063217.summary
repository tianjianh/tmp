EFL Cup final quiz: Name the League Cup final goalscorers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
We've made a League Cup final goalscorers' quiz. It's really just a chance for you to see how good you are at spotting footballers - one or two of them semi-obscure - from the past 20 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All you have to do is name these players who scored the last goal in a League Cup final. A few are obvious, others might require a bit more of a reach into your memory banks.
There are 19 questions rather than the 20 we hoped for - blame everyone involved in the goalless 2009 final.
