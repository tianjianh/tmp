Boxing Day's 4-1 home defeat by West Ham left Swansea four points adrift of safety in the Premier League.
Bradley took training on Tuesday and could still be in charge against Bournemouth on New Yea's Eve, but Walsh believes the American should go.
"You just feel he's out of his depth," Walsh told BBC Radio Wales.
"He's not up to it, he's not aware of what needs to be going on.
"Yes, the players have to take a lot of responsibility but the buck stops with the man at the top. He's failed at what he's tried to achieve."
Swansea fans called for the American to be sacked during the defeat to West Ham, his seventh loss in 11 games since succeeding Francesco Guidolin in October.
Prior to the West Ham match, Bradley had admitted his future could depend on the outcome of the Boxing Day fixture and the home match with Bournemouth.
But after the loss against the Hammers, it is understood Swansea-based chairman Huw Jenkins is in touch with owners Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan in the USA.
Ex-Wales international Walsh, who spent two years at Swansea between 1982 and 1984, says American owners Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan need to replace their compatriot.
"I think this can only go one way and that would be relegation, so something has to be done," Walsh added.
"The American owners have given the American manager the chance and that's na√Øve to say the least.
"The owners have got to say 'we've given you an opportunity and it's not working.'
"They've got to get rid of Bob Bradley very, very quickly and bring somebody else in.
"The American owners have got to stand up, be counted and put their money where their mouth is and give someone the opportunity to see if they can drag Swansea out of the mire."
Another former Swansea City player, Owain Tudur Jones, also believes Bradley's future at the club is in doubt after defeat by the Hammers.
"The pressure is building on Bob Bradley," Jones told BBC 5 live.
"He's been very unfortunate to take over a side that is struggling but that's generally how managers get the job.
"If anything the record has worsened since he's been at the club."
