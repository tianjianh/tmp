Belfast City Council proposes new guidelines for student housing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belfast City Council is proposing to develop new planning guidelines for student accommodation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are currently more than a dozen applications in the system representing more than 6,000 student beds.
The council is proposing internal guidelines for planners and a best practice guide aimed at developers.
The guidelines would not have determining weight in decisions, but could help influence proposals and ensure consistency.
A report to the council's planning committee said guidelines could also "provide reassurance to communities that existing residential amenity will be protected".
It added that any "policy deficiencies" can be addressed in the longer term in a new Local Development Plan.
The Ulster University's new campus on the northern edge of Belfast city centre has led to a wave of planning applications for student accommodation.
Most of the applications are for sites close to the new campus, but Queens University has also tendered for student accommodation.
