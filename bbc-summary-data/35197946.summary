The presenter, who also now works for ITV, is a director of the Women in Football network.
Oatley, originally from Codsall, near Wolverhampton, made her commentating debut on the BBC's flagship football highlights programme in 2007.
She receives the honour for services to broadcasting and diversity in sport.
Oatley, who directs the network which works to support women involved in football, said the honour was the "last thing I expected".

She said: "I couldn't even tell my mum... I never expected to receive one myself.
"When I was growing up in Wolverhampton, there was no suggestion of working in the game. Nobody suggested it."
Oatley said she was proud to see how far the women's game had come in the past decade.
Musician Goldie, real name Clifford Price, has also been appointed MBE, for his contribution to the music, TV and film industry and his work with a number of charities.
He was raised in the care system and grew up around the West Midlands, spending a large part of his youth in the Heath Town neighbourhood of Wolverhampton.
Goldie said: "From where I've come from, I look back at everything, all these people that influenced my life as a kid growing up in a really bad environment, it just makes it all worthwhile in terms of the recognition."
The musician, who made his name with his record Timeless, has appeared in several TV shows and movies, including roles in James Bond's The World Is Not Enough, as well as having a recurring role in EastEnders as Angel Hudson.
