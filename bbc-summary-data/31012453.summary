Did Taylor Swift just get hacked by Lizard Squad?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Taylor Swift apparently posted on her Twitter account earlier asking people to follow two accounts linked to the hacking group Lizard Squad.

Minutes later the posts were deleted but they had still racked up thousands of retweets and favourites in the short time they were live.
It appeared the star's Instagram account was also briefly compromised with a picture connected to another suspected member of the group.
It looks like the Shake It Off singer' accounts are now secure again.
Earlier, Lizard Squad claimed they were behind a major outage across Facebook, Instagram and Tinder but Facebook said the problems were down to a technical issue.
Since the rogue Taylor posts, Twitter has suspended the two users mentioned @veriuser and @lizzard.
On her Tumblr feed Taylor said: "My Twitter got hacked but don't worry.
"Twitter is deleting the hacker tweets and locking my account until they can figure out how this happened and get me new passwords."
She hashtagged the post "#HACKERS GONNA HACK HACK HACK HACK HACK"
She then found out about her Instagram and added: "Never a dull moment."
