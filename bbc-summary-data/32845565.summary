A Cardiff woman who has designed fashion for wheelchair users has won two awards in New York.

Lucy Jones, 23, was voted Womenswear Designer of the Year of Class 2015 at the New York Parsons School of Design's annual fashion benefit.
She also jointly won the Parsons and Kerings Empowering Imagination contest.
Ms Jones said the motivation for her designs came from a conversation with her cousin, Jake, who has a condition which means half his body is paralysed.
He has hemiplegia and told his cousin about the daily struggle he goes through putting on his own clothes.
"I realised that we, in the fashion industry, need to create more accessible solutions in clothing," Ms Jones said.
"I thought if Jake could dress himself, he would be able to be more independent. Clothes have the power to do that."
She started developing her line of clothes by working with a woman who has multiple sclerosis and limited mobility.
Ms Jones noticed some of the most complicated problems arose in designing trousers, as standard pairs were too short at the ankles and too low at the back.
She also had to consider that kneecaps change shape when bent, leading her to remove extra fabric at the bend of the knee, so trouser legs can fall flat.
And she took account of how thighs and bottoms spread when seated, as well as eliminating uncomfortable fabric bunching at the crotch.
For tops, she reinforced elbows that are always leaning on armrests, removed excess bulk and made room for the more developed muscles that people in wheelchairs develop in their shoulders and arms from propelling themselves in their chairs.
Ms Jones has now made it her mission to raise awareness on the issue of designing for disabilities.
She is the first Welsh design student to attend Parsons School of Design, securing her place in 2011 after receiving an award for art excellence and a distinction in fashion and textiles from Glamorgan University.
"I am thrilled to be named Designer of the Year. Having this accolade from a leading world-wide design school is amazing and I am hoping this will help further my career in design - I can't wait to see what the future holds," she said.
