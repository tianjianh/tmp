The 28-year-old replaces Australia leg-spinner Kristen Beams, who is recovering from a finger injury.
The Stars play Sydney Thunder on the opening day of the BBL, which runs from 10 December to 28 January.
"We are very fortunate to have secured the services of Danielle Hazell, a very competent T20 cricketer," head coach David Hemp told the Stars website.
Hazell, who has taken 73 wickets at an average of 18.95 in 73 Twenty20 internationals, is the fifth England player to join a BBL side.
England captain Heather Knight will play for Hobart Hurricanes, Melbourne Stars have signed Danni Wyatt, and Anya Shrubsole and Katherine Brunt will line up for Perth Scorchers.
Former England skipper Charlotte Edwards has moved from Perth to Adelaide Strikers.
