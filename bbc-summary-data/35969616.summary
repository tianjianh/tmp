The 31-year-old half-back has only featured twice this season after returning from knee surgery in March.
He went off injured in his comeback game at Huddersfield Giants and was forced off in the first 20 minutes of Friday's win at Leeds Rhinos.
The Robins are currently 10th in Super League, with two wins from their opening 10 games.
