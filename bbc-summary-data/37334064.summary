Gary Cahill: You could see Swansea foul from the moon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea defender Gary Cahill says Swansea's second goal in their 2-2 draw should have been ruled out because there was a foul on him so obvious "you could be sat on the moon and see it".

Swans midfielder Leroy Fer scored after dispossessing Cahill following a heavy touch, with referee Andre Marriner allowing the goal to stand.
An animated Cahill said: "It's a clear foul. Come on, seriously.
"It was clear as day and seeing it back has made me even more angry."
Analysis: 'Chelsea right to feel robbed by referee'
Cahill, who has posted a clip of the incident on social media labelling it "incredible", went to see Marriner after the game.
He added: "I said to the referee, 'there's three of you that can see that'.
"There were two fouls on me and between the officials they have said that they couldn't see it. For me that is incredible."
"I took the touch away from him [Fer], he came through the back of me.
"It's all fun and games for the fans - but it's the players who suffer. That kills me and kills my team. We have dropped two points which is massive in this league."

Chelsea controlled the first half, taking the lead through Diego Costa but Swansea levelled from the penalty spot after Gylfi Sigurdsson was tripped by Thibaut Courtois.
And when Cahill miscontrolled a pass from John Terry, Fer took the ball from him to score.
In a heated second half Costa - who equalised with a late overhead kick - was involved repeatedly in spats with Jordi Amat and Chelsea manager Antonio Conte wants referees to protect his striker.
"Every game the press ask me about the patience of Costa, his behaviour," Conte said.
"His behaviour was fantastic. Today he took a lot of kicks.
"I think the defenders know him and sometimes they try to provoke him. It's football and it's normal in this situation. They try to provoke but it's football, not only in England but in general in the world. The referee must see it and permit Diego Costa to play his football."
Chelsea captain John Terry ended the game limping and was seen leaving the stadium on crutches.
The Blues are next in action on Friday when they host Liverpool (20:00 BST kick-off).
But Conte said: "I don't know the extent of the injury. Tomorrow we will see the situation about his ankle. He's a warrior. I'm not worried."
