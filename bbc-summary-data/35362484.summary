Hart: "I love this. Before we start I just want to say that I am an expert at football predictions."
Ice Cube: "Yeah, I got the Panthers to win the Super Bowl."
Hart: "No, no, not THAT football."
Ice Cube: "You mean this has got nothing to do with the Patriots or the Raiders? Oh, it's actual 'with your foot' ball."
Hart: "He's got it now. We are totally ready and in tune with what we have to do."
Ice Cube: "We have a great affiliation with Manchester City. We are down with City."
Hart: "Call them Man City. Trust me, it makes us look like we know what we are talking about."
