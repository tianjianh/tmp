Fulham 2-3 Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley moved four points clear at the top of the Championship after coming from behind to beat Fulham.

The Clarets led when Sam Vokes headed home a corner but Ross McCormack levelled with a powerful shot.
Moussa Dembele converted a Luke Garbutt centre to put the hosts in front.
The visitors equalised when Vokes slotted home from the penalty spot after Joey Barton had been clipped in the area, before Andre Gray rifled home a great finish to give Burnley the win.
Burnley, who had not won at Fulham since 1980, stretched their lead at the top thanks to Middlesbrough's surprise defeat at Rotherham.
The game pitted the Championship's two highest-scoring teams against one another and it took less than 10 minutes for Vokes to break the deadlock with his 11th goal of the season.
Struggling Fulham turned the match on its head with two goals in five minutes from their front two but defensive frailties ultimately cost them once again.
Gray, signed for a fee of around Â£9m from Brentford in August, has now scored 20 Championship goals in 31 appearances for Sean Dyche's side.

Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic:
"We played a very good game but in this game the result is more important. It's very difficult when you need to score four to win. We need to be more solid to compete in this division.
"It's very complicated for us to score so many goals to win games, that's our problem. These goals do not give us enough points. They score goals always but it is true we are not enough solid to compete.
"It is the fifth penalty in nine games, it is too many penalties. It is so very easy to score a goal. We don't find many more benefits to make chances. This is our moment, we need to be more solid."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"Andre has a marvellous habit of not being disappointed to miss. He has so much power but [Sam] Vokes was tremendous as well.
"We can't worry about the other results, that's an anomaly, we can't control that. Tonight gives me belief in how we operate. You can't guarantee the outcome of every game.
"Consistency is difficult to find. I expected a lot of my players but they are human. To deliver constant high-level performances is difficult."
