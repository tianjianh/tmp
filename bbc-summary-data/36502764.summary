Criterium du Dauphine: Chris Froome takes overall lead after stage five win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome won the fifth stage of the Criterium du Dauphine to move into the overall lead on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Team Sky rider took the yellow jersey from Spain's Alberto Contador after also overtaking Australian rider Richie Porte with two stages remaining.
A group of five riders led for much of the 140km race from La Ravoire to Vaujany, but Froome was among those to catch the breakaway 3.5km from home.
The 31-year-old then burst away to hold off BMC Racing's Porte at the finish.
Saturday's penultimate stage provides several tough climbs in a 141km ride from La Rochette to the ski resort of Meribel.
Froome holds a seven-second lead over second-placed Porte and is looking for his third victory in the Dauphine, a race viewed as an important gauge of form before July's Tour de France.
On both previous occasions that Froome has won the week-long stage race - in 2013 and 2015 - he has gone on to win the Tour.

1. Chris Froome (GB/Team Sky) 3hrs 32mins 20secs
