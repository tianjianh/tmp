The crew of the closure-threatened St Abbs lifeboat station in the Borders have agreed to take back their emergency pagers and respond to RNLI call outs.

The volunteers were angry at the RNLI's decision to shut down the station later this year.
They had said they would no longer use the lifeboat to respond to emergencies, and would instead use their own boats.
But the crew agreed to take back their pagers at a meeting on Friday night.
In a statement, the crew members said they felt they had to do so ahead of the busy summer diving season, but they pledged to continue campaigning to save the St Abbs station.
There has been a lifeboat station in St Abbs for more than 100 years. The local volunteers have been credited with saving hundred of lives in and around the seaside town on the east coast of the Borders.
But following a review the RNLI announced last week that the St Abbs boat was no longer needed and in future cover would be provided with an additional boat in nearby Eyemouth.
Supporters of the station have argued that closing it would put lives at risk.
