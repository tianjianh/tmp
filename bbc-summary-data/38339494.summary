Paul Tisdale: Exeter City goalkeeper selection dilemma pleases boss

Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale says the competition for places as goalkeeper in his side is pleasing.

Bobby Olejnik, who played almost every game last season, has featured just three times since the start of October.
Christy Pym has taken over as first-choice keeper - playing nine of the last 12 games - while James Hamon has also made two starts.
"The fact of the matter is we have three very good goalkeepers, that's how it should be," Tisdale told BBC Sport.
"All players have light at the end of the tunnel in terms of good performances and I'm comfortable in selecting all three."
In 21-year-old Pym's last five games for his hometown club, City have lost just once - away at high-flying Carlisle in a game they should have won - and moved up to 17th in League Two.
"I will make a selection based on a whole number of topics and analysis and at the moment my choice is Christy," added Tisdale.
"He's played really well over the last three or four games and I don't think anyone would criticise his performances.
"We need competition for places and I've got three very able, selectable goalkeepers all trying very hard.
"There's no poor relationship between them on the training ground, which you often get in these situations, so I'm delighted for all of them.
"They're all good chaps and all pulling in the same direction whether they're selected or not, which isn't always the case."
