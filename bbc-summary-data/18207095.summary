The survey that will go to more than 4,000 households is being conducted by the States of Jersey Statistics Unit.
They want to know what people think about topics such as migration, housing needs, discrimination, parking and other public services.
It will also attempt to find out how many people speak Jersey's native language, Jerriais.
The statistics unit said it would be used by the government to make decisions about public services.
