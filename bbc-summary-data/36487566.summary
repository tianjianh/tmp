New £22.3m third Don crossing opening in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The third Don crossing in Aberdeen is to open to the public on Thursday afternoon, following months of delays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £22.3m Diamond Bridge linking Danestone and Tillydrone is aimed at easing congestion.
It was supposed to be completed late last year but issues with re-routing underground utilities caused a series of delays. A worker also died in an accident on the site.
The Diamond Bridge name was chosen by local schoolchildren.
