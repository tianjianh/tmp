Ballymurphy: Inquest into deaths of 10 people to begin later this month

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest into the deaths of 10 people shot dead by soldiers in west Belfast 45 years ago will get under way later this month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The killings by members of the Parachute Regiment took place in Ballymurphy over a three-day period in August 1971.
A preliminary inquest hearing has been scheduled for 30 November.
But it will not be completed unless the Coroner's Courts service is given additional funding.
The decision to prioritise the Ballymurphy deaths follows a review of more than 50 so-called legacy inquests, involving more than 90 deaths in some of the most controversial incidents of the Troubles.
They include killings by police officers and soldiers, and others where there are allegations of collusion.
The Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, has written to the families of the Ballymurphy victims informing them that their inquest is deemed to be at an advanced stage of readiness.
Those killed included a mother-of-eight and a priest.
A solicitor representing the families has welcomed the scheduling of a hearing date, but stressed that this does not mean the inquest will be completed at this time.
"The families have received notification that the inquest has been prioritised by the Lord Chief Justice," said Padraig Ã“ Muirigh.
"However, he was very clear that this doesn't mean that the inquest can be completed at this time.
"He warned earlier this year that legacy inquests can't be completed unless extra funding is made available and that position hasn't changed."
The decision means the Ballymurphy inquest will be among the first to be heard if the Stormont Executive or Westminster government agree to a request from Sir Declan Morgan for additional funding for the coroner's court service.
The Lord Chief Justice has drawn up a five-year plan to hear all outstanding legacy inquests.
It has been estimated that the cost would be at least Â£10m.
His request for additional funding has been blocked by First Minister Arlene Foster.
The BBC revealed on Thursday that lawyers acting for families of more than 30 people killed in some of the most controversial incidents of the Troubles have launched legal action in an attempt to have the funding released.
They are seeking a court order instructing the Stormont Executive, department of justice and Westminster government to give the Lord Chief Justice the resources he has requested.
A hearing for a judicial review application has been listed for 14 December.
