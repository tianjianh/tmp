[SN]TITLE[SN]
Work begins on £17m power station at St Helier, Jersey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on a new £17m electricity substation is expected to start early in the New Year following delays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The project to build the station on a former quarry site on Jersey had been stalled over concerns it would take up open space in town.
Jersey Electricity said the old quarry wall can now be safely removed and a new retaining wall constructed.
The firm signed a contract with Jayen to carry out the civil works on the 10,000sq ft site at Westmount Gardens.
