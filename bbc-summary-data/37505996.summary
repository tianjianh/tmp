Castleford Tigers have given half-back Rangi Chase a new deal for 2017, with the option of a further year.

Chase, 30, returned to Wheldon Road in July after spells at Salford and Leigh, and scored one try in seven games.
His first stint between 2009 and 2013 was hugely successful, and he won the 2011 Man of Steel award as well as winning eight England caps.
"It's good to come back to a group that is capable of winning something in the next two years," Chase said.
"We have a strong group of players and the club has turned around a lot from when I was last here."
Cas offered Chase a return to rugby league about two months out after he opted to leave Leigh, citing depression as one of the reasons.
The New Zealand-born stand-off can now be part of a full pre-season with the Tigers when they return to training on 7 November.
"He has fitted back into the club well and there is so much more to come from him," head coach Daryl Powell said.
"He has been out of the game for a while so his fitness levels need a pre-season but he has shown in his brief time back that there is still the talent and ability there."
