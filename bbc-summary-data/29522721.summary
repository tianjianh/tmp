Alice Gross death: Inquest date set

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest into the death of 14-year-old Alice Gross is to open at West London Coroner's Court on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The schoolgirl's body was found in the River Brent on 30 September, nearly a month after she went missing. A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and more tests are being carried out.
Arnis Zalkalns - the prime suspect in the killing - was found hanged in a west London park on Saturday.
The hearing is set to be adjourned while police investigations continue.
Mr Zalkalns, a convicted murderer,  was last seen on 3 September at his home in Ealing.
The 41-year-old Latvian builder was filmed on CCTV cycling along the Grand Union Canal path 15 minutes after Alice walked along it on 28 August.
He had served seven years in prison in his native country for bludgeoning and stabbing his wife Rudite to death before moving to the UK in 2007.
Police said significant efforts had been made to conceal Alice's body.
The hunt for Alice, from Hanwell, west London, was the largest Met Police search operation since the 7/7 terrorist bombings in 2005, involving 600 officers from eight forces.
Officers searched at least 25 sq km (10 sq miles) of open land and 5.5km (3 miles) of canals and rivers.
