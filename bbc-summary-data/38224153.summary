[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doosan Babcock to shed 470 jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Engineering group Doosan Babcock has announced plans to cut 470 UK jobs, the majority of which will be in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company confirmed that 270 jobs were at risk at the company's base in Renfrewshire, where 800 staff are currently employed.
They include 140 posts at its machining and assembly facility in Renfrew, along with 130 management and back-office support roles.
The Unite union said it was "angered and dismayed" at the news.
In addition to the planned Scottish job cuts, 70 roles are at risk in Crawley, West Sussex, another 20 at Gateshead and a further 25 at Tipton in the West Midlands. The rest will be spread across other sites in the UK.
The Renfrew plant suffered job losses a year ago when Doosan announced a nationwide restructuring move.
Doosan, which provides services to the energy, pharmaceutical and petrochemical sectors, said it foresaw a "long-term downturn in certain market sectors".
Chief executive Andrew Hunt said: "Over the last year we have worked hard to rebalance the business, adapting to changing market dynamics and reacting to industry requirements for a low-carbon future.
"Unfortunately, we foresee long-term downturn in certain market sectors which mean the current position is unsustainable.
"It is with much regret that we now have to enter into the statutory consultation period on redundancies."
He added: "The continued long-term growth of the business across the UK and in strategic international markets remains a priority.
"We have made significant progress in transforming and future-proofing the business but this will only prove successful if we also reduce our cost base in parallel."
Unite regional officer Alison MacLean said: "We are angered and dismayed that the company has started a consultation with virtually no notice to the union and without giving a clear breakdown of where it wants to make changes.
"Pushing ahead with this consultation at this time of year is particularly distressing for our members.
"We will be seeking an early meeting with the company to get the information our members need and to ensure that their employment rights are fully protected."
