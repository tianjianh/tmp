The RNLI has urged canoeists, kayakers and boat users to check weather conditions before venturing out on to Loch Ness.

The loch's volunteer lifeboat crew was called to the aid of an exhausted kayaker on Sunday and two capsized canoeists on Tuesday.
High winds were a feature of the weather conditions on both days.
A spokeswoman for RNLI Loch Ness said: "Loch Ness often takes people by surprise."
She added: "We always advise people to be prepared and check the weather conditions before setting out."
The first of the incidents involved a holidaymaker who got into difficulty in a kayak.
Loch Ness' lifeboat was launched at about 16:40 and one of the crew helped the man to swim with the aid of a rope line to the rescue boat.
The spokeswoman said: "The man, who was very shaken by his experience, was returned safely to the campsite at Foyers by the lifeboat crew before they returned to base."
The second call-out came at about 14:15 on Tuesday after two canoeists had capsized but managed to reach shore at the north of Invermoriston.
The spokeswoman said: "Cold and wet and hampered by waves and wind, they were soon picked up by the Loch Ness lifeboat."
They were also staying at the campsite at Foyers and were dropped off there by the lifeboat.
