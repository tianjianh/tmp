"Whilst we want everyone to enjoy their weekend we are asking these youths to stay away from the area," police said on their west Belfast Facebook page.
They said they were concerned by a large gathering close to train lines.
"Police will be on patrol and we will deal robustly with anyone caught breaking the law," they added.
"We would also ask parents to ensure they know where their children are."
