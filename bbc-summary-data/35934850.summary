McDermott first took on the post with the USA Hawks last July, sealing qualification for the tournament with wins against Jamaica and Canada.
The 46-year-old has become one of the most successful coaches in Super League, with three titles and two Challenge Cup wins as Leeds boss.
"I'm very pleased to have been invited to continue my role," he said.
"What's already been achieved is the result of a lot of hard work and commitment, with much more preparation required.
"I'm looking forward to working alongside a dedicated group of people that have demonstrated the desire to succeed and are willing to make the necessary changes in order to adapt."
Former Salford, North Sydney Bears and Canberra Raiders forward Sean Rutgerson will also continue as assistant coach.
