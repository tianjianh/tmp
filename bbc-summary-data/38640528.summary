[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eintracht keeper Lukas Hradecky was sent off after 125 seconds for handling outside his area - and the home side took control just four minutes later.
Marvin Compper pounced on a rebound to put the home side ahead, Timo Werner adding a header before half-time.
Marcel Halstenberg's scrappy third moved the top-flight debutants back within three points of leaders Bayern Munich and eight points clear of third-place Hoffenheim.
Hoffenheim, the only unbeaten side left in Europe's top five leagues, maintained their record with a 2-0 win at 13th-placed Augsburg.
Top scorer Sandro Wagner bundled in his 10th goal of the season shortly after half-time, with former Leicester striker Andrej Kramaric tapping in the second.
Hoffenheim, who have won seven and drawn 10 of their 17 games, are a point clear of Borussia Dortmund.
Dortmund's right-back Lukasz Piszczek's late tap-in secured a 2-1 win at 10-man Werder Bremen, lifting last season's runners-up to fourth.
Elsewhere, new signing Guido Burgstaller enjoyed a dream debut for ninth-placed Schalke, netting a 92nd-minute winner in the 1-0 victory over second bottom Ingolstadt.
France international Paul-Georges Ntep also played a key role on his Wolfsburg debut, setting up Mario Gomez's winner in their 1-0 home victory against fellow strugglers Hamburg.
Ex-Germany midfielder Torsten Frings, recently appointed as Darmstadt's new coach, saw the league's bottom side earn a point in a 0-0 draw against Borussia Monchengladbach.
