[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to £3m of extra cash will be spent on health services in Guernsey due to urgent changes highlighted by a number of reviews.

Reviews into maternity care and social care found the need for a number of changes to be made by the Health and Social Services Department (HSSD).
The extra funding, above the £112m already budgeted for this year, will come from the budget reserve.
The department asked for the extra money to fund the changes.
The breadth and depth of issues facing HSSD have been many years in the making
Previously, a States review of social care criticised inconsistent staff training, an "appalling" lack of investment in facilities and creating an "unacceptable delay" in finding suitable homes for vulnerable children.
A number of baby deaths were also investigated following the publishing of a critical report into Guernsey's maternity services, which resulted in an 88-point improvement plan.
The changes include the appointments of a clinical director of health and a medical director, simplifying internal processes and working more closely with other agencies that deal with children.
The department has the biggest budget in the States of Guernsey at £112m in 2015 and the extra funds will be used this financial year.
Health Minister Paul Luxon said: "The breadth and depth of issues facing HSSD have been many years in the making and will without doubt take, in the board's view, 5-10 years to rectify fully.
"This is going to be a long haul and extremely difficult choices will have to be made, both by this assembly and future government, there is no magic panacea."
