[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town 0-1 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MK Dons started life after relegation back to the Championship with a hard-earned win at Shrewsbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Powell's second-half goal proved the difference as Karl Robinson's men collected maximum points.
Dons threatened from two early corners, as Dean Lewington headed over before Joe Walsh then forced a comfortable save from home goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler.
But Shrewsbury, once they settled, started to pose the visitors problems, debutant Louis Dodds dragging a shot wide before seeing an effort well held by goalkeeper David Martin, diving to his left.
Another of their debutants AJ Leitch-Smith was denied by an excellent challenge from defender Walsh, while fellow new boy Jim O'Brien also went close when he fired narrowly wide from the edge of the penalty area.
Shaun Whalley attempted to break the deadlock for the hosts early in the second half, but his effort was safely gathered at his near post by the alert Martin.
Dons had found clear chances hard to come by until they struck their 73rd-minute winner.
Shrewsbury sub Abu Ogogo was dispossessed in his own penalty area by Ed Upson and Powell rifled an angled shot powerfully past Leutwiler from 15 yards.
