Eddie Girvan, 67, was found in his home on Station Road in Greenisland by police at about 21:30 GMT on Monday.
A 29-year-old woman and two men, aged 23 and 24, were arrested in Belfast on suspicion of murder.
DCI John McVea said it was an "horrific and shocking" crime and said Mr Girvan suffered a "painful and violent death".
He said Mr Girvan was seen in a nearby off-licence at about 14:30 GMT on Sunday.
However, his whereabouts and movements after that are not known, or who he was with.
Mr McVea appealed for anyone saw Mr Girvan in the last few days to contact police.
He said shortly before 07:30 GMT on Monday, Mr Girvan's car, a silver Hyundai Sonata, reg MKZ 9818, was seen leaving the area and being driven down the motorway "in a dangerous way".
"It is believed to have been involved in a minor accident as it travelled through the city centre. This car was recovered late last night in Verner Street in Belfast," Mr McVea said.
Police confirmed that an ongoing operation in Verner Street on Tuesday is related to serious crime.
Mr McVea said robbery was one possible motive being investigated by police.
He said that police went to the house after detaining one of three people currently being questioned by police over an unrelated matter.
"It was due to those enquiries that were being made with one of the arrested persons that led us to come to this address and following the discovery of Mr Girvan that person was then arrested on suspicion of murder," he said.
The other two people were then also arrested, he said.
A post-mortem examination has yet to take place.
East Antrim Alliance Party MLA Stewart Dickson said he had known Mr Girvan most of his life, having gone to primary school and Boy's Brigade with him.
"Always a very helpful, friendly person, someone who would have gone the extra mile to help people, doing odd jobs and was always willing when somebody needed something done in their home, a repair job or something like that" he said.
"Eddie was always there to help out."
