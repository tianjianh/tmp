Chris the sheep has set a Guinness World Record for having the most wool shaved in a single sitting.

The Australian sheep was found wandering alone near Australia's capital a month ago.
His coat was dangerously big and he needed a life-saving shave.
Five shearers volunteered to help, including champion sheep shearer Ian Elkins.
Together the team removed 41.1 kilograms (90.6 pounds) of wool.
Ian said it was one of the biggest challenges he'd faced in 35 years of work.
Guinness World Records have now confirmed Chris' record, previously held by Big Ben and his 28.9 kilogram shaving.
Tammy Ven Dange from the RSPCA animal charity said: "We certainly didn't have the world record as priority when we sheared Chris, but we appreciate the recognition,"
"We can only hope that record is never broken again because it would be unlikely that the animal would live to tell the story."
Chris is now well and has found a new home on a farm in New South Wales state.
His fleece has been donated to the National Museum in Canberra.
