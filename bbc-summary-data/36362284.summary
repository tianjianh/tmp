County Antrim girl receives £5.3m in compensation claim against Northern health trust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An eight-year-old girl from County Antrim who was left profoundly disabled after being starved of oxygen at birth is to receive £5.3m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The settlement was reached in a compensation claim against the Northern Health and Social Care Trust.
The child, who cannot be identified, suffered hypoxia due to a delay in her delivery at Antrim Area Hospital in 2007.
It resulted in a series of complex health issues.
These included severe cerebral palsy and complex epilepsy.
Her parents sued the trust, claiming medical negligence.
The case had been due to run as a five-day trial at the High Court in Belfast earlier this month.
However, full liability was admitted a week before the listed hearing date.
The figure of £5.3m covers damages and the costs of past and future care for the child.
