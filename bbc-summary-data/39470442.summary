[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sunderland v Manchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John O'Shea is at home in Ireland after the death of his father, having also missed the defeat to Leicester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victor Anichebe is pushing for a recall but on-loan winger Adnan Januzaj is ineligible to face his parent club.
Antonio Valencia will return at right-back after being rested, with Paul Pogba also likely to start.
Ashley Young is out after picking up a knock against Everton and Wayne Rooney is also sidelined with an ankle injury.
Guy Mowbray: "In response to criticism of his Stoke side, then-manager Alan Durban was misquoted as once saying: 'If you want entertainment, go to a circus' (He may actually have said 'watch a bunch of clowns').
"The relevance? Mr Durban moved on to Sunderland, where he was responsible for the last time they went more games without scoring than currently.
"With Sunderland, the circus reference sometimes feels far too apt as well. But entertainment is way down the list of priorities for both teams.
"If United fail to win at the Stadium of Light then it really might be all about the Europa League.
"For Sunderland, it's long felt about a return to the English Football League they left a decade ago. A drawn out, sorry saga."

Sunderland manager David Moyes: "The players have been here before and we will keep going; it's still within our hands to stay up and we'll make sure that we do that.
"I think the boys have given a good go at it, so there's no faulting them and I think they've done everything they can.
"What I hadn't put down was a win against a Manchester United - or an Arsenal or Chelsea - in our remaining fixtures, so we now have to win at least one of those games."
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho: "It's good to know that we have a fantastic run of 20 unbeaten matches in the Premier League.
"In terms of looking to the future, I prefer to look at 10 matches with 10 draws, you have something that is not easy to have. You are quite solid mentally, difficult to beat, fighting
against difficult circumstances."
And Mourinho on Moyes: "I have sympathy with every manager that is fighting hard to reach their objectives.
"Some of us, we are sacked in the middle of the season. It's difficult for everyone, so of course I have sympathy."
Sunderland have not scored in any of their past six matches and I think they know the game is up. Another great escape is not going to happen now.
I am not expecting Manchester United to just brush the Black Cats aside, though.
Sunderland may well start with a defensive outlook, but they need to win and ultimately they will give United more room.
