[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough United have parted company with assistant manager Lee Glover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 46-year-old ex-Nottingham Forest and Rotherham forward joined manager Grant McCann's staff last June, but has left after just nine months.
Peterborough have won just four games in 2017 and are currently on a five-match winless run following their 1-1 with struggling Oldham on Saturday.
Posh are 12th in League One, eight points outside the play-off places with seven games remaining.
Glover told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "I had a chat with [director of football] Barry Fry and he decided it was probably best to terminate my contract. That was the decision taken at board level.
"Results have been poor and I think someone has carried the can for that."
