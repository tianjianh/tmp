[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Co-op Group has reported its first annual loss since 2013 after declaring that its stake in Co-operative Bank is worth nothing.

Co-op Group reported a pre-tax loss of £132m for 2016, a sharp deterioration on the previous year's profit of £23m.
It reduced the value of its 20% stake in Co-operative Bank from £185m to zero, reflecting the bank's continuing problems.
The group also said that its financing costs had risen by £74m in 2016.
The Co-op Bank, which has four million customers, put itself up for sale in February.
It almost collapsed in 2013, but was rescued by a group of US investors. Under that deal, Co-operative Group kept a 20% stake in the bank.
But the new owners have struggled to revive the bank's fortunes. Last year, it lost £477m - the fifth consecutive year of losses.
Co-op Group said it had made a "prudent valuation" of its stake in Co-operative Bank based on the "volatility" caused by the sale of the bank.
Co-op Group said that operating profits, which exclude the loss related to the bank stake, were up 32% in 2016 at £148m.
Those profits were boosted by the sale of its crematoria and a 3% rise in sales.
"We've made great progress in rebuilding our Co-op, with all our businesses delivering strong performances," said chief executive Steve Murrells.
He said that in 2017, the Co-op Group would look to expand outside of its current markets.
"We are exploring how we can enter markets that are not serving people well and challenging existing providers," he said.
