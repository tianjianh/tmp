Worcester Warriors have appointed Gary Gold as director of rugby until the end of the season, with Carl Hogg retaining his position as head coach.

Gold, 49, has Premiership coaching experience with London Irish, Newcastle and Bath, as well as at international level with his native South Africa.
He takes on the role with Warriors 11th in the Premiership table, just one point above bottom side Bristol.
"Gary is highly regarded," said Worcester chief executive Jim O'Toole.
"He is someone who has always taken clubs forward and managed to get the best out of players and staff.
"We believe that working with Carl Hogg and his coaching team, he will take us in the right direction for the rest of this campaign to achieve the obvious goal of improving our league position."
Gold inherited a similar situation at Newcastle Falcons in January 2012 when he took over from Alan Tait with the north-east side nine points adrift of safety in the Premiership.
Although the club were eventually relegated, they finished the campaign just one point behind Wasps above them by winning four of the final eight games.
Warriors have only won two of 13 league matches this season and were thumped 55-19 by local rivals Gloucester in their last Premiership fixture on 7 January.
"The opportunity to return to the Premiership to oversee such an exciting project is something which hugely appeals to me and I am looking forward to getting started," said Gold.
"There are nine Premiership games remaining this season. The hard work has already begun as we look to rise to the challenge and ensure the rest of the season is a success."
Gold's arrival brings to an end to former Wales international back-row forward Phil Davies's return to Hogg's Worcester backroom staff in a short-term coaching consultancy role.
Warriors have also confirmed that Edward Griffiths is working as a consultant for the club on a short-term review of the Sixways rugby operation.
Bill Bolsover has taken over as the club's new chairman, taking over from Anthony Glossop who, as planned, steps down on reaching his 75th birthday but will remain on the board.
