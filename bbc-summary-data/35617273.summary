A major fundraising push has been made to build a £4.8m children's emergency and trauma department at Southampton Children's Hospital.

At present, children have to use the adult A&E department while the paediatric unit is four floors above.
Chief executive Fiona Dalton said updating the department for younger patients was "essential".
The hospital foundation and charity, along with the Murray Parish Trust, will put £2.8m towards the project.
The trust was set up by Cutting It actors Jim Murray and Sarah Parish in memory of their late daughter Ella-Jayne, who was treated at the hospital but died of congenital heart failure.
Ms Dalton said: "This development is a crucial part of our strategy."
Dr Peter Wilson, a consultant in paediatric intensive care and director of the hospital, said: "For us to continue to provide exceptional paediatric services we need facilities that can meet future demand."
