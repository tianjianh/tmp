The 14-year-old was on his paper round on Cheetham Hill Road, Tameside at 18:45 GMT on Wednesday when he was attacked by two teenagers, police said.
The pair threw a substance, suspected to be petrol, over him before chasing him with a lighter in "an unprovoked attack".
Officers want to speak to a man the boy ran to for help.
The man, who was walking his dog near Chester Avenue, could have information which could help the investigation, police said.
The two boys are described as about 13 years old, white, of slim build, and about 5ft tall. One of them had dark hair.
Det Sgt Zoe Stapleton said: "Why anyone would want to scare an innocent child like this is beyond comprehension and it's particularly worrying that the culprits appear to be young boys themselves."
