The weekend-long event features a fun fair, stalls and musical performances on the Town Moor, and a parade through the city centre on Saturday.
Newcastle Cathedral is holding a Pride Eucharist - a special service of communion to celebrate diversity.
There will also be a candle-lit vigil to show support for those who have lost their lives - and those who keep fighting - for LGBT rights worldwide.
Mark Nichols, chair of Northern Pride which organises the event, said: "I hope it's raising the awareness of the community, that we are your neighbours, your work colleagues, part of your family.
"We are ordinary people; there's nothing different to us, and that's the message I want people to take away, and just want to be able to combat homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia."
In 2016 the festival attracted more than 73,000 visitors and contributed more than Â£10.4m to the economy, according to estimates.
The event was first staged in August 2007 after a brief gap in Pride activities following the closure of Pride on the Tyne.
