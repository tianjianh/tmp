[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicky Law fired the hosts in front after 21 minutes, drilling home from 10 yards after a Filipe Morais shot had been blocked by Abu Ogogo.
It was the midfielder's first goal since joining the Bantams from Rangers in the summer and the ninth game in a row when Shrewsbury have conceded first.
Morais went close to a second in Bradford's next attack but some last-ditch defending from Jack Grimmer managed to deflect the ball over the crossbar.
Bradford were not so effective after the break and Shrewsbury had a strong penalty shout for handball against defender Stephen Darby.
Goalkeeping coach Danny Coyne, in temporary charge of Shrewsbury following manager Micky Mellon's resignation to join Tranmere, saw his team threaten more as the game went on.
But substitute Haris Vuckic secured Bradford's win with a stoppage-time penalty after Antoni Sarcevic brought down Daniel Devine.
