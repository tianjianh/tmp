Derbyshire village recreated using Christmas cake

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A village has been recreated in edible form - using Christmas cake, icing and marzipan - to raise money towards restoring a church roof.

Villagers in Youlgrave in Derbyshire pitched in by donating ingredients then sharing out the 35 cakes to bake in their ovens.
Keen cake maker Lynn Nolan then cut, shaped and iced the incredibly detailed 16 buildings with skilled helpers.
Baking began back in June, and the icing alone took 387 hours.

Mrs Nolan, a retired florist, said: "I kept finding eggs in my little porch and little old ladies would come to the door with a packet of sugar and butter.
"We also got a mystery man phone up and say whatever the shortfall was he would provide it, because he owned a bakery."
The cakes are still edible because they have been soaked in whisky, which preserves them.
"I've eaten one after five years and it was fine," Mrs Nolan said.
The models are on display at All Saints Church in the village.
They will be auctioned on 15 December, and the money raised will go towards restoring the church roof.
Barbara Scrivener, from the church, said: "It is all very Christmassy and looks absolutely amazing with lights twinkling from the buildings and Christmas trees scattered around everywhere."
