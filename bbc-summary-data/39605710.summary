[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 2-2 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green confirmed their place in the National League play-offs, despite being held to a draw by Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers took the lead early on when Keanu Marsh-Brown changed the pace of a steady build-up, cut inside and shot clinically past Lee Worgan.
The hosts went 2-0 up five minutes short of the hour mark, but it was thanks to a large slice of luck as Dale Bennett's dangerous low cross was turned into his own net by a pressurised Kevin Lokko.
Maidstone emphasised their increased resilience of late by fighting back unexpectedly. Harry Phipps pulled one back on 61 minutes, despite determined attempts to block, and Joe Pigott then levelled with a close-range finish.
Dover's defeat to Torquay, though, means they cannot catch Forest Green for a top-five spot.
