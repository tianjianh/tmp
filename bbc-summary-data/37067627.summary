[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage came from behind to secure a win over local rivals Luton thanks to Matt Godden's winner in the sixth minute of injury time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cameron McGeehan's 15th-minute opener was the first noteworthy chance of the game, and only found its way to goal thanks to a heavy deflection that wrong-footed Stevenage goalkeeper Jamie Jones.
The home side did not trouble the Luton goal in the first half but Hatters duo Jake Gray and Danny Hylton both struck wide as half-time approached.
Stevenage found a way back into the game early in the second half as Godden found Connor Hunte unmarked at the back post and he headed calmly past Christian Walton.
Stephen O'Donnell then rifled the ball off the underside of the crossbar before McGeehan saw his subsequent shot blocked on the line, as the visitors looked for a way back into the match.
After hitting the bar, Luton watched on as Tom Pett broke away and played the ball to Godden who converted to give Boro their first ever home win against Luton.
