The Football Association of Zambia has relieved coach George Lwandamina of his duties and installed Wedson Nyirenda as interim coach.

Lwandamina had been doubling as coach for Zesco United, who are in the semi-finals of the Champions League.
FAZ said it released Lwandamina to "focus on the Champions league which is of equal importance to the country".
"We believe that he can win the Champions league and are in a great position to do so," FAZ added.
Nyirenda, who joins the team from Ferroviario de Beira in Mozambique, will step down to assistant coach once a permanent coach is employed.
"The change is immediate and we believe that Mr Nyirenda will add immense value to the national team, " FAZ general secretary Ponga Liwewe said.
Former Bafana Bafana coach Gordon Igesund is widely expected to be installed in the role permanently after impressing during job interviews last month.
Zambia's next assignment is the 9 October World Cup qualifying match against Nigeria. Both sides have failed to qualify for next year's Africa Cup of Nations.
