Tom Kettle: Tributes in London and Dublin to MP killed at Somme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tributes have been paid in London and Dublin to mark the centenary of the death of East Tyrone MP Tom Kettle who died at the Somme in 1916.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dubliner was a writer, poet, barrister, soldier and  politician.
From a staunchly nationalist background, he was a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party and served as MP for East Tyrone from 1906 to 1910.
Born in 1880  he was well-known for being a gifted speaker and a passionate advocate of Irish independence.
Known as Tom or Thomas, in 1914 he was in Belgium purchasing weapons for the Irish Volunteers and witnessed the German invasion of the country.
He returned home and helped to recruit thousands of young Irish nationalists into the British Army in defence of Catholic Belgium.
At the outbreak of the Great War he enlisted for service with the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and, serving as a lieutenant, he was killed at Ginchy on 9 September 1916.
To mark the centenary of his death, an act of remembrance was held at Westminster that was attended by MPs and representatives of the Irish government.
Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson laid a wreath at the memorial which commemorates the life of the Dublin-born politician.
The DUP MP said he was "honoured " to help host the event in London.
"Tom joined in common cause with the Ulster Volunteers at the Somme and his death symbolises the heavy loses suffered by the 16th Irish Division," he said.
"He is surely deserving of full recognition and remembrance by all of us."
Irish Ambassador to the UK Dan Mulhall also laid a wreath to mark Mr Kettle's life.
"In this decade of commemorations, Kettle's story gives an invaluable insight into the difficult choices that confronted the Irish men and women of that era," Mr Mulhall said.
"Reflecting on his hopes for reconciliation in Ireland and Europe, 100 years on from his death, resonates strongly."
The event in Westminster was also attended by Labour MP Vernon Coaker, the former Northern Ireland shadow secretary, and peers Lord Rogan and Lord Kilclooney.
Foyle MP Mark Durkan also took part in the commemoration at the Palace of Westminster.
An admirer of Mr Kettle, he said the poet and politician was "ahead of his time in seeing our issues in a wider European context".
Mr Durkan said Mr Kettle was "held in great esteem " and said had the 36-year-old  survived World War One he would have "made a major mark on Irish society".
In Dublin, Minister for Foreign Affairs Charlie Flanagan attended an event to mark Mr Kettle's life and death.
The ceremony was also attended by many members of the extended Kettle family.
Paying tribute to him, Mr Flanagan said: "His loss is a reminder of the tragedy of a generation from across Europe who were caught up in the slaughter of World War One."
Shortly before his death in  September 1916, Kettle wrote about Irish men who volunteered for military service in the British Army.
The poem entitled  "To My Daughter Betty, the Gift of God" contained the poignant lines that Irish men "Died not for flag, nor king, nor emperor. But for a dream, born in a herdsman's shed, And for the secret scripture of the poor".
Today those lines adorn the bottom of his memorial which sits at St Stephen's Green in tribute to a gifted politician, soldier and poet who many believe was ahead of his time.
