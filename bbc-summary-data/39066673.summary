The 30-year-old, who began his career at West Brom, has made four appearances for the National League side since arriving in January.
Gulls player-manager Kevin Nicholson says he is happy to prolong the ex-West Bromwich Albion full-back's stay.
"He has been an excellent influence on the lads and his experience has really helped us," he said.
Meanwhile, Torquay captain Courtney Richards could miss the rest of the season with a knee problem.
The 23-year-old midfielder will be out for up to eight weeks after suffering a medial collateral ligament injury in their draw with Barrow on Saturday.
