Dundee United: Gavin Gunning agrees Tannadice return deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United hope to complete the return of Gavin Gunning in time for the defender to play in Saturday's home game against St Johnstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old Irishman left Tannadice in 2014 to join Birmingham City in the English Championship.
But he was released in August after only one game for League One outfit Oldham Athletic.
Gunning has agreed a contract until the end of the season but is awaiting international clearance to play.
He spent three years with United after leaving Blackburn Rovers following a loan spell with Motherwell.
Gunning made 99 times for the Scottish Premiership club, but he has made only two first-team appearances since leaving Tayside, both in the Capital One Cup.
He played for Birmingham in a 3-1 win over Cambridge United in August 2014 and only featured once for Oldham - in a 3-1 home defeat by Middlesbrough a year later.
United manager Mixu Paatelainen has played down any suggestions that Alexia Eremenko will also be joining the club.
The 32-year-old playmaker, who ended his second spell with Kilmarnock last summer, has left Jaro after they were relegated from the Finnish top flight.
Meanwhile, United are still waiting to hear if Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima has been granted a work permit to join the club.
Paatelainen says this is proving to be frustrating for both parties.
