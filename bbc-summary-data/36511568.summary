[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alistair Brownlee produced a dominant display to win his first World Series race of the year and prove his unparalleled racing pedigree with the Olympics less than two months away.

With younger brother Jonny in second it was the result that the huge crowds in their home city of Leeds had wanted.
Reigning world champion Javier Gomez was well back in fourth.
Britain's Vicky Holland had earlier taken third in the women's race to underline her own medal chances in Rio.
Holland held off the challenge of her compatriot Jodie Stimpson as reigning world champion Gwen Jorgensen came past long-time race leader Flora Duffy on a storming run.
The brothers, Olympic gold and bronze medallists four summers ago, had been part of a small lead pack that also included Gomez as they exited the 1500m swim in Roundhay Park.
Alistair then accelerated away up the hill on to the bike course, with Jonny bridging across from the chase group to form a pack of four with France's Aurelien Raphael and Australian Aaron Royle.

Working together well round the tight, technical course the four had a two-minute lead coming off the bikes.
And Alistair then hit the front on the run, going out hard to build a 19-second lap after two of the four laps as Jonny pulled clear of Royle and Raphael.
Roared on by crowds four-deep around the city centre course, he had extended that to half a minute as he came back on to the blue carpet for the final time, and was able to high-five his way down the finishing straight as the grandstands in Millennium Square rose to him.
"I had a good day," Alistair told BBC Sport. "My form is nowhere near that good and I think I was carried around by the fact it was in Leeds.
"At the start of the run I would have put my money on Jonny. I was fortunate to have a good day.
"The crowd was just phenomenal - it can lift you and it did today."
Jonny added: "It was a tough day, but a great day and no-one is going to beat Alistair on that kind of day."
Duffy, World Series leader, held a lead of around 40 seconds in the women's race as she and the British pair of Lucy Hall and Jess Learmonth came out of the water.
That had stretched to a minute and a half coming off the bike in transition two, with Jorgensen, Holland and Stimpson in the second group and Britain's 2013 world champion Non Stanford a further 28 seconds back after a disappointing swim.
But Jorgensen, the strongest runner on the circuit, had cut Duffy's lead to just 38 seconds two laps into the 10km run and came storming through coming into the fourth and final lap.
Bermuda's Duffy, who retains her current lead in the rankings, hung on for second while Holland pulled away from Stimpson in the final 100 metres.

"Vicky was the better athlete on the day," said Stimpson.
"I'm still building at the minute and Vicky is as well. It is really exciting for GB going in to Rio. I think we're going to have a fantastic Olympics."
