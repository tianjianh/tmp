[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has pleaded guilty to assaulting and robbing a member of one of Scotland's richest families after hearing his victim give evidence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian Martin stole £200,000 of jewellery after holding a knife to the throat of Sarah Gloag, daughter of Ann Gloag, at her Perthshire home.
Martin, 58, interrupted proceedings at the High Court in Edinburgh to change his plea and apologise to Ms Gloag.
She and her husband Sundeep were tied up during the robbery in January.
The trial had heard how Ms Gloag was doing DIY work at the property when she noticed two men were at her front door.
She told advocate depute Paul Brown, prosecuting, that she opened the door and asked: "Can I help you? Are you lost?"
She said a man she identified in court as being Brian Martin produced a knife and forced his way inside the property with a second man.
Martin held a knife to her a throat and she was ordered her to get on the  ground.
She was tied up with tape and asked where her safe was.
The court heard that her husband took Martin upstairs and he eventually came back down with a supermarket bag.
Ms Gloag said that Martin then threatened to come back and stab her if she called the police.
She told the court: "He said 'don't press the panic alarms and don't use the phone. Give us 20 minutes and then you can call whoever you want."
Ms Gloag told the court that she and her husband were able to free themselves and that her mother Ann phoned the house about another matter.
Her husband answered the phone and told the businesswoman: "Ann - can I call you back. We've just been robbed."
Ann Gloag, one of Scotland's best known entrepreneurs, then contacted the police who arrived at the property within six minutes.
After hearing Ms Gloag's evidence, Martin - who was sitting in the dock a few feet away - shouted across an apology.
He said: "I'm sorry Mrs Gloag. Please accept my heartfelt apologies - you and your family shouldn't have to go through this."
Addressing temporary judge Paul Arthurson QC, Martin then said: "Your honour - I wish to change my plea from not guilty to guilty."
As she left court, Ms Gloag looked to Martin and said: 'Thank you.'
Martin pleaded guilty to assaulting Sundeep Salins, Sarah Gloag  while "face masked" and holding a knife,  detaining them against their will and robbing them of jewellery as well as £4,000 in cash.
He told the court he could not remember who his accomplice was.
Another man called Christopher McMultan, 40, denies all charges brought against him by prosecutors.  His trial is due to continue on Thursday.
Martin has also admitted assaulting and robbing David Gilfoyle and Joanne Miles  at a property in Muthill, Perthshire, in January.
