Police said they allowed Walkabout to reopen after imposing "strict measures" and "a set of agreed conditions", including close monitoring, regular reviews, better CCTV and changes to door security and management.
Ch Supt Shaun Morley, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "Following this serious incident, we worked quickly to enforce a 48-hour closure notice on this licensed premises, which was in effect from Sunday lunchtime."
