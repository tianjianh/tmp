They claimed the local authority had a "moral duty" to spend the money needed to retain Haulfre in Llangoed.
Anglesey council has started a consultation on its future, amid concern about the building's condition.
Residents at the meeting on Friday were told the council will make a final decision in October.
A report to councillors highlighted a detailed fire risk assessment, commissioned by the county council, which found a number of serious deficiencies within the building.
It is home to 18 residents.
Anglesey council's community director Gwen Carrington said: "It's acknowledged that there has been under-investment over the years.
"The overall assessment is that the current facilities are not suitable and that it will become more and more difficult to ensure safe care within the building.
"Our priority, first and foremost, must be to ensure safe and appropriate care of Haulfre's residents and the staff who look after them."
