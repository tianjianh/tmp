Joan Bartholomew, 89, was in Blackpool when burglars targeted her home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.
Police said items of jewellery, including rings and watches, were stolen some time between Thursday and Sunday.
The statue of Morecambe and Wise marks their first stage appearance together.
Mrs Bartholomew's son, Gary, who was also at the unveiling on Friday at Blackpool's Winter Gardens, told the Lancashire newspaper The Visitor that thieves may have been aware of his mother's trip via social media.
"They must have known she was away," he said.
"There wasn't masses of damage.  My mum is a very realistic person, she doesn't like to make herself into a victim. It's just the way it is."
Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise
The 8ft (2.4m) tall bronze statue was created by sculptor, Graham Ibbeson, who also made the statue of Eric in the comedian's hometown of Morecambe in 1999.
It cost Â£75,000 and was funded by donations.
Mr Ibbeson said: "I am delighted to have brought the boys back together so the nation can see them as they should be - Eric and Ernie alongside one another."
