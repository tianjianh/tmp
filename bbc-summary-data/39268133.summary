Commonwealth Games Wales chief executive Chris Jenkins says he is disappointed the 2022 Games will no longer be held in Durban, South Africa.

The Commonwealth Games Federation announced on Monday they were searching for a new host city as Durban did not meet criteria set by the organisation.
"It would have been great to have seen the Games go to South Africa," Jenkins told BBC Wales Sport.
"We were as excited to see the games was finally going to go to Africa."
He continued: "I think the ambition is still there to be honest. I've spent a lot of time with my colleagues in the African region over the last few days.
"Obviously they are disappointed but they still want to host the games in Africa and it's up to Wales and the Commonwealth Games federation and all the countries to pull together to make sure that one day this dream comes true not too far in the future."
The Welsh government decided not to bid for the 2026 Commonwealth Games in the summer of 2016 because of high cost and funding uncertainty due to Brexit.
Jenkins still hope Wales will host a future Games, however.
"I think there is still an appetite in the future to bid for the Games. We have an exciting bid which we would like to unveil at some point in the future," Jenkins said.
"We are excited long term with those plans. It was a regional model. It was different to the type of games we are going to see in the Gold Coast [in 2018].
"When the process for 2026 stopped we said we still want to be considered longer term. We have always made that very clear both within the Commonwealth family. We haven't gone away forever we've just gone away for a while."
