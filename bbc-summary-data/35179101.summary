Firefighters in London rescued a family's Christmas dinner after the oven caught fire while the turkey was roasting.

Crews were called to a kitchen blaze at a house in Edmonton, north London, at about 12:20 GMT on Christmas Day.
After making sure the fire was out, they took the family's dinner back to the station to finish cooking it.
Watch manager Adam Baker said the family had had a "lucky escape" because they had no working smoke alarm.
London Fire Brigade posted a picture of the family on its Twitter page: "It's a #Christmas miracle! Firefighters save #Edmonton family's Christmas after oven fire."
Mr Baker said: "The oven fire was already out when we arrived. The turkey had only been in the oven for an hour, we saw the table was laid out with all the crackers and asked: 'Do you know anyone else nearby or have any neighbours that could cook the turkey for you?' But they said no.
"We were cooking our turkey back at the station so we offered to take theirs and put it in our oven and told them they could come and collect it in a few hours."
It was vital that everyone had at least one working smoke alarm, he added.
The fire is believed to have been caused by lack of maintenance and a build-up of fat in the oven.
