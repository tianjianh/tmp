The Hatters have used 32 players in the league, four more than top three sides Northampton, Accrington and Oxford.
"It's been a disjointed season for so many of the squad that there hasn't been any continuity," said Jones.
"I could name (Championship leaders) Burnley's side on Saturday now. They have pros who are fit, strong, hungry, have desire and want to get out. That's what you need to be successful."
Talking to BBC Three Counties Radio, Jones continued: "Luton have been nowhere near that this season since I've come in. That has to change.
"There's no balance in the squad and what had started as a season with high hopes hasn't been because of that. There's too many in-between players, it's been a confused season, confused squad."
Jones has been in charge of Luton since January after replacing John Still at Kenilworth Road, and recently brought in former Portsmouth, QPR and Crystal Palace boss Paul Hart as his assistant manager.
And the Welshman is keen to make sure his first signings will be key players next season.
"I don't want to bring in players to improve our squad, I want them to improve our 11," Jones said.
"I would be surprised if the first four we bring in aren't starters for us. We want to get the level of quality here that we believe will do well for Luton Town, then we'll look to improve constantly."
