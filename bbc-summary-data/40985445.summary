The International Ski Federation had said Wallace was in a light coma but stable after being flown to a hospital in Zurich by helicopter on Thursday.
British Ski and Snowboard said the 22-year-old will be moved from intensive care to a recovery ward on Saturday.
It added: "He is doing well and is able to talk."
The crash reportedly happened when the world junior bronze medallist fell on a run-up while at a training camp in Mettmenstetten.
Wallace trains full-time with the Swiss aerial skiing team and has been using a crowd-funding site to help his bid to reach next year's Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea.
