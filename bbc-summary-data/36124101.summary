Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs was critical of the Cappielow pitch and the officials after his side drew 0-0 with Greenock Morton.

Jason Cummings had the ball in the net but was deemed to be offside as Hibs missed a chance to narrow the gap with second-top Falkirk in the Championship.
"It wasn't a great surface to try and play football on," Stubbs said.
"The players were really worrying too much about the bobbles rather than trusting their technique. "
Despite his side's struggles, Stubbs took heart from a point which keeps them within three points of Falkirk with a game in hand, though with an inferior goal difference.
"We wanted three points, but the positives are we got a clean sheet, and Mark Oxley has made a save that has gone on to the post.
"Jason's 'goal' looked onside but we will have to wait and see. The officials didn't get a lot of things right today to be honest."
Hibs conclude their league campaign with two home games - against Dumbarton on Tuesday, and Queen of the South next Sunday - before tackling the promotion play-offs. Falkirk finish with a home game against Morton.
"We have got a really exciting end to the season," Stubbs noted.
"We have been to a final, we are in the Scottish Cup Final and we still have a chance of promotion. How could I not be full of hope? I am surprised how people think sometimes it is doom and gloom.
"We have still got an unbelievable end of the season to play for so I am full of optimism. I am excited by it, and let's see what happens for the next three or four weeks."
Morton beaten Hibs 3-0 at Easter Road in their last meeting, but manager Jim Duffy was satisfied with a point - although they might have taken all three, but Bobby Barr's strike came back off the post.
"If that goes in there is every likelihood we could have picked up the three points, but a point against a side of Hibs' qualities is not a bad result for us," Duffy said.
"If I look over the season, mid-table is where we at least deserve to be. But all credit to the top four clubs, they deserve to be the top four. They have been the most consistent."
