Plymouth Argyle boss Derek Adams says the club's defeat at rivals Exeter City was the worst of his managerial career.

The Pilgrims were beaten 2-1 at St James Park, despite taking the lead and dominating for large parts of the game.
"Last Saturday was the hardest defeat that I've taken in my managerial career," he told BBC Radio Devon.
"To play in such a way and not be under any trouble and then one shot on target goes into the back of the net, that was hard to take."
The loss saw Argyle slip back out of League Two's automatic promotion places, but Adams says his side are still good enough to finish second or third, with leaders Northampton Town 16 points clear of the Pilgrims.
"We've put ourselves in a fantastic position," added the former Ross County manager, who took over at Home Park last summer.
"With six games to go we've got an opportunity of two automatic promotion places and that's the position we wanted to be in at the end of the season - in touching distance of that and we've been able to do it.
"We know how tough a league it is and squad-wise we're shorter than anybody else, and I think that we all knew that at stages in the season it would catch up on us.
"Performance-wise we've really done well recently, obviously against Exeter on Saturday we didn't get the rewards that we felt we deserved."
