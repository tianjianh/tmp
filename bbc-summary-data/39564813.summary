Mobile theatre cuts cataract operation waiting times

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mobile operating theatre has cut the waiting list for cataract surgery in west Wales by almost a quarter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Almost 850 patients have received eye surgery at the unit which has been temporarily located at Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest.
Hywel Dda University Health Board has described it as an "incredible success".
The unit's stay has now been extended throughout April to complete an additional 175 operations.
Prior to the start of operations, there were more than 1,500 people who had waited over 36 weeks for cataract surgery. This figure has been reduced to 350.
Joe Teape, Hywel Dda's director of operations and deputy chief executive, said: "This has been an incredible success that has made a real difference to people with cataracts."
He said patient feedback had been "very positive" and post operative checks "have all demonstrated an improvement in the patients' sight".
