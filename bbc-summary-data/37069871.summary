County Championship: Lancashire teenager Haseeb Hameed hits Roses match century

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire's teenage opener Haseeb Hameed made his first Roses match century to put his side on top at Old Trafford before Yorkshire battled back in the day's final session.

Hameed's third County Championship ton of 2016, backed by Luke Procter's 79, had the hosts in control at 238-1.
But six Lancashire wickets then went down in the evening session for 61.
Jack Brooks (3-51) was backed by Ryan Sidebottom (2-46) and Tim Bresnan as the Tykes hauled Lancs back to 299-7.
At the age of just 19, Hameed has gone past 50 nine times in 19 innings in his first full season - and is now Lancashire's leading Championship run scorer in 2016 with 930.
After Steven Croft had won an important toss, Hameed shared 86 for the first wicket with Tom Smith, whose 46 was ended just after lunch when trapped leg before by Sidebottom.
He then shared a stand of 152 in 39 overs for the second wicket with Procter, before the left-hander was caught behind by Bresnan (2-58) to become the first victim of the post-tea collapse.
Early season leaders Lancashire are now sixth, having begun the day chasing a first win in seven Championship matches, yet still in outside title contention.
They are 31 points behind leaders Middlesex and nine behind third-placed Yorkshire, but they are also only 33 points clear of bottom club Hampshire.
Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale:
"Lancashire played really well for the first two sessions. Hameed is one of the best young players I've seen in a long time. He's an old-fashioned opening batter who occupies the crease and didn't get out of his shell all day. He just played beautifully.
"What we did well was control the rate all day, and we felt if we could get a wicket after tea and then pick up a few more with the new ball, we'd have had a good day.
"We'd have definitely settled for that after them winning the toss. We spoke about them being four or five down when we sat down at tea, so to have them seven down is great. Typically Brooksy to come on and get a few in a cluster. That's how he does it."
Lancashire opener Haseeb Hameed:
"Ideally we'd have been three or four down at the end of the day, but it goes to show that it can happen quickly on that wicket.
"If we can build on this and get close to 400, every run is going to be vital. The wicket seems to be getting drier and the cracks wider. We were looking at 500 at one point, but now closer to 400. I'm really confident that the wicket's going to be difficult to bat on last.
"It was frustrating for me not getting three figures last week against Hampshire, so  to get one in front of my home crowd was really good. It was a special moment to get there."
