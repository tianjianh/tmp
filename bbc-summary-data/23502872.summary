[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first Scottish council to install life-saving defibrillators in its high schools is extending the scheme to its sports centres and swimming pools.

North Lanarkshire Council said the move would help save lives at the venues.
Defibrillators deliver an electric shock to the heart in cases of cardiac arrest - when the heart stops pumping blood around the body.
Survival chances of those affected by cardiac arrest decrease by 10% for every minute without defibrillation.
North Lanarkshire Council said automatic electronic defibrillators (AEDs) would be installed at Airdrie Leisure Centre, John Smith Pool in Airdrie, Aquatec in Motherwell, Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld and the Iain Nicholson Centre in Chryston.
Other venues include the Time Capsule in Coatbridge, Kilsyth pool, Ravenscraig Sports facility, Sir Matt Busby Centre in Bellshill, Tryst Sports Centre in Cumbernauld, Shotts Leisure Centre and Wishaw Sports Centre.
All 24 secondary schools in the area are due to be fitted with the devices before the end of March 2014.
Blane Dodds, chief executive of North Lanarkshire Leisure, said: "Emergency situations are time critical and this equipment will help save lives.
"We are grateful to NHS Lanarkshire for donating these devices and with millions of visitors each year to our centres it is reassuring to know that staff are well trained and AEDs are available."
