[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A federal judge in Alabama has declared a mistrial in the case of a police officer accused of assaulting an Indian man who had recently moved to the US.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prosecutors said police officer Eric Sloan Parker seriously injured 58-year-old Sureshbhai Patel as he walked near his son's home in February.
Mr Patel's arrest, which was filmed, drew international attention.
The governor of Alabama issued an apology to the government of India for the incident
Jurors on Friday could not reach an unanimous decision in the case, which forced a mistrial.
US District Judge Madeline Hughes Haikala repeatedly urged jurors to come to an agreement, but the panel remained deadlocked.
Prosecutor Robert Posey said Mr Parker would be tried again.
Mr Parker, 26, was charged with violating Mr Patel's civil rights. He also faces state assault charges.
Defence lawyer Robert Tuten called the arrest an unfortunate escalation, but said it was not a criminal offense.
Mr Patel was walking outside his son's home on 6 February in an Alabama suburb when police said they received a call from a neighbour about a suspicious person.
Footage from police cameras showed Mr Patel - who speaks no English - trying to walk away when the officers approached him. They detained him and eventually shoved him to the ground.
The arrest left Mr Patel - a grandfather - partially paralysed.
