The 19-year-old had been on a night out in the town when she flagged down what she believed was a taxi.
The driver of the silver, four-door saloon car took her to the Tesco car park at Cuckoo Bridge where she was assaulted.
Police are reviewing CCTV images from surrounding areas.
The suspect has been described as Asian, in his late 20s to early 30s, of medium height and build.
He was wearing a dark coloured T-shirt and denim jeans.  He did not have a local accent.
Additional patrols are being carried out in the area to "offer reassurance to the local community".
Det Insp Fiona Bell said: "I am appealing to anyone who has any information regarding this crime, in particular anyone who may have noticed the car.
"If you think you may have seen it during the evening or have any knowledge of the crime, then please do get in touch with us.
"A small piece of information could aid the investigation and lead officers to tracing the man responsible for this attack."
