Wales wing Hallam Amos says he had the comeback he wanted after scoring a try on Saturday with his first touch of his first game of the season for Dragons.

Amos, 21, who injured his shoulder as Wales beat England in the World Cup in October, helped Dragons beat Castres.
It is now possible he could regain his national squad place as Warren Gatland names his Six Nations squad on Tuesday.
Amos told BBC Wales Sport: "I've come back at a good time. There are exciting matches coming in the next few weeks."
His try after just 50 seconds against Castres sent Dragons on their way to a 31-18 win in European Challenge Cup Pool Two.
Medical student Amos, who has five international caps, will be up against Northampton's George North and Cardiff Blues' Alex Cuthbert for a Six Nations place, with Eli Walker of the Ospreys and Blues' Tom James also in contention for the squad.
Asked about a possible selection for Wales, Amos said: "I'm not sure, it's a tough one because I'm only just back from injury and there are other boys playing really well at the moment.
"I haven't thought too much (about it), I just wanted to get back on the pitch with the Dragons, and whatever happens, happens.
"I was always aiming for this kind of time to be back, and I'm back a couple of weeks ahead of (the original) schedule which is good."
Amos could hardly believe he had the chance to run in a try with his first touch on his return.
"You think about it the night before and that's exactly what you want," he continued. "(It was) a great break by Sarel (Pretorius) and a lovely ball by Jason Tovey.
"In rugby you will pick up injuries, though it's been tough watching the boys.
"But I can't ask for much more than that with my first touch back after three months."
Amos will now be part of the Dragons squad aiming to ensure a home quarter-final in the Challenge Cup with victory away to Sale Sharks on Thursday.
