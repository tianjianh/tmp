They also won best live and biggest fans but the boys weren't there to pick up their prizes.
As well as performing, Ariana Grande picked up her first EMA's for best female and best song for Problem.
She thanked her fans and MTV for introducing her to Iggy Azelea who features on the award winning track.
"Last year I was presenting with Iggy (Azealia) and that was the night that I met her," she explained.
"And I feel like, I kind of owe it to the EMAs kind of, because, last year that's where I met and totally, like, fell in love with Iggy."
The night really belonged to Nicki Minaj, who hosted the awards which were held in Glasgow.
She had numerous outfit changes and showered the crowd with her own currency - Minajes - with people at the front of the stage getting a free drink when the notes were chucked their way.
Minaj told the crowd she "was pretty much Scottish now" before doing a "dope new rap" about the country.
The rapper also performed a medley of Superbass, Anaconda plus a new track Bed of Lies which featured Skylar Gray.
"I wouldn't trade this experience for the world, like, it was so amazing," she said after the show.
"The crowd was on fire all night. I didn't expect the crowd to be that much of an intricate part of, you know, what I was doing.
"But they kept me, they gave me energy, they made me feel great. I just, I can't believe it's done.
"I will remember coming down from all the way up in the air, with that long flowy grey dress, in that harness, that hurt like all hell. But it was all worth it, because when I went on Instagram I saw the pictures and I loved it."
Beyonce didn't appear, despite being widely rumoured, and Calvin Harris had to pull out of opening the show after having a heart scare.
Scottish musicians were out in force to celebrate MTV coming to Glasgow.
Emeli Sande made a rare appearance to present best female to Ariana Grande with Alicia Keys.
Amy Macdonald, Prides and Biffy Clyro were also there.
Simon Neil from Biffy Clyro performed with Slash to pay tribute to Ozzy Osbourne who was named Global Icon.
"I'm in shock, I don't know where they got that from," he told Newsbeat on the red carpet before he accepted his award.
"Sharon told me about it around three months ago and I said what does that mean?
"I mean, there's an award every week for somebody, I don't really know what to say."
Other winners included 5 Seconds of Summer who picked up two including Best New Act, Justin Bieber, who thanked MTV via a video clip for his best male award, while Linkin Park won in the rock category.
Katy Perry collected two including best look, she wasn't there this year but recorded a message in which she thanked her mum and dad for her "look."
BeyoncÃ© won best song with a message for Pretty Hurts but didn't leave a message for the fans who'd voted for her.
