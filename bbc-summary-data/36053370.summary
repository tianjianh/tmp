The Swansea-based region said it wanted to show support for workers at Tata plants in nearby Port Talbot and Llanelli, which are facing closure.
A Save our Steel banner was carried before the Guinness Pro12 game against Benetton Treviso.
The Ospreys said it was also talking to unions about how else it could help.
"Any closure would impact directly on countless Ospreys supporters, players and staff, including many of those who will be at the Liberty this Friday night," the region said in a statement.
"At times like this it is vital that a community-focused, high-profile organisation such as ours stands up for our local economy and makes a stand - backing calls for a solution to save the industry from closure."
Steelworkers also paraded the banner ahead Swansea City's football match against Chelsea last Saturday.
The show of support comes as efforts are being made to save thousands of jobs at Tata's Port Talbot steel plant.
