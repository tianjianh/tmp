City of Edinburgh Council signed the 10-year contract to deliver wifi coverage and improve mobile phone reception in March.
The service, provided by intechnologyWiFi, will offer blanket coverage in the city centre rather than the traditional hotspot model.
The network has been made live ahead of festive celebrations that are expected to attract almost one million people.
A map of coverage offered by the EdiFreeWiFi service has been published by the council.
The council said the network was central to the council's plans for growing Edinburgh's economy, as well as encouraging residents and visitors to stay longer and spend more in the city centre.
Councillor Frank Ross, digital champion, said: "It is great news as everyone will be able to get free outdoor access to the latest information on their favourite apps and websites while they are out and about over the festive season and beyond.
"It is also really important that we are providing this kind of quality service to the millions of residents and visitors who enjoy our city each year to ensure they have access to all the information they need."
