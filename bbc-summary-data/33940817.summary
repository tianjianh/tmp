Tilly Confectionery, which is based in Larbert, near Falkirk, will use the funds provided by HSBC to launch a new export drive and buy new production equipment.
Tilly said the move was in response to increasing demand for its products.
The firm produces the Mrs Tilly's range of Scottish tablet, fudge and macaroon.
It aims to increase its footprint in Canada immediately, following "significant" export growth to a number of European markets, including France, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland and Poland.
In March, Tilly announced it had secured a contract to launch a range of fudge products across the French market.
Blair Paterson, managing director of Mrs Tilly's Confectionery, said: "My parents founded the business in the family kitchen in 1997 and have worked extremely hard to make it the success it has become today.
"We have ambitions to grow the business and take Mrs Tilly's fudge and tablet to an even wider international audience."
In 2014, Mrs Tilly's sold more than two million bars of tablet and fudge and developed their international sales to about 3% of turnover.
This figure is expected to rise to 10% by the end of 2016, with turnover projected to grow to £5m within the next five years.
The company currently employs 33 people.
