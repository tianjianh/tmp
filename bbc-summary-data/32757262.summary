Cannes 2015: Teenage tales of the red carpet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British actress Bebe Cave had to get special permission to attend the Cannes Film Festival from her school. She walked the red carpet on Thursday - and hours later sat her A-Level English exam in Nice. She describes the experience.

"It was very surreal, I was walking with Vincent Cassel and he was like, 'This is like a Fellini movie!'"
Not your average conversation starter from a teenager who is currently sitting her A-levels, but then it has not really been an average summer for 17-year-old Bebe Cave, who is in Cannes to promote Tale of Tales, the new film from celebrated Italian director Matteo Garrone.
The film, which is in competition for this year's Palme d'Or, premiered at the huge Grand Theatre Lumiere on Thursday night, the first time that Cave has attended such an event.
"It was completely silent, with these flicking and flashing lights and twinkling music as we paraded up this scarlet promenade," she recalls. "It felt like we were little fairies walking up these stairs and I kept expecting some kind of monster coming out to get us.
"It was like a scene from our film."
The movie, which tells three interlinked stories set in neighbouring kingdoms, introduces us to a world of monsters, ogres and witches.
In Cave's story, she is a young naive princess who daydreams of the time she will leave her father, played by Toby Jones, and see the world outside her castle.
But the dream turns sour when she is betrothed to an ogre.
"By the end of the film she realises that freedom is not something that you just have to run away to get, it's something that's inside you and you have to fight for. She's certainly much tougher than I am. I aspire to be like Violet, I have to say."
The film is director Garrone's first in the English language. He is still best know for his Italian gangster film Gomorrah. But for this project he assembled an international cast which included Salma Hayek, John C Reilly, Stacey Martin and Shirley Henderson.
Reviews have mostly been positive, although some eyebrows were raised at his decision to shoot in English, particularly as the film is based on the writings of 17th Century Italian writer Giambattista Basile.
"Matteo has a very relaxed feel to him," says Cave. "[At the premiere] he just seemed to be happy. Just to see him so happy was all I wanted. I respect him so much and he gave me such a great opportunity.
"I loved the film, I thought it was so beautiful, he's a painter and I though that every shot was like a painting."
Cave, who has appeared in a TV adaptation of Great Expectations, admits she wasn't quite prepared when she arrived on set in Italy, particularly given Garrone's loose directing style.
"We improvised a lot and that was scary at first because I did not prepare for that.
"I thought, 'I'm going to Italy to play a princess and that's fine'. And we got there they were like, 'the scene is in this room but it might be cool if we shoot it here' and 'what do you think that she would say at this point?'
"But after a couple of days of that, I saw he wanted me to take a bit of creative control."
Although the film is clearly set in a world of fantasy, the problems and the flaws of the characters are all very real. And for those expecting fairytale endings... Well, they may end up a little disappointed.
"We're all very used to the happy ending but it didn't feel like there was a happy ending coming for my character," says Cave.
"I was caked in dirt and wincing with pain from climbing up mountains and being thrown around a cave but that's what the magical element was for me."
The film also turned into something of a family affair for Cave as her older sister Jessie, an actress and stand-up comic - who Harry Potter fans will recognise as Lavender Brown - joined her for a few days, playing a small role.
"It was a fleeting visit towards the end of my filming in the summer. She was in a different  tale to me but I thought it was really lovely."
"The fact that we had Jessie on set for a few days was great because by that point they [the crew] were my Italian family. I was their bambina and they all loved her, and they kept talking about how nice her hair was. Slightly nicer than mine, which was quite annoying!"
Tale of Tales is in competition for the Palmde d'Or, which will be announced on 24 May.
