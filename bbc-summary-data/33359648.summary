Operation Exposure: Lawyers to take PSNI teen photo case to Europe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lawyers for a Londonderry teenager, who lost a Supreme Court battle over a picture of him being published as part of an investigation into rioting, are to take the case to Europe.

The 18-year-old, who was 14 at the time, was involved in rioting in the city in July 2010.
CCTV images of him rioting were later published in two newspapers.
They were published as part of a police campaign called Operation Exposure.
The teenager's family complained that the publication of the images breached his rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.
The legal firm representing the teenager have said they will now try to challenge the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Solicitor Barbara Muldoon told BBC Radio Foyle: "The Supreme Court got it wrong.
"Featuring these pictures in newspapers was a breach of human rights.
"Different standards and different tests should apply in the case of children. They are not the same as adults.
"Children don't make reasoned decisions. We have to remember that some of the photographs featured children as young as eight. Some of the children were bystanders.
"It was established that this 14-year-old threw two stones.
"Rioting seems to be the word used as matters progressed. It was originally described as disorder.
"We don't accept that human rights were taken into consideration."
PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said: "We welcome the decision by the Supreme Court to dismiss this appeal.
"The judgement confirms our decision to release the images was properly considered and justified given the significant level of violence that was happening in the area on an almost nightly basis and was in no way excessive given the circumstances.
"Extensive checks and balances are always put in place to ensure that all images we release are appropriate and proportionate.
"At all stages of the process we seek and fully take on board human rights legal advice and the final decision is authorised by a senior ranking police officer.
"At the core of this operation was the need to protect those living in those interface areas and prevent young people from becoming drawn further into a world of violence and criminality.
"As a police service we need to take positive action to protect communities, particularly those who are vulnerable."
Following the release of the images in July 2010 there has been an 85% reduction in interface violence.
