Peter Moody: Black Caviar trainer cleared of deliberate doping

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trainer of retired sprinter Black Caviar has been cleared of deliberately administering illegal levels of the drug cobalt to a horse.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leading Australian trainer Peter Moody had been facing a three-year disqualification if found guilty.
He was found guilty of two lesser charges by a disciplinary board, relating to the non-intentional administration of cobalt to a horse.
The penalty for those offences will be decided at a later date.
The Moody-trained Lidari tested positive for cobalt following a race in Melbourne in October 2014.
But a Racing Appeals and Disciplinary Board decided the drug was not administered deliberately.
Cobalt is said to have similar effects in horses to the blood-boosting hormone EPO in athletes.
Black Caviar retired in 2013 as the top-rated racehorse in the world, having amassed 15 Group One victories.
