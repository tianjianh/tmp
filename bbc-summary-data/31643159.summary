Ex-Japan PM's and anti-Wylfa campaigners at Anglesey visit

Anti-nuclear campaigners have met the former Prime Minister of Japan to fight plans for the Â£8bn Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant on Anglesey.

Naoto Kan resigned after Fukushima was hit by a tsunami in 2011, causing radiation leaks.
He has since become an anti-nuclear campaigner and came to Wales on Thursday to oppose the new plant.
He told BBC Wales he had believed nuclear power to be safe but Fukushima had "changed all that."
Mr Kan met with campaigners from the People Against Wylfa B group.
Dr John Idris Jones, energy island programme director for Anglesey council, told BBC's Good Morning Wales programme the UK had an independent regulator with the power to shut plants down if they did not comply with safety regulations.
He said there was a push to bring new jobs to the island, but "not jobs at any cost".
It is hoped the nuclear project will boost the island's economy.
