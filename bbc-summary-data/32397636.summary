One bay on another ward at the site near Melrose has also been closed to admissions.
NHS Borders said the situation was being managed by its infection prevention and control team.
Visiting the department has been "strongly discouraged" and anyone who has had symptoms of the virus in the past 48 hours should stay away.
Dr Tim Patterson, consultant in public health medicine, said: "Norovirus is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea and vomiting illness.
"It is very infectious, spreads quickly between people and can start abruptly and spread quickly through communities.
"It is vital to protect yourselves and your loved ones from catching this unpleasant virus.
"Patients, visitors and staff can help minimise the spread by complying with instructions given by staff and paying attention to the signs at the entrances to the hospital and wards."
