Bradley Dos Reis Pais Quaresma died after a fight broke out between a large group of men in Stratford Park in West Ham Lane on 21 July 2016.
Mario Albino Te, 21, of no fixed address, was found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey and jailed for 11 years and six months.
He had been charged with murder but was found not guilty.
The court heard young children were in the park enjoying the afternoon sun when the attack occurred.
Mr Quaresma, a Portuguese national who had been in contact with Te in the days leading up to the killing, was stabbed in the neck and chest and died at the scene.
The next morning Te boarded a train at St Pancras International Station but was detained by French police when he arrived in Paris and returned to the UK.
Mr Quaresma's family have paid tribute to the 20 year old, calling him "an adorable, charismatic, understanding and true companion".
"Not a day goes by that Bradley is not remembered for his infectious smile, his love for his family and his good heart", they said.
