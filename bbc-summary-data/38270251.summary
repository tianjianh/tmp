Calais child migrants: More than 750 brought to UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 750 children have been brought to the UK from the Calais migrant camp, the government has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A scheme to move unaccompanied children from the so-called Jungle was launched in October after criticism of the government's efforts to provide refuge.
Many have been reunited with family members already in the UK, Immigration minister Robert Goodwill said.
He also insisted the transfers had not ended and more children would arrive from Europe "in the coming months".
Children who have family links have been admitted to the UK under the Dublin regulation - which requires evidence that they have relatives who can care for them.
Others, without family ties, have arrived under the "Dubs amendment" rules which allow particularly vulnerable children - such as girls and those under 13 - refuge in the UK.
The Home Office said the transfers were being carried out as part of a planned process in conjunction with French authorities and all the children taken from the camp to children centres in France had been interviewed by UK officials.
A total number of those brought to the UK as a result of the operation is expected to be published once all the transfers are concluded.
Mr Goodwill said: "We have been working with the French authorities to bring children eligible to come here under the Dublin Regulation or the Immigration Act since the clearance of the Calais camp in October.
"More than 750 children have arrived so far. Many have been reunited with family members already in the UK, while others are being cared for by local authorities across the UK.
"The remaining children are safe and in the care of the French authorities."
He added: "The Dubs process has not ended. More eligible children will be transferred from Europe, in line with the terms of the Immigration Act, in the coming months and we will continue to meet our obligations under the Dublin Regulation."
The charity Unicef, and the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams were among those who previously accused the government of "foot-dragging" over the transfer of migrant children.
There was also controversy when the young people started to arrive in the UK from Calais, with Monmouth MP David Davies suggesting that some looked older than 18.
