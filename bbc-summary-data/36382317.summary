'UK's first' alpine coaster gets go-ahead in Snowdonia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK's first alpine coaster is to be built in Snowdonia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The national park authority has granted planning permission for the 0.6-mile (1km) elevated toboggan ride.
The attraction is being planned by the Zipworld group, which runs Europe's longest zipline above Bethesda's Penrhyn quarry.
The Â£1.5million project would be based at Zip World Fforest, between Betws-y-Coed and Llanrwst, and could create more than 20 jobs.
Alpine coasters are normally located in ski resorts to provide an income during the summer - the world's longest is in the resort of Hoch-Imst, Austria.
The company behind the scheme said this one would be the first of its kind in the UK.
