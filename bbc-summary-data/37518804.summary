In a Facebook video, which includes footage of the woman running across the tracks with the child, Chief Inspector Jon Burrows said: "Getting hit by a train is certain death and people just don't get it."
The footage was being posted as a "wake-up call", he added.
The PSNI wrote on Facebook: "If anyone recognises the female in this footage, please give us a call.
"Her life and the child's life were put at risk."
