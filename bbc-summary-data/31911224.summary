Scale of River Tweed salmon catch fall revealed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fall of more than 50% has been reported in the number of salmon caught on the River Tweed last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Figures disclosed in the River Tweed Commissioner's annual report show the total number of salmon caught by rod and net in 2014 was 9,971.
It is a drop of more than 10,000 compared with the 2013 total of 20,316.
It has been attributed to the mildest winter on record coupled with a hot summer and lengthy dry spell.
However, the report maintained there was "plenty to be positive about" on the river.
It said the fact the fishery was "properly protected, monitored and understood" could provide a "platform to bounce back from a period of relative famine".
