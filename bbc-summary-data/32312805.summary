[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is still not certain when the Scottish Premiership's final round of five fixtures will be announced.

But league bosses insist they are confident that the 12 clubs will know their end-of-season games by the end of Wednesday.
An announcement by the Scottish Professional Football League has been delayed by discussions with broadcasters and police.
The Premiership splits into two sections of six for the final games.
And the SPFL had hoped to have released the fixtures soon after weekend results confirmed which clubs would be in the top and bottom halves of the table.
The SPFL says it has a finalised list of fixtures ready to publish but is still waiting for final approval from all the agencies involved.
A league spokesperson told BBC Scotland that it is "confident" and "hopeful" the fixtures will be made public on Wednesday but could not absolutely guarantee it.
The first round of post-split matches will be on the weekend of Saturday, 25 April, with the final round of matches on the weekend of 23/24 May.
Holders Celtic lead the Premiership by five points from Aberdeen and have a game in hand.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Dundee United, St Johnstone and Dundee will chase a Europa League qualifying spot.
St Mirren, who are guaranteed to finish in the bottom two, and Motherwell will battle it out to avoid the one automatic relegation spot.
Ross County, Kilmarnock, Partick Thistle and Hamilton Academical will also compete in the bottom six.
A relegation play-off tie against a Championship side awaits the team finishing second bottom.
