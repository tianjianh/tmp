Sheku Bayoh death: Lord Advocate promises 'thorough' investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's most senior law officer has promised a "thorough, impartial and objective" investigation into the death of Sheku Bayoh.

Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland also told MSPs that a fatal accident inquiry would be held into the death.
Mr Bayoh, 31, died in police custody after being detained following an incident in Kirkcaldy on 3 May.
His family welcomed the comments and said they hoped the Lord Advocate would establish "the truth of what happened".
Mr Mullholland told MSPs that further work was needed by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc), particularly into the cause of death, before the investigation was completed.
"Having met the family on two occasions, I know the effect that this tragedy has had on them and they have borne their loss with great dignity," he said.
"They are right to demand answers and a thorough, impartial and objective investigation is what they deserve."
Mr Mulholland said he was confident this could be done "expeditiously without compromising thoroughness".
He added that regardless of the decision on criminal proceedings, a fatal accident inquiry would be held because Mr Bayoh had died in custody.
"A fatal accident inquiry will allow all the evidence to be presented in a court, open to the public and the media, to be rigorously tested by all parties represented at the FAI, including the family, and allow the sheriff to make findings in fact and recommendations in relation to Sheku's death in a judgement that will be available to all," he said.
Aamer Anwar, the solicitor for Mr Bayoh's family, said: "The family have always known that there would be an FAI but they do not believe at this stage that this is a solution to the death in custody of Sheku Bayoh.
"An FAI is, in essence, the bare minimum of what can happen, but at this stage it would be premature to predict the outcome of the investigations if they are truly robust and impartial.
"It has been 19 weeks since Sheku's death and the family hope the Lord Advocate can provide them with the truth of what happened, because without that they know there can be no justice."
