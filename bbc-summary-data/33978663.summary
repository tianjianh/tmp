Brides-to-be have been left out of pocket after a West Midlands wedding company collapsed.

Bake A Cake Catering, in Halesowen, ceased trading on Monday and cannot fulfil or refund orders.
Kirsty Robinson says she may be forced to cancel her wedding next Saturday if she cannot find cake and flowers.
Owner Lisa Holt, 39, said she was forced to shut up shop after her equipment and paperwork were stolen during a burglary.
Miss Robinson, who lives four doors away from Bake a Cake in Albert Road, paid Â£800 for finishing touches including a cake, flowers, chair covers and table cloths.
And Rachel Hodson, 27, of Wednesfield, said she is now "frantically rearranging" plans in time for her ceremony on 12 September.
The customer service advisor, who is marrying her partner of three years in Walsall, said: "We had our dream wedding all booked and paid for way in advance. Now we've got to start again."
Miss Holt told the BBC she had reported a "hate campaign" to West Midlands Police.
She said: "My whole house had been ransacked. All the business paperwork... the equipment I owned had been taken. So I had to outsource everything.
"I was frightened to stay there. When I went back to check on the place on Friday, I found they had set fire to my back door.
"I can't keep afloat anymore and I've had to cease trading.
"I haven't filed for bankruptcy because I want to pay all these people back.
"I know they are victims of my circumstances but they need to see I'm a victim too. I am sincerely sorry."
A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: "We are investigating a burglary and an arson at Albert Street, Halesowen.
"Enquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made."
