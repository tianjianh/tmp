Two men entered the house on Cavehill Road at about 21:00 GMT on Sunday.
One of the men, who was wearing a Halloween mask, bound her hands with cable ties while the other searched the house.
After they made off with money, the woman was able to raise the alarm.
Appealing for information, Det Sgt Andrew Madden said police believed the burglars may have been accompanied by a third man.
"The first suspect is described as around 5ft 8in tall of stocky build," he said.
"He was wearing a dark green hoodie, grey tracksuit bottoms and a Halloween mask.
"The second is described as taller than the first and thin. He was wearing a black-coloured bomber jacket and had a scarf over his face."
