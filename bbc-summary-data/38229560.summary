Karen Bradley MP made the announcement while visiting the tomb of China's First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang.
She said she was "delighted" that a "selection of warriors" would be coming to Liverpool, home to the UK's oldest Chinese community.
It is the first time the warriors have been exhibited in the UK outside London since the 1980s.
The warriors were last displayed at the British Museum in 2007 and at Edinburgh in 1985.
Ms Bradley was touring the burial site and tomb complex as part of the UK-China People to People Dialogue (P2P), which celebrates the links between Britain and China.
"I am sure that the exhibition will be very warmly received by the people of Merseyside and beyond as Britain welcomes back the Terracotta Warriors," she said.

The exhibition will run from February to October 2018 at the World Museum in the city centre giving a glimpse into the story of Qin Shi Huang, who ruled from 221 to 206 BC.
The story of the tomb's Terracotta Warriors will be displayed alongside important artefacts and research relating to the formative years of the Chinese nation, from the pre-unification Qin Kings (307 to 221 BC) to the First Emperor's legacy in the Han Dynasty (206 BC to AD 220).
David Fleming, Director of National Museums Liverpool, said staff were hugely excited at the "unmissable opportunity to see artefacts of great historical importance in the flesh".
The exhibition will span three periods of more than 500 years and will include a number of objects that have never been displayed in the UK.
Liverpool has Europe's oldest Chinese community.
