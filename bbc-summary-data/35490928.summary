[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Network Rail has spent Â£3m building a temporary road in Wiltshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The road will save the need for a 24-mile detour when three bridges near Royal Wootton Bassett are closed for rail electrification upgrades.
Network Rail spokesman Julian Burnell said it would be "cheaper to close a few roads" but they wanted to minimise disruption to motorists.
The work on the bridges will start in March and last until 2017.
The project involves reconstructing two bridges on Marlborough Road and Broad Town Road and work on the A3102 Bath Road.
The track will also be lowered under the listed Hunts Mill bridge to create the additional space needed for the overhead electrification.
Work on the Marlborough Road/Broad Town bridge will take place between March 2016 and September 2016.
The work on the A3102 Bath Road bridge is due to take place between October 2016 and March 2017.
