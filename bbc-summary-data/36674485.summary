Sheriff Alastair Brown told Joel Justice's court hearing there had been "increased sensitivities" following the Brexit vote on Friday.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told that Justice launched the tirade at staff in Curry House in April.
He admitted telling two male workers: "You treat your women like slaves."
Depute fiscal Trina Sinclair told the court: "He asked 'are you from Afghanistan' then told the two employees 'go back to your own country'."
"Police were called and arrived at 23:50.
"They found the accused standing at the counter eating his food."
Justice was taken to police headquarters where he continued to make racist remarks.
The 25-year-old, from Dundee, admitted acting in a racially aggravated manner towards Rifa Nezir and Rehan Khan on 29 April.
Defence solicitor John Boyle said: "It is clear from the background reports there are some misguided views that he holds.
"He has an alcohol addiction and though he doesn't drink every day he does regularly, and when he drinks it is always to excess."
Sheriff Alastair Brown deferred sentence until 26 July for an alcohol treatment assessment.
He said: "It needs to be understood very clearly that this sort of racist abuse has never been something that this court will tolerate.
"I'm aware that there is increased sensitivity now and there is some evidence that there has been an upsurge in racist abuse.
"That has been roundly rejected by the Scottish government and is rejected by this court.
"Anyone who indulges in it will be dealt with seriously."
