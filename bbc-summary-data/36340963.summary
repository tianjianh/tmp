Watching volunteers and webcam viewers saw the chick hatch at the reserve near Dunkeld on Friday.
It is the 80th egg to hatch at Loch of the Lowes since the osprey protection programme started in 1969.
The female osprey, known officially as Lowes Female 15 or LF15, and nicknamed "Lassie" laid three eggs at the reserve this season.
The first chick hatched at the Scottish Wildlife Trust nature reserve on Wednesday.
Charlottte Fleming, Perthshire ranger for the Scottish Wildlife Trust said: "We noticed a small hole in the second egg yesterday afternoon and knew that the chick wouldn't be far away.
"It was great to see it when LF15 stood up briefly just after midnight."
"LF15 and LM12 are proving to be good parents again this season as the chicks are being fed and well cared for in the nest.
"We'll be watching and waiting for the third chick to hatch out in the next few days."
Osprey chicks usually hatch one or two days apart and are ready to fly after seven or eight weeks.
They are fed a high-protein diet of fish brought to the nest by their parents.
Once extinct in the UK, there are now around 240 breeding pairs of ospreys.
The osprey protection programme is supported by the People's Postcode Lottery.
