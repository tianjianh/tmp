£1.2m Aberystwyth bandstand opens after two month delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £1.2m bandstand on Aberystwyth's seafront is due to open later than originally planned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The original landmark, built in 1935, was demolished in January 2015 with an initial date of August given for the completion of the replacement.
The delay was blamed on bad weather, high tides and difficulties with underground cables.
It survived storms that hit the promenade unlike some businesses and a Grade II-listed seafront shelter.
The bandstand will be opened on Thursday by Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant and Ceredigion council chairman Dai Mason.
