The label on a drink containing whey protein is to be changed after unsubstantiated claims were made.

The Good Whey Company, based in Orwell, Cambridgeshire, is to make the changes to its Upbeat drink after advice from trading standards.
It says the drink has the "right amount" of whey protein to make people feel "upbeatable".
A new label will be introduced on 17 October. The company says it believes in the health benefits of whey protein.
The label claimed the drink "might" make customers "feel sustained, energised or even stronger" with the "magic of whey".
According to European Commission regulations, health claims on food and drink packaging must be based on scientific evidence.
The European Union Register of Nutrition and Health said claims made about the benefits of whey protein, a dietary supplement, "have not been substantiated".
Mark Neville, from the Good Whey Company, part of Volac International, said they were "not misleading" the customer.
He said: "We are aware that no approved claim is currently presented on pack. However, this absence was accepted by trading standards on the basis that the statements on pack are supported by a 'high in protein' claim."
Mr Neville defended the label's specific reference to whey protein on the basis that "whey protein contains all nine essential amino acids".
A Cambridgeshire County Council spokesman confirmed a trading standards officer had advised the company on the "compliance of a minor labelling issue".
