Surrey Police has lost experienced officers because the area is too expensive, the county's police and crime commissioner has said.

Kevin Hurley said the force had the highest rate of officers leaving in England.
He wants the introduction of a "Surrey weighting", where police are paid more than the national rate.
The Home Office said it would consider any recommendations made by the Police Remuneration Review Body.
Speaking to BBC Surrey, Mr Hurley said: "We need to recruit 140 people this year and we've manage to recruit 32.
"Additionally, our unplanned attrition has been 72 - it's therefore absolutely clear we are losing people quicker than we can recruit them.
"All emergency services... are paid on national rates, but the cost of living is very different to Lincolnshire."
There are currently 1,889 police officers in the force and 1,917 members of staff.
Mr Hurley added: "You've got absolutely no chance whatsoever of buying a house in the county on police officers' pay."
A Home Office spokesman said: "The Home Secretary will receive the first report of the Police Remuneration Review Body later this month and she will consider any recommendations it makes, including on regional pay.
"Surrey Police officers can already be paid an extra Â£2,000 per year, at the discretion of the chief constable, as a south east allowance."
