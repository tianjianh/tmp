Sir Chris Hoy to write children's books

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The six-times Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy is turning author to co-write a series of six children's books.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flying Fergus, is about a nine-year-old boy who inherits his dad's rusty old bike - only to discover there is more to it than meets the eye.
A non-fiction book to encourage children to have fun cycling, keep safe, and record their cycling experiences will also be published.
The first in the series from Hot Key Books will be published next March.
Sir Chris will work alongside award-winning author Joanna Nadin to produce six books.
The series will be illustrated fiction aimed at children aged five to eight.
Sir Chris said: "Working with Jo Nadin has been fantastic and my hope is that Flying Fergus excites and inspires children, opening their eyes to the freedom and adventures two wheels can offer with just a little hard work."
The Scots athlete is the most decorated Olympic cyclist of all time, with a total of seven Olympic medals - six gold and one silver- as well as 11 World and two Commonwealth titles.
Since retiring from professional cycling, Sir Chris has been eager to devote his time and experience to working with the next generation of cyclists.
Now, with this series of books, he hopes to continue to inspire youngsters with stories about the taste of freedom that comes with owning your first bike and discovering the adventures that lie ahead.
Emma Matthewson, editor-at-large at Hot Key, said: "Sir Chris has already provided a lasting legacy of inspiration to young people with his tremendous list of achievements.
"What drew me to Flying Fergus was a genuine warmth and heart to the books and Sir Chris's clear dedication to the next generation.
"We can't wait to see young cyclists across the country enjoy reading about their new hero."
