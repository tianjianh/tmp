[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic romped to victory over Rangers in the Scottish Youth Cup final at Hampden as they chalked up yet another triumph over their Old Firm rivals.

Just as the gap showed at first-team level in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final, there was a huge difference in quality in their under-20 sides.
Captain Sam Wardrop and Calvin Miller netted before half-time, with Miller having a hand in the first.
And Aidan McIlduff struck powerfully in the second period to seal victory.
Celtic, who have now won the tournament 15 times, dominated with winger Michael Johnston in dazzling form on the right and Miller impressing on the left.
The two of them combined to give their team the lead after 38 minutes, working the ball from the left to set up Wardrop, who fired low into the net.
Their superiority was underlined with just a minute of the first half to go, the Rangers defence failing to deal with a straightforward ball down the middle.
Brothers Robby - the goalie - and Ross McCrorie - the team captain - got themselves in a dreadful mix-up and Miller took full advantage to poke the ball into an empty net.
Even at that stage it looked over as a contest.
Celtic scored their third with keeper McCrorie unable to prevent a shot from McIlduff finding the net.
Throughout the match Rangers toiled to trouble keeper Conor Hazard, who had nothing much more to do than deal with a clutch of crosses and the occasional weak attempt on goal, although in fairness they fielded a much younger side than their opponents.
However, Celtic won the cup without conceding a goal throughout the entire tournament.
The teams were watched by their respective first-team managers Brendan Rodgers and Pedro Caixinha and it was clear which would be feeling better about the future.
Celtic under-20s head coach Tommy McIntyre described his side as "worthy winners".
And he said of Johnston: "He's got a lot of talent. As long as he listens to the coaching staff and obviously the manager, we're hoping he'll at least progress.
"It's a good occasion for us and it's good to win."
