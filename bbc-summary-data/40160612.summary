Glen Scobbie also wrote a threat on the social media account of Mr Sheppard, who was a sitting MP at the time.
Scobbie's comment was posted on 21 September 2016 beneath a video of a speech by Mr Sheppard.
The 26-year-old, of Falkirk, will be sentenced later in June.
Falkirk Sheriff Court was told that Scobbie wrote "shoot the bastard" beside the pistol emojis.
The court heard that the speech had been "promoting the MP's political work".
Scobbie's post was noticed by an aide some time later, and drawn to Mr Sheppard's attention.
Depute fiscal Graham McLachlan said Mr Sheppard was "concerned" about the post and decided to report the matter to police.
Scobbie pleaded guilty by letter to making a "menacing" post, abusive in nature, and uttering a threat of violence, contrary to the 2003 Communications Act.
Sheriff Derek Livingston deferred sentence and ordained Scobbie to appear before him in person.
