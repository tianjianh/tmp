A £3.8m project to restore the last remaining steam tug-tender ship in the UK has been completed.

The Daniel Adamson, built in 1903, carried people and livestock between Ellesmere Port and Liverpool before being decommissioned in 1985.
A campaign by the Daniel Adamson Preservation Society (DAPS) saved the Merseyside vessel from being scrapped in 2004.
The society said the only other tug-tender in the UK is not steam-powered.
The Daniel Adamson will offer cruises and private hire, as well as being at Albert Dock as a museum attraction as part of the Steam on the Dock event running on 7-8 May.
Sara Hilton, head of Heritage Lottery Fund North West, which provided funding for the restoration, said: "This is a vessel with a remarkable and important story to tell.
"Lottery players' money has helped to bring it back to life and secure its future."
She added: "Heritage has not only shaped the North West's past, but has a real relevance to the region's future."
Dan Cross, chairman of the Daniel Adamson Preservation Society, said: "Our long-awaited launch is going to be an emotional day for all the volunteers, who have tirelessly campaigned and physically worked on restoring The Danny."
