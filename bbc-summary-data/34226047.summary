Jono Dunnett fished for food, sailed with dolphins and was put up by strangers who read his blog during the 2,200-mile (3,540 km) journey.
He is the fourth person to windsurf around Britain, but the first to do so without a water-based support team.
Mr Dunnett began the fund-raising trip on 7 June at Clacton Pier in Essex and will return there later.
He said: "I got to see places I've never seen before and got to see this island I call home in a unique way."
The 41-year-old was inspired by Tim Batstone, the first windsurfer to sail around Britain, with a support boat, in 1984.
Mr Dunnett took advice from windsurfers and a round-Britain yachtsman and "painstakingly risk-assessed" the project.
He also received "some van-based support" and used a GPS tracker.
The longest distance he covered in one day was 100 miles as he travelled along the south coast.
The windsurfer slept in a makeshift tent made from his sail, but was sometimes given a bed by people who took pity on him when he was pitching his tent in cold, wet conditions.
He said: "Doing something like this, you appreciate the fundamental niceness of people."
But he added: "There are parts of the journey, like Land's End, I would never do again."
Mr Dunnett was also raising money for two charities, the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund and Supporting Tanzanian Orphans and Widows.
