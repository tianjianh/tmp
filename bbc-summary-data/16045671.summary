The 50-acre "Bridgehead" development in Hessle, East Yorkshire, will be built on the site of a golf course.
Once completed, the Â£100m complex will include 612,000 sq ft of offices, warehouse and manufacturing spaces.
Developers said a planned fall in the bridge tolls along with road improvements on the nearby A164 would attract investors to the area.
The business park is being developed by Hull-based firm Wykeland Group in partnership with The Humber Bridge Board and the Hessle Golf Course Company.
Stephen Hudson, development director of Wykeland Group, said Bridgehead could eventually generate more than 3,000 jobs with another 150 or more being created during its development, where most of the contracts for the construction of the site would be awarded to local companies.
He said: "We see Bridgehead as playing a key role in our region's economy especially as a support location to the growing renewable sector in the region. It will provide high-quality space to enable businesses to expand and at the same time attract major new investment from out of town.
"We are already talking to several potential users who recognise the value of this location".
Earlier this year developers received planning permission for the Â£100m business park and work on the construction of the site is expected to start in February.
The golf course was cleared in the 1970s to make way for the construction of the Humber Bridge.
