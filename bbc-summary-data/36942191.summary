The town, which used to be one of Mexico's most popular tourist spots, has seen a rise in violence in recent years as criminal gangs fight for control over illegal activities.
According to a recent report, the city is now the most violent in Mexico.
The government wants to bring the city back to its former popularity.
Officials from the Guerrero state prosecutor's office said three men were killed and another injured in a shoot-out in a bar in the early hours of Sunday.
Also on Sunday, two men and a woman were found murdered in a car. Their bodies showed signs of torture.
In the port area of the city, two young men were killed in their vehicles in separate incidents.
And an anonymous call led police to a shallow grave on the outskirts of the port, where they found the remains of three people.
The Guerrero state prosecutor had warned of a rise in violent incidents less than two weeks ago following the jailing of a local drug lord.
He said taking David Analco Palma, alias El Deivid, off the streets would create "a reaction" and a "reshuffle" among criminals active in the area.
In July, the Mexican government announced a plan to "restore the glory" of the resort town, which was once a popular destination for celebrities and Hollywood film stars.
Despite the arrest of a number of high-profile criminals in Guerrero state and beyond, the government has struggled to curb the high levels of murder in some of the states most affected by drug-related violence.
