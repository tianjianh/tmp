Kosovo won their first fully-recognised international courtesy of a 2-0 victory over Faroe Islands, despite playing for nearly an hour with 10 men.

Albert Bunjaku headed Kosovo into the lead just before half-time, shortly after Manchester City's Bursant Celina was sent off for shoving an opponent.
Elbasan Rashani finished off a counter-attack to seal Kosovo's win in stoppage time in Frankfurt, Germany.
The Faroes had Bogi Petersen dismissed 10 minutes from full-time.
"I expected a difficult game and it was even more difficult with 10 players," said Kosovo coach Albert Bunjaki. "We have to work hard but I can say Kosovo has a good future in the football."
Kosovo was accepted as a member of European soccer's governing body Uefa in May, with Fifa accepting them the following week.
