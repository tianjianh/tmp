The Nicaraguan challenged Adrian Hernandez for the WBC World Light-Flyweight title in 2013.
Cardoza has 21 wins from 32 career fights, six coming by knockout.
"Expect fireworks - this is a great opportunity to get my hands on another belt and I'm not going to waste it," said unbeaten Belfast fighter Conlan.
Commonwealth champion Conlan boasts a flawless record of 18 wins, 11 via knockout, and he is targeting a world title shot later in the year.
"I need to get in there and get the job done. My team has really pushed me forward and we've been making some great progress over the past few months," he added.
"There's some huge fights out there for me and I'm going to kick the year off with a new belt around my waist."
Paddy Barnes is also on the Titanic Exhibition Centre bill, with the double Olympic bronze medallist fighting for a second time as a professional.
