The Gunners kept the trophy they won against Hull City a year ago and earned Arsene Wenger a sixth triumph.
It's the 12th time the team have won the world's most famous cup competition.
Arsenal's victory was never in doubt as they dominated with a magnificent display.
Five minutes before half-time their control was rewarded with a goal from Theo Walcott.
Alexis Sanchez scored again shortly after with an amazing goal - a swerving, dipping 25-yard thunderbolt that flew high past startled Villa keeper Shay Given.
Per Mertesacker took advantage of a lack of marking to head the third.
And substitute Olivier Giroud's fourth in the final moments completed their stunning victory.
