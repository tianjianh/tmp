US court denies Samsung appeal in Apple patent row

A US appeals court will not reconsider an earlier decision finding that Samsung violated Apple patents.

Samsung has been in a legal battle with Apple for years with each accusing the other of patent infringements.
In May, the South Korean firm lost a previous appeal, which ruled that it did infringe on some of Apple's design patents from the iPhone models.
The patents mostly refer to overall appearance, design and user interface.
Samsung had sought the backing of Google, Facebook and Ebay to argue their case that the verdict placed too much focus on minor design elements compared with the overall complexity of a smartphone.
The amount of the compensation that the South Korean technology giant will have to pay will still need to be decided by court.
The decision comes on the same day that Samsung unveiled its latest flagship phones, hoping to turn around its fortunes after a string of disappointing quarterly results.
