Rio 2016 Olympics: Shooter wears Gunners shirt as he captures skeet medal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It seemed like the ideal solution but the significance was perhaps lost on Abdullah al-Rashidi.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Without a national uniform to wear because he was competing under the Olympic flag following Kuwait's suspension from the Rio Games, he decided to don an Arsenal shirt.
Whether he knows the football club's nickname is the Gunners is doubtful.
Nevertheless, the top helped him win Olympic bronze in the men's skeet.
Asked why he had worn it, he replied: "I don't know, I just bought it."
Some didn't waste any time cracking a few jokes at Arsenal's expense.
Christopher Flux suggested on Facebook that they could do with a sharp-shooter of their own, while Ash Dolan ‚Äètweeted his surprise that Al-Rashidi finished third and not fourth, which has often been the side's fate in recent times.
The Gunners were second to champions Leicester City in May but have finished fourth on six occasions in the last 11 seasons.
