Tommy Ward: Pensioner death now a murder investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a pensioner who was severely beaten by robbers at his home in Rotherham is now being treated as murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-miner Tommy Ward, 80, was found badly injured at his home in Salisbury Road, Maltby, on 1 October. About Â£30,000 was thought to have been taken.
Mr Ward died five months later at Rotherham Hospital, where he had been receiving treatment.
South Yorkshire Police described it as a "vicious attack on a vulnerable man".
Five people arrested in connection with the attack were later released.
A post-mortem examination following Mr Ward's death in February proved inconclusive. Further tests are due to take place to establish the cause of death.
Det Insp Richard Partridge said: "Exactly six months ago, Tommy Ward was attacked in his own home, robbed and left seriously injured by his cowardly attackers.
"We do still need your help to understand what happened that night Tommy was attacked and I would ask anyone with information to get in touch with us."
A safety deposit box was taken during the break-in and a similar one was found in the Kilnhurst area two weeks after the attack.
Members of the public donated more than Â£30,000 to replace Mr Ward's lost life savings in an online appeal.
