Senior investigating officer, Temporary Det Ch Insp Martin Tate, said: "This is clearly a murder inquiry. We're working very, very hard to gather as much as evidence as we can.
"That is going to take us a little bit of time, but we are working with the family and providing them with the information as we get it."
Patrols have been increased in the area to reassure the community and police have asked for anyone with more information to make contact.
At a news conference on Monday night, Temporary Supt Sarah Poolman had said police were treating the death as suspicious.
She said the force received a report of a missing person 20 minutes before the body was found.
Friends and family posted Facebook appeals for Leonne's whereabouts on Monday morning after she failed to return home.
By 18:00, comments hoping she would be found safe had changed to well wishes to the family after "heartbreaking news".
More than 100 tributes were posted on Leonne's Facebook account under her latest profile picture.
One, written by Bommer McLauchlan, said: "Fly high cousin can't believe you have gone miss you."
Another, Danny Bowskill said: "Rest in peace my wonderful niece never thought I would ever be writing this but Leonne Weeks you (were) and still are loved by so many. I'll be there for your dad and mum all the way."
Braden Oldfield added: "Sleep tight Leonne, Can't believe [you have] been taken away so early gone but never forgotten."
Police have asked the family's privacy be respected.
Rebecca Staples, principal of Dinnington High School where Leonne was a pupil, said pupils and staff were receiving support.
A message on the school's Facebook page said it had drafted in additional security staff to "reassure" parents and pupils and added it was "being extra vigilant to ensure all young people remain safe".
Ms Staples said: "We have a lot of upset students because of what has happened in a small community.
"Support for students and staff is available while we wait for more news."
