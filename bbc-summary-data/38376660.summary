Dembele - who made headlines in October when he played for Celtic's development team - came off the bench as England beat Turkey 5-2 at St George's Park.
He recently appeared for Scotland's Under-16 side in the Victory Shield.
He is also eligible to play for Ivory Coast and will not be tied to a national team until he makes a competitive senior appearance.
After Saturday's game, Dembele posted a message on Instagram that read: "Good experience at England, glad to have won 5-2 against Turkey and have assisted one, played well."
