Luke Donald will head into the final round of the RBC Heritage one stroke clear of the field after regaining the lead on day three at Hilton Head.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Englishman, who led after round one, shot a two-under 69 to move to seven under par, one clear of Americans Jason Kokrak and Charley Kaufmann.
Scotland's Russell Knox slipped back to three under with a round of 73.
World number one Jason Day had a disastrous day, making eight bogeys and one double bogey in a 79.
That left the Australian tied for 40th place overall on two over par in South Carolina.
Donald, 38, is without a PGA or European Tour win since 2012, has slipped to 95 in the world rankings and considered retirement last year.
