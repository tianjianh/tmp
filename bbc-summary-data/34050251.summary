In a video given to the BBC a car towing a boat is seen coming to a halt in the outside lane of the M4, near Bristol, after its trailer tyre has apparently blown out.
The apparently barefooted passenger is seen leaving the vehicle and stopping the traffic, before the boat is then driven to a hatched area.
Avon and Somerset Police said it is looking to identify the driver.
