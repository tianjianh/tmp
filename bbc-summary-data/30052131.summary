The incident happened at a shop in the Camlough Road area on Friday morning.
Police said they received a report at about 04:00 GMT that the front of the shop had sustained significant damage to metal shutters and windows.
They said the damage appeared to have been caused by a "vehicle, possibly a 4x4, being driven deliberately at the shop in order to gain access".
