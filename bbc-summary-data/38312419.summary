A heavily pregnant woman was pinned to the ground by two men who sprayed a noxious substance in her eyes before stealing her car, police say.

They approached the eight-month pregnant woman after she parked her VW Golf in a car park in Birmingham. Police said they were "lying in wait".
The victim tried to run away but was dragged to the floor. The men stole her keys and smashed her phone.
She went to hospital and police say she and her unborn child are "doing well".
Sgt Philip Poole, from West Midlands Police, said the woman was treated for minor injuries after the incident near Yew Tree car park, opposite Frogmoor Lane, on 11 December.

"Nevertheless, it was a shocking attack against a heavily pregnant woman and the outcome could have been far worse," he said.
"We need to identify the offenders before they are able to attack again."
CCTV images of the offenders, described as Asian, have been released by police.
Her vehicle, which has an on-board tracker, has since been recovered and is being forensically examined.
"We've secured CCTV and recovered the car, but we're still appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious, or has any other information which they believe will assist the investigation to come forward," Mr Poole added.
