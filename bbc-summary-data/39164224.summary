Sutton United 2-2 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jan Klukowski struck in the fifth minute of injury time as relegation-threatened York hit back from two goals down to earn a dramatic draw at Sutton, with all four goals scored inside the final quarter of an hour.

Vadaine Oliver won a free-kick which City's Klukowski fired into the top corner from 20 yards to extend his side's unbeaten run away from home to six games.
Former Middlesbrough midfielder Nicky Bailey broke the deadlock in the 74th minute with a fierce 30-yard strike which went in off the post.
And the points looked to be safe when Sean Newton's back pass skidded off the surface past his own goalkeeper Kyle Letheren with three minutes remaining.
However, Scott Fenwick glanced in a corner from fellow substitute Klukowski to reduce the arrears with one minute left on the clock.
Klukowski earned the Minstermen a precious point which moves them up one place in the National League table, although they remain five points from safety.
