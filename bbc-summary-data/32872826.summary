Police are continuing to search parts of Oxfordshire for 21-year-old Jed Allen who they want to question in connection with the deaths.
The bodies of Janet Jordon, 48, her six-year-old daughter Derin and Philip Howard, 44, were found at their home in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on Saturday.
Detectives have described their deaths as a "tragic and sad event".
Mr Allen, who has a distinctive black spider tattoo on his left hand, is described as white, about 6ft (1.8m) tall and stocky.
Thames Valley Police confirmed he was known to the force and has warned the public not to approach him, although he is not considered dangerous to the wider community.
Speaking at a news briefing on Sunday, Det Supt Chris Ward emphasised the need to trace the suspect as soon as possible.
"It is vital that we trace Jed Allen and I would urge anyone who has any information about his whereabouts to contact police," he said. "If you see Jed please do not approach him, instead call 999 immediately."
More than 100 officers - some of them armed - have taken part in the search which involved closing Oxford University Parks where Mr Allen used to work as a groundsman.
Police said the presence of armed police was "purely for the safety of the searching officers".
The victims' bodies were found in a house in Vicarage Road at about 20:20 BST on Saturday after police were alerted by concerned neighbours.
A number of people have since visited the scene to leave floral tributes.
One tribute left with a bunch of flowers read: "You are my family and always will be. I will miss you all each day. You have all left a massive void in my heart which will never be filled.
"I love you all so much, Jan, Phil and my Dezzy Doo."
Earlier, resident Sheila Welch said the family had only lived in the house for a couple of months and "always looked so happy".
Ms Welch said she was first alerted when police descended on the quiet residential road, adding there were "just sirens and police cars".
"All I can say is that I am very upset - it is all very traumatic," she added.
