Baggage handlers at Jersey Airport are being balloted over industrial action, the union Unite said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They are threatening to strike over potential changes to working hours and conditions after changes to service providers at the airport.
Up to 18 Unite members will be balloted on whether take action. If they decide to strike a union spokesman said it could be over the Easter break.
The spokesman said the count would be made on 4 April.
The union said the action was over possible cuts to pay and working hours due to the Guernsey-owned airline Aurigny taking over Blue Islands' ground-handling work.
The airlines signed a code sharing agreement on flights between Jersey and Guernsey, with Blue Islands operating the flights and Aurigny taking over ground handling.
Jersey Airport says there were contingency plans for the Easter holidays, if baggage handlers do decide to strike.
Servisair said any disruption to passengers would be minimal.
