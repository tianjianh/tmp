A mountain biker is believed to have injured herself while trying to emulate feats by stunt cyclist Danny MacAskill's in Skye's mountains.

The woman broke a leg in a fall at Coire Lagan, which is 609.6m (2,000ft) up in the Cuillin hills.
Skye-born MacAskill made his 2014 short film The Ridge in the Cuillin. It featured stunts high in the range.
Skye Mountain Rescue Team urged people not to replicate MacAskill's daredevil rides.
The team, which rescued the woman last Friday, said it had been encountering a number of cyclists high in the mountains recently.
A spokesman: "We have been coming across people on bikes in places they shouldn't really be.
"Once they do get to these places they soon realise that in reality it is a very different prospect from what they thought it would be like.
"Our message is please don't try and be like Danny MacAskill."
The spokesman said the rescued woman appeared to be dressed for attempted stunts.
He said: "She had the helmet and the knee pads."
However, she fell a few feet close to a loch at Coire Lagan, an ice age geological feature high in the Cuillin.
It is surrounded by the rocky peaks of Sgurr Alisdair, Sgurr Mhich Chonnich and the Inaccessible Pinnacle, also known as the In Pinn.
MacAskill took a bike to the top of the In Pinn, a challenging rock formation, for the making of The Ridge.
The film has been viewed more than 50 million times on YouTube.
