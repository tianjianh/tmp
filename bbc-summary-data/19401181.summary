Ecuador media moves create waves
It is characterised by "self-censorship, intimidation, and legal sanctions", US-based Freedom House reports. The NGO says President Correa and other officials have targeted journalists and media outlets with aggressive rhetoric.
Defamation is a criminal offence. A 2013 Communications Law provides for regulation of editorial content and gives officials the power to sanction media outlets.
Most media outlets are privately-run. Ownership is highly concentrated.
Radio is a key medium; there are hundreds of stations, some broadcasting in indigenous languages. Soap operas and US series are staple fare on TV.
There were 7 million internet users by 2016 (Internetlivestats.com). The government has attempted to force the removal of critical social media content on copyright grounds, says Freedom House.
