The 31-year-old, who began his career at West Ham and later joined Sunderland for Â£8m, was a free agent after leaving Reading earlier this summer.
Ferdinand could make his Southend debut in Tuesday's Checkatrade Trophy game against Brighton.
"I'm hoping to play regularly and prove to people I can still play in English football at this level and at a higher level," he told the club website.
