The move will see their news and features departments merge into one, along with backbench news and sports.
The merger is designed to create an integrated seven-day print and digital operation.
Up to 15 jobs are at risk at the Record and Mail, with another seven threatened in Trinity's Scottish regional titles.
A Trinity Mirror spokesman said: "We are seeing growth in digital and in our events and business division but like all publishers we are having to carefully manage costs."
