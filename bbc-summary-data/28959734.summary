It means the 33-year-old, who joined Everton on Tuesday, will miss the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in January in Morocco - should Cameroon qualify.
The decision comes after he was dropped from Volker Finke's latest squad and lost the captaincy to Stephane Mbia.
"I wish to inform you that I hereby put a definitive end to my international career," he said on his Instagram page.
"On this occasion, I wish to thank all Africans in particular and all my fans around the world for their love and unconditional support."
The former Barcelona, Inter and Real Madrid player made his international debut in 1997 during a 5-0 defeat to Costa Rica.
He went on to become an Olympic gold medallist at Sydney 2000, scoring in the final against Spain to take the match to extra-time and also slotting home his kick in the penalty shoot-out victory.
Eto'o is the leading all-time scorer in the Nations Cup with 18 goals and he appeared at four World Cup finals - 1998, 2002, 2010 and 2014 - playing in eight matches and scoring three goals.
His last match for Cameroon was the 1-0 defeat by Mexico at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
Meanwhile, compatriot Jean Makoun also announced his retirement on Wednesday after more than a decade of playing for the Indomitable Lions.
The 31-year-old Rennes midfielder had also been left out of Finke's latest squad.
He played 66 times for his country and scored five goals.
