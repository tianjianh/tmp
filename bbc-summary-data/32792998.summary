Plans for a £480m retail development in Sheffield have been revealed.

The proposals for Sheffield Retail Quarter in the city centre includes new offices, homes and restaurants and could create about 2,500 jobs.
It replaces the £400m Sevenstone retail development scheme, which was scrapped in 2013.
Sheffield City Council has released the new plans as part of a consultation. Work could start in 2017 if planning permission is granted in the summer.
The first stores could open at the development around Barker's Pool, Pinstone Street and Moorhead two years later.
The scheme could also include new car parks, bus and cycle routes and a new cycle hub.
John Lewis, which was due to leave its Barker's Pool site and open a new store in the defunct Sevenstone development, has welcomed the plans.
A spokesman said: "There are significant implications for John Lewis in the detail of the council's draft plan, and we are in discussion with the council about this."
The council is purchasing the land for the scheme and is seeking a development partner.
Leigh Bramall, deputy leader of the council, said: "This is what we want for Sheffield, a flourishing city centre that is not only a good day out, but also offers jobs and economic benefits to the whole city."
The consultation will run until 19 June, with an exhibition at the town hall from 3 - 6 June.
