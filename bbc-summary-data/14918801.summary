Japan country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Japan has the world's third-largest economy, having achieved remarkable growth in the second half of the 20th Century after the devastation of the Second World War.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Its role in the international community is considerable. It is a major aid donor, and a source of global capital and credit.
More than three quarters of the population live in sprawling cities on the coastal fringes of Japan's four mountainous, heavily-wooded islands.
Japan's rapid post-war expansion - propelled by highly successful car and consumer electronics industries - ran out of steam by the 1990s under a mounting debt burden that successive governments have failed to address.
Japan's relations with its neighbours are still heavily influenced by the legacy of Japanese actions before and during the Second World War. Japan has found it difficult to accept and atone for its treatment of the citizens of countries it occupied.
Population 126.4 million
Area 377,864 sq km (145,894 sq miles)
Major language Japanese
Major religions Shintoism, Buddhism
Life expectancy 80 years (men), 87 years (women)

Head of State: Emperor Akihito
Akihito, who has been emperor since 1989, has no political powers but he has played an important role in working to heal the wounds of a war waged across Asia in his own father's name.
His father Emperor Hirohito, who reigned between 1926 and 1989, was once revered as divine but transformed after Japan's defeat to promote peace and democracy.
In 2016, the emperor indicated that he wished to abdicate, out of concern he may become unable to carry out his duties because of old age.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appointed a six-member commission to look into the issue, which may involve changing the law.
Prime minister: Shinzo Abe
Shinzo Abe became Japan's prime minister in 2012 after his Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) landslide election win.
He was re-elected in 2014. His focus has been on a series of measures - known as "Abenomics" - aimed at boosting Japan's struggling economy.
Mr Abe has said he wants to amend Japan's post-war pacifist constitution, in particular the war-renouncing Article 9 - a goal that has prompted sharp criticism from China.
He previously served as prime minister in 2006 and 2007, but quit after a series of scandals involving his ministers.
Japan was years ahead of the US and Europe in pioneering reality TV, in which ordinary people are placed in extraordinary situations.
Newspaper readership is very high, with some 80% of Japanese reading a paper every day.
Some 110 million people - or about 86% of the population - were online by mid-2014 (InternetWorldStats).
