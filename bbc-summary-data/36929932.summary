[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 3-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall put last season's play-off final disappointment behind them with a routine home win over Oldham, thanks to goals from Lee Gregory, Aiden O'Brien and Byron Webster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lions took the lead after 13 minutes. Cameron Burgess was slow to react to a loose ball in the area, and as Ben Thompson nipped in to flick it past him, a crude lunge brought the inevitable spot-kick.
That was tucked away into the bottom-right corner with minimal fuss by Gregory, and Josh Law went close with a free-kick for the visitors before the Lions doubled the lead shortly before half-time.
A corner kick from David Worrall was not cleared initially and O'Brien reacted first to smash the loose ball past Connor Ripley.
And just 49 seconds in to the second half, another corner by Worrall was not cleared and Webster slid in at the far post to prod home.
Oldham's best effort after the break was a Marc Klok free-kick that narrowly missed the target, while visiting forward Darius Osei slid a shot wide.
