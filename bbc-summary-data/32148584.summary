Belfast scientists claim to have developed a perfume that smells better the more the wearer sweats.

Researchers from Queen's University have created a liquid which they say releases more of its fragrance when it comes into contact with moisture.
The perfume is made up of a raw fragrance that scientists 'tagged' on to an odourless ionic liquid, which is salt in the form of liquid.
It has been designed by Queen's Ionic Liquid Laboratories (QUILL).
The perfume gives off an aroma when it comes into contact with water, allowing more of the perfume's scent to be released on to a person's skin.
The scientists say the perfume also has the ability to remove the bad odours that come from sweat. Compounds responsible for the smell are attracted to the liquid, attaching themselves to it and losing their potency.
QUILL researchers are working with a perfume development company to identify a number of products that could eventually be sold in shops.
Project leader Nimal Gunaratne said: "Not only does it have great commercial potential, and could be used in perfumes and cosmetic creams, but it could also be used in other areas of science, such as the slow release of certain substances of interest."
