A new £4.7m scheme has been launched, aimed at helping 4,000 people with health problems to stay in work.

It is hoped it will stop people starting long-term sick leave and get people who are already signed-off back to worker sooner.
The project will target issues such as  musculoskeletal problems, mental health and drug and alcohol problems.
It will run in Conwy, Gwynedd, Denbighshire, Anglesey, Bridgend, Neath Port Talbot and Swansea.
Some £3.2m of the money comes from the European Union and people can access help via their GP, employer or refer themselves.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "It will provide rapid access to early, work-focused interventions, including physiotherapy, psychological therapies and occupational therapy."
The project is for people working in small and medium-sized businesses in the private and charitable sectors, which lack access to occupational health services.
