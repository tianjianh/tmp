He scored eight goals in 15 games for the Minstermen last season, including one in the FA Trophy final at Wembley.
The 25-year-old also had a spell on loan with League Two Notts County in 2016-17, with his one goal in 25 appearances coming against the Shrimps.
"I've always been impressed with him in the past and I tried to sign him on loan during January," Morecambe boss Jim Bentley said.
The length of Oliver's contract with Morecambe has not been disclosed.
