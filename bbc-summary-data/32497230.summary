[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors, who resumed on 115-3, saw Matt Machan dismissed for 80 before losing their last four wickets for 10 runs and were 265 all out.
Chris Rushworth (5-81) took his second five-wicket haul of the season.
Needing 262 to win a second successive Championship game of the season, Durham closed on 115-2 with Matt Stoneman making 41 and Keaton Jennings 38.
Ajmal Shahzad (2-40) took both wickets, trapping Stoneman leg before and having Jennings caught behind by Ben Brown.
Earlier, Machan was fifth wicket to fall when he was out lbw to Usman Arshad (2-43) and Sussex's innings quickly fell away.
Looking well set on 217-4, they were quickly dismissed for 265, with first-innings hero Ollie Robinson ending on four not out.
John Hastings (2-57) took the wickets of Steve Magoffin and Matthew Hobden in successive balls to wrap the innings up.
Durham seam bowler Chris Rushworth:
"We knew we needed quick wickets after lunch and to wrap them up like that was a big plus.
"There's a bit of variable bounce but it's a good pitch and the scores are about par. It's been a remarkable game and one of the coldest I've played in.
"The ball doesn't swing in these conditions, but I got one to nip back off the pitch to get Luke Wright when he was looking dangerous.
"It's always nice to see the middle stump 10 yards back."
