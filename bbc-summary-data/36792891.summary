The 27-year-old joined Saints from Hull FC in 2013 after he came through the ranks with Salford Red Devils.
He has scored 200 points in his 107 outings at Langtree Park and won the Grand Final in 2014.
"We'd like to thank Jordan for his commitment and effort in the red vee," said chief executive Mike Rush.
"His professionalism is second to none and we're sure he will want to finish his Saints career on a high this year."
Turner will link up with England duo Elliott Whitehead and Josh Hodgson at Canberra, in addition to former Saints teammate Sia Soliola.
