Dyfed-Powys Police specials saddle up to fight crime

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Special police constables will soon be patrolling parts of Powys on horseback in a bid to tackle rural crime.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dyfed-Powys Police launched its mounted special constabulary at the Spring Festival in Builth Wells.
It follows the success of a similar scheme in Norfolk and it is hoped it will encourage horse owners and riders to volunteer as a special.
Special Inspector Giles George said officers on horseback will "increase visibility" in the community.
S Insp George has been a volunteer with Dyfed-Powys Police for more than 20 years and will be one of the first officers to take to horseback.
He said he saw how successful the scheme was in Norfolk and, given the "huge rural area they cover", it was a model he thought they could emulate in mid and west Wales.
"Officers on horseback improve visibility on country lanes and in isolated areas, and will give rural communities better access to police support," he said.
"We are able to get to places on horseback that a patrol car can't reach, which will increase visibility and reassurance for the farming community.
"It will be a real asset to the Powys division."
The horses taking part in the patrols are two Irish sports horses - Jack, a retired Kings Troop Army horse, and Butler, a former events horse - both of which are owned by S Insp George.
They will wear crested high visibility coats, and have been given the opportunity to get used to their new kit and the sound of the police radio.
