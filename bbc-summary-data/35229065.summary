Sheridan, 51, has lifted Newport from the bottom of the table up to 20th with five wins and seven draws from 17 games since taking charge on 2 October.
Reports tipped him to replace Ricardo Moniz who was sacked on 29 December.
"As far as we're concerned, John is still our manager. He's with us until the end of the season," said Foxall.
He told BBC Radio Wales: "We've not been approached by Notts County, and nor has John as far as we're aware.
"He's focused with us. He's done a great job since he's come in. We're watching some good football out there.
"There's a job to be done. We're not away from relegation trouble. He's come here to do a job and we're expecting him to do that."
Sheridan recently said he was only concentrating on Newport.
The Welsh club host Championship outfit Blackburn in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.
