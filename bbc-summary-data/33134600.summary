Michelle grew up in the US city of Chicago with her parents and older brother Craig.
Growing up her hobbies included playing the piano - in fact she played it so much that she had to be told to stop.
Despite her family not having much money when she was younger, she went to university and became a lawyer.
As US First Lady, Michelle Obama campaigns on different issues like education, healthy living and supporting military families.
She's also well known for her fashion sense and her love of sleeveless dresses.
Her Let's Move campaign encourages kids to exercise and eat healthily.
As part of this she even danced to Uptown Funk at the White House.
She also campaigns to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school through the Let Girls Learn initiative.
Mrs Obama wants young people across America to take charge of their future and complete their education past high school.
