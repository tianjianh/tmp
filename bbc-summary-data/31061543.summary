The Great Tapestry of Scotland is officially the world's largest embroidered tapestry, at 469ft (143m) long.
It uses 300 miles (483km) of yarn to show everything from the Battle of Bannockburn and the Act of Union to Andy Murray winning at Wimbledon.
The tapestry is on show in the castle's Great Hall until 8 March.
Stirling Castle is featured on a number of panels in the tapestry, including one of former resident Mary Queen of Scots.
The castle's Great Hall of James IV is one of the few places where the enormous tapestry can be displayed in its entirety.
Lorna Ewan, head of visitor experience, content and learning for Historic Scotland, which runs Stirling Castle, said: "To date more than 200,000 people have had the chance to view The Great Tapestry of Scotland on its national tour.
"Now, through a carefully designed exhibition, the public will see the full extent of the tapestry - all 160 hand-embroidered panels - in the surroundings of Stirling Castle's Great Hall.
"This exhibition will allow visitors to follow the journey of Scotland's history, and we look forward to welcoming people to Stirling Castle to view this impressive piece of art."
