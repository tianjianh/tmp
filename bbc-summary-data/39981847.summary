Motherwell striker Scott McDonald appears to have played his last match for the Steelmen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old Australian has turned down the option of another year at Fir Park and will leave at the end of the season.
With McDonald out of Motherwell's final Premiership match - Saturday's trip to Inverness - his second spell with the Claret and Amber is almost over.
He has scored 11 goals in 40 appearances this term.
McDonald began his football career in England's lower leagues and shot to prominence in Scottish football with his 45 goals in three-and-a-half seasons for Motherwell when he moved to Fir Park in January 2004.
He was a regular scorer for Celtic from the summer of 2007 and for Middlesbrough thereafter, with a stint at Millwall preceding his return to Fir Park in February 2015.
He is currently assessing his options for next season.
