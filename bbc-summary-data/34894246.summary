All of the band were safe following the attack, but members of the crew and friends were among the victims.
Frontman Jesse Hughes told Vice people who hid in their dressing room had all been killed "except for a kid who was hiding under my leather jacket".
A total of 130 were killed during the Paris terror attacks on 13 November.
In a preview from the forthcoming Vice.com interview, Hughes said: "Several people hid in our dressing room and the killers were able to get in and killed every one of them, except for a kid who was hiding under my leather jacket.
"People were playing dead and they were so scared - a great reason so many were killed was because so many people wouldn't leave their friends. So many people put themselves in front of people."
Among the victims were their merchandise manager, 36-year-old Briton Nick Alexander, and colleagues from their record label - Thomas Ayad, Marie Mosser, and Manu Perez.
Following the attacks, the band issued a statement, saying: "Although bonded in grief with the victims, the fans, the families, the citizens of Paris, and all those affected by terrorism, we are proud to stand together, with our new family, now united by a common goal of love and compassion."
Eagles of Death Metal have put all their concerts on hold, and have pulled a documentary due to screen at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam.
Screenings have been cancelled of The Redemption Of The Devil, which follows Jesse Hughes in the build-up to the release of their new album, because of concerns the timing was inappropriate.
