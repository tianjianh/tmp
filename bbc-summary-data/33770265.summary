A representative for Zayn confirmed that the couple had ended their relationship but didn't give out any more details.
They'd been together since 2012, shortly after Little Mix won The X Factor.
Perrie had told the BBC that she was looking forward to her wedding day because "it's where we say we're going to be together forever".
However, Perrie wasn't wearing her diamond ring on a snap shared on Instagram by her bandmate Jesy Nelson on Monday.
Zayn Malik left One Direction earlier this year and signed a solo record deal in July.
Little Mix are in America at the moment on a promotional tour.
