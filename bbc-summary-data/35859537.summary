Ryan Lloyd teed up Ross Hannah to give Chester what looked to be the game's only goal before a hectic ending.
Emile Sinclair headed Oliver Norburn's corner to level before Will Hatfield gave Guiseley an 81st-minute lead.
Kane Richards levelled just two minutes later while Sinclair looked to have won it after tapping in James Hurst's cross before Tom Shaw equalised again.
