West Ham winger Michail Antonio has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a "significant injury", manager Slaven Bilic says.

The 27-year-old was injured in the Hammers' 1-0 win over Swansea at London Stadium last weekend.
"It's a significant injury and he's out for the season," Bilic confirmed.
Antonio, who has scored nine goals for the Hammers this season, was called up by England for the first time in August.
"It is a big blow. We know what he has been giving. He is one of our best players," Bilic added.
He was again called up for England's World Cup qualifier against Lithuania last month but pulled out of the squad with a hamstring injury and has yet to make his international debut.
He joined West Ham from Nottingham Forest in 2015 and signed a new four-year deal with the club last summer.
