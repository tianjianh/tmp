Championship side Birmingham City have signed Middlesbrough right-back Emilio Nsue for an undisclosed fee on a three-and-a-half-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Equatorial Guinea international joined Boro from Mallorca in 2014 but has not featured since September.
He scored three times in 40 league games last season as Middlesbrough were promoted back to the Premier League.
Nsue, 27, is new manager Gianfranco Zola's third January signing after Lukas Jutkiewicz and Craig Gardner.
"Emilio is a very good player who has already been promoted," Blues boss Zola told BBC WM. "In this league, he knows what it takes.
"He has the attacking qualities from a right-back which are important. He is different from [Blues' current right-back] Jonathan Spector.
"He is very good on the offensive. Jonathan is very good on the defensive."
