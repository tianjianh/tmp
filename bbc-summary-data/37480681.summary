[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 3-1 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Miller scored twice as Dover secured victory over Sutton United in a thrilling game.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In-form Miller struck for the Whites just two minutes in from a move set up by Moses Emmanuel.
In the second half, Miller seized on a long ball to double his and his side's tally.
But Emmanuel was sent off with 22 minutes remaining, which changed the match. Times became tense for Chris Kinnear's men as defender Kevin Amankwaah pushed forward to pull one back for Sutton.
However, Mitch Pinnock set up Jim Stevenson to make it 3-1 courtesy of a big deflection.
Home goalkeeper Mitch Walker still had time to save a Sutton penalty from Bradley Hudson-Odoi on an eventful night.
