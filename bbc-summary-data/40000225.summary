[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Northampton Town have signed midfielder Sam Foley on a free transfer from relegated Port Vale.

The 30-year-old was out of contract and was offered a new deal following Vale's relegation to League Two.
But, having appeared 83 times in two seasons for Vale after joining from Yeovil, he has opted to sign a two-year deal at Sixfields Stadium.
The move reunites him with Cobblers boss Justin Edinburgh - his manager at Newport County.
Foley told BBC Radio Northampton: "Justin being here has been the big lure for me. I've worked hard in my career with Justin previously, I know what he wants from his players and football and sort of aligns with what I want.
"Also, Northampton being a League One club, it's where I want to play my football and I'm thankful they wanted to sign me. The opportunity to play at a higher division was too good to turn down."
