Jack Moran, 85, from Crosby believes a misunderstanding led to his eviction from the Royal Caribbean ship and is demanding an apology.
He was celebrating his diamond wedding with his wife Anne and family in May when their cruise was cut short.
Royal Caribbean said its first priority is "the best interests of guests."
Mr Moran said he got wet paint on his hand and trousers after arriving in the cabin, as the balcony had been recently painted.
After making several complaints, he told a member of the restaurant staff he wanted to "jump ship" at the next stop.
When he returned, security staff and the second captain told the family the company's head office wanted him taken off as he was a "security risk."
A security guard was stationed outside his cabin all night and regularly checked on him.
Mr Moran said he believes his comments were misunderstood and the cruise company overreacted.
"Cruises are a great holiday, it's just unfortunate that staff that were dealing with me misunderstood everything.
It could have been so simple, everything could have been sorted out."
The couple, their daughter and son-in-law and his mother, left the ship at Zeebrugge and made their way home to Merseyside after just 23-and-a-half hours on the cruise in May 2014.
The group has been refunded the cost of the four-day holiday and the return trip home. They are hoping to receive an apology soon.
A spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean Cruises said: "Our first priority is always to look after the best interests of our guests and crew.
"We acknowledge Mr Moran's ongoing concerns and have contacted him to discuss these in more detail."
