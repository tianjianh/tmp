Seven sizeable creatures that will blow your mind

Have you ever seen ANYTHING like it?

After someone put a picture of this enormous snail on social media, it has gone viral.
People have been sharing their amazed reactions, with some wondering what the animal is.
Well, this is a giant African land snail. It is one of the world's largest species of snail and can grow to about 20cm long.
They feed on more than 500 types of plant and can even eat through plaster walls, so you certainly don't want to have one wander unexpectedly into your house.
In fact, they are considered to be one of the worst invasive species in the world because of their ability to munch through almost anything and reproduce a lot.
They originally come from Africa, but can now be found in China, India, South-East Asia, the Caribbean, Brazil, Florida and Venezuela.
Let's take a look at some other mind-blowingly massive animals...
Check out this massive alligator as it goes for a stroll in a US animal reserve.
Only a small group of people were lucky enough to see the huge beast - called Humpback - in Florida in the US.
Wildlife experts estimated the alligator weighed about than 360kg and was up to 15 feet long. That's as long as a family estate car!
This is the world's tallest horse and he's rather appropriately called Big Jake!
According to the Guinness World Records, this nine-year-old is a Belgian Gelding horse.
When he was last measured for record, he was just over 6 ft 8 - and that's without even having his shoes on. You might need a ladder if you fancied going for a ride!
OK, so you won't come across this chap any time soon, but this is the megalodon - the biggest shark ever thought to have lived.
This fearsome, finned super-predator was swimming about in the oceans between around 2.3 and 16 million years ago.
Scientists think megalodons could grow up to around 59 feet long, which is just shorter than two double-decker busses parked end to end. As well as its giant body, it had a very large mouth as well.
Scientists think it hunted smaller whales, like the prehistoric Eobalaenoptera whales in the picture above.
Even Eobalaenoptera themselves were pretty massive. They could grow to an impressive 35 feet, which is as big as a tennis court.
Imagine taking this for a quick stroll! Zeus is the tallest recorded dog ever to have lived.
He was an amazing 111.8cm tall, which is about the same height as a donkey. When he stood up on his back legs, he was over 7 feet tall!
This gentle giant weighed about the same as an average man of 5 foot 11 inches, so certainly stood out from the crowd compared to other canine companions.
Sadly, he passed away of old age in 2014, but he still holds on to his title.
This colossal cat is Ludo - the longest cat in the world!
Ludo is a Maine Coon, which is a breed of cat known for their size. Ludo measures a huge 118.33 cm and - as you can see from the picture - he is certainly a big creature to try to pick up!
His owner Kelsey has to put him into a dog carrier box when they travel because he wont fit into one designed for cats.
She said its great having a big cat because she never has trouble finding him around the house.  Hide and seek anyone?!
We couldn't do a list of big animals without giving a mention to these creatures.
If you come across a blue whale, you're certainly going to know about it.
Coming in at over 98 feet long, just longer than 3 double-decker buses parked end to end, and weighing over 160 tonnes, the blue whale is believed to be the largest animal to ever exist on our planet.
They were lots of them in every ocean on Earth until hunting nearly brought them to extinction. A hunting ban started in 1966 and saved the species.
Today, there is thought to be around 10,000 to 25,000, but because of their solitary nature it's difficult to know for sure how many there are - despite their enormous size.
