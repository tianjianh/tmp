James Gray's first-half score was allowed despite Armagh keeper John Connolly having the ball knocked out his grasp by Glenavon's Rhys Marshall.
Greg Moorhouse's penalty made it 2-0 to the Premiership side.
"The referee has admitted he got it wrong. It is hard to take, but what can you do," said keeper Connolly.
"We were well in the game - it was close.
"For a game like that to be changed in that way, well I have to be careful about what I say, but it was shocking."
Former Northern Ireland Under-21 striker Gray, who recently joined Glenavon club from Southport, said he had expected referee Arnold Hunter to stop play.
"I saw the ball rolling out to me and was going to knock it back to the keeper," said Gray.
"But the referee did not blow so I did when every striker would do - you put the ball in the net and ask questions later."
The seven Premiership teams in the last 16 all made it through to the quarter-finals.
League Cup finalists Ballymena United went behind away to Championship opposition when David Rainey fired H&W Welders into the lead.
But United debutant Kevin Braniff's equaliser forced extra-time and David Jeffrey's men took the lead through Tony Kane with Braniff making it 3-1 with his second goal.
Portadown, bottom of the Premiership, were trailing to an early goal scored by Loughgall's Peter Campbell but Shea McGerrigan and Tiernan Mulvenna clinched a 2-1 win for Niall Currie's visitors.
Second-half goals by David Cushley and Jordan Forsythe saw Premiership leaders Crusaders win 2-0 against Championship side PSNI who had keeper Jordan Williamson sent off late in the game.
Linfield, who have won the cup a record 42 times, progressed to the last eight by beating Institute, Cameron Stewart and Andrew Waterworth getting the goals at Drumahoe.
Institute's Aaron Harkin was sent-off as he picked up a second yellow for dissent after referee Ian McNab controversially disallowed a Mark Scoltock header which would have made it 1-1.
Jamie McGonigle's early goal was enough to give Coleraine a 1-0 home win over Tobermore United.
There will be one non-Premiership side in the quarter-finals as Championship leaders saw off Crewe United 5-0.
Conor McMenamin, Stephen Murray, Philip Donnelly, Liam McKenna and Curtis Dempster scored for Matt Tipton's side.
