About 90% of the City Road building was damaged and it also suffered a roof collapse, a South Wales Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said on Friday.
The blaze, which began at 18:10 BST, was under control by about 23:50.
Crews spent the morning monitoring the building's "hotspots" while a joint police and fire service investigation has started.
As yet, the cause of the fire is not known.
It took more than 90 firefighters to extinguish the blaze, which originated in the ground and spread to the building's first floor. There were no reported injuries.
Andy Davison, group manager for SWFRS, said: "Our crews worked hard over a period of six hours to bring this fire under control and successfully prevented the fire from spreading to the adjacent buildings including the YMCA and Machine Mart."
Cardiff council said the road would remain closed "until further notice" and could not be reopened "until a demolition team have secured the site".
