British number one Heather Watson said she has proved she can compete with the best after getting within two points of beating Serena Williams at Wimbledon.

The 23-year-old from Guernsey served for the match against the world number one but lost 6-2 4-6 7-5 in front of a partisan Centre Court crowd.
"I was two points away from winning, so I'm pretty disappointed," said Watson.
"I've learnt that I can compete with the best in the world and I can play really good tennis."
Watson was cheered on by a raucous Centre Court crowd, which was warned on several occasions by the umpire as they reacted to shots mid-point.
"It was the loudest the crowd has ever been for me," added Watson. "I was getting goose bumps and loved every second. I am just disappointed I couldn't win it for them.
"I gave myself the opportunity to play against the best player in the world.
"I also gave myself the opportunity to beat her.  I didn't take it this time.  But I'm really glad I was in that situation because I can learn from it and do better next time."
Williams, 33, remains on track to win a fourth straight major title and the win inched her closer towards a calendar-year Grand Slam, but the American was pushed hard by Watson.
"She should have won the match. I think she played unbelievable," said Williams.
"She could get beyond the top 20, she is playing really well," she added.
"She should set her sights higher. She was playing so good there was nothing I could do."
And the five-time Wimbledon champion admitted she had never experienced such a partisan crowd at the All England Club, adding that she was surprised at how they reacted to her complaints about distracting mid-rally noise.
"I never saw a crowd like this, they were really into it," added Williams, who will play sister and five-time champion Venus in the next round.
"I've never seen them this vocal or heard boos here, so that was new for me, but I've been through it all."
