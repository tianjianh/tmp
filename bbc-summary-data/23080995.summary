Borders affordable homes bid makes progress

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The provision of up to 200 more homes for rent at affordable levels in the Scottish Borders has come a step closer.

Councillors agreed to proceed with the preparation of a business case to provide the new houses under the National Housing Trust model.
It has already provided homes in Galashiels and Innerleithen.
Scottish Borders Council leader David Parker said there was evidence of increasing demand for such properties.
The local authority disposed of its own housing stock a decade ago.
However, Mr Parker said the time was right to look at getting more involved under the NHT model.
It uses private sector funding and council borrowing to deliver new homes.
"I think our decision not to be involved in housing in the past was based on the way in which the housing was structured within the council," said Mr Parker.
"But moving forward this particular route we are now looking at is a very successful route.
"We know from our waiting lists that we have many Borderers who are looking for quality, affordable housing and we know that that is a growing market given the current economic climate."
He said social landlords did a "fantastic job" but could not meet the demand "all on their own".
Mr Parker added that this was "only the beginning of the process" and that the council could provide many more houses if this model proved as successful as they believed it would.
