Among those who will take part in the 28 February ceremony are Benicio Del Toro, Whoopi Goldberg and Kevin Hart.
"Each of these artists brings a wonderfully distinctive element to the Oscars stage," said Oscars producers David Hill and Reginald Hudlin.
The Oscars has been overshadowed by a row about the lack of diversity, with some black stars boycotting the show.
The Academy Awards announced the first slate of presenters for the 88th Oscars telecast in Los Angeles on Thursday.
Other performers and presenters taking part are Tina Fey, Ryan Gosling, Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, Charlize Theron, Jacob Tremblay, The Weeknd and Pharrell.
"Together they represent the many thrilling ways stories can be shared about the human experience, and we're honoured they will be part of the celebration," the Oscars producers said.
The announcement comes after film director Spike Lee's suggestion that quotas might need to be introduced for black, Asian and minority ethnic actors. All 20 Oscar nominees for acting are white for the second consecutive year.
A slew of actors later backed Lee's announcement that he could not support the "lily white" awards show.
However, Oscar nominee Charlotte Rampling called the ongoing row "racism against white people" and double Oscar-winner Sir Michael Caine advised black actors to "be patient".
