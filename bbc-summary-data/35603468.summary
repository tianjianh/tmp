Isles street lights could be switched off for six months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Street lights on the Western Isles could be switched off for six months of the year to help the local authority save money.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Comhairle nan Eilean Siar said it would be examining the impact of turning off the lights from May to October.
It suggested the idea after councillors agreed where Â£1.4m of savings will be made in its budget for 2016-17.
The comhairle said the cuts were necessary because of reduction in funding from the Scottish government.
There were fears among crofters that the local authority would shut its abattoir in Stornoway in Lewis as part of the 2016-17 savings.
The facility serves all the Western Isles and its closure would mean crofters taking their livestock to the mainland to be slaughtered.
The comhairle has decided to keep the abattoir open but charges for its use will be increased.
