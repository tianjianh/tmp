Italian midfielder Bianchi, 25, joins on a four-year deal from Serie A side Sassuolo and spent last season on loan with Modena in Serie B.
"He can play on the left, right or in the number 10 position and he can score goals," said Leeds boss Dave Hockaday.
Senegal striker Doukara, 22, has arrived from Italian club Catania.
He was on loan with Serie B's Juve Stabia last season, scoring six goals in 20 appearances.
"He is a big, powerful and fast player with a hunger to succeed," added Hockaday. "He is exactly what we need at the club."
The Championship club's tally of signings this summer is now four following the arrivals of goalkeepers Marco Silvestri and Stuart Taylor.
The latest transfers come after Scotland international striker Ross McCormack left Leeds to join Fulham for an undisclosed fee, believed to be Â£11m.
