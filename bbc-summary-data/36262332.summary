Becky Morgan's remains were recovered from the water at Broadstairs on Sunday.
Police have appealed for anyone who saw a young couple between 02:00 and 02:45 BST on Sunday on the East Pier in Ramsgate.
Detectives said they were also keen to recover Ms Morgan's mobile phone.
It is a white Samsung Galaxy S with a sticker on the back, which said "you are beautiful".
A police spokeswoman said: "Those who were fishing in the area, working on the boats in the harbour, or perhaps in the area on holiday are all being urged to get in touch if they saw a man and a woman on the pier at that time."
A 21-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail until 24 June.
