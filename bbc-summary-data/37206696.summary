Swansea coach Alan Curtis expects Alfie Mawson to be the last player the club sign before the transfer window closes.

The Barnsley defender is close to a switch to the Liberty Stadium.
"I don't think there will be more new signings. Obviously the plan was to bring another centre back in," Curtis told BBC Wales Sport.
"If there was a bonus of getting another forward, great, but as far as I know, that is all of the deals concluded."
Mawson will have big shoes to fill after Swansea reluctantly sold captain Ashley Williams to Everton after eight years with the club.
However, Curtis thinks the 22-year old can be an instant success for the Swans despite never having played in the top flight.
"What he lacks is the experience of playing in the Premier League, but he has all the attributes and qualities to suggest he can make the step up," he said.
"Alfie came come in now during the international break and get his feet under the table, so to speak."
Curtis offered no excuses for the Swans after they were defeated 2-1 at Leicester City and like boss Francesco Guidolin conceded that the Premier League champions deserved their victory.
"It was 2-1, we could have got something at the end, but we certainly wouldn't have deserved it," Curtis explained.
"All credit to Leicester, for the way they played, they didn't allow us to play at all and they bossed the game in many ways.
"No complaints from us, Leicester deserved to win and we were fortunate maybe to come out with a 2-1 result."
