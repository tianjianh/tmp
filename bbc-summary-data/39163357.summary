[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport caretaker boss, Mike Flynn, had the perfect start as the bottom club grabbed three points at Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the proverbial game of two halves, Callum Cooke fired home on 22 minutes to put the home side ahead in an opening 45 minutes they dominated.
But after the break, the Exiles roared back with Dan Butler volleying an equaliser and skipper Joss Labadie stroking home the winner on 88 minutes.
The result leaves Newport still nine points from safety.
Newport caretaker boss, Mike Flynn, told BBC Radio Wales: "It's a massive win. It lifts the whole place. You could see the smiles on the boys' faces. The fans were exceptional.
"I said we had to fight and scrap and in the second-half, the boys were absolutely exceptional. I couldn't be any happier.
"I told them at half-time what I told them before the game, that I believe in them. We've got to put the pressure on other teams now, we've got to drag them into it."
