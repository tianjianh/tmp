Barry Geraghty: Jockey out of Punchestown Festival after 30-day ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's Barry Geraghty is out of the Punchestown Festival after being handed a 30-day ban by stewards at Limerick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Geraghty, 36, was found not to have allowed Noble Emperor to run on his merits after coming a distant second in Sunday's Handicap Hurdle.
All jockeys except Barry Cash, who rode the victorious Velocity Boy, were asked to explain why the winner was able to open up a large and unassailable lead.
Geraghty's ban starts on 17 April, with Punchestown beginning on 26 April.
The 7-4 favourite Noble Emperor ran in the pack, some 20 lengths behind Velocity Boy, for much of Sunday's race before finishing 11 lengths behind the winner.
The Limerick stewards, acting under Rule 212, also banned Noble Emperor for 60 days and fined trainer Tony Martin 3,000 euros (Â£2,400).
All other jockeys and horses escaped sanction.
