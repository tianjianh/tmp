Kingston Police's video, which shows a "prisoner" challenge officers to a dance off, has had more than 450,000 views.
While the acting leaves a lot to be desired, PC Daniel Graham, 33, impresses with his dance moves.
The viral craze was started by a police force in New Zealand.
Kingston Police have now challenged NPAS Redhill and Surrey Police to take on the running man challenge.
