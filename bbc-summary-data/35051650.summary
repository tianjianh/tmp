Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has been named Welsh Politician of Year, winning praise for her "accomplished" performance in the election debates.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The judges said she had become Wales' most recognised politician, after a memorable clash with UKIP leader Nigel Farage over so-called "health tourism".
Labour's Chris Bryant was named MP of the Year, with Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams AM of the Year.
Byron Davies, who won Gower for the Tories, was Campaigner of the Year.
Nick Thomas-Symonds, newly elected Labour MP for Torfaen, was named the Member to Watch at the ceremony in Cardiff City Hall on Tuesday.
His predecessor - former Welsh and Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Murphy - was given the lifetime achievement award.
The winners were chosen by a panel of journalists and people with party connections, chaired by the editor of the Wales Yearbook Online, Dr Denis Balsom.
