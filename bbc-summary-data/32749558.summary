Turner, who spent nine years as a player with Peterborough before winning back-to-back promotions as manager in the early 1990s, was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia in 2006.
He died on 27 April at the age of 64.
Fans from both teams attended the funeral at Peterborough Cathedral.
Turner, who also played for Cambridge United, Luton, Swindon and Southend, started his playing career at Peterborough in 1969, making more than 300 appearances for the club.
He retired as a player in 1984 and took over as Cambridge United boss the following year, managing them until 1990.
His successful reign at Peterborough ended in 1992, when he stood down to become chairman.
Turner's family and friends were joined at his memorial service by fans, staff and players from both clubs, including former Cambridge United and Manchester United player Dion Dublin.
A Peterborough Cathedral spokesman said 730 people attended the service while dozens of others stood outside to pay their respects.
Tributes were paid to Turner, including one from a fan sporting a "Posh at Wembley 1992" commemorative hat.
"I've come along to represent my family to say well done and thanks to Chris because he gave us the most amazing days of our footballing career," she said.
"He was a manager who made fans feel like they were part of a great big team."
Phil Adlam, from Peterborough United, confirmed the club was working "to find a way of commemorating Chris that is fitting, and to make sure we celebrate the life of Chris in the right way".
After being diagnosed with dementia, Turner's wife Lynne said doctors told her the illness was "caused by heading too many balls" and called for greater research into the health risks surrounding the sport.
