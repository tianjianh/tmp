[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Edward Bates, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, faces a total of 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child.
The 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989.
Mr Bates denies all the charges.
Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.
"The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies," said Mrs Hale.
The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.
She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.
Mrs Hale said: "The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage."
She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.
Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.
The jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.
The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.
