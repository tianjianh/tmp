Reveal government credit card spending, say Conservatives

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than £3.8m has been spent in the last three years by civil servants using Welsh government-issued credit cards, prompting calls to reveal what the money has been spent on.

The Conservatives want a report into the spending on the 218 "procurement cards" used for government spending.
A further £475,540 was spent in the first three months of 2015/16.
A review was conducted in April 2014, but Welsh ministers said they do not publish the results of internal audits.
However, all internal audits are shared with the public spending watchdog, the Wales Audit Office.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Unfortunately, the minister [Finance Minister Jane Hutt] is refusing to publish that report, which leaves a number of questions unanswered: is the taxpayer getting value for money?"
The Tories say they would encourage public bodies to publish all spending of more than £500.
A Welsh government spokesman said: "During the audit process for the Welsh government annual accounts, the Wales Audit Office has the opportunity to review all of the Welsh government's financial transactions.
"If Mr Davies is suggesting that civil servants are improperly using procurement cards then he should raise his concerns with the permanent secretary."
