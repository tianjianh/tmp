[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh police officers who want to go to the funeral of their colleague who was murdered in the Westminster terror attack can get free train travel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Train companies have said any officer with a valid force ID can get a return ticket from any station in Wales to London on 10 April for nothing.
PC Palmer's funeral is being held at Southwark Cathedral at 14:00 BST.
Five people, including PC Keith Palmer, were killed by Khalid Masood in the attack on 22 March.
Masood killed the unarmed officer who was guarding Parliament, minutes after driving a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge.
On Friday, Andreea Cristea became Masood's fifth victim when she died two weeks after falling into the River Thames during his rampage.
Ms Cristea, 31, was on holiday from Romania with her boyfriend Andrei Burnaz.
Masood drove into crowds on Westminster Bridge then stabbed PC Palmer to death before being shot dead himself.
