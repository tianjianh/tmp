His new album Uptown Special went straight to number one on Sunday, while his single Uptown Funk notched up a sixth week at the summit.
The hit, which features Bruno Mars, has now sold 120,000 copies and was streamed 2,562,000 times last week, the Official Charts Company said.
Ronson is the first person to claim the chart double since Miley Cyrus in October 2013.
Meanwhile, Meghan Trainor's new single Lips Are Movin' rose to number two, but she could not dislodge Ronson.
The rest of the top five comprises Hozier's Take Me To Church, Philip George's Wish You Were Mine and Olly Murs and Demi Lovato's duet Up.
On the album chart, Ronson held off competition from Fall Out Boy, who entered the chart at number two with American Beauty/American Psycho.
Singer-songwriters Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and George Ezra continued to camp in the top five, but there were new entries in the top 10 for Enter Shikari at six, and Belle and Sebastian at nine.
Bjork's eighth album Vulnicura reached number 11. It was rush-released onto iTunes last week after the music leaked online.
