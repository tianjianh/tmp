Liverpool is to become the new permanent home of the British Music Experience museum, which is leaving its current home in London.

The exhibition of popular music opened at the O2 in Greenwich in 2009 but closed last year amid plans to relocate.
Plans have now been announced to move the museum to Liverpool's Cunard building and to open at Easter 2016.
The museum features hundreds of rare artefacts and manuscripts.
Among them are David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust costumes and the original handwritten lyrics to Blue Monday by New Order.
Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said: "It makes perfect sense that a museum which celebrates the importance of British music and its influence on society has its home in Liverpool.
"Music is entwined with the city's history, present and future. The Cunard building itself played a vital role in shaping the industry thanks to the music that travelled across the Atlantic by those travelling on the Cunard vessels.
"This music then immersed itself in our culture and influenced many aspiring musicians, including four young men who went on to become the most famous band in the world."
The museum, which operates as a registered charity and is managed by a trust, is being partially funded by a Â£2.6m Regional Growth Fund grant from the government.
It will feature a new cafe and shop selling souvenirs and collector's items.
Museum chairman Harvey Goldsmith said: "The trustees of the British Music Experience are thrilled to have partnered with the city of Liverpool and to have found a permanent home for the UK's collection of rock and pop memorabilia and artefacts."
At the time of the museum's closing in London, Mr Goldsmith said the trust was looking for a "more sustainable home" for the attraction.
