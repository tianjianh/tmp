Teenage paceman Conor McKerr took 5-87 in just his second first-class game for the visitors as Northants were all out for 218, Rob Newton (67) top scoring.
The innings also saw Derbyshire all-rounder Luis Reece taken to hospital as a precaution after breathing problems.
Derbyshire reached 153-6 at the close with Alex Hughes unbeaten on 50.
Reece managed to bowl four overs before complaining of difficulties and did not return to the ground to open the batting. He is to be kept in hospital overnight as a precaution.
Meanwhile, Northants wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Rossington has been ruled out of action for three weeks after fracturing his left hand in last week's win over Durham.
Former Derbyshire man Chesney Hughes, who appeared for Northants in that Championship game against Durham, was included in Northants' team for the visit of Derbyshire as he continued his casual contract.
