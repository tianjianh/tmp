UK retail sales rose by 0.2% in May, a slowdown from a rise of 0.9% in April, after shoppers bought fewer clothes.

The Office for National Statistics said clothing sales were 1.6% down on April's level, the biggest fall since September 2014.
Economists had expected retail sales to be flat in May after sales in April were boosted by unusually warm weather.
By contrast, May was cooler than normal.
