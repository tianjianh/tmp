She will be one of 16 celebrities taking part in a four-part series aiming to raise money for Sport Relief.
Other stars in the line-up include singers Kimberly Walsh and Will Young, actors Ade Edmondson and Alison Steadman, and former Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls.
Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood will return to critique the bakes.
Former Spice Girl Geri Horner will also be in the kitchen, along with Louise Redknapp, Victoria Coren-Mitchell and Jason Manford.
Representing the sporting worlds, former footballers David James, Chris Kamara and Jermaine Jenas will be taking part.
EastEnders actress Maddy Hill, The Morgana Show's Morgana Robinson and veteran BBC News reporter John Simpson complete the cast list.
Every episode will be presented by a different host, with Edmondson's wife Jennifer Saunders, comics Ed Byrne and Sarah Millican, and Bake Off's regular host Mel Giedroyc each fronting an edition.
The series will air early next year, ahead of Sport Relief in March.
