Snapchat friends: The new emoji update explained

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Need to know if your Snapchat BF considers you THEIR Snapchat BF?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Want to know if your Snapchat BF has another BF on Snapchat who is also one of your BFs?
Does that even make sense? Can you handle the drama? Well fear not, the app has introduced emojis next to your most popular mates to outline your relationship to them.
A series of photos of Beyonce have been released to explain it all. Yes, this is the official press release…
The six emojis appear next to your contacts to mark them as your #1 best friend, one of your general best friends, or someone you're on a snapping streak with.
It's something of a replacement for the best friends feature which was removed back in January.
It publically showed the three people you exchanged most Snapchats with.
But wait, there's more...
The latest version of the app also features a low light enhancement button, making it better for night shots and gigs, as well as a 'needs love' feature, which alerts you when you've been neglecting someone for a while.
So there you go, your life has changed forever.
• Gold Heart - You're top friends: The person you send snaps to most sends snaps to you the most too.
• Gritted Teeth - You have a mutual best friend: The person you send snaps to most is also who this person sends snaps to the most.
• Smile - One of your best friends: This is one of the people you send snaps to the most.
• Sunglasses - You have a mutual best friend: One of the people you send snaps to most is also one of the people this person sends snaps to most.
• Smirk - You're their best friend, but they aren't yours: You're one of the people they send snaps to the most, but they're not one of the people you send snaps to most.
• Fire - You're on a snapstreak: You and this person have sent snaps back and forth for the number of consecutive days shown.
