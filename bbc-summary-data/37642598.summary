Barrier blocks bus fall into river in Jedburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A metal barrier has blocked a bus from ending up in a river after a crash in the Scottish Borders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened after the vehicle left the A68 in Jedburgh at about 09:40.
Police said a "small number of passengers" on board had been left shaken and were checked over by paramedics at the scene.
Investigations are continuing to determine what caused the bus to leave the road.
It hit a car and also struck a roadside wall a number of times before travelling across a grassy area and finally coming to rest against a metal barrier overhanging the Jed Water.
The route was closed for about an hour while the vehicle was safely removed from the scene.
