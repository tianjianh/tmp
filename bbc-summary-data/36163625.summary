England's central defence will be their biggest problem at Euro 2016 having had failings against quality opposition exposed in recent years.
And yet Hodgson has decided to sacrifice one central defender to add to his resources further forward. Everton's Phil Jagielka is left out while Manchester United's Chris Smalling, Gary Cahill of Chelsea and Everton's John Stones are selected.
Hodgson has covered himself with Tottenham's Eric Dier. He is likely to start as a holding midfield player but is also the central defensive cover. A gamble.
In attack, Manchester United's Marcus Rashford has the chance to be the squad's "bolter" - but he will have to produce something special in the pre-Euro 2016 friendlies to unseat any of the established names.
