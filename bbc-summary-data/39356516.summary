Pay rises of up to 50% for senior NHS managers in Liverpool have been described as "scandalous" by an MP.

Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) chairman Nadim Fazlani got a £50,000 rise in 2014-15, Rosie Cooper's Freedom of Information request found.
Replying to the West Lancashire Labour MP during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Theresa May promised an investigation into the pay hike.
Liverpool CCG said its salaries were set within NHS England guidelines.
The prime minister told Ms Cooper that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had requested an investigation by NHS England.
An NHS England spokesman said they "will be looking into the matter raised" and a spokesman for the CCG said: "We will of course co-operate fully with any review."
Ms Cooper said: "Whilst the CCG were handing out these scandalous pay rises to reward themselves, the CCG stood by and allowed grotesque failings to occur at Liverpool Community Health NHS Trust in which patients and staff were harmed by the culture of bullying and horrific management failures."
She added: "They are a law unto themselves. It is clear in Liverpool they can do as they please and believe they do not answer to anyone."
Most of the pay rises relate to the 2014-15 financial year when the chair's salary rose from approximately £105,000 to £155,000.
Deputy CCG chairman Prof Maureen Williams saw an increase of at least a third, from £70,000-£75,000 to £100,000 while the chief officer and chief finance officer both received rises of about 15%.
A Liverpool CCG spokeswoman said 2013-14 was the CCG's first year and that salaries reflected a newly-established organisation establishing its strategic role.
She added: "The increase in governing body salaries in 2014-15 were in recognition of the significant system leadership roles assumed by the senior leaders of one of the largest CCGs in the country, responsible for the most complex health system outside of London."
The spokeswoman also said: "The increase in salary of the CCG's GP Chair in 2014-15 was also in part due to an increase in his CCG commitments and a corresponding reduction in his clinical practice."
