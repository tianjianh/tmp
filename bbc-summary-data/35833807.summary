The Wales international, set to be a key member of his country's Euro 2016 squad, has impressed with recent performances for The Royals.
"I'm comfortable playing across the front line," he told BBC Radio Berkshire. "Having that fluidity in my game is a good trait to have."
Reading face play-off hopefuls Cardiff City on Saturday.
The former Reading trainee admitted he was among a number of players who spoke openly during a 45-minute behind-closed-doors meeting manager Brian McDermott held with his squad following Tuesday's defeat at Brighton.
"We're a group of very experienced individuals," said the 26-year-old.
"We know what's required and we want to get the best out of each other.
"It was a case of letting each other know that's what we need and how we want to finish the season strong.
"Cardiff will be a tough game on Saturday against a team close to the play-offs, but it's one we're confident we can get something from."
