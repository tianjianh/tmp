[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Yuill and Lamara Bell were last seen in the company of friends on the south shore of Loch Earn in the early hours of Sunday.
The couple, aged 28 and 25, are believed to be together in a light blue Renault Clio, but have been out of contact with friends and family, which police said was "completely out of character".
Officers have appealed for information.
Mr Yuill is described as being about 6ft 1in (1.85m) tall, with short black hair. He was last seen wearing grey jogging trousers, a black zipped hooded top and white trainers.
Ms Bell is described as being 5ft 4in (1.64m) tall, with long purple hair and brown eyes. When last seen she was wearing a blue hooded top, a striped t-shirt, blue tracksuit bottoms and white and pink trainers.
Ch Insp Mandy Paterson said: "Both John and Lamara have not been seen since Sunday morning, which is believed to be completely out of character for both of them.
"We are eager to trace them both as soon as possible."
