[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Geraint Thomas says he was fortunate to avoid serious injury in the Olympic road race and would be ready to compete in the time trial.

Thomas crashed on the final descent but still finished the road race as the best-placed British rider, in 11th.
The 30-year-old could compete in Wednesday's time trial if Team GB are handed an extra spot.
"Potentially I'm going to get a start in that so I'm delaying my holidays for a few days just in case," he said.
"We may get a second spot because a few countries aren't using their time trial places."
Tour de France winner Chris Froome, who finished 12th in the road race, is at present Team GB's sole representative in Wednesday's time trial.
British hopes in the road race ended when Thomas crashed after Froome and Adam Yates had failed to stay with the leaders.
"It was a massive shame because I was ready to fight for the win," Thomas told BBC Sport.
"For me to crash on the last corner of the descent was more mentally hard to take rather than physical.

"At least I was fortunate not to do any real damage. I'm really fortunate not to break anything.
"I'm a bit sore but feel a lot better after a bit of a spin this morning. I've certainly had worse.
"It still doesn't quite numb the pain of not being able to go for that win."
Thomas was left as Britain's last chance of a medal but did not have the legs to stay with the three leaders - Vincenzo Nibali, Colombia's Team Sky rider Sergio Henao and Poland's Rafal Majka.
That trio looked set to contest the medals until the final descent when Nibali and Henao both crashed out, with Thomas sliding off the road soon afterwards.
"We were right in there, rode just as we wanted to and it was all going to plan until 10km to go," Thomas added.
"That descent is super dodgy. It's twisty and the road's really uneven and any little mistake you pay the price.
"I went into the corner a bit fast and the back wheel skipped out on the small little bumps and that's what threw me off my bike.
"A lot of guys crashed and it's not normal really for pro racing for everyone to be crashing on the same descent, especially one you've done three times already.
"I think it shows how technical and dangerous it was."
Greg van Avermaet of Belgium won the sprint to the line to secure gold, leaving Denmark's Jakob Fuglsang to take silver and Majka bronze.
