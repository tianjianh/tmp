Met Police 'hesitant' to save canal death teenager, inquest hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cyclist who saw a teenager die in a canal thought he must be violent because police were not going in to save him, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ailish Tynan arrived at the canal at Walthamstow Marshes, east London, as Jack Susianta, 17, was "treading water".
An onlooker told Ms Tynan "the police have chased that fella into the water", she told St Pancras Coroner's Court.
The Met Police deny claims they refused to save the teenager in July 2015.
She told the inquest: "There did not seem to be any sense of urgency, which made me think 'Gosh, maybe he has got a knife' and 'Why is nobody doing anything?"'
She saw Mr Susianta, of Hackney, east London, "treading water like he was trying to stay in one spot" as police looked on from the grassy bank.
"Everyone seemed very hesitant," she added.
"I thought 'Gosh, this might be some kind of dangerous individual' because they had no-one going after him."
The inquest continues.
