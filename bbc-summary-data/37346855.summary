Charles Brooke Pickard: New Kerry search for abducted man

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in the Republic of Ireland have begun excavating a site in County Kerry for a man who was abducted 25 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charles Brooke Pickard, 43, disappeared from Castlecove on the Ring of Kerry in April 1991.
Several people saw him being abducted by up to five men close to his home. He was then driven away in his own van.
It was found burnt out at Shronaloughnane Forest three weeks later.
No trace has ever been found of Mr Pickard.
Police have said that new information has led them to begin excavating a site to close to where his van was found.
Mr Pickard, who was originally from Leeds, moved with his wife from England to Ireland in the mid-1980s and bought a farm in Castlecove. He was the father of four children.
Members of the Irish Defence Forces are assisting the new search which began on Tuesday morning.
It is expected to last at least a week.
Superintendent Flor Murphy has appealed for further information from the public.
"There are people who may not have been in a position to assist the investigation twenty five years ago but with the passage of time their circumstances may have changed," said Supt Murphy.
"Relationships, friendships, associations and loyalties may have changed and people may be in a better position to help us now. "
