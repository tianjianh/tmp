The label from a parcel destined for an officer on the Titanic has been sold at auction for more than £3,000 ($4590).

It was addressed to "Marconi Operator, RMS Titanic" and stamped on 11 April 1912 - the day after the ill-fated ship set sail from Southampton.
What the parcel originally contained is unknown, but it is believed to have missed the sailing by a few hours.
A spokesman for the auctioneers said there had been a lot of interest in what was "a piece of history".
An internet bidder from the UK eventually paid £3,100 ($4740) for the label, after John Nicholson's Auctioneers in Fernhurst, West Sussex, opened bidding at £50 ($764).
The parcel was sent by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company in Chelmsford to the radio operator of the White Star liner.
Unsuccessful bidders included a group hoping to turn the old Marconi building in Hall Street, Chelmsford, into a museum.
The auctioneer's spokesman said the item was of interest to both Titanic and Marconi enthusiasts.
"It's a pleasing result - it's got the story behind it, the only thing we don't know is what was in the parcel".
Also included in the lot were photographs of Marconi telegraph operator, Alec Bagot, and the telegraph equipment from on board Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic.
The label was given to the vendor's mother, who lived in Southampton, by the first officer of the Olympic.
