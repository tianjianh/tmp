Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc has extended his deal at the club until summer 2018 after triggering an appearance clause in his contract.

The former Celtic and Southampton keeper joined Bournemouth on loan in 2014 when they won promotion to the Premier League and made the move permanent the following year.
His contract had been due to expire in the summer.
The 37-year-old Poland international has made 32 appearances this season.
"We're really pleased for Artur, he's been so consistent for us and in really good form. He's won us points this season," boss Eddie Howe said.
Bournemouth, who are 13th in the Premier League, play bottom side Sunderland at the Stadium of Light at 15:00 BST on Saturday.
