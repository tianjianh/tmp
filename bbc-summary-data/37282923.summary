[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 3-1 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Woking returned to winning ways with a much-needed victory over Torquay at Kingfield Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The away side took the lead against the run of play when Nathan Blissett's header was blocked by former Gulls goalkeeper Michael Poke before summer signing Giancarlo Gallifuoco tapped the ball home for his third goal of the season.
Torquay almost doubled their advantage when Blissett and Daniel Sparkes combined to set up Jamie Reid, who struggled with the tight angle and found the side netting.
Woking struck back four minutes after half-time as Gozie Ugwu collected a great ball and set up for Delano Sam-Yorke to sweep into an empty net, and he completed his brace from inside the box just before the hour mark.
The visitors threatened to come back but Garry Hill's home side increased their lead through man of the match Dennon Lewis as he lifted a neat shot over goalkeeper Brendan Moore and in off the underside of the bar.
