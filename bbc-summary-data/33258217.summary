Mike Porter death: Cows wanted to trample us, says brother

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who survived an attack by cows in which his brother was killed has told an inquest it appeared the herd wanted to "deliberately trample" them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Porter said he and his brother Mike, 66, from Edinburgh, had been walking dogs on leads when they were attacked in a field in Wiltshire.
He told Salisbury Coroner's Court they picked themselves up after being trampled only to be knocked over again.
There had been three previous cow attacks nearby, the inquest heard.
The fatal attack happened on a public footpath through Elbow Field in Turleigh in May 2013.
Mr Porter told the inquest that attempts to shoo the cows away failed and they were surrounded.
Mr Porter, from Monkton Combe, near Bath, said the cows seemed to "deliberately trample" on them "as if it was something they really wanted to do", adding that it was "extraordinary".
His brother, who lived in Edinburgh with Adrienne Sillar and their two sons, died at the scene.
The inquest heard there had been one previous attack in the field, in 2008, and two in a neighbouring field in 2011.
David Billington, from Winsley, described how he had been walking home one evening in October 2011 when he heard "thundering hooves". He was knocked unconscious and suffered a broken neck.
The farmer, Brian Godwin, 81, said the cows in the field were continental and British cross-breeds, which were "more excitable" than other cows.
He said he had put in place safety measures after previous incidents - including signs warning people to keep dogs on a lead and some electric fencing. Mr Godwin has since sold his cattle and is trying to establish a new herd, the court was told.
The inquest continues.
