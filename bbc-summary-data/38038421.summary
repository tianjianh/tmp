Prince William wants his children to grow up with "simple aspirations", he has told a talk show in Vietnam.

Speaking on Talk Vietnam, he said: "I would like George and Charlotte to grow up being a little bit more simple in their approach and their outlook."
He told the show's host he found materialism "quite tricky" with "people living with an enormous amount of stuff that they don't necessarily need".
The TV appearance was made during his first official visit to Vietnam.
The Duke of Cambridge had earlier on his trip spoken at an international conference about the number of endangered animals being killed in illegal poaching.
During the interview on the English language show, for Vietnam's national broadcaster VTV, he said he hoped George, three, and one-year-old Charlotte, would grow up "treating others as they would like to be treated themselves".
The 34-year-old also admitted he had "struggled at times" with parenthood, which had come with "wonderful highs and wonderful lows".
"I'm very lucky in the support I have from Catherine, she's an amazing mother and a fantastic wife," he said.
"But I've struggled at times. The alteration from being a single independent man to going into marriage and then having children is life-changing."
The Duke of Cambridge also told host Tran Thuy Duong:  "George is a right little rascal sometimes, he keeps me on my toes but he's a sweet boy. And Charlotte, bearing in mind I haven't had a sister, so having a daughter is a very different dynamic.
"I adore my children very much and I've learnt a lot about myself and about family just from having my own children."
