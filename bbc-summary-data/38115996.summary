Brixham honours fishermen lost at sea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A statue to honour those lost at sea has been unveiled at one of the UK's last fishing ports after a decade of fundraising.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It took residents in Brixham, Devon, 10 years to raise the Â£76,000 needed.
Artist Elizabeth Hadley was commissioned to create the bronze life-size Man and Boy statue.
Eighty-three British commercial fishermen died in the past decade at sea, according to the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.
Brixham is one of the largest fishing ports in the UK.
The names of fishermen both past and present will also be commemorated on plaques near the new statue.
Victoria Bowen, who helped fundraise said: "It's a high-risk industry and it's important people remember what these guys face when they are bringing home what they call 'the silvery harvest'."
Barry Young from Brixham Trawler Agents said: "It's a big effort from a long campaign which has been going on for 10 years"
