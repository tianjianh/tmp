[SN]TITLE[SN]
Koran teacher guilty of Cardiff mosque sex abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An 81-year-old former Koran teacher has been convicted of a string of child sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohammed Haji Sadiq taught for 30 years at the Madina mosque in Cardiff.
Sadiq, from Cyncoed, was found guilty of 14 child sex offences  but cleared of one count of indecent assault at Cardiff Crown Court.
He had denied the charges involving four girls aged between five and 11 and blamed "politics" in the mosque for the accusations.
The offences took place between 1996 and 2006 at the Woodville Road mosque.
The court heard Sadiq "took advantage of his position" and touched the four girls inappropriately as a form of punishment, abusing the girls if they made a mistake while reciting the Koran.
Some of his victims said they were afraid to attend the mosque because of his abuse.
Jurors were also told Sadiq would use a stick as a form of punishment in class and hit people over the hand or hard on the back.
One victim said he would threaten young pupils.
His Honour Judge Stephen Hopkins QC said Sadiq was found guilty "on the most compelling evidence".
He said the case clearly passed the custody threshold and that Sadiq would be monitored electronically.
Sadiq, who has had no involvement in the mosque since 2006 when it burnt down, was released on bail and will be sentenced at a later date.
