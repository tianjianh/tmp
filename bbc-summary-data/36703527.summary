The 31-year-old free agent averaged 12.3 points from 74 games for Miami Heat last season after joining them in 2014 from the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Sudan-born Deng represented Britain at the 2012 Olympics and also played for the Chicago Bulls from 2004 to 2014.
Meanwhile, former Miami team-mate and 12-time NBA All-Star Dwyane Wade is heading to Chicago.
The guard has accepted a reported two-year, $47.5m deal with the Bulls.
"I was born and raised in Chicago," said Wade, 34. "I'm excited to go back to the place I've always envisioned playing basketball.
"Growing up, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls was the team for us."
