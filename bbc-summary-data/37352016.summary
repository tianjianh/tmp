The widow of Constable Stephen Carroll has expressed her anger at a Sinn Féin jail visit to meet one of his killers.

Mr Carroll was shot dead in Craigavon, County Armagh, in March 2009.
Last week, three Sinn Féin members of the Assembly justice committee met Brendan McConville at Maghaberry Prison.
Mr Carroll's widow, Kate, told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme that it appeared Sinn Féin were trying to placate dissident republicans.
"Whenever I heard the news about it yesterday afternoon, I just felt that even after seven and a half years we are still being terrorised as a family," said Mrs Carroll.
"It has been ongoing since Stephen's murder and it is as if something is popping its head up every month and it is soul destroying for us as a family.
"We just think when is Stephen going to be allowed to rest in peace? When are we ever going to get peace?
"At the minute it looks as if Sinn Féin are trying to placate the dissidents by standing by them and the victims of the so-called cause we seem to be at the bottom of the pile."
Brendan McConville and John Paul Wootton were jailed for the dissident republican murder of Mr Carroll in 2012.
They lost an appeal against their convictions in 2014.
Sinn Féin Justice Committee members Declan Kearney, Pat Sheehan and Michaela Boyle met Mr McConville and another republican prisoner, Tony Taylor, on 9 September.
The visit has also been criticised by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) who have expressed their "disgust".
DUP MLA for Upper Bann Carla Lockhart denounced it as a stunt that opened old wounds.
Mr Carroll was the first police officer to be killed after the formation of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).
In a statement on Tuesday, Sinn Féin said it believed his killing was "wrong and unjustifiable" and acknowledged Mrs Carroll's "deep loss".
However, it added: "Those who have been convicted, and their legal representatives have raised serious concerns and questions over the reliability of their convictions.
"Everyone in our society is entitled to the highest standards of justice and maximum information recovery."
