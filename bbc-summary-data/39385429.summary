[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rhiannon Smith, 21, was involved in a collision between a black Range Rover and a grey Toyota Yaris on the A48 between Newport and Chepstow, Monmouthshire, on 16 March.
The trainee teacher, from Llandevaud, has since died.
Her family said she was "the life and soul of a party" and had ambitions to work as a teacher in London.
The Cardiff University graduate was finishing her PGCE at the University of Gloucestershire and had been applying for jobs in England's capital when she died.
In a tribute, her family said: "Her enthusiasm for teaching was difficult to match. She had recently said that she was having the happiest time of her life and thanked her family for enabling her to achieve these wonderful goals.
"Rhiannon was the life and soul of a party and left a mark on everyone she met. She was such an integral part of the Smith household and will be sorely missed, never forgotten and impossible to replace."
