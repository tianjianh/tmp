[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brechin City replaced Alloa Athletic at the top of Scottish League One after beating Stranraer by a single goal, Andy Jackson getting the winner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alloa - now third - lost 2-1 at home to Airdrieonians, while Livingston moved up to second with a 2-1 win at Peterhead.
Peterhead slip to bottom with Stenhousemuir's 1-0 win away to East Fife taking them up to ninth.
And Albion Rovers were 2-0 winners over Queen's Park, who are a point ahead of Stenny.
At Stair Park, it was goalless until Jackson struck in the 75th minute.
Livi went behind to Peterhead early on, Fiacre Kelleher heading the hosts ahead.
However, strikes by Danny Mullen - one either side of half-time - turned the match in Livi's favour.
Andy Ryan's shot and one from Ryan Conroy put Airdrie in control away to Alloa, who replied through Greig Spence's strike.
The only goal at Bayview was a Colin McMenamin penalty, awarded for a hand-ball by the Fifers' player-manager, Gary Naysmith.
And, in Coatbridge, Ryan Wallace's late strike added to Steven Boyd's long-range first-half effort as Rovers ran out comfortable winners.
