Gary Roberts slid a ball through to Marc McNulty, who calmly slotted for his 10th goal of the season as the visitors took the lead.
Tom Conlon went close for Boro, thumping an effort off the crossbar late on.
But it was Naismith who found the crucial goal, firing in after being on the pitch for only 11 minutes.
Stevenage remain in 21st position in the League Two table, eight points clear of the drop zone.
Portsmouth sit in fifth, nine points behind Plymouth who occupy the third automatic promotion spot. Pompey have a three-point advantage over eighth-placed Leyton Orient.
Stevenage caretaker manager Darren Sarll told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"I thought so much fear and anxiety in the first half. Most disappointingly we looked hesitant in the defensive high press that we have become so good at.
"Second half I felt we were a lot better. We created chances - but same again, what's the point in turning up at half-time, especially against a good side?
"My main concern is that we haven't entered play until 46 minutes. It's just madness to me, and something I can't accept and needs to be addressed. It's only running - we need them to run harder than what they did for 45 minutes."
