UK construction picked up in March, suggesting that the sector is reviving after a slow start to 2015.

Construction output rose 1.6% compared with the same month last year, and by 3.9% compared to February 2015, the Office for National Statistics said.
Private sector house building grew 2.3% in March, after five successive months of contraction.
UK construction growth slowed at the end of 2014 and remained sluggish through the start of this year.
Overall, output in the first quarter of 2015 was down 1.1% compared to the last quarter of 2014.
"Following the fall in output over January and February, today's figures represent encouraging news," said Gareth Hird of property consultancy McBains Cooper.
"However, it would be premature to call this a recovery just yet. In all likelihood it is fragile at this stage," he said.
