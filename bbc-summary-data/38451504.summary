The two men, aged 19 and 24, were arrested on Daggers Lane soon after the shooting in Dartmouth Street at about 14:30 GMT on Tuesday, West Midlands Police said.
The 33-year-old male victim was a passenger in a stationary car. He died after being shot in the head.
The scene of the incident is cordoned off for forensic investigations.
Officers are appealing for anyone who saw a grey Audi Q5 being driven away from the scene shortly after 14:30 on Tuesday to come forward. The car has been recovered.
Det Insp Martin Slevin said: "We have increased patrols in the area to reassure residents, however we do believe this to be a targeted attack and there is no risk to the general public."
One nearby shopkeeper said he heard five shots.
