A stolen dog found wandering the streets of a Lancashire town has been reunited with its owner - more than 200 miles away and a year after the theft.

Nellie the pug went missing in October 2014 from owner Marie Ling's garden in Norwich, prompting a police investigation.
But their inquiries drew a blank, until Nellie was found in Burnley and passed to a vet's practice.
The vets were able to trace Nellie's owner through her microchip.

Sonia Billington, practice manager at Oakmount Veterinary Centre, telephoned Mrs Ling, who burst into "tears of joy" when she heard the news.
"She was just absolutely elated," she said.
"She asked if she could set off straight away to come and collect her, but because of the distance we decided it would be best for her to come the following day.
"It was a very emotional reunion."
Norfolk Police are continuing to investigate the theft, which also saw Nellie's mother taken from Mrs Ling's secure garden.
It is not known how she came to be in Burnley, but Ms Billington said pugs are sought-after pets and are often sold around the country.
