[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fresh appeal for information has been issued about the disappearance of a young boy in North Ayrshire 40 years ago.

Three-year-old Sandy Davidson went missing from his grandmother's garden in Irvine on 23 April 1976.
It is believed he went to look for the family dog which had escaped through an open gate, but he never returned.
Police Scotland have issued a computer-generated image showing how Sandy might look if he is alive.
Sandy had been playing in the garden in St Kilda Street in the Bourtreehill area of Irvine with his younger sister Donna when he went to look for the family pet.
Police were alerted immediately of his disappearance but despite an extensive search by the police and members of the community, as well as a high profile media campaign, there was no trace of him.
There have been no positive sightings of him since 1976.
Det Supt David Halliday, who is the senior investigating officer, said: "It's hard to imagine the distress and sadness Sandy's family have endured over the last 40 years, not knowing what has happened to their beloved son and brother, who was only a toddler when he went missing.
"Despite the passage of time, this missing person investigation remains open and I'd like to take this opportunity on the anniversary of Sandy's disappearance to ask people to cast their minds back to Friday 23rd April 1976.
"Did you live in Bourtreehill in Irvine, specifically around the area where Sandy was last seen in St Kilda Street?
"Friday April 23rd 1976 was a relatively warm day as Sandy played outside with his sister Donna. The community of Bourtreehill was tight-knit and mostly everyone knew their neighbour.
"Did you see Sandy when he left his grandmother's garden? He was quite a distinctive-looking child with light blonde hair and blue eyes."
Over the years, his sister Donna has led various campaigns to ensure the public are aware of Sandy's  disappearance and police have worked closely with the charity Missing People.
Jo Youle, chief executive of Missing People, said: "To spend any length of time with a loved one missing is heartbreaking for a family desperate for news.
"Sandy's family have had to endure an unimaginable 40 years since Sandy disappeared.
"Everyone at the charity joins Police Scotland and the rest of the public in the hope that this new appeal will finally end the limbo that Sandy's family has been living in since the day he disappeared."
