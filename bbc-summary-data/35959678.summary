Emergency services were called to Muscle Junction health supplements store in Glasgow Road, Barrhead, at about 23:10 on Saturday.
The entire shop front was blown off in the blast but no-one was injured as the premises were unoccupied at the time.
Police have appealed for witnesses in a bid to trace who was responsible and establish why the shop was targeted.
Police Scotland said that following a joint investigation with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, "officers can now confirm it was a deliberate act".
Det Con Mark Hendry said: "It's important we establish why this property was targeted and trace whoever is responsible.
"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen someone in the area or near to the premises who was perhaps acting a little suspiciously.
"If you have any information, no matter how insignificant it seems to you, please do pass it on."
Police said officers were gathering CCTV images from the area in a bid to help the investigation.
