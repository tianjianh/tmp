[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Det Sgt Gerallt Davies is accused of gross misconduct at hearing which started on Tuesday in Colwyn Bay.
He admitted six allegations of misconduct involving accessing police systems from 5 January to 5 February.
His "dozens of searches" were about incidents involving the PCSO and a police constable.
Det Sgt Davies denies two further allegations of contravening a lawful order.
The hearing is the first one of its kind to be held in public in north Wales under new legislation.
At the start of the hearing, barrister Simon Walsh, the presenting officer, said the public had no legitimate interest in knowing the names of the PCSO or the PC.
Richard Debicki, assistant chief constable of North Wales Police, is chairing the hearing and the three-person panel includes another senior officer.
Det Sgt Davies's barrister Trevor Parry-Jones said: "This is a serious matter. The officer's future is at stake."
The hearing will continue on Wednesday.
