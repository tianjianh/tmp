The league was expanded from eight to ten teams in June, but Jets, who finished bottom of the table last season, were not offered a place.
The team will close in September to allow players to take part in training camps already scheduled for the summer.
"This is a sad day for netball and for women's sport in Yorkshire," Jets chairperson Mariana Pexton said.
"It has been a difficult period for all involved and we have been overwhelmed by the support we have received through the media and social media.
"The overwhelming public sentiment has echoed what we feel - sadness, shock and great disappointment at the removal of Yorkshire, a county of five million people, from a place in the country's premier domestic netball competition."
