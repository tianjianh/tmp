[SN]TITLE[SN]
Manchester City v Liverpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City could recall Yaya Toure and Nicolas Otamendi, both of whom dropped to the bench in Wednesday's defeat by Monaco.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City remain without long-term absentees Gabriel Jesus and Ilkay Gundogan.
Liverpool will assess forward Roberto Firmino, who missed last weekend's win against Burnley with a minor injury.
Dejan Lovren, who has been nursing a knee problem, played for the under-23 side on Monday and is fit to make his first senior appearance since January.
Divock Origi is doubtful because of a knock and illness, while injured duo Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge will again miss out.
Steve Wilson: "Pep Guardiola is well used to managing his sides through a sequence of big games. However, it is unlikely that with either Barcelona or Bayern Munich he approached such a run with each fixture so laced with the danger of defeat.
"After Liverpool at the Etihad, Guardiola travels to Arsenal and Chelsea as a prelude to pitting his wits against Arsene Wenger again in the FA Cup semi-final.
"City might win the lot - but, after Monaco, Guardiola surely cannot completely silence the nagging voice which says that they could also lose the lot.
"Jurgen Klopp will have studied Monaco's approach to beating City and concluded that it was not so very far removed from his own preferred modus operandi - an approach which earned Liverpool a thumping win at City last season."

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: "I have heard people have written that I will change 12 or 13 players [this summer]. That is impossible. They have contracts. You have to pay them.
"We will try and improve the team. Next month and a half I expect a huge step forward. Next season will be better. Just because they are out of contract doesn't mean they will all leave. Some will stay."
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on Guardiola: "I am not in doubt about his quality. Maybe a few people are but I am not. I respect him a lot.
"I know probably a few people think (differently) now they are out of the Champions League but I think the way they played was quite impressive as Monaco.
"City could have won the game easily in the second half but because they are human beings they missed a few chances. For me City is the most difficult team to play. I know their image at this moment in this country is a little bit different."
There could be a backlash from City after their defeat by Monaco but, even if there is, I don't see them keeping a clean sheet.
The Reds will get chances but they will have work to do at the other end too. I am going for a draw, which I think Liverpool would take now.
