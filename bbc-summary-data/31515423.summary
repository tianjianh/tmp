The actor will be on the public address system at Bromley-by-Bow station.
It was chosen because it's replaced by the fictional Walford East station on Tube maps in the show.
"I can't tell you how much I loved sitting in the control room with them lovely ladies in their blue coats who work tirelessly," says Dyer.
"I remember I used to go through [Bromley-by-Bow] and get off at Mile End on the District Line and change to the Central Line to get to Stratford.
"It brought back some happy memories. So remember everyone - mind that gap."
Dyer plays Mick Carter, landlord of the Queen Vic, in the soap opera.
Sandra Anderson, manager of Bromley-by-Bow station, says: "Our station is at the heart of the East End and it is fantastic that as part of EastEnders' 30th anniversary, our customers will be able to hear one of the most recognisable voices from the show telling them that there is a 'right pukka' service on the District Line."
Last year celebrities including Stephen Fry, Joanna Lumley and Barbara Windsor all recorded announcements for trains and buses as part of London Poppy Day.
