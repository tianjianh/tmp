European champion Steadman was top in the PTS5 category, while Paralympic hand-cycling champion Darke was victorious in the wheelchair category.
"After seven months out, training has picked up and I am really pleased," Steadman said.
In the men's PTS4 category, Britain's George Peasgood won a silver medal, but said he had struggled with the heat.
Alison Patrick, guided by Nicole Walters (PTS5), and Ryan Taylor (PTS3) failed to finish their races in Iseo-Franciacorta.
