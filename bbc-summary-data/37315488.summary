[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British Airways flight from London to Florida had to divert to Boston because of a "disruptive" British passenger.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 24-year-old Glasgow man was removed from the Orlando-bound flight at 16:45 local time (21:45 BST) on Thursday.
The man was taken off the flight half an hour after it made the unscheduled landing at Logan International Airport.
Massachusetts State Police said the man would appear in court accused of interfering with the flight crew of the Boeing 777, which flew from Gatwick.
A force spokesman said: "Customs and Border Protection took custody of the 24-year-old man from Glasgow, Scotland.
"Massachusetts State Police will be summonsing the man for interfering with a flight crew."
A British Airways spokeswoman said: "Our customers and crews deserve to enjoy their flights, and not to suffer any form of abuse.
"Disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated, and the appropriate action will always be taken.
"We'd like to apologise for the delay to the other customers on the flight."
