Wasps wing Christian Wade has landed a unique double at the Rugby Players' Association awards.

Wade, 22, was named both the Players' Player of the Year and the Young Player of the Year after a superb season.
He scored 18 tries in 26 appearances and finished level with Wasps team-mate Tom Varndell as the Premiership's joint leading try-scorer with 12.
Jonny Wilkinson is the only other player to have won both RPA awards - but he did so in different years.
Wilkinson won the young player trophy in 1999 and the main award in 2003.
"I am really shocked and humbled," Wade said.
"When it is the players who you play week-in, week-out it makes it that more special. It is the greatest feeling to have the respect of your peers.
"Looking at the quality of the nominees in both awards I didn't expect to win and I am thankful to come out on top."
Wade won the Players' Player of the Year award ahead of the Leicester flanker Julian Salvi, with Saracens and England prop Mako Vunipola in third.
Vunipola also finished runner-up in the Young Player of the Year award with his brother, the Saracens-bound Wasps number eight, Billy in third.
Wasps were strongly represented, with lock Joe Launchbury named the England Player of the Year for 2012-2013.
