[SN]TITLE[SN]
Two primary schools 'could close' in Lewes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two primary schools in Lewes have been earmarked for closure due to falling pupil numbers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A public consultation over the proposed closure of Pells CE Primary School and Rodmell CE Primary School has been launched.
East Sussex County Council said the fall in pupil numbers meant the schools "could not secure financial stability".
Nick Bennett, who is the lead member for education, said the decision to close a school was "never an easy one".
The consultation will close on 27 May.
