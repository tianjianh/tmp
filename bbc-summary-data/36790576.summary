A man has been charged with sending death threats to a Labour MP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luciana Berger, Liverpool Wavertree MP, received a number of emails on Friday, with one message allegedly saying "she is going to get it like Jo Cox did".
John Nimmo, 28, appeared before South Tyneside Magistrates' Court on Wednesday charged with sending a message causing anxiety or distress.
Mr Nimmo, of Moreland Road, South Shields, was remanded for a hearing on 27 July.
In May Ms Berger officially joined the race to become Liverpool's first metro mayor and has been the target of hate messages in the past - often referencing her Jewish religion.
Last month Labour MP Jo Cox, 41, was shot and stabbed shortly before she was due to hold a constituency surgery in Birstall, West Yorkshire.
