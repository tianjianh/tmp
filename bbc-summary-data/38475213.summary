Forward Fejiri Okenabirhie produced a neat finish to put the visitors ahead with 15 minutes played at Grange Lane, before top-scorer Hawkins blasted in off the crossbar to double the advantage two minutes later.
Luke Guttridge put the result beyond doubt when he found the top corner of Rory Watson's net just before the interval.
The home side pressed for a way back into the game but striker Hawkins scored against the run of play in the 64th minute to further extend the lead with his 16th goal of the season.
