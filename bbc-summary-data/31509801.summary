Bishops warn voters to ignore 'sexy' Russell Brand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's not just the political parties who are urging you to vote, the Church of England is at it as well.

Russell Brand disagrees. The comedian's not going to vote at the General Election in May, and wants others to do the same.
In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Brand explained the current political system has created a "disenfranchised, disillusioned underclass".
A group of bishops has attacked Brand's view that voting is pointless.
In an open 52-page letter, the House of Bishops call for a "fresh moral" vision from politicians.
The Bishop of Norwich, the Rt Rev Graham James explained: "While the bishops of the Church of England don't quite have the sex appeal of Russell Brand, we think we should counter [his views].
"Do vote, do engage and do use the hard-won political freedoms that you possess."
The letter stayed clear of getting behind a particular party, but calls for us to discuss issues such as nuclear weapons and the economy.
While Brand says he won't vote because he's tired of the "lies, treachery and deceit of the political class", but the letter calls for Christians to see ignore him.
"It is the duty of every Christian adult to vote, even though it may have to be a vote for something less than a vision that inspires us."
