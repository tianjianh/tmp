[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 1-2 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steve Morison scored with a brilliant 25-yard volley as Millwall came from behind to beat Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam Sercombe gave Oxford the lead on 31 minutes with a simple tap-in at the far post after Marvin Johnson brushed off Byron Webster's unconvincing challenge and squared to him behind the Lions' defence.
But just five minutes later, when there seemed little on, Morison connected beautifully on the volley from distance for his sixth League One goal of the season.
Oxford top scorer Chris Maguire went close with a free-kick when he tried to catch out goalkeeper Jordan Archer at his near post, firing the effort into the side-netting.
And, from a left-wing cross by Maguire, striker Dan Crowley saw his shot on the turn from eight yards deflect just wide.
However, five minutes into the second half, Oxford's defence failed to deal with Mahlon Romeo's run and pull-back, and Aiden O'Brien fired home from 12 yards for what proved to be the winner.
John Lundstram headed wide at a corner, a Tyler Roberts effort deflected onto the bar, and in stoppage time Curtis Nelson headed straight at Archer as Millwall held on.
