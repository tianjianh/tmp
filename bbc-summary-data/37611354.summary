Kaydel Williams, 19, was pronounced dead after being found in Hunton Road, Erdington, Birmingham, with serious injuries on Friday evening.
Minutes earlier he had been bundled into a car at The Gardens, Erdington, by a group of men, police said.
Mr Williams' family said he was a "vibrant soul".
Police believe Mr Williams, from Tipton, was put into the car at about 20:50 BST during an outbreak of disorder.
A force spokesman said: "I believe that two vehicles were involved in the initial report of disorder at The Gardens; a blue Mercedes which has been recovered and a silver VW Passat which remains outstanding.
"I am keeping an open mind about what happened on Friday night and I am appealing directly to the people in the cars to do the right thing and come forward."
In a statement released by police, the Williams family said the 19-year-old man was "a humorous character, who was well mannered, caring and highly regarded by others".
