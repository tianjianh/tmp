The 27-year-old kept six clean sheets from 17 games on loan at Darren Sarll's side from Preston last season.
Former Everton youngster Jones has made 251 career appearances, with the majority coming at Leyton Orient.
"As a player, I just need to concentrate on starting next season as I finished it. I thought my last 10 games were really strong," he said.
"As a team, we don't deserve to be in the position we were last season fighting against relegation, we need to be at the top end fighting for promotion.
"With the squad we've got up until now I think we can do it."
