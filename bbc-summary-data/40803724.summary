Salford Red Devils: Mark Flanagan and Lama Tasi both out with injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salford will be without injured forwards Mark Flanagan for the rest of the season and Lama Tasi for 10 weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flanagan, 29, was expected to return from a shoulder injury during the Super 8s but medical staff have ruled against him coming back in 2017.
Tasi, 27, sustained a knee injury in Salford's Challenge Cup semi-final loss to Wigan on Sunday.
He was due to miss Friday's game with Hull FC through suspension for striking with the shoulder in the defeat.
"Realistically I need to rest and recover," Flanagan said. "As soon as I'm fully fit I'll be working hard to come back fitter and stronger for the 2018 season."
