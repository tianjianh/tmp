The BBC News website profiles Russia's S-300 surface-to-air missile system, components of which have been delivered to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government.

In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said shipments had been suspended, but that if the US and its allies intervened militarily in Syria, Moscow would "think how we should act in the future".
The S-300 is a series of highly capable, long-range surface-to-air missile complexes first deployed in the USSR in 1979 and later modified by the Russian armed forces.
As well as targeting aircraft, the fully mobile units have the capacity to engage ballistic missiles.
Experts believe that Russia is most likely delivering the S-300PMU-2 systems - also known by the Nato codename SA-20 - which were first introduced in 1997 and are comparable to the US Patriot Air and Missile Defense System.
The Russian batteries are made by a state-run company, Almaz-Antei, which last year announced it was stopping the production of the S-300s and switching resources to the more advanced S-400s.
The vehicle used as a launcher is currently manufactured at the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant (MZKT) in Belarus, although Russia is now shifting the production to its western city of Bryansk.
