Jonathan Davies says his focus for now will be Scarlets' Pro12 play-off bid rather than this summer's British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.

The Wales centre, 29, said he was "delighted" to have been selected for his second Lions tour.
But Davies said the priority before then would be helping Scarlets to secure a top four finish in the Pro12.
"You've got to enjoy the moment but make sure your focus goes back to the Scarlets," Davies said.
"Hopefully we can finish off with a good run-in."
Davies, a member of the successful Lions squad which won the Test series against Australia in 2013, is one of 12 Welsh internationals selected for New Zealand.
Scarlets team-mates Liam Williams and Ken Owens are also in the squad but Davies' centre partner Scott Williams missed out.
Davies is disappointed for 26-year-old Williams but backed him to bounce back and said he could be a useful back-up player should injuries affect the Lions squad.

"I've spoken to Scott since the squad announcement and he seems alright," Davies added.
"He'll cope with it. He's an excellent player and has shown in the past how good a player he is.
"Injuries do happen and you've got to make sure you concentrate on putting yourself in a position that if you're called upon you're ready to go.
"For us as a partnership moving forward with the Scarlets we've got to make sure we're focused on securing a play-off berth in the Pro12.
"We're in such a good position in the league and it would be criminal to let that slip. We're focused on finishing the league strong."
Scarlets colleagues, captain and hooker Owens and back Liam Williams, have been included in their first Lions squad.
Davies said both players deserved their spots in Warren Gatland's 41-man squad,.
"They've shown the form to get into the squad," Davies told BBC Wales Sport.
"They've both had very good seasons. Ken's been outstanding and he's been a great leader for us and Liam's shown great form over the last 18 months, probably longer.
"I'm delighted for them after all the hard work they've put in."
