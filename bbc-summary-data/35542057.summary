[SN]TITLE[SN]
Psychiatrist Adam Osborne faces being struck off over relationship

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A psychiatrist faces being struck off from the medical profession after he had a two-year affair with his "vulnerable" patient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A disciplinary tribunal found Dr Adam Osborne's behaviour "profoundly unacceptable" and ruled his fitness to practise had been impaired.
Dr Osborne, the brother of Chancellor George Osborne, started the relationship with the woman in 2011.
The tribunal chairman said his actions were not "easily remediable".
Dr Nigel Callaghan said Dr Osborne's behaviour "undermines the public's confidence in the medical profession".
The psychiatrist had treated the woman for depression, anxiety and chronic fatigue at a private practice in London, between 2011 and 2014.
The tribunal heard Dr Osborne had begged, then threatened the woman after she complained to the General Medical Council (GMC) when he ended the relationship.
In one email he wrote: "If I get into trouble for this then I will never forgive you for this and I will make sure you pay."
Dr Callaghan said Dr Osborne had sent "inappropriate emails" when he knew the woman was in "a particularly vulnerable and fragile state".
The tribunal previously heard she had tried to take her own life two days after they broke up.
It will now decide whether to impose a sanction on the psychiatrist.
If they do, Dr Osborne could have conditions put on his registration, be suspended or be struck off.
