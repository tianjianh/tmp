[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have released the images of 12 more people they want to trace in connection with violence and disorder at the Scottish Cup Final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fans invaded the pitch at Hampden after Hibs beat Rangers 3-2 on 21 May.
Officers have already made 40 arrests over the disorder - most recently two men aged 18 and 27 who were arrested last week.
Anyone with information about the identities of those pictured is asked to contact the police.
Members of the public can send information to a dedicated email address - Scottishcupfinalpitchinvasion@scotland.pnn.police.uk.
Thousands of Hibs fans jumped the barriers at the final whistle after their team won its first Scottish Cup Final in 114 years.
A number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.
