Michael Gove moves to justice in post-election reshuffle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron is set to make Michael Gove the justice secretary and Chris Grayling leader of the Commons in his new Conservative government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicky Morgan will remain as education secretary and minister for equalities.
The PM, who secured the first Conservative majority since 1992, has already said his chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary and defence secretary will stay the same.
Former Immigration Minister Mark Harper is expected to be the new chief whip.
The Conservatives won a total of 331 seats at the general election, with Labour leader Ed Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage all resigning after the votes had been counted.
In other election developments:
The new appointments join Home Secretary Theresa May, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in Mr Cameron's government.
Michael Gove's appointment as justice secretary places him firmly at the top table of British politics.
It is a marked promotion from the job of chief whip, where he had been in charge of Conservative party discipline.
Mr Gove was removed as education secretary last year after repeated run-ins with the teaching unions and a reported spat with Home Secretary Theresa May - someone he will now have to work closely with once again.
As justice secretary, his responsibilities will include implementing the Conservative Party's pledge to scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.
The aim is to give the UK courts and Parliament - rather than European institutions - the final say in contentious cases.
On Twitter, Ms Morgan said she was "delighted" with her re-appointment, which Downing Street said was a "huge vote of confidence".
BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said the announcements were "a reward for loyalty" from Mr Cameron.
Making Mr Grayling, the former justice secretary, the Commons leader was a "gesture to the right wing of the party", she added.
Mr Gove, a former chief whip and education secretary, will be in charge of implementing the Conservatives' pledge to scrap the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.
He will also take on the role of Lord Chancellor.
A wider reshuffle is expected on Monday, with posts held by Liberal Democrats under the coalition yet to be filled.
As Mr Cameron finalises his new government, Labour is beginning the search for a new leader.
Shadow care minister Liz Kendall told the Sunday Times she was considering putting herself forward, adding that "we don't just need a new face. We need a fundamentally new approach".
Another likely frontrunner, Chuka Umunna, said Labour had appealed to its core voters, "but not to aspirational, middle-class ones".
Writing in the Observer, he said: "We talked about the bottom and top of society, about the minimum wage and zero-hour contracts, about mansions and non-doms. But we had too little to say to the majority of people in the middle."
Former Prime Minister Tony Blair told the Observer Labour needed to occupy the centre ground in order to win again, saying it needed to stand for "ambition and aspiration as well as compassion and care".
