The steel statue in the shape of a bent spoon had been placed on a large tree stump in Sonning earlier this month.
Geller, 68, who became famous for bending spoons, is believed to have since returned to his native Israel.
It is not clear who has taken the sculpture down, or why.
Following the unveiling, it emerged the sculpture did not have the necessary planning permission from Wokingham Borough Council.
The council said it was not involved in the removal and Thames Valley Police said it had not received a crime report.
The spoon has previously been targeted by graffiti and someone had even left a rude message and bag of dog poo on it.
Although Geller said it made him laugh, he warned that people should not leave dog mess lying around as it was "disgusting... and dangerous".
Nick Proctor, who cycled past the sculpture to and from work, said: "Every day it keeps changing - someone's defaced in it an exciting new way. Then I cycled past and discovered it had gone."
The large red artwork was unveiled as a parting gift to the Berkshire village of Sonning where Geller has lived for 35 years.
