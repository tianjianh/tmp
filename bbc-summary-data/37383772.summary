More than 2,000 endurance athletes will be taking on one of the most challenging courses in the sport, starting and finishing in Tenby.
They have to complete a 2.4 mile (3.8km) swim, a 112 mile (180km) bike ride and 26.2 mile (42km) run before the 17 hour cut-off time.
Thousands of spectators are expected and road closures are in place.
It is estimated Ironman Wales generates about Â£3.5m for the local economy and attracts 10,000 visitors to Tenby.
Ironkids kicked off the weekend events on Saturday. It saw more than 1,000 three to 14-year-olds take part in a fun run around Tenby town centre.
There was some disappointment earlier in the week for Tenby triathlete Oliver Simon, who had to withdraw from the main event with a foot injury.
Writing in his blog, he said: "I have trained all year on the course and not to be able to race and see how training has gone is the worst feeling for me."
Other names to look out for include former Wales rugby players Shane Williams, Ryan Jones and Ian Gough.
Kevin Stewart, managing director Ironman UK and Ireland said: "We're really looking forward to welcoming all the competitors and supporters from around the world to Tenby.
"Despite it being one of the toughest on the circuit it is also one of the firm favourites, due to it's phenomenal vibe and open armed welcome from the entire county of Pembrokeshire."
Ironman Wales and Pembrokeshire council have already reached an agreement which will see the event return for 2017.
