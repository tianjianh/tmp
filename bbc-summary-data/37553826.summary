Scotland v Lithuania: Robert Snodgrass keen to hear Bits and Pieces

Robert Snodgrass hopes rave hit "Bits and Pieces" will ring out around Hampden on Saturday so he can dance away the blues of poor club results.

The Artemesia tune was chosen by Scotland fans as the music to accompany goals during the World Cup campaign.
"I tell you what - there'll be some amount of carnage going on," the Hull City midfielder said about the prospect in the build-up to the home game with Lithuania. "I'm a fan of it.
"I'll be dancing as well."
More than 20,000 people voted in the Scottish FA survey, with the dance tune from 1995, which was more recently re-mixed by Scottish DJ George Bowie, winning.
It beat The Proclaimers' "(I'm Gonna Be) 500 Miles", which has most recently been played over the PA when Scotland score.
Having scored a hat-trick in Scotland's opening Group F victory away to Malta, Snodgrass is eager to trigger the music against Lithuania and make a statement about Scotland's prospect of qualifying.
"At club level, we've just got beat three on the bounce," he said of Hull's Premier League form. "So I'm desperate to get a win and I can't wait for the game to start.
"Because of how well we did in the last game, we want to build on that and it's at home and you want the home fans to see you mean business."
After entertaining Lithuania, Scotland travel to face Slovakia on Tuesday and Snodgrass agreed that four points from the two games would be the minimum target for his side.
"Focusing on two games, we obviously need to get off to a good start on Saturday," said the midfielder.
"They will be no mugs. It will be like the Malta game. They will be hard to break down, but we have to be ruthless, especially at home, because the fans have an expectation when you go away from home and win your first game convincingly.
"But I am not one for feeling pressure. I just enjoy playing football and enjoy being with the lads every day."
Snodgrass has shown excellent form after being sidelined for 15 months following an injury picked up when making his Hull debut in August 2014.
He missed much of Scotland's failed Euro 2016 qualification campaign and national assistant boss Mark McGhee again emphasised how highly the 29-year-old is regarded by head coach Gordon Strachan.
"I was there the day he got injured at Queens Park Rangers and I remember saying that, had he not got injured, I don't think his team would have got relegated that season," he said.
"That's how important he was to them and then he went out and scored a hat-trick in Malta and qualified that by showing how important he is to us.
"He is a brilliant player. He is such an important asset in and around the camp in the sense of taking the pressure off people.
"He will make a little joke in the dressing room. On the training ground, he's got a lovely rapport with the coaches. He is a great asset to the squad."
