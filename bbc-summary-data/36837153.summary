Port Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite has said Anthony Grant will only be allowed to leave if his "true value" is met after the midfielder submitted a written transfer request.

The former Crewe Alexandra player, 29, still has 12 months left of a two-year contract he signed last summer.
Grant scored once in 38 games as Vale finished 12th in League One last term.
"I consider him to be a major asset within the squad," Smurthwaite said in a statement.
Following a debate among fans on social media about about Grant's future, the chairman received an email from the player requesting a move.

"I was a little disappointed in this approach as, just before the end of last season and as recent as last week, I was having discussions with Anthony regarding extending his contract for one more year beyond this new season," Smurthwaite added.
"I would like to put on notice to all interested parties, including his recently-appointed agent, that I will not consider any offer other than his true value to the club; if these conditions are not achieved then Anthony will remain a Port Vale player until the end of his contract.
"Any contracted footballer cannot be approached directly without the parent club's permission and I confirm that no approach has been made for any other Port Vale player at the time of this statement."
Under new boss Bruno Ribeiro, Smurthwaite has overseen a major reshaping of the playing squad with 11 new players arriving so far this summer.
