West Ham striker Carlton Cole has accepted a Football Association charge for directing abusive comments towards a Tottenham supporter on Twitter.

Cole's expletive-laden response to the fan followed a 2-2 draw between the Hammers and Spurs on 22 February, a game he had played in.
An FA independent commission will now meet to decide his punishment.
In April 2011, Cole, 31, was fined Â£20,000 for comments he made on Twitter during England's friendly with Ghana.
On that occasion, he wrote: "Immigration has surrounded the Wembley premises! I knew it was a trap!
"The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/ the St George's flag!"
He later deleted the comments and apologised, describing them as a "light-hearted joke".
Cole has made 17 appearances for the Hammers this season and scored three goals.
