Riders sealed their place as British basketball's major force with Sunday's 84-63 play-off final win over Newcastle Eagles in London's O2 Arena.
It secured a second treble, having also won the league title and BBL Trophy.
"It's hard for me to think about any season that has been better," Paternostro told BBC Radio Leicester.
"I love this team. I love how we play and how hard we work.
"Trophies are awesome," said the 44-year-old American. "But any coach of any team in any sport wants a team who play hard and stay together.
"Although we jumped out into a big lead, I'm a notorious worrier. But there's no better feeling in a final than, with five or six minutes left, knowing it's going to your name on the trophy.
"And to do it in front of a crowd of 16-17, 000 in a world-class arena is the icing on top of a magical season."
Having already retained both the BBL Trophy in March and the BBL league title in April, this latest triumph, their second play-off final victory, became the ninth piece of silverware the club have won now in five seasons.
Paternostro was named as BBL coach of the year for the fourth time earlier this month.
