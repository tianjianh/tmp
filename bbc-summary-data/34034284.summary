Jack, Calum and Robbie Hudson have become the first siblings to swim the entire river course from the source at Mallerstang to the Solway Firth.
They were raising money for the Swimming Trust and completed the last leg at Port Carlisle on Sunday.
Calum Hudson, 25, said the final few days were made harder after he contracted an ear infection.
The trio trained for eight months for the challenge.
Calum, who lives in London, said: "I thought the hardest thing was getting up early and putting on a cold wet suit. But then I got a really bad ear infection about two days ago.
"So I found out that the combination of earache and spending 10 hours a day in cold river water were my two least favourite things."
Before the start, brother Jack, 23, who lives in Newcastle, said completing the swim with his brothers would be an "incredible achievement".
Robbie, 27, who lives in Berlin, added that the course had been "a challenge".
The brothers were all born in Yorkshire, but grew up in the Cumbrian village of Langwathby,
