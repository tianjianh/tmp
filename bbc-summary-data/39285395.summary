Robinson, 42, had been in interim charge at Fir Park following Mark McGhee's sacking last month.
Club chairman Jim McMahon described former Northern Ireland midfielder Robinson as the "outstanding candidate" who emerged from a five-man shortlist.
Robinson said he was honoured to be appointed and revealed his "mission" was a strong finish to the season reflected in their league position.
In his first game at the helm, former Oldham Athletic boss Robinson oversaw a 2-1 win over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, ending a run of four straight Scottish Premiership defeats.
"It was clear that Stephen was the outstanding candidate," McMahon told the Motherwell website.
"He has a real vision of what the club needed in the short, medium and long-term and a plan of how he would implement it. His values, skills and attributes matched exactly with the criteria we developed to be the manager of this football club and we wish him every success."
Robinson, Motherwell's 24th manager in their 131-year history, expressed delight at his appointment and said he aimed to help the club climb the table.
"I am absolutely delighted and proud to lead this football club, a club with a rich history in the Scottish game," he said.
"My mission from the board is absolutely clear. Firstly, to ensure the team have a strong finish to the SPFL Premiership season and finish as high as we possibly can between now and May.
"Then, to help shape the club going forward with a strong emphasis on hard-work, discipline and a real passion and desire for Motherwell FC that the fans can get behind and be proud of."
Speaking before the appointment was made, veteran striker Scott McDonald said Robinson would be a popular choice.
"We know what Robbo is all about - the majority of us do anyway," McDonald said last week. "It has always been a joy to work under him and work with him.
"As players, all we are concerning ourselves about is to do our best and do our job and, if we do that, we give Steve every possible chance of maybe taking the reins, which I think most boys would be more than happy with."
Robinson's first home match as manager will be Saturday's visit of St Johnstone, with the Steelmen currently in 10th spot in the table.
