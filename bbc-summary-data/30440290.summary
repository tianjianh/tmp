Three ways the crackdown on paedophiles will work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There's lots of talk about the start of a "global war" against online child abuse.

David Cameron says efforts to track and stop paedophiles will match the battle against terrorism.
A new global child protection fund is being set up to tackle the dark net, a "hidden" part of the internet where criminal activity can go untraced.
The UK is the first and "major" donor, contributing Â£50m over the next five years.
So what is the money being spent on? Here are the three main ways:
It will become illegal for an adult to ask anyone under 16 for a sexual image of themselves.
It's already an offence to exchange pictures with a child but the legal loophole on being able to ask for one is now being closed.
Anyone found guilty will face two years in jail.
Google, Facebook Twitter and Yahoo will use digital fingerprints to track down offending images and videos.
These firms will work with The Internet Watch Foundation to use these fingerprints, which are known as a "hash value."
New systems are also being developed to help warn children if the person they are chatting to online is not who they say they are.
It will monitor IP addresses and analyse the kind of words used by suspects to determine whether they are the age they claim to be.
Browsers will be blocked - so abusers won't be able to use the likes of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox to access web addresses where abusive material can be found.
GCHQ  (it stands for Government Communications Headquarters and gathers information by listening in on phone chats and looking at emails) will join up with the National Crime Agency.
Intelligence experts and organised crime specialists will share information to track abusers.
A recent example: a gang in the Philippines was found to be arranging the sexual abuse of children, then live-streaming it to paying customers in other countries. A British police officer examined a sex offender's computer and from there, the gang was tracked down and prosecuted.
Emma Hardy, from the Internet Watch Foundation, told Newsbeat: "What we need to do is work globally on this issue so we all need to work to take down child sexual abuse images - that's you sitting at home, and me.
"If you stumble across child sexual abuse images on the internet there is a defence for you in the law to report it.
"With every new bit of technology there is always scope for someone to work out how to abuse it in some way.
"But what we have to do is work with the big technology giants like Google and Facebook, using fingerprint technology and removing abusive images."
