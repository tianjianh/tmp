Darcey Bussell encourages future ballet stars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former principal ballerina of the Royal Ballet Darcey Bussell has her fingers in lots of pies these days, not least as a judge on Strictly Come Dancing.

But her first passion is ballet, and as president of the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD), Bussell is excited about the return of the prestigious Genee International Ballet Competition, which has come home to London after a five-year hiatus.
The Genee, named after the RAD's first president, Dame Adeline Genee, attracts top dancers aged 16 to 19 from across the globe, who are trained in the RAD syllabus.
The competition began in 1931 in London and was held there annually - bar the odd year where the contest didn't run - until 2002, when the RAD held the competition outside London for the first time, in Australia.
Since then it has travelled to countries including Canada, Singapore and South Africa.
Following a rigorous audition process, the 70 or so dancers selected each year have the chance to work with renowned choreographers and teachers for five days at Sadler's Wells before a select few perform at the semi-finals, and then the final - this Saturday - where they compete for a range of medals.
Past Genee medallists have gone on to dance for the Royal Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre and the English National Ballet, to name but a few.
But Bussell is keen to widen the talent pool, and for the first time this year, the RAD has offered nine bursaries - bearing Bussell's name - to dancers who would not otherwise be able to finance their trip to the competition.
The scheme is open to any individual from any country wishing to compete and will run for five years.
"There are lots of talented kids who can't afford to come to the competition. The bursary is to get them here.
"I'm excited - it's back in London, and it's bigger and better than ever.
"We intend to get nine (bursaries) every year, getting these kids the opportunity - there's so much talent out there that can't be seen."
Bussell never entered the Genee herself, but she did compete in Switzerland's Prix de Lausanne, where she unsurprisingly won a prize back in 1986.
So what do the Genee finalists get out of the competition?
"You're getting coached by the top teachers, you get to perform in a top opera house, Sadler's Wells. It's extraordinary for a kid that age - is this the life they want? And most of them are, like: 'Yes, yes, yes!'"
Bussell's message to young, aspiring dancers is simple: "If you love it, you can make it, you just need that determination.
"I didn't have everything going my way all the time, some people told me to give up - but I just loved it, it's either inside you or it's not."
Of course, ballet isn't the only thing on her mind at this time of year - series 13 of Strictly Come Dancing is just around the corner, having showcased its celebrity dancers and professional partners earlier this month.
"I'm very much looking forward to it - it's a really lovely group with a very positive vibe," enthuses Bussell.
Is it difficult to switch between ballet and ballroom?
"I like any social dance, ballroom and Latin. It would be wonderful if we could open up all those old ballrooms again.
"It's all about dance for me - as long as people are trying it out."
The final of the Genee International Ballet Competition will take place at Sadler's Wells in London on Saturday 19 September.
