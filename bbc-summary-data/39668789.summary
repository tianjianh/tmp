Anglesey's Rhosgoch solar farm decision set for delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on whether to build Wales' largest solar power farm is expected to be delayed until after the council elections.

The plans would see electricity-generating panels covering almost 90 hectares (222 acres) between Cemaes and Amlwch on Anglesey.
The 49.9MW development could produce enough electricity to power 15,500 houses - half the homes on the island.
But planners are being asked to defer a decision until after the 4 May vote.
The authority's head of regulation has told the council's planning committee that national guidelines means approving "contentious matters" should be avoided while campaigning is under way.
The proposals for the solar farm were first submitted by Countryside Renewables in February 2016.
But it has led to 100 objections about the scale of the project and the impact on the environment.
The site on farm land at Rhosgoch is already home to 22 wind turbines, towering 150ft (46m) over the landscape.
In March, a report by planning officers recommended allowing the solar farm to go ahead.
A decision on whether to defer the matter will be taken on Wednesday.
