The R&B star was not at his home at the time of robbery, which took place in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
Officials said the suspects, who were armed with handguns, got away from the Tarzana property with an unknown amount of money and some personal items.
Brown or his representatives have yet to comment on the matter.
According to reports, the 26-year-old was at a nightclub at the time of the incident.
It marks the second home invasion that Brown, the former boyfriend of pop star Rihanna, has suffered in recent months.
In May, he came home to another property to find a woman had allegedly broken in, cooked several meals and written "I love you" on walls.
Amira Ayeb, 21, subsequently pleaded not guilty to first-degree residential burglary, stalking and vandalism.
