Glenn Morris: Crawley Town goalkeeper signs contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crawley Town goalkeeper Glenn Morris has signed a contract extension to stay with the League Two club until the end of the 2018-19 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morris joined the Reds as a player-coach in May 2016 following his release by League One side Gillingham.
The 33-year-old has made 28 league appearances this season, keeping eight clean sheets.
"I think it's important that we push on and try to finish the season strongly," he told the club website.
"Then next season, with a lot of lads who are already here, we can hopefully push on."
