Repair funding for St Beuno's church spire, Gwyddelwern

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An historic church near Corwen in Denbighshire which closed four years ago because of falling masonry has received Â£123,000 to repair its spire.

St Beuno's in Gwyddelwern, which has plants growing out of its spire, will use the Heritage Lottery Fund grant for work on the spire, tower and roof.
Church wardens hope the work will allow the building to reopen for church services and community use.
A church is believed to have stood on the site since the seventh century.
Canon Martin Snellgrove, the rector of the Corwen group of parishes, said the appearance of the church was a central problem for the village.
"We haven't even got to get out of your car and get below 30mph to see that there are that there are trees growing out of the spire which have been there for some years and there has been lots of masonry falling off the top of the tower damaging the spire," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"On of the most regular effects [of the church being closed] is that the school children who usually cross the churchyard to get to the canolfan (centre) where they do various activities have to take the long route by the road because the church is closed because it's unsafe.
"The congregation is meeting in a committee room in the canolfan and we have had two funerals that I know of in the last year and one wedding that have had to be located elsewhere.
"It would be good to have our building back."
