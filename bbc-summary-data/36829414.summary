Jackson, 29, joined Rovers on a short-term deal from Barnsley in January and scored twice in 19 games for the Championship club last season.
He will help plug the gap left by Tom Bradshaw, who has moved to Oakwell in the pursuit of Championship football.
Jackson is Saddlers' boss Jon Whitney's ninth signing of the summer.
"I want to come here, play as many games as I can, score goals and cause defenders problems," Jackson told Walsall's website.
"It's a new challenge for me being a senior in the changing room, but from what I know and have seen in my short time here, the set-up looks really good.
"The club just missed out [on promotion] last season and hopefully they can learn from it and be up there again this year."
