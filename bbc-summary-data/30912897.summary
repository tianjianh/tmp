Instagram: The 'homeless' chief executive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cillin Perera travels a lot. As the chief executive of a couple of companies, he is constantly moving from one place to another and, like many others, has turned to photography to record his journeys and keep in touch with family and friends.

He began taking pictures on his phone and rediscovered his love of photography, something he had not done since his days at Harvard in the late 1990s.
Soon he was using an iPod to shoot, with the results being uploaded to Instagram under the name @homelessCEO - his username reflecting his nomadic existence.
Mr Perera uploads each day, using the regime as a way to get out of the hotel and see something of where he is in the world.
He notes that the in-flight pictures can be most challenging as the environment is the same. And with more than 160 flights in 2013, he has done well to find new angles.
You can hear Mr Perera talking about his pictures and what he is looking for in a frame in an interview with the BBC's Dan Damon on World Update.
Some years ago I shot a daily series to mark the end of Kodachrome. It's a routine that can be challenging but also a good way to keep your photography as part of your day-to-day routine. I'd be keen to hear from anyone shooting a project on a daily basis, sometimes known as a 365-day project. Email me.
