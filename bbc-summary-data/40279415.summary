[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shoes worn by Princess Diana fetch £1,800 at auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pair of shoes, thought to have been worn by Princess Diana when she was a nursery assistant, have fetched £1,800 at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The white leather, flat, peep-toe shoes had been expected to fetch up to £500.
A note from the princess, discussing meditation and French philosophy, written on Kensington Palace notepaper, made £1,400 at the sale in Cirencester.
A candid letter written by the Prince of Wales days after his separation from the princess made £360.
Dominic Winter Auctioneers described the shoes as having been left at the London house of an anonymous friend of Princess Diana in about 1977-78.
There are photographs of her wearing similar shoes while working as a kindergarten teacher aged about 19, they added.
She was 20 when she and Prince Charles married on 29 July 1981.
A candid letter written by Prince Charles in December 1992 on Royal Yacht Britannia-crested paper, was sent to interior designer Dudley Poplak two days after the formal separation of Charles and Diana had been announced.
In it he revealed his hopes of being appreciated "after I am dead" and how "awful" it had been living through "all the misinterpretation and the flak".
Three other letters written by Prince Charles made between £230 and £320.
