Rig salvage master to give talk to UHI students

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The salvage master in the operation to remove the rig Transocean Winner after it grounded on a Lewis beach has been invited to talk to students.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sylvia Tervoort, of Smit Salvage, has been invited by the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) to give a seminar on the operation.
Her 90-minute talk will also cover her involvement in refloating the wreck of the cruise liner Costa Concordia.
Transocean Winner ran aground in a storm while under tow off Lewis.
Ms Tervoort and her team used two tug boats to pull the 17,000 tonnes drilling rig off rocks at Dalmore beach, near Carloway, on the west side of Lewis.
The structure was then towed to a temporary anchorage on the east side of the island.
A decision on the future of the rig, which was destined for a yard in Turkey to be scrapped, has still to be taken.
Ms Tervoort will give her talk and answer questions in the seminar at Lews Castle College UHI in Stornoway on Wednesday.
After running aground in 2012, the Costa Concordia cruise liner lay partially submerged off the Italian island of Giglio for more than two years before it was refloated and scrapped.
