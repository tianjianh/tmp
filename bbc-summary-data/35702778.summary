The game was due to start at 18:00 GMT but the council expressed safety concerns about an early kick-off on St Patrick's Day and asked for the move.
United also reportedly favoured moving the kick-off.
European football's governing body has now agreed to a 20:05 GMT kick-off.
The first leg at Anfield is on Thursday, 10 March, at 20:05 GMT.
