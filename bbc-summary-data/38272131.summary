[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 1-0 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton were beaten for the first time in five league games as a Liam O'Neil goal earned struggling Chesterfield victory at the Proact Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
O'Neil swept home a shot from 15 yards in the 27th minute and although Bolton had chances to equalise, their finishing was wasteful.
The visitors had plenty of possession but Chesterfield defended strongly, although Zach Clough was just off target with a flick in the seventh minute and he also had other chances in the game.
O'Neil showed how to finish when he turned in a cross from Gboly Ariyibi but Bolton should have levelled two minutes before the break when Clough burst clear, only for Lloyd Allinson to make an excellent save on his home league debut.
Bolton controlled large parts of the second half but the finishing again let them down, with Clough firing over in the 66th minute.
Their last chance came in stoppage time when Jay Spearing could not keep his shot down from 10 yards.
