Dolly the sheep will have a blue plaque put up in Edinburgh, to acknowledge her contribution to science.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Born in 1996, Dolly was the first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell.
She is now the first sheep to be given a blue plaque, which links important historical figures with the buildings in which they lived and worked.
The plaque will read: "Dolly the Sheep, 1996-2003. First mammal to be cloned from an adult cell."
Organised by the Society of Biology, Dolly's plaque is one of ten to be put up around the UK during February and March "celebrating the eminent and sometimes unsung heroes of biology".
There are hundreds of blue plaques around the country.
Notable names to receive the honour include the actor Charlie Chaplin, the writer Agatha Christie and the creator of the Tube map, Harry Beck.
Dolly is not the first animal to receive a blue plaque. Nipper the HMV dog has one in Bristol.
The unveiling of Dolly's plaque, which will be installed at the Roslin Institute at the University of Edinburgh, will take place on Wednesday 25 February.
Sir Ian Wilmut, who was the lead researcher on the Dolly project, will be making a short speech.
Scientists aimed to let Dolly live as normal a life as possible and she was allowed to breed, giving birth to six lambs.
In 2001 she was shown to have arthritis. She died in 2003 having also developed lung disease.
Sheep of her breed, Finn Dorset, usually have an average life expectancy of 11 to 12 years.
