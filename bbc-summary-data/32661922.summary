A Conservative member of the Welsh assembly has resigned following her election as an MP in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Antoinette Sandbach took the safe Cheshire seat of Eddisbury with a majority of nearly 13,000.
She said it had been "a privilege to serve my constituents in north Wales for the last four years".
Janet Haworth will succeed her, having been the next name on the North Wales regional list for the Conservatives at the 2011 assembly election.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "Antoinette has been an exceptional Assembly Member and I wholeheartedly congratulate her on today's result.
"I know Antoinette will make an exceptional Member of Parliament and I wish her every success in the new role."
A Welsh Conservative spokesman said Mr Davies was due to meet another AM, Byron Davies, who beat Labour to win Gower, to discuss his future.
