The work at the former Stow College is part of a Â£80m campus development project being undertaken by GSA.
It is scheduled to be completed in time for it be in use in the academic year 2018/19.
The design is the work of BDP architects.
GSA director Prof Tom Inns said: "The Stow Building has been a distinctive part of Glasgow's educational landscape for over 80 years.
"BDP's design harnesses the full potential of the original 1930s building, with the new roof extension, while carefully considered to meet the very specific needs of fine art internally, plays tribute to Glasgow's industrial heritage externally."
BDP Scotland chairman and architect principal Scott Mackenzie added: "BDP is delighted to be part of the GTMS team working with the Glasgow School of Art to rejuvenate the former Stow College building as a School of Fine Art.
"This project not only brings new life to a cherished Glasgow landmark, but also provides the School of Fine Art with inspirational and truly world class teaching and learning spaces."
