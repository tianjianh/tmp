[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Calls have been made for a £2m centre to tackle substance misuse in Wrexham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Health officials want the Welsh Government to fund the work for the centre in Rhosddu Road as current facilities are "sub-standard".
Geoff Lang, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board's executive director of strategy, said new facilities would help "improve the physical health of our entire service user group".
Officials hope the centre would open within two years.
