Partick Thistle's top-six hopes were dented and Kilmarnock's relegation fears heightened with a goal-less Scottish Premiership draw at Firhill.

New Killie signing Miles Addison almost marked his debut with a goal but the post kept out his header.
Kris Boyd had a tap-in ruled out for offside straight after the break before Mathias Pogba's angled drive was also chalked off.
And Boyd blasted a great chance over the crossbar with 15 minutes remaining.

The Ayrshire side's advantage over bottom side Dundee United is reduced to five points, with the Tangerines winning away to St Johnstone and also having a game in hand against Thistle in midweek.
Killie manager Lee Clark said pre-match that he would be taking a "calculated risk" by starting Addison at the centre of defence when the Englishman was not 100% match fit, but the gamble almost paid off immediately.
Julien Faubert's fourth-minute free-kick found the ex-Peterborough man at the back post and he met it with a header that cracked off Tomas Cerny's near post.
Fresh from signing a new one-year contract, Australian midfielder Ryan Edwards blasted Thistle's first opportunity way over as the Jags tried to respond to the early pressure from their visitors.
Freddie Frans - the Belgian centre-half that Thistle boss Alan Archibald said was pleased to be back "home" in Glasgow after being in his native country when the bombings happened last month - headed high above the target from Sean Welsh's corner.
Kilmarnock had two former Jags in their starting line-up in the shape of Conrad Balatoni and Kallum Higginbotham, and the home fans certainly made them as uncomfortable as possible by booing most of their touches.
Thanks largely to the industry and flair of David Amoo down the right-hand side, Thistle began to take control.
The former Carlisle winger tormented Lee Hodson and on one occasion delivered an inviting cross that Pogba could only nod wide of Jamie MacDonald's upright.
Both teams had a goal disallowed for offside at the start of the second half - Boyd disappointed for Killie after Rory McKenzie's header hit the bar, while Pogba was left deflated for the hosts.
Thistle would have been ahead had Edwards' close-range effort not been blocked; then Callum Booth - who has played every minute of competitive action for the Jags this season - watched his shot get deflected over.
Boyd, known as a clinical finisher throughout his career, spurned a brilliant chance to win the match for Killie when he ballooned Josh Magennis's cut-back over from eight yards.
