The band will headline the Saturday night of the festival at Glanusk Park, Powys, on 21 August.
St Vincent, on Sunday, and Hot Chip, on Friday, have already been named as the event's other headliners.
Super Furry Animals are to play their first live dates in six years in May, including two gigs in Wales.
Festival director Fiona Stewart said: "Green Man have been waiting for the Furries to re-form for years and can't wait to welcome them to Wales' own Green Man in what promises to be a truly amazing homecoming show."
The band, fronted by Gruff Rhys, are also re-releasing their Welsh language album Mwng to mark its 15th anniversary.
A mini-tour starts on 5 May with two nights at Cardiff University's Great Hall.
The live dates also mark 20 years since the release of their debut record.
Other acts booked for this year's Green Man festival include Father John Misty, The Fall, and Television, who will play their 1977 album Marquee Moon in full.
Among the other prominent acts appearing are Public Service Broadcasting, The Staves, Charles Bradley, and the Sun Ra Arkestra.
Previous headliners have included legendary Belfast-born blues and rock singer Van Morrison, ex-Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, US singer-songwriter Patti Smith, Fleet Foxes, Jarvis Cocker and Doves.
Founded in 2003, Green Man has become one of the most popular alternative festivals.
In 2012 it won best "grass roots" event at the UK Festival Awards.
The festival, held annually near Crickhowell, was a sellout last year with about 20,000 people attending.
