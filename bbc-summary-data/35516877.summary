A Dutch cargo vessel that broke down off the west coast of Orkney on Saturday has been towed to the Moray Firth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 90m-long Schokland is carrying a cargo of wind turbine parts and lost power on Sunday near the island of Hoy.
The ship was towed through the Pentland Firth and down the east coast overnight by the Einar tug, owned by Orkney Islands Council.
A spokesman for the authority said the cargo ship had suffered engine failure.
