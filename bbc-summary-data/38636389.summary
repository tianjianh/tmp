[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victoria Cherry, 44, of Fulwood, Lancashire, has not been seen since October 2015.
A 43-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the search of a property in Toronto Street, Bolton, said Greater Manchester Police.
A spokesman said the investigation was being treated as a "non-body murder" and appealed for information.
Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: "The focus of our investigation has now changed and we remain keen to speak to anyone who may have any information about what has happened to Victoria.
"I am urging anyone who has any knowledge of Victoria's movements since her disappearance, or any information - no matter how insignificant you feel it may be - to please get in touch."
