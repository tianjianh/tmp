The Spaniard was handed a two-match ban by the SFA for the incident, and fined by the Highland club.
"With my poor behaviour, I let down the club, supporters and teammates," Lopez told the club's website.
"This was very out of character for me and I assure everyone that it won't be repeated."
Inverness chairman Kenny Cameron said: "We believe Dani's actions were indefensible. However, we've taken into account his apology and sincere regret for his inappropriate behaviour.
"He has assured us he has learnt a salutary lesson  with regard to his future conduct while with this club."
Lopez signed for Inverness in the summer and has scored once in nine senior appearances for the club.
"I would also like to extend my apology to St Johnstone FC," Lopez continued.
"In addition, I regret the stress caused to my family.
"As an experienced player in a relatively young squad, I should set a good example to others and on this occasion I failed to do so."
