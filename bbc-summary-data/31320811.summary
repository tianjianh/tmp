North, 22, appeared to be knocked out after clashing heads with team-mate Richard Hibbard in Cardiff.
Mathema said Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) medics will have access to video replays at future matches.

"Having seen it since, he should definitely have been removed," he said.
"At that moment it was clear to see that he had a momentary loss of consciousness and, because of that, irrespective of him having no signs or symptoms, we've been dealing with George North as a concussion.
"We've seen where our protocols need to improve."
North has passed all tests for concussion and could play against Scotland at Murrayfield on Sunday.
The Northampton player left the field for eight minutes during the first half after receiving an accidental kick to the head, but was allowed to resume playing after showing no sign of concussion.
The incident with Hibbard was picked up by television cameras but was not seen by the Welsh Rugby Union medical staff, who did not have access to a video feed.

"All I saw was George North getting up off his knees when I arrived at the scene," said Mathema, who was pitch-side at the time.
"He was completely lucid and conversing spontaneously with me. At that time I deemed him fit to play."
Mathema said the WRU has responded to a request from World Rugby, the sport's governing body, for an explanation of North's treatment.
A decision on whether North will be available against Scotland, who lost their opening game 15-8 in France, will be made by Wales this weekend.
Mathema added: "Today he has been evaluated and he has shown no signs of any concussion and, because of that, he's started his return-to-play protocol already and there's been no issues.
"He has to go through that process for the rest of the week, having a step-by-step increase in his activity."
