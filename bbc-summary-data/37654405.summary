Flood sirens have sounded as the "biggest ever" training exercise has been held in parts of West Yorkshire inundated by flooding in December 2015.

The exercise was carried out in Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Mytholmroyd, Sowerby Bridge, Elland and Brighouse.
About 2,700 homes were flooded along with more than 4,400 businesses in the area in 2015, said Calderdale Council.
Scenarios played for the exercise included a mock rescue of casualties from a sinking canal boat.
Operation Calderdale16 was its biggest ever live training exercise, the council said.
The Environment Agency has eight flood sirens to warn the upper Calder valley when rivers are expected to flood.
The sirens sounded for about two minutes during the exercise.
