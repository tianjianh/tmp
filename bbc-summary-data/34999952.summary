OCD treatment provision in Wales 'woefully inadequate'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An expert on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder says patients in Wales are receiving a poor treatment service, with long waits to see specialists.

Prof Paul Salkovskis, who runs an NHS clinic treating patients from across the UK, said services for Welsh patients were "woefully inadequate".
He said families had to fight for treatment referrals for the anxiety-related condition.
The Welsh government wants appropriate interventions to be offered.
But speaking to BBC Wales' Newyddion 9, Prof Salkovskis said health boards in Wales needed to address problems with OCD treatment and referral, and to invest in what he described as "care pathways" - bespoke treatment plans for individuals.
"The provision of specialist treatment in Wales for OCD is extremely poor," he said.
"My perception of the cases I've seen in Wales - and this is a small number and may not be atypical - but my perception is that there is no care pathway in place, and that the treatment people are receiving is woefully inadequate."
The Centre for Specialist Psychological Treatments of Anxiety and Related Problems headed by Prof Salkovskis is one of just five clinics in the UK specialising in treating OCD conditions.
However, the psychologist said authorisation for referral must come from a Welsh health board - and that takes too long.
"I don't think I've seen any referral authorised in less than a year," said the expert.
The charity that offers support to patients with the condition, OCD-UK, was also critical.
"OCD-UK remain concerned that the level of understanding mental health professionals have about OCD in Wales is lacking, with patients often receiving poor quality treatment," said chief executive Ashley Fulwood.
Responding to the criticism, an official for the Welsh government said: "We expect all Welsh health boards and mental health service providers to be able to offer appropriate interventions according to the clinical need of the individual."
The Welsh government spokesman said the budget for mental health service in Wales accounts for 11% of the whole NHS Wales budget.
"In addition, earlier this year the health minister announced an extra £15.6m will be invested every year in mental health services in Wales, taking the total investment to more than £600m," they added.
