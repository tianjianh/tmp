[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bookkeeper admits £60,000 embezzlement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bookkeeper embezzled £60,000 from her employer and spent the money on cars, foreign holidays and jewellery, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Catherine Bryceland took the money from Raymond Gloag Painters and Decorators in Dundee over an 18-month period.
She admitted the charges on the third day of her trial before a jury at Dundee Sheriff Court.
The trial heard that company owner Raymond Gloag was left "hurt" when the fraud came to light.
Fiscal depute Donna Brown told the court that Bryceland left the firm in 2010.
Ms Brown said: "The accused was employed as a bookkeeper for around 10 years at the company.
"She transferred money to her own bank accounts.
"The amateur nature of the embezzlement came to light when new accountants looked at records and when her bank accounts were examined later."
Ms Brown said that Bryceland made cheques payable to herself and that Mr Gloag would sign his name to blank cheques.
She said: "The £60,000 was used to buy cars, holidays and jewellery.
"To date no money has been repaid."
Bryceland, 50, of Wellgrove Street, Dundee, had denied embezzling £192,000 from the firm.
However, on the third day of her trial, the Crown accepted her guilty plea to embezzling £60,000 from the company between July 2007 and December 2008.
Sheriff Michael Fletcher was told there was no prospect of Bryceland repaying the money.
He deferred sentence until next month for social work background reports and released Bryceland on bail.
