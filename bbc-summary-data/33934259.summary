An airline passenger has been billed for Â£2,716 for costs incurred due to his behaviour on a flight to Ibiza from Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie Ferguson, 21, was arrested by Spanish police following alleged threatening behaviour towards cabin crew on the 13 July Jet2.com flight.
The crew had to give statements to police which led to a two-hour delay to the return flight.
Jet2.com also had to pay extra ground handling, airport and security charges.
Phil Ward, managing director of Jet2.com, said: "Mr Ferguson's behaviour was completely unacceptable. He showed no respect towards our cabin crew or fellow passengers.
"His anti-social actions not only meant a delay for the 179 passengers returning to Glasgow, an additional 337 of our customers suffered delays to their holiday flights that day because of him.
"As part of our Onboard Together programme we are committed to taking the necessary action to stamp out disruptive passenger behaviour on our flights and that includes billing troublemakers like Mr Ferguson for delay costs."
The airline has also issued Mr Ferguson with a lifetime ban and is pursuing legal action against him in the Spanish courts.
