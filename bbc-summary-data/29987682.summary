Flood warnings as more rain set to hit Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flooding alerts are being issued as bad weather is set to continue this week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) warn that the already saturated ground could encourage localised floods if rain persists.
Heavy showers are expected to reach Wales on Monday evening and are likely to be heaviest across south Wales.
NRW are advising people to take extra care on roads because of flooding caused by blocked drains.
South-west Wales was the badly hit by storms this weekend, with several flooding incidents in Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion following a yellow "be aware" warning for the South Wales coast.
