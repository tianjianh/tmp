[SN]TITLE[SN]
Huddersfield Town 2-1 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nahki Wells pounced on an error by Bristol City goalkeeper Frank Fielding to help Huddersfield Town end their five-game winless run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fielding's failure to control a backpass - minutes after he escaped a red card despite handing outside the area - allowed Wells a tap-in finish.
Elias Kachunga nodded the hosts ahead early on from a Tommy Smith cross.
Tammy Abraham punished Town's inability to clear a set-piece with the leveller, only for Wells to snatch the winner.
Huddersfield's first victory since a 1-0 triumph over Derby County on 22 October moved the West Yorkshire club up to fourth in table, while defeat saw the Robins slip to 13th.
David Wagner's Terriers, who could have been leapfrogged by the Robins if defeated at the John Smith's Stadium, looked positive throughout, with Fielding making two fine saves either side of the break - first to deny a deflected shot from Rajiv van La Parra in the first half and then later from Aaron Mooy when City were 2-1 down.
The opening goal came after some fine link-up work between Kachunga and Smith, ending with the striker heading home from close range.
Abraham's 13th goal in all competitions this season drew heavy criticism from the home fans as Aaron Wilbraham appeared to be offside as he rolled the ball past goalkeeper Danny Ward and into the path of the on-loan Chelsea striker to finish.
Wells, who was through one-on-one with Fielding when the goalkeeper handled the ball outside the area, was again onto the keeper quickly to score the decisive goal soon after.
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:  "I am very happy for Nahki. The goal came from a mistake by the goalkeeper but Nahki chased down the keeper and deserved that.
"Nahki works very hard and he had a role in the first goal when he made a run to open up the space for Elias.
"The players performed very well against a very hard opponent and we are very happy and proud.
"This was a massively huge win for us - 20 games have gone and we have 10 wins, which is fantastic. But we can only celebrate for a few minutes before we focus on the next game."
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson: "He (Fielding) has kept us in games and won us games. It was a mistake but I don't want to dwell on it.
"I have no complaints about the result. I felt we were in the game right into the second half.
"It hurts when you lose and we have lost too many away from home this season. The atmosphere is against you but then that's the case in every away game.
"It is disappointing and frustrating and we just didn't play our game. We have to be better."
