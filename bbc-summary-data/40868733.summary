Goalscorer Pheobe Richards said: "It was a stressful game for our part.
"We didn't really play as well as we did in the previous game, but we showed a lot of resilience because we stuck to the process.
"We knew fitness wise, if we got to the fourth quarter still at a draw, then we would be fine and it showed in the end."
Captain Abi Welsford and Leah Wilkinson joined Wales hockey legend Anne Ellis on a record 138 caps.
Welsford added: "If we had written it beforehand, that might be what we did - qualify for the semi finals with a game to spare - you can't really ask for much more than that.
"But we know we've got an awful lot to work on if we want to do well in the semi finals."
