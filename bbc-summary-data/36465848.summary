Technical issues at St George's in Tooting, south London, were reported at about 17:00 BST and resolved by 19:40.
A spokeswoman said the cause was not yet known and that an investigation had been launched.
One woman described it as "chaos", adding: "We have been here for eight hours. We still have not got a bed and we are waiting for X-ray results."
The patient, who did not want to be named, added: "I did hear a doctor say, 'I have never worked in a hospital before where all the computers have gone down'.
The hospital said the emergency department remained open and provided a "full service".
