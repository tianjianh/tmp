Christi and Bobby Shepherd, of Horbury, near Wakefield, were unlawfully killed by fumes from a faulty boiler in a Thomas Cook bungalow in 2006.
Wakefield MP Mary Creagh has secured a debate on Tuesday and plans to set out how the family were failed by the firm.
She called for a Europe-wide campaign to improve carbon monoxide safety.
"As British families get ready for their summer holidays, they want to know they will come home safely," Mrs Creagh said.
She is "pressing" Thomas Cook and the UK government to lead a safety campaign.
"Having worked with the family for the past five years, their dearest wish is that no other family suffers a similar tragedy," she said.
The Labour MP met Thomas Cook's new chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, on Tuesday ahead of the debate.
Thomas Cook was criticised for its treatment of the family after the deaths of Christi, seven, and Bobby, six.
It accepted nearly Â£3m in compensation for legal expenses and lost revenue.
Later the firm apologised to the family and gave Â£1.5m to children's charity Unicef.
Former chief executive Harriet Green was awarded a shares bonus worth about Â£5.7m, but said she would donate a third to charities chosen in consultation with the children's parents.
Justin King, former Sainsbury's boss, will lead an independent review into Thomas Cook's health and safety and crisis management practices.
In May, it was announced that the bungalow at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel would be demolished.
