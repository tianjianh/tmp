The assaults happened on buses in Lewisham and Southwark, south-east London.
Each of the women's descriptions match a man who was wearing a hooded jacket.
A man, described as black and in his 20s with short black hair and stubble, intentionally fell on to the women before groping them, police said.
He was wearing baggy blue jeans and a black bomber jacket, with a white fur trim on the hood.
The latest attacks occurred on Friday 27 January.
At 15:15 GMT a man intentionally fell on to and groped a 17-year-old girl on the 176 bus.
Later, at about 17:00, a 13-year-old girl reported being sexually assaulted on the number 363 bus.
Another girl of the same age, reported a man matching the same description making her feel uncomfortable by engaging in a conversation.
At 17:50, a man touched the knee of a 15-year-old girl on a 171 bus at Catford train station. Frightened, she got off the bus but he followed her and groped her before she managed to flee.
The first attacks were on a 22-year-old and a 17-year-old, on a number 12 bus in Dulwich at about 21:30 on 24 January.
Det Con Alex Price said: "We are keen to trace the suspect carrying out these despicable attacks on young girls and women in public.
"Five victims have been targeted by this man and we believe there could be many more victims who are yet to come forward."
He urged anyone with information to contact police.
