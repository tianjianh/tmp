Carr, who plays forensic examiner Clarissa Mullery, was with her personal assistant when the assault happened near London's Euston station.
A man has been detained under the Mental Health Act, police said.
"Thanks to everyone who has sent their love and good wishes following last week's stabbing," Carr said.
"Just to reassure you that whilst it was very frightening at the time, I came out of it relatively unscathed and was even back home later that night.
"Looking forward to returning to filming on Silent Witness next week where thankfully all the violence is fake!"
The 45-year-old, who uses a wheelchair, suffered minor cuts. Both women were taken to hospital and later discharged.
She also tweeted: "I want to say an extra thank you to the amazing paramedics, ambulance crew & A&E staff #SaveTheNHS."
The incident happened on 10 August. A Scotland Yard spokesperson said: "A man - aged in his 20s - was arrested at the scene on suspicion of GBH.
"He was taken into custody at a north London police station. He was subsequently detained under the Mental Health Act."
Carr, also a comedian whose recent work includes Assisted Suicide: The Musical, has been using a wheelchair since she was seven.

Carr replied by thanking Fox for "all the love today and always".
