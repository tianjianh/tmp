Twitter troll victim: More should be done to punish them

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"We've sucked at dealing with trolls, and we've sucked at it for years."

The chief executive of Twitter Dick Costolo didn't exactly hold back in a leaked memo to staff.
Charles Sherwin went on ITV's Take Me Out in 2012 looking for love, but ended up with a string of abuse from Twitter trolls.
Now the farmer's told Newsbeat the site needs to do more to punish trolls, and stop them ruining it for everyone else.
The Cheshire lad remembers getting some pretty nasty tweets.
"They said that my farm wanted burning down, and my cows wanted poisoning.
"When someone wants to knife and kill you, that's the worse anybody can be told."
Twitter's boss is worried they could be driving users away, and Charles only uses Facebook now, as he thinks it's safer.
"It made my whole experience of Take Me Out, which is a really good show, very unbearable at the time.
"I don't know why the trolls go at people, they do it to all the stars and it's a great shame really, because it's spoiling what is probably a good service.
"More action should be taken to stop these sorts of people and punish them because it can be very threatening."
Years on, and despite no longer being on Twitter, Charles is still scared.
"I still get recognised when I go out, and in the back of my mind I think, 'Are they the people that put the nasty remarks on Twitter? Are they going to hurt me?'
"I didn't get the police involved, because they're untraceable really."
Despite everything though, Charles hasn't lost any optimism on the relationship front.
"The trolls made it out that I was such a bad person, and I'm just a happy go lucky farmer lad who loves his cows and is looking for love."
Twitter told Newsbeat that they're "not commenting on this one", but pointed us to their recent blog telling us to expect "new enforcement procedures for abusive accounts".
