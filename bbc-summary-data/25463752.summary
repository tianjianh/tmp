One highlight of the #bbcnwtlive day was a live stream of the NWT gallery during the 18:30 broadcast to viewers in the north-west of England.
It was the day Lee Rigby's killers were convicted of murder and a large part of the show was broadcast from the soldier's home town of Middleton.
The full 30-minute broadcast of the gallery, with an inset of what TV viewers saw, is available on this video.
