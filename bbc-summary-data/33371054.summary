An investigation into the blaze, which broke out on Saturday at the Virador site at Dimmer, has been launched.
The surface fire, which was tackled by 11 fire crews at its height, has now been fully put out and the site capped with soil, the firm said.
A spokeswoman said it would be examining records of what had recently been dumped at the site.
