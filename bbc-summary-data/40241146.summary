[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Blackford is likely to stand to be the SNP's new Westminster leader, BBC Scotland understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The position became vacant after Angus Robertson lost his seat in the general election.
SNP sources say Mr Blackford, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, has the backing of a number of MPs in the Westminster group.
Other names being linked with the post include Joanna Cherry, Tommy Sheppard and Stephen Gethins.
Mr Blackford's supporters say he is popular in the party and would help reconnect with rural communities.
Sources close to Joanna Cherry, the MP for Edinburgh South West, say she is also "seriously considering" running for the job.
The SNP won the general election in Scotland, despite losing 21 seats. They will start the new parliament with 35 MPs.
Mr Robertson lost his Moray seat to the Conservatives' Douglas Ross after Thursday's vote.
Meanwhile the 13 Scottish Conservative MPs are due to meet in Westminster on Monday morning.
