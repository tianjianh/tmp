The 18-year-old midfielder has been on trial at Deepdale since departing former club Cork City in November.
Browne is a Republic of Ireland youth international and has captained his country's Under-19 side.
"Alan can play a big role this season. He's got fantastic energy about him, is two-footed and is a goal-scoring midfielder - we think he has a bright future," said manager Simon Grayson.
