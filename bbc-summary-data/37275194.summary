[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ironmen are playing under a new name having competed for the past decade as South Wales Scorpions.
The club are also relocating to Wern Sports Park, the home of Merthyr RFC.
Byrne helped Wales win rugby union's Six Nations Grand Slam in 2008, while he also played for Ospreys, Newport Gwent Dragons and Clermont Auvergne.
The 36-year-old retired from playing in April 2015 after failing to recover from a shoulder injury.
His appointment is due to be followed by news of player recruitment, with the Ironmen set to announce signings from Australia and New Zealand on Tuesday.
The club will play in League One of the Kingstone Press League, two tiers below the Super League, in 2017.
