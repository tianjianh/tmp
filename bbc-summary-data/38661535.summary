The Rugby Football Union's Professional Rugby Injury Report, first commissioned in 2002, found the overall likelihood of a player getting injured was lower than in any previous season.
But concussion incidents increased 7%.
The RFU said increased awareness and improved management had contributed.
Its chief medical officer, Simon Kemp, said: "The continued rise in the number of reported concussions in the professional game continues to be an area of priority focus for everyone involved in the game.
"Medical staff are all working extremely hard to ensure that we are identifying and managing this complex injury well."
The report also found:
From 3 January, World Rugby changed its protocol regarding high tackles during play.
Players making contact with an opponent's head in "reckless tackles" will now be shown a yellow card, and will be punished even if the tackle starts below the shoulders.
If head contact is accidental - for example, if a ball carrier slips into a tackle - a penalty will be awarded.
World Rugby says the new rules "aim to change culture in the sport to ensure that the head is a no-go area".
