The tree had to be felled in order for the bird, which had escaped from an aviary on a farm in Pontycymer, Bridgend County, on Monday, to be rescued
A specialist unit from Newport were called to assist local firefighters in the rescue.
It took almost three hours and followed a request for help from the RSPCA.
Earlier, police warned people to be on the lookout for the "large and powerful" bird which had flown with its jesses - leather straps for birds of prey - still attached.
Officers advised the public not to approach the bird, which has a 6ft 5in (1.95m) wingspan and weighs 16lb (7.2kg), but to call police on 101.
Wildlife and environmental crime officer PC Mark Goulding said: "The golden eagle is a captive breed and familiar with humans, however, it is a very large and powerful bird and so should not be approached.
"When the eagle escaped it had only just been fed, so it is likely it will only show itself when it becomes exhausted and hungry, which could take up to 10 days.
He added: "I would ask people to remain vigilant and call us if they see the animal.
"Although the eagle does not offer a threat to public safety, please do not try to capture it if you see it.
"Only professional and experienced bird handlers should approach the eagle."
Golden eagles are usually associated with North America, but they are also present in Eurasia and parts of Africa.
According to the RSPB, the species also lives in the open moorlands and mountains of Scotland, favouring islands and remote glens.
