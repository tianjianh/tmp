Firth, who will transfer from ITM Cup side Counties Manukau, made two appearances for the Chiefs in Super Rugby last season.
"We've been tracking Jarrod for some time in the ITM Cup," Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend said.
"He's built a very good reputation as a strong scrummager."
Townsend added: "Initially, he'll be working with our conditioning staff as we start to get him integrated into the rugby we aspire to play.
"Jarrod has made a big commitment in coming to Scotland and we believe he'll fit in really well at Scotstoun and add further competition in our front row."
Firth, who has made 25 appearances for Counties Manukau over the last three seasons, said: "Everyone I spoke to had great things to say about the club and the city, so I jumped at the chance to get over here.
"Glasgow have had a few Kiwis before and they've always done well, so there is no reason why I can't be successful too."
Firth knows Warriors scrum-half Grayson Hart, having faced him in New Zealand.
"I played against Grayson in my younger days and it's good to see him doing well here," he said.
"I hope I can earn the chance to pull on the jersey."
