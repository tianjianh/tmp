Both players are now contracted with the Super League side until the end of the 2020 season, with the option of an extra year in the club's favour.
Marshall, 21, signed full-time with Wigan ahead of the 2017 campaign and has scored 11 tries in 12 games.
Davies, 20, spent 18 months in the Warriors academy before moving up to the first team in 2016.
"I am so pleased that both these young players have committed their immediate futures to Wigan and repaid the loyalty the club has shown to them," said head coach Shaun Wane.
"Liam has a great skillset and is a very natural player, while Tom has shown a desire to succeed that I've only seen in a couple of players during my career."
