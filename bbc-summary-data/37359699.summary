Wayne Madsen and Harvey Hosein shared a 143-run stand to rescue Derbyshire after a second-innings collapse on day three against Leicestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Captain Mark Cosgrove was left stranded on 95 not out as Leicestershire were dismissed for 245 - a deficit of 60.
Derbyshire fell to 57-5 after Clint McKay (2-61) struck in the first over.
But Madsen's unbeaten 134 and a second fifty of the match from Hosein (58) helped the hosts to 286-8 in their second innings, leading by 346.
