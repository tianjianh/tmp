Pro12: Cardiff Blues v Scarlets (Fri)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales centre Cory Allen will make his first start of the season as one of three Cardiff Blues changes for the New Year's Day Pro12 derby with Scarlets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dan Fish returns at full-back, while Jarrad Hoeta starts in the second row.
Visitors Scarlets welcome Wales scrum-half Gareth Davies back to their starting line-up after a calf problem.
That means Aled Davies is named among the replacements, along with Wales hooker Emyr Phillips, who has been selected as back-row cover.
And with Jake Ball (knee) and John Barclay (forearm) both injured, Tom Price and Jack Condy come into the Scarlets pack.
Blues' other positional switch will mean Phys Patchell moving to fly-half.
Australia international prop Salesi Ma'afu, who joined on 18 December, is not named in the home side's squad.
