No job should be "off limits" to women, a Welsh government minister has said.

The message comes as leading sports stars, engineers and scientists seek to inspire girls in Wales to take up careers in male-dominated industries.
Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths said "barriers" blocking women from better-paid jobs needed tackling.
More than a hundred 16 to 18-year-old girls will get advice on reaching the top at the event at Wrexham's Glyndwr University on Friday.
Those taking part in the conference include Alison Westcott, a mechanical design engineer at technology firm Raytheon, Royal Air Force computer programmer Corporal Clare Loughran and Paralympian archer Pippa Britton.
Wales' Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Julie Williams and Alison J McMillan, a professor in aerospace technology at Glyndwr University, will also be involved.
Ms Griffiths said: "The achievements of the women at today's event show us no job is off limits to women and girls.
"However, it is important to hear about the obstacles successful women have faced along the way.
"We must acknowledge and address these barriers if we are to stop women from being shut out of certain careers and under-represented in many of our better-paid jobs."
Prof McMillan said the insights of women can "lead to profound changes".
"Women's contribution in innovation means the development of products that improve women's and men's lives, and make a real difference to the profitability of a company," she added.
