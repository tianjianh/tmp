On display are many of Ikea's famous designs and products, from meatballs to bookshelves.
The museum is located on the site where founder Ingvar Kamprad opened the first store in 1958.
The global furniture store now operates in 25 countries with €21.5 billion (£17.7 billion) in annual sales.
The Ikea museum will also feature a temporary exhibit that will change throughout the year. The initial theme will focus on life around the kitchen.
Mr Kamprad is renowned for having shown business acumen from an early age, making him one of the richest men in the world.
But Swedish author Elisabeth Asbrink, revealed more controversial details of the founder's past in a book in 2011.
Ms Asbrink said Mr Kamprad actively recruited people to the fascist Sweden's Socialist Union, prompting the security police to set up a file on him when he was 17 - in the same year he founded Ikea.
The Swedish billionaire has said his involvement was youthful "stupidity", and the "greatest mistake" of his life.
