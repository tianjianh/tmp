Some of the pylons for Anglesey's planned Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station will follow a route close to existing power lines.

National Grid has consulted on routes for the cables to run between the station and to the east of Llangefni.
It said its chosen route would "keep the effects of the new connection" as low as it could.
Plans to connect Wylfa Newydd at Cemaes Bay to a substation at Pentir, Gwynedd, have proved controversial.
Campaigners have been concerned about the impact of pylons on the countryside.
Last year, the National Grid said it would use underground cables instead of pylons under the Menai Strait between Anglesey and the mainland.
It has also confirmed up to three miles (5km) of underground cables with no pylons close to Gaerwen and Bangor.
For the latest section of the route, the National Grid said it had taken feedback into consideration following a consultation.
"People said if an overhead line was progressed, that we should keep close to the existing line," it added in a statement.
The National Grid has published an interactive map showing the proposed routes of the power cables.
