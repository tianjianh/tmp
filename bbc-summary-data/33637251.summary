Two schools destroyed in an arson blaze on the Isle of Wight will be temporarily moved to a primary school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Island Learning Centre in Lake will relocate to Hunnyhill Primary School in Newport from September.
The centre housed two schools for students between five and 16 who are unable to access mainstream education.
Head teacher Tom Pegler said: "This has been a disastrous event for our children, who are some of the most vulnerable children on the island."
The fire broke out shortly after midnight on Friday 17 July.
Police said a school minibus had caught fire and flames spread to the building that houses two schools, Clatterford Tuition Centre and Thompson House.
Isle of Wight Council said the relocation of the centre was a "short-term solution", but that Hunnyhill would be refurbished to meet the needs of the Island Learning Centre.
Mr Pegler said: "After the devastating events of last week, I feel very grateful and pleased that we have managed, with the Isle of Wight Council, to find a workable solution to our relocation so quickly.
"I am so impressed and grateful for how the community is rallying round to ensure these children have a school to go to in September."
The Island Learning Centre will be demolished "imminently", the council said.
A 16-year-old boy from the Isle of Wight was arrested on suspicion of arson and later bailed.
