[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Peak District will become the first UK National Park to have its trails and hard-to-reach locations captured on Google's Street View technology.

Images will be recorded through Google Trekker equipment - backpacks fitted with a 15-angle-lens camera.
The Peak District became the UK's first National Park 63 years ago.
Google has marked the anniversary by posting an image of the Salt Cellar - an unusually shaped gritstone tor on Derwent Edge - on its front page.
Peak District National Park chief executive Jim Dixon said: "It is amazing to think that, thanks to technology, many more people will be able to enjoy the outstanding natural beauty of the Peak District.
"The Trekker will help bring the Peak District to life online and hopefully inspire families to come and enjoy a walk or a cycle ride in the most beautiful landscapes."
The Trekker equipment is designed to capture locations the Street View car and tricycle cannot reach.
Previous locations captured by the technology include the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal.
Peak District staff expect to start filming in May and June, and the images will appear on Google Maps in June or July.
The locations to be captured will include all of the Peak District's traffic-free routes, including the Tissington, High Peak, Monsal and Thornhill trails.
The views at Stanage Edge, where Kiera Knightley daydreamed of Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, will also be stored.
The Derwent Valley - where the World War Two Dambusters raid was rehearsed - will also feature.
