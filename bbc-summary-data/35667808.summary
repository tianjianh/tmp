The 18-year-old is yet to make his first-team debut for Boro, but was a regular in the under-19s' UEFA Youth League campaign.
The Hartlepool-born player is available for the weekend's game against Crewe.
"I'm delighted to have Harry join us, he is an exceptional talent," Barnsley's acting head coach Paul Heckingbottom told the club website.
