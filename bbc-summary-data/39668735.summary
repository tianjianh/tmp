Twenty people were hurt - including two people each blinded in one eye - in the attack at the Mangle E8 club on Monday.
Police said the men, aged 21 and 24, were arrested in separate properties in north London on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.
They are still urging Arthur Collins, from Hertfordshire, to hand himself in.
The 25-year-old is the boyfriend of The Only Way is Essex star Ferne McCann, who has urged him to go to a police station.
The Metropolitan Police said a man and a 22-year-old woman both lost their sight in one eye while other people were treated for severe burns following the attack at the club in Hackney.
Det Insp Lee McCullough, who is leading the investigation, said it was continuing "to move at great pace and the net is closing in on those we believe to be responsible".
He added: "My team is acting on a number of leads to bring in those wanted for questioning in relation to this awful incident."
The officer said "anyone found harbouring those wanted for questioning by police can expect a knock at the door and could well find themselves under arrest".
The noxious substance used has not yet been confirmed but samples retrieved from the scene have been sent for analysis.
Three people had been earlier arrested as part of the investigation.
A 33-year-old woman, held on suspicion of firearms offences, has been released on bail, while a 54-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman held on suspicion of cultivation of cannabis after police officers found a suspected cannabis farm and suspected illegal firearms at Mr Collins' home in Broxbourne have been released under investigation.
Scotland Yard believe the acid was sprayed at two men, but hit others, following a dispute between two groups.
Two of the injured men - and 24-year-old and a 29-year-old - remain in a specialist burns unit hospital in Essex, both in a serious but stable condition.
The acid attack is one of three similar reports made to police in London over the past week.
On Good Friday a carjacking victim was sprayed with a "noxious substance" in Bow, while an 18-year-old man suffered what have been described as possibly life-changing injuries when he and another woman had a corrosive substance thrown over them in Fulham.
