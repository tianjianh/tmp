[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torino 3-1 Roma

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England keeper Joe Hart produced a string of fine saves to help Torino beat Roma in a Serie A home game for the first time since 1990.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hart, on loan from Manchester City, denied his former team-mate Edin Dzeko three times in an entertaining match.
Andrea Belotti put Torino ahead before Iago Falque's penalty made it 2-0.
Roma struck back when Francesco Totti, who turns 40 on Tuesday, scored his 250th Serie A goal from the spot before Falque's looping shot sealed victory.
Falque is on a season-long loan at Torino from Roma.
Hart had kept clean sheets in his previous two appearances for his Italian club, against Pescara and Empoli, but both matches had ended in draws.
The 29-year-old looked on course for a third clean sheet after frustrating Roma, and Dzeko in particular.
Dzeko, who helped City win two Premier League titles and the FA Cup during five years in Manchester, looked set to open the scoring in the fourth minute but Hart was quickly off his line to punch clear.
He then dived to keep out the Bosnia-Herzegovina international's first-time shot in the 27th minute before punching away Dzeko's goal-bound header.
Hart was eventually beaten as substitute Totti sent him the wrong way from the spot after Lorenzo De Silvestri's foul on Diego Perotti.
It was a landmark goal for the Roma legend, who made his Serie A debut in March 1993 as a 16-year-old.
However, it was not enough to launch a comeback as Torino went on to seal their first win since Hart arrived last month.
