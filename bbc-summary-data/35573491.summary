Six Nations 2016: Scotland tired of defeat - Ruaridh Jackson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ruaridh Jackson says the best way to end questions about Scotland's Six Nations run and Vern Cotter's future is to win their next match against Italy.

The 27-23 defeat by Wales was a ninth in a row in the championship for the Scots and left coach Cotter without a tournament win in seven games.
"Hopefully we'll get the win and put that to bed," Jackson, who replaced the injured Stuart Hogg in Cardiff, said.
"We don't want to be in this situation. We're tired of it."
Jackson, a fly-half who can also play full-back, was a late call-up to the bench on the morning of the match after Sean Maitland's thigh injury saw Sean Lamont promoted to the starting line-up.
The Wasps player found himself pitched into the action after only 28 minutes when Hogg hobbled off with a back problem, but Scotland led 13-10 at half-time and 16-13 after 55 minutes.
But errors at critical times in the second period helped Wales overpower their visitors with tries from Jamie Roberts and George North.
"To come down here and push them close shows that we are in a good place," Jackson told BBC Radio Scotland. "It's frustrating but I don't think it's necessarily a mental problem.

"Our decision-makers are good and they're used to winning and being in pressure situations and generally make the right decisions. I don't think that's a problem."
With the Six Nations now entering a mini-break, Scotland's players will get a few days off before regrouping for a trip to Rome on 27 February that already looks like a potential Wooden Spoon decider.
But Jackson, 28, feels Scotland are better than that.
"We don't become a bad team overnight," he added. "It's a results-based business so when you look at the results, it doesn't make good viewing.
"But look at the World Cup and how close we were to a semi-final. We've fronted up again and it's just one or two decisions that will get us over the finish line.
"We can't get too disheartened and we have to stick together. We're tired of repeating ourselves but we want to push on and get those wins."
Former England centre Jeremy Guscott on BBC Six Nations Forum: "There has to be a touch of reality. There was a lot of expectation on Scotland after the World Cup but Wales are ranked higher than them and they came into the championship as favourites.
"Scotland have a very poor record against sides that are above them in the world rankings. The expectation on Scotland is too great.
"If you picked a Lions side before the game, how many Scottish players would get in the team compared to Welsh players? There is too much expectation on this Scottish side to win games."
Wales' record try-scorer Shane Williams on BBC Radio Scotland: "It was 'same old, same old' against Wales. Scotland played particularly well, far better than they did against England, and the endeavour was there.
"But they weren't able to capitalise on it and couldn't close it out. They don't have that winning mentality.
"A lot of players in that side are not used to winning Six Nations matches. You have to feel for them because they are playing some good rugby at the moment."
England World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward on ITV: "Scotland made so many changes in a short space of time, you just get disorganisation. [At 20-16 down, Scotland brought on five replacements between the 66th and 68th minute]
"There were so many missed tackles before George North scored [in the 70th minute]. But that happens when you get so many new people on.
"They just panicked. They were only four points down, there was plenty of time left. They made so many changes and lost some focus and organisation, and the game was gone."
