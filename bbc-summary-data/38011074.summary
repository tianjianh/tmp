A £50m radiotherapy unit in Londonderry is to start treating prostate cancer patients at the end of November.

The cross-border treatment centre at Altnagelvin hospital will treat cancer patients from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
A second phase of new admissions is scheduled to start in early 2017.
The new unit is expected to be fully operational by May. It  will allow patients to access treatment without facing lengthy journeys.
Cancer patients in the Derry area currently face a 200-mile round trip to a cancer centre in Belfast.
Patients from Donegal in the Irish Republic will no longer have to travel to Galway or Dublin for treatment.
'Phased opening'
Clinical Oncologist Dr David Stewart said: "To support the implementation of radiotherapy treatment at the hospital, the opening of the Radiotherapy Department will be phased.
"This is to ensure radiotherapy within Northern Ireland continues to be delivered safely to the highest standard.
"The initial phase will see a small number of new patients with prostate cancer receive their treatment at the centre. This will commence within a matter of days.
"Phase two, in the new year, will see a gradual increase in the number of patients and different types of cancers being treated at the centre."
Dr Stewart said patients currently undergoing treatment elsewhere would continue to do so until their medical team refers them to the new Altnagelvin facility.
"This will ensure that they are being cared for by the same team and more importantly with the same diagnostic and treatment equipment," he said.
Trust chief executive Elaine Way said the new unit would deliver "the highest quality of care possible".
She said the radiotherapy facility had been "on the horizon for almost a decade" and said its opening was "fantastic news for the people of the north west".
The unit will provide access to radiotherapy services to more than half a million people living in the Western Trust area and in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland.
