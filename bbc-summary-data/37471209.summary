The 32-year-old former Australia back-rower was one season into a three-year contract with Catalans, but was been released for family reasons.
Leigh will play in Super League for the first time since 2005 after they finished second in the Qualifiers.
"I am not coming over for a holiday. I want to play my best footy and achieve things with the team," said Stewart.
