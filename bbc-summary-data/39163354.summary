[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil impressed as they picked up a first win in nine games with victory at Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After going four games without a goal, Darren Way's side were clinical against a poor home side and should have won by a greater margin.
The Glovers took the lead through substitute Matt Butcher, who scored with a superb left-foot volley in first-half injury-time.
Butcher had only been on the field for a matter of minutes when the ball came to him on the edge of the Morecambe area and he unleashed a superb dipping volley that gave goalkeeper Barry Roche no chance as it crept under the crossbar.
Morecambe levelled eight minutes into the second half when Everton loanee Antony Evans scored for the second successive game as he stroked home a loose ball from six yards after Artur Kysiak had saved Paul Mullin's initial effort.
Way's side bounced back and added a second after 65 minutes through Alex Lacey. Ben Whitfield was the spark with a superb run and cross from the left-hand side that the Morecambe defence failed to clear and as the ball rebounded to the far post, Lacey was in the right place at the right time to put the ball over the line from close range.
The visitors then added a third seven minutes later when a left-wing corner was met by Bevis Mugabi who timed his run perfectly into the box to head past Roche from six yards.
Yeovil had golden chances to extend their advantage as Francois Zoko forced another fine save from Roche before missing an open goal after a shot from Kevin Dawson hit a post and bounced back into his path.
Whitfield blotted his copybook by dragging a shot wide from 12 yards when he should have done better and Tom Eaves wasted a similar opportunity when found again by the excellent Whitfield.
