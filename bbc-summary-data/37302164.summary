Eoin Morgan still to commit to Bangladesh tour amid Andrew Strauss warning

England one-day captain Eoin Morgan is still to commit to the Bangladesh tour, with director of cricket Andrew Strauss saying anyone who does not travel is giving a chance to another player.

The England and Wales Cricket Board are satisfied with security plans for the trip, which takes place in October.
"It comes down to how comfortable I feel to go," said Morgan.
But Strauss said: "The big consequence for not going is you are giving someone else an opportunity to stake a claim."
No international side has toured Bangladesh since 29 people were killed in a siege on a cafe in Dhaka in July.
However, the ECB conducted a security review and declared in August that England's tour, which includes two Tests and three ODIs, will go ahead as planned.
"We feel it's safe to go, and I genuinely believe that," said Strauss. "That is why I'm encouraging every player to use that incredibly detailed and experienced viewpoint from security expert Reg Dickason to make a judgement."

So far, Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan have publically said they will tour, with Jonny Bairstow indicating he will do the same.
Strauss confirmed that the rest of the players will inform the ECB of their decision on Friday or Saturday, with squads to be named on 16 September.
"I can't force anyone on to that plane," added the former England captain.
"I cannot literally force people up the steps and say 'you have to go to Bangladesh'.
"Everyone has a different attitude to risk, different thoughts about what their priorities in life are. That's fine - that's their decision."
Morgan had twice previously declined to state his intentions and, after England's T20 defeat by Pakistan on Wednesday, he told Test Match Special: "I haven't made a decision on Bangladesh yet. I have had two weeks of busy cricket. I have a few more days now to think about it.
"The decision will be based on if I feel safe going out there to play cricket."
He added: "I think as captain, you want to be there in the mix with everybody but ultimately you have to feel comfortable enough to be able to concentrate on cricket and be able to benefit the team."

"I went to India (in 2008). And we got a lot of praise for going back, for the right reasons, for showing solidarity with the Indian people [after the Mumbai bombings].
"I went back on a very personal, selfish mission because I knew I would play Test cricket. Had I had kids, young children at the time there's no way I'd have gone back. I weighed it up for myself. Is it worth the risk?
"We didn't go to Pakistan when we were in a similar situation with terrorist activity going on. We had the same meetings, we were told it's safe, there's no way they'll attack you, they love their cricket. That was said to us. We didn't go and Sri Lanka went in our place. And then they were attacked.
"Eoin Morgan was involved at the time, he sat in those meetings. I'm sure that's going through his head. Because the England security man has flown out unannounced, and gone for a tour and said 'yeah I felt safe' - that for me, wouldn't sway me one bit. We're a western team, going to a country where there's terrorism against the west. And we are a massive beacon - we are a target. If I was in that situation I wouldn't go.
"A team will go. And if you don't go and someone goes in your place, there's a chance you might not play again. It's a very tricky decision to make. I'm glad I'm not in a position to make it again."
