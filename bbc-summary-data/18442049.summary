Royal British Legion Scotland's Inverness Branch and Highland Council have asked families in the city and surrounding area to provide details.
The names will be added to the Cavell Gardens War Memorial.
Conflicts since 1945 include the Korean and Falkland wars and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Highland Council said: "To enable the authorities to verify the details for the entry on the war memorial, they require as much information about the deceased as possible.
"Such as the number, rank and full name of the deceased, ship, unit, regiment, squadron or base, conflict in which the incident occurred."
The memorial on a bank of the River Ness recalls those killed in the two world wars.
With a 10m (33ft) high red sandstone Celtic cross, the memorial was unveiled in 1922.
According to Gaelic heritage website  
          Am Baile
, one in seven men in Inverness parish died while serving in the forces during World War I from 1914-18.
Cavell Gardens were named after Edith Cavell, a nurse who helped French and British soldiers to flee to Holland during the war.
She was executed by German soldiers in Brussels in October 1915.
