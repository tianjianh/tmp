A member of the public made the find near the waterworks in Mugdock Country Park, Milngavie, on Tuesday afternoon.
Police Scotland said efforts were continuing to identify the remains and establish the cause of death but it was not being treated a suspicious.
A spokesman said: "We can now confirm that the remains are of a human nature."
He said: "The process of identifying the remains continues. A post mortem will be conducted to establish the exact cause of death, however, the death is not being treated as suspicious by officers at this time.  A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal."
Police are understood to have notified relatives of missing people about the discovery, including the family of John Murphy, who disappeared after leaving for work from his home in Dennistoun, Glasgow, 10 months ago.
Mr Murphy, 52, failed to turn up at work after leaving home at about 07:00 on 12 May.
