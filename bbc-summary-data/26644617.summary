A social media campaign by Aberdeen FC fans has propelled a 1980s hit by The Human League into the iTunes top 5.

Dons fans have embraced Don't You Want Me - a number one in 1981 - by changing the lyrics to "Peter Pawlett Baby".
Campaigns on Facebook and Twitter to get the song to the top of the charts have snowballed since the club won the Scottish League Cup on Sunday - with the song echoing in the background.
The Human League have now joined in with the effort.
Peter Pawlett is an Aberdeen midfielder.
The song was the highest new entry in the iTunes chart on Tuesday, when it reached number 10, and has continued to climb since.
Human League's Facebook page posted a message that said: "Amazing stuff you Aberdeen FC fans, simply amazing.
"Best of luck with your campaign and here's hoping the club appreciate your creativity and support as much as we do."
The band later said in a statement: "For us to be waking up this morning to find Don't You Want Me at number 5 on the iTunes singles chart was absolutely amazing and has to rank as one of the biggest surprises of our career to date, which after over 35 years in the music business is really saying something.
"We are slightly stunned but at the same time very honoured that the fans of Aberdeen FC have chosen our song as their anthem to Peter Pawlett and their achievement in getting it so high in the charts in the space of just one day is a real testament to both their dedication to their club and to this player in particular.
"Speaking as a band who have always enjoyed a deeply loyal and enthusiastic fan base of our own we know just how important the fans really are and what a difference they can make.
"We do of course wish the Aberdeen fans every success in their campaign to honour Peter by getting DYWM to number one on Sunday and regardless of whether they succeed or not we hope that both they and everyone involved with the club have a fantastic day at their League Cup parade this coming Sunday.
"As we believe the saying goes in Aberdeen - Come On You Reds!"
Fans are now also calling on The Human League to come to Aberdeen to play the song - with the alternative Peter Pawlett lyrics included.
