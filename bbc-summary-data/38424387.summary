[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 0-0 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United's first meeting with Walsall for 16 years ended in anti-climax with an uninspiring goalless draw at the Kassam Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Saddlers arguably had the better of what few chances there were in a match in which defences were very much on top.
And after their 1-0 win at Port Vale on Boxing Day, Walsall can be satisfied with their end to 2016.
Oxford top scorer Chris Maguire drove over the bar from 12 yards after a smart link-up with Marvin Johnson, who was a threat down the left.
But Walsall, who had youngster Kory Roberts making his debut at the back, defended solidly and the U's had to work very hard to try to break them down.
Alex MacDonald managed to find space to send in a low shot early in the second half, but it hardly troubled keeper Neil Etheridge.
Saddlers striker Simeon Jackson fired Joe Edwards' cross over the bar at full stretch. And U's keeper Simon Eastwood had to be at his best to turn Flo Cuvelier's 20-yard effort around a post.
Eastwood also produced a superb reaction save two minutes from time when an Edwards shot deflected off Chey Dunkley.
