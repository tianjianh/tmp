The pair, along with third-placed Dani Pedrosa, wore T-shirts that read "always in our hearts" on the podium in memory of Moto2 rider Luis Salom, who died during practice on Friday.
Marquez moved into the championship lead on 125 points, 10 ahead of Jorge Lorenzo, who did not finish.
Rossi is now third on 103 points after seven rounds.
The Yamaha rider started fifth and dropped to seventh before taking the lead on lap seven.
Rossi traded first place with Honda's Marquez in the closing stages but made a move with two laps to go for his second win of the season.
"It's a great victory, one of the best of my career," said the 37-year-old.
Rossi accused Marquez of "making me lose the championship" last season but the pair shook hands after the race.
"The important thing is that we had a great battle with Valentino and I think the people enjoyed it," said Marquez.
Lorenzo came off his Yamaha bike after a clash with Ducati's Andrea Iannone, who he will replace next year, on lap 17.
"I am appalled by Iannone's move," said Yamaha team boss Lin Jarvis.
"He hasn't learned his lesson from what he did earlier this season where he took out his own team mate.
"This do-or-die suicide move on Lorenzo is impossible. - it's not acceptable to do this sort of thing."
