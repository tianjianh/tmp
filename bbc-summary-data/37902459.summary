Sue and Joe Davis from County Meath in the Republic of Ireland were so worried they posted their own video to correct the claim.
Their son, Daniel, was wrongly alleged to have broken into the home of an elderly woman on Halloween night.
The teen who posted the prank claim appeared in the video to apologise.
The boy's father also took part in the recording and apologised on his son's behalf.
The video, posted on 2 November, has been viewed more than 350,000 times.
The prank post wrongly alleged that Daniel Davis had been involved in a break-in and the assault of an elderly woman in Kinnegad on Halloween night and asked people to report sightings to Trim Garda (police) station.
No such incident ever occurred, police confirmed.
Speaking to Radio Ulster, Mrs Davis said: "I thought [Daniel] could have got a hiding, you don't know what sort of situation there could be - that he could get murdered, you just don't know."
She said she was optimistic the video would improve the situation.
"I'm a very positive person and I hope it did improve things.
"Obviously it's not going to change everything in life but hopefully it's put that awareness out there."
She said young people carrying out such pranks did not realise the effect they could have on people.
"I just think they shouldn't do it, they don't realise what the impact is, they don't realise that they could be causing someone to get a hiding, get murdered - they're causing a threat to the person that they're putting that out about.
"They're also defaming their character for the rest of their lives, that maybe if they get a job or whatever and somebody looks for them on Google, that might affect them in later life."
Speaking in her follow-up video, a distraught Mrs Davis said: "I just want you to see how severe it is, that a child can be slated in a situation that he didn't actually do anything wrong.
"And just to let you know how worried as a parent I am at the moment, because I'm afraid something is going to happen to him."
She added: "I just want us to get a message out there to people that's actually going to impact the silliness of kids putting up stuff like this."
Her husband said: "It's been shared all over Facebook and I've actually received phone calls with threats on his life, so if anyone else is thinking about putting anything 'funny' on Facebook, just think about it before you put it up."
