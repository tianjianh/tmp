A new stone plaque can be erected at a famous Borders battle site, after councillors approved the plans.

Scottish Borders Council's planning committee agreed the 1514 Club's application for the three-foot high stone and paved area.
Some members, however, only agreed because officials told them there were no planning grounds for refusal.
They felt, like opponents, that the new plaque could detract from the existing memorial.
Conservative councillor Michelle Ballantyne said she had some sympathy with a submission by objectors.
"From our point of view that's our job done, planning permission has been granted," she said.
"I think most members of the planning committee and the officers would say really this is a matter for the people of Hawick."
She said it was time for locals to "work together".
"The granting of planning permission doesn't mean that it has to happen, it merely means that the option is there," she added.
"I would urge both sides in the argument within Hawick to talk to each other and see if they can't resolve between them a way forward that they can all support."
The stone structure would mark the battle between an English raiding party and youths from Hawick.
The young Scots defeated the invaders and captured their standard at Hornshole.
