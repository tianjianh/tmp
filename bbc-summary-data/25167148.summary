Button returned to Frome, Somerset, to turn on the Christmas lights and drove his car around a special track.
Speaking to a cheering crowd, Mr Button acknowledged 2013 had been a "difficult year" but that he now knew "what not to do for 2014".
The 2009 world champion tweeted "after a long hard season that ended with a reasonable result at Interlagos it's time to go home!!  Frome here I come."
