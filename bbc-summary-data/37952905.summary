A photo of Ken Farlow, 95, staring at Spitfires through the fence of Gloucestershire Airport became an internet hit in July.
The airport tweeted: "With sadness we report the passing of Ken Farlow yesterday. His story touched hearts."
Mr Farlow, who had bowel cancer, was an electrical engineer in the war and worked on Spitfires and Hurricanes.
After hearing his story airport bosses treated Mr Farlow to a flight in a two-seater training plane.
He was also invited to RAF Coningsby and the Royal International Air Tattoo.
Mr Farlow's daughter Helen Nock, who took the photo of him staring through the fence, said her father, who lived in Painswick, Gloucestershire, spent time in Syria and Palestine during the war working on the airplanes.
