Victoria Gribovskaja was attacked by Cox at her home in Lambeth on 16 July when he tried to collect his belongings after their relationship broke down.
The Swindon-based WBO European super-middleweight champion was convicted, under his real name Jamie Russan, of assault by beating, violence to secure entry, harassment and criminal damage.
He is due to be sentenced on 11 April.
Croydon Magistrates' Court heard Cox also denied harassing Ms Gribovskaja by sending her abusive texts in the days before the assault and that he had placed his hands around her neck, leaving her with "redness".
The boxer, who won gold at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, said he had "barged" through her front and bedroom doors as he was afraid she "could kill herself", which he said she had previously threatened.
Magistrates said they found Ms Gribovskaja's account of the confrontation "credible and convincing" and 29-year-old's Cox's evidence "not credible".
The court was told the relationship, which had lasted for between nine to 12 months, was "coming to a head" a week before Cox was due to fight for the European title.
Cox said, during his evidence, if he were found guilty his career "would be very much in tatters, if not over".
The court heard the boxer, who became European champion by beating Blas Miguel Martinez at Wembley Arena last July, was due to fight for a world title and the consequences of assaulting someone would likely result in a suspension of his licence.
Cox's lawyer Nathaniel Ikeazor, speaking outside the court, said: "My client intends to appeal this at the first available opportunity. I am personally shocked and appalled by the court's decision."
Cox was released on conditional bail to return for sentencing next month.
