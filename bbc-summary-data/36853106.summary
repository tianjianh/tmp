Officers said he was approached by two men as he was out jogging near RAF Marham in Norfolk on Wednesday.
He was threatened with a knife and attempts were made to grab him but the victim, who was not in uniform, fought them off and escaped unharmed.
Norfolk Police said it was "unable to discount terrorism" as a motive.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed RAF Marham is home to some of the Tornado bombers that have recently taken part in air strikes against so called Islamic State.
Det Supt Paul Durham said the serviceman was jogging along a fairly isolated route used regularly by station personnel when he was grabbed by a man from a parked, dark coloured people carrier.
He was wearing headphones and listening to music at the time so did not hear what the first attacker said to him, police said.
He managed to wrestle him to the ground before a second man, armed with the knife, tried to attack him.
The men then fled in the car.
The knife was described as a "military type" with a three inch handle and blade measuring about 2.5 - 3 inches long.
Det Supt Durham said the force were examining CCTV footage outside the station and that tracing the vehicle was "hugely important to the investigation".
"We want to recover that vehicle and its occupants", he said.
Police have issued descriptions of the two suspects involved.
One is described as between 20 and 30 years old, approximately 6ft (1.81m) tall, of athletic but stocky build, with dark hair, long on top, and a well-groomed beard. He was of Middle Eastern appearance with dark skin and wore dark casual clothing.
The other is said to be around the same age but younger than the first suspect and of a slimmer build, 5ft 10ins (1.78m) tall, and clean shaven with short dark hair.  He was also of Middle Eastern appearance and wore a white T-shirt and dark shorts.
Det Supt Durham said they were keen to hear from anyone who may have seen the people carrier in the King's Lynn area "but particularly towards Marham between midday and 6pm yesterday".
He added: "The motivation for the attack remains unclear and whilst we are currently unable to discount terrorism, there are a number of other possible hypotheses."
A dedicated hotline for anyone who has information about the abduction has also been set up.
Detectives are urging members of the public to call 0800 056 0154 or 0207 158 0011 particularly if they saw a dark coloured people carrier in the King's Lynn area yesterday afternoon.
Assistant Chief Constable Nick Dean said vigilance at RAF Marham and the wider community would be enhanced.
He added: "But in terms of the threat to national security, and particularly the military, there has been no change in terms of the security threat."
The MoD said it was aware of the police operation but would not comment further.
The Burnthouse Drove and Ladywood Road area remains closed as police carry out patrols, house-to-house inquiries and more detailed searches.
The station is home to almost 10,000 people, including members of the RAF, Navy and Army, as well as the civil service and other staff.
A spokeswoman said an event for base friends and families went ahead as planned.
