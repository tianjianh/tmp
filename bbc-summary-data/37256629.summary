Man convicted of rape and abuse charges against six women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man is facing a lengthy jail term after being convicted of a catalogue of abuse charges against six women, including rape and beatings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Slee, 30, abused the women while in relationships with them at locations in Helensburgh, Garelochhead, Glasgow and Edinburgh between 2002 and 2015.
He raped one victim, attempted to rape another and subjected four others to beatings and sex attacks.
Sentence on Slee was deferred and he was remanded in custody.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Beckett told Slee: "You have been convicted of many serious charges which represent a very concerning catalogue  of bullying and domestic abuse."
One of Slee's victims, a 32-year-old woman, told the court how he pulled her head under water while she was having a bath.
She said: "I couldn't breathe and he was laughing. He said: 'That was brilliant. You should see your face. I could have killed you.'"
The woman said that on a few occasions she woke up to find Slee having sex with her.
She added: "He made out it was a laugh or a joke."
Another victim, a 29-year-old mother-of-two, said Slee was "manipulative" and could be "so aggressive" if her "eyes even looked in the direction of another man".
He forbade her from wearing a bikini during a holiday and also attacked her at a house in Helensburgh in 2004.
She said: "I was screaming. He just ignored me. The look in his eyes was pure evil."
A 27-year-old victim told the court she was subjected to "constant mental abuse".
"He called me ugly and fat and said I would never be anything without him," she told the court.
His fourth victim, whom Slee tried to rape, told the court that he threatened to pour acid in her face or petrol bomb her parents' home and car if she went to the police about him.
The court also heard how Slee often flew into jealous rages and had thrown the contents of an ice bucket over one woman at a hotel in Glasgow.
He fell out with another woman because she was showing her cancer-stricken sister more attention than him.
Slee also controlled another woman's Facebook account - despite working in the North Sea at the time.
In evidence, Slee claimed all his victim's were lying, adding: "They have ruined my life, they have done it, they have done what they wanted."
The jury did not believe him, however, and convicted him of 29 charges involving domestic abuse, including raping one partner and  intent to rape another.
Two other rape charges against two former partners were found not proven.
