The 22-year-old, who never made a first-team outing for the Blues, spent one month on loan at Yeovil in 2010.
Coombes told the club website: "It was a big chance for me to come here and luckily the manager's liked me and given me a chance.
"The most important thing is we have a good season and win, so I'm willing to do anything it takes to do that."
He was previously known as Adam Phillip before changing his surname in July 2012.
