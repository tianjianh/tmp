BCC boss resigns over 'Brexit' support

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, has resigned after being suspended for saying the UK's long-term prospects could be "brighter" outside the EU.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BCC said Mr Longworth had accepted his support for leaving the EU was "likely to create confusion".
He revealed his support for "Brexit" at the BCC annual conference on Thursday.
The BCC said Mr Longworth had breached the group's official position of neutrality on the referendum.
At the conference, Mr Longworth said the EU referendum was a choice between the "devil and the deep blue sea".
He added that voters faced "undoubtedly a tough choice".
One option was staying in an "essentially unreformed EU", with the other being the uncertainty of leaving.
He later said his comments had been made in a personal capacity.
His remarks and his subsequent suspension prompted a political outcry, with London mayor Boris Johnson and former defence secretary Liam Fox, both prominent campaigners for the UK to leave the EU, weighing in on his behalf.
Mr Johnson called Mr Longworth's treatment "scandalous", while Mr Fox said ministers should clarify "if they were involved in any way in putting pressure on" the BCC to suspend Mr Longworth.
Downing Street denied any pressure was put on the BBC to suspend its director general.
