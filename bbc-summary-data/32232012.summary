Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal, both 17 and from Dewsbury, are thought to be trying to join Islamic State after flying from Manchester to Turkey on 31 March.
A statement released on behalf of their families said they were "devastated".
Farooq Yunus, from the Zakaria Mosque in Savile Town, Dewsbury, said the "whole system" had failed the boys.
West Yorkshire Police is investigating their disappearance.
Mr Yunus told Radio BBC 5 live: "I think we have failed. Not just the people in here... the council, the police, the community."
In a statement the boys' families said: "Our number one priority is to get Hassan and Talha back home with their families and we implore anyone who may have any information whatsoever to get in contact with the police.
"Naturally, we are in a state of profound shock and are trying to come to terms with the predicament we find ourselves in and we hope and pray that no other family finds itself in our situation.
"These were just two ordinary Yorkshire lads who enjoyed the things that all young people enjoy at their age - both Hassan and Talha had a promising future, as an apprentice and an A-level student respectively, and we are praying they will be back with us soon and are able to realise that future."
Hassan's brother, Hammaad Munshi, was arrested in 2006 at the age of 16 after police found a guide to making napalm on his computer.
He became the youngest person to be convicted under the Terrorism Act.
