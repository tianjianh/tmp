Hamilton Accies boss Martin Canning has called for a unified front at the club as they battle to avoid relegation.

Skipper Mikey Devlin was involved in a confrontation with a fan after the 1-0 defeat by Motherwell left Accies in the Premiership's relegation play-off spot.
Hamilton need at least one win from Tuesday's trip to Ross County and Saturday's home match against Dundee to have a chance of avoiding the play-off.
"We've got to stick together - fans, players, everybody," Canning said.
"If you're a fan you're there to support your team.
"If you feel you're being short-changed and the boys aren't working hard enough, I can understand maybe giving a little bit from the stands, but the boys put in everything they had and Michael was fantastic. So for someone to come and give him personal abuse is not on.
"That's not a fan. We need fans that are behind the team. I've had it at certain points of the season, but one thing you can't do is give it to the players, because they're out there every week giving their all for the club."
Canning, whose side are three points adrift of Motherwell following the weekend defeat, was keen to stress the isolated nature of that incident, and is convinced the reaction was not representative of the overall support.
"It's one person," added Canning. "There were 2,500 people supporting us. I'm sure if you go round the whole crowd, 98% of them would be Michael fans because he's been excellent for this club.
"Michael's such a level-headed guy, it's just water off his back. The club obviously fully support him. We don't expect any of our players to take personal abuse."
Canning had the squad in on Sunday to try to lift spirits ahead of a few days which will determine the club's immediate future.
"The priority now is to win on Tuesday night and see where that leaves us because obviously it can change so quickly," he added.
"If we get a result tomorrow night and Motherwell don't, we're back above Motherwell. It's not like you're four, five, six points adrift and hoping everything's going to go in your favour."
