Scotland head coach Grant Bradburn believes playing competitive cricket is "vital" to his side's development ahead of the ICC World Twenty20 in March.

The Scots' Intercontinental Cup clash with Hong Kong was abandoned without play on Sunday due to heavy rain.
"It's a busy period coming up, so it's vital we complete our preparation with match practice," said Bradburn.
"(The abandonment) is disappointing. We prepared so well over winter and we had an excellent Abu Dhabi camp last week."
Scotland are scheduled to play one-day internationals on 26 and 28 January, followed by two Twenty20 internationals on 30 and 31 January in the build-up to the ICC World Twenty20 in India, which begins on 8 March.
"The guys have arrived (in Hong Kong) absolutely fizzing to play, but unfortunately we can't control the weather," Bradburn told BBC Scotland. "There's just been no chance of play in the last four days.
"We're very much hoping the weather does change for the better, and we can get on the park and complete our fixtures.
"We're just keen to play as much cricket as we can. We get precious little cricket in our programme and we're not picky as to who we play. We want to play some quality opposition and of course Hong Kong are very much a quality team, particularly in the white ball game."
