Matthew Stockdale captured the moment on a dashboard camera.
He said the driver repeatedly attempted to cut him up and shunted him twice as he drove along the M1 on the night of 11 November.
Mr Stockdale has criticised police for failing to attend the incident for three hours.
Northamptonshire Police, which took the first call with subsequent calls taken by Thames Valley and Bedfordshire Police, has apologised for failures in communication.
The lorry driver, who lives in Bedfordshire, was employed by Wincanton hauliers as an agency driver. Liability for the car damage has been accepted by the firm's insurers and a spokesman confirmed he is "no longer conducting deliveries" for them.
This edited sequence of the footage, including parts of a 999 call made after the incident, shows the lorry apparently striking the vehicle.
