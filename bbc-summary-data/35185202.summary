[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yasir, 29, tested positive for banned substance chlortalidone following the second one-day international against England in Abu Dhabi last month.
He has been provisionally suspended by governing body the International Cricket Council (ICC) "pending the outcome of the disciplinary process".
Earlier this month, Yasir was named in the ICC's Test team of the year.
He bowled nine overs on the day of his failed test, taking 0-70 as England won by 95 runs.
Since making his international debut in 2011, Yasir has played in 12 Tests and 15 one-day internationals.
He took 12 wickets as Pakistan beat Australia 2-0 in a Test series last year, and doubled that tally in a 2-1 win over Sri Lanka this year.
