[SN]TITLE[SN]
Raith Rovers 1-1 Hibernian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hibernian extended their lead at the top of the Championship to seven points but were held to a 1-1 draw by Raith Rovers at Starks Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Hearts midfielder Ryan Stevenson, who joined Rovers last month, gave the hosts the lead after 52 minutes.
But Hibs top-scorer Jason Cummings equalised with a wonderful free-kick.
Brian Graham and Cummings both came close to a winner but Raith forced a third draw with Hibs this season to end a run of six straight league defeats.
Their last point came against Hibs on Christmas Eve, so it was a positive start under new manager John Hughes, who was given a standing ovation from the home fans as he took his place in the dugout before the game.
Rovers had the better possession in the first half with Stevenson warming the palms of Marciano in the Hibernian goal with a 25-yard free-kick.
At the other end Cummings looked dangerous when the ball reached him but the home defence was well marshalled by Kyle Benedictus and Jean-Yves M'Voto.
Seven minutes into the second half Rovers took a deserved lead, Stevenson's crisp half-volley from 22 yards rifling into the top corner of the net.
Hibs boss Neil Lennon introduced winger Chris Humphrey and the visitors equalised on the hour mark.
Cummings scored with a wonderful free-kick from just outside the 18-yard box that Conor Brennan in the home goal had no chance of reaching.
The goal spurred Hibernian into action and Graham was inches away from a John McGinn cross.
Cummings went close to snatching a second but his effort drifted a yard wide of Conor Brennan's goal.
Rovers manager John Hughes: "I'm happy with the result.
"Maybe the substitutes I made put us on the back foot rather than on the front foot. I maybe should have just waited a little bit. Hibs were chasing the game.
"In terms of commitment, organisation and shape, we were there. It took a wonderful free-kick for Hibernian to draw level and we were hard to beat."
Hibs boss Neil Lennon: "We were an absolute disgrace - a disgrace.
"We had the right colour (yellow) of jersey on today. You can't turn up and play for 30 minutes. We were abject.
"We are going for a title here and trying to extend our lead but we totally disrespected the opponent. I am not happy with that at all, and that is creeping in far too often."
