Worcestershire v Glamorgan: Teenager Josh Tongue puts hosts in charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire's teenage seamer Josh Tongue tore Glamorgan apart with five wickets as they fell to 76-6 in reply to the hosts' 267 all out at New Road.

The 19-year-old produced a spell of 5-3 in 19 balls as six Glamorgan wickets fell in the last 13 overs of day one.
Ben Cox's aggressive 93 off 99 balls was the mainstay of the home innings, while Ed Barnard (60) and Tongue (41) led the lower-order resistance.
Timm van der Gugten, with 4-66, was the pick of the Glamorgan attack.
Worcestershire counter-attacked hard from their poor start as Cox, having come in on a hat-trick on 14-3, hit 15 fours before being brilliantly caught by Andrew Salter within sight of his century.
After two double century opening stands in three matches, this time both Worcestershire openers were back in the pavilion inside eight overs, Daryl Mitchell, who had scored 534 runs in his previous five innings, going for a third-ball duck.
Netherlands seamer van der Gugten claimed four of the first six wickets to fall in an accurate display, including Tom Fell and Brett D'Oliveira in successive balls.
But, in only his sixth Championship game, Tongue outshone everyone. He improved his best with both bat and ball, aided by some superb slip catching in the dramatic closing overs as only Jacques Rudolph (49 not out) reached double figures.
Worcestershire's Ben Cox told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"It was an edgy start, going in at 14-3, and I wasn't backing myself. But, on a wicket like that, it sometimes suits my game to go out and try and put the pressure back on them.
"Fortunately my edges didn't go to hand. And iIt was a good catch (to get me out), but it's 93 from a position where we were really struggling and we're in a good position now.
"We couldn't be happier after that spell from Tonguey. That's one of the best spells I've kept to. We said it down at Glamorgan that there's going to be times that he has those spells, he clicks and hits the zone."
Glamorgan's Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport:
"First and foremost it was a great spell of bowling (by Tongue), it's one of those spells where Joe (Clarke) took a brilliant one-handed catch, the keeper (Cox) took a brilliant one-handed catch and it's obviously not ideal to be in this position because it's quite a good wicket.
"Coming back, we've got to have a strong mind-set and when we bowl again. we probably gave 20 to 30 runs too many, but there's still plenty of time left in the game.
"If your mind-set's good on this wicket, it gives you opportunities to score, Cox almost got a hundred by playing really positively."
