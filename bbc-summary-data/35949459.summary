[SN]TITLE[SN]
Altrincham 0-0 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Altrincham's National League survival hopes took a blow after a goalless draw at home to Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Robins created pressure in the first half but no clear chances, with Jake Moult and Michael Rankine testing Bromley's Alan Julian.
Alty thought they had scored a crucial goal in their relegation battle, but Rankine's effort was ruled offside.
The Ravens came close to an away win through Moses Emmanuel, but the forward put the ball wide late in the game.
The result leaves Altrincham two points from safety, while Bromley, who are 12th, cannot finish in either the play-offs or the relegation zone.
