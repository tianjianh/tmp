A 56-year-old man had to be placed in a medically-induced coma after he was attacked on Davies Row in the town on Sunday.
Police said he had suffered severe facial injuries in a "serious and sustained assault".
Gregor Thomson, 26, was arrested on Tuesday and has appeared at Falkirk Sheriff Court charged with attempted murder.
Thomson, from Denny, made no plea or declaration when he appeared on petition before Sheriff Craig Caldwell, and was remanded in custody until a hearing next week.
Insp John Kellett said the 56-year-old remained in Western General hospital in Edinburgh with "severe, but fortunately no longer life-threatening" injuries.
