The group also announced that former Menzies Distribution managing director Forsyth Black had been appointed as managing director of Menzies Aviation with immediate effect.
Forsyth has been with the group for more than 16 years, predominantly in senior aviation roles.
Mark Cassie, currently Distribution Operations Director, has been appointed as interim boss of Menzies Distribution.
John Menzies chairman lain Napier said: "I am delighted to welcome Forsyth to the board with his extensive and relevant experience which we are confident will drive forward the implementation of our existing aviation strategy.
"I also look forward to working closely with Mark Cassie as he continues to develop our distribution business into the e-commerce fulfilment market.
"The board wish Jeremy Stafford well for the future."
