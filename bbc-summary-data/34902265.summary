[SN]TITLE[SN]
Medieval silver mount found in Llanbadoc is treasure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A medieval silver mount found by a metal detectorist in Monmouthshire has been declared treasure by a coroner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fragment, which historians believe could have been part of a sword, was discovered by Michael Beirne on Coleg Gwent land at Llanbadoc in March 2014.
The mount was first reported to the National Roman Legion Museum at Caerleon.
It will now be valued and bought by National Museum Wales with Heritage Lottery funding.
Dr Mark Redknap, of National Museum Cardiff, said the mount bears two incomplete inscriptions and is believed to date back to the 15th century.
He said the motto appeared to be a version of the commonplace inscription nul si bien / nul ce bien / nul sy bien (None so good, None this good), which was "appropriate for a fine sword".
He added it was likely the surviving fragment was only 50% of the original length, which would leave room on the missing section for another motto or a shields of arms.
Mr Beirne, 39 of Newport, who has been metal detecting for 15 years, said the find had "probably been my best one".
He added: "I'd like to think that the sword, which the find may have been part of, belonged to a Welsh or English knight."
Alex Anderson, head of estates at Coleg Gwent, said an Ordnance Survey map showed the mount was found close to the assumed site of the 1405 Battle of Pwll Melyn, fought by Owain Glyndwr's men, but it may have been lost at a later date.
