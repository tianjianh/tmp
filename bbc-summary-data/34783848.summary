[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A judge has sentenced a white supremacist to death for the killing of three people at two Jewish centres.

Frazier Glenn Miller Jr, 74, targeted the sites in Kansas last year and will be put to death by lethal injection.
Johnson County District Judge Thomas Kelly Ryan said: "Your attempt to bring hate to this community, to bring terror to this community, has failed."
Miller responded to the sentence, by shouting "heil Hitler" before he was removed from the courtroom.
He was convicted of one count of capital murder, three counts of attempted murder, and assault and weapons charges.
Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, represented himself during the trial.
He admitted to killing William Corporon, 69, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood, 14, outside the Jewish Community Centre in Overland Park, Kansas.
Terri LaManno, 53, was killed outside a Jewish retirement centre.
Miller told the jurors he "knew" they were going to put him on death row, and he did not care what sentence he would receive.
He said he was motivated to kill Jews before he died because he believes they have too much power.
Before the shooting, Miller founded several white supremacist groups and later ran twice for elected office on a white power platform.
