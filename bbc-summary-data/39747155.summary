A man who seriously assaulted his partner 16 years ago has been jailed for murder after the attack was linked to her death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Keeling, 58, attacked Ann Robinson in December 2000.
Miss Robinson died in 2014 and a post-mortem examination found her death was directly linked to the assault.
Keeling, of Selby Road, Thorne, Doncaster, who was originally convicted of attempted murder in 2001, admitted murder at Sheffield Crown Court.
He was sentenced to life, and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years in jail, less the time he had previously served.

Ms Robinson was living with Keeling in their home in Truro Avenue, Wheatley, Doncaster, when he attacked her on 28 December.
She was taken to hospital with significant and life-threatening injuries, which resulted in her requiring 24-hour medical care.
In March 2014, Miss Robinson, 58, was admitted to hospital where she died.
Det Con Ian Honeybone said the force had worked closely with medical professionals and the Crown Prosecution Service to build a case to prosecute Keeling for murder.
He said: "This may seem like an unusual step, but extensive medical assessment concluded that the brutal and sustained attack on Ann in December 2000 significantly contributed to her death in March 2014.
"Her health was forever changed as a result of Keeling's actions that night. Ann survived extensive injuries but needed round-the-clock care and medical support."
He added he was pleased Keeling had accepted responsibility for his actions but his guilty plea was "small consolation" for her family after 17 years.
