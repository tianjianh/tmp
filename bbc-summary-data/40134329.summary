A record crowd of 9,000 is expected at the event on the Raehills Estate near Beattock from 8 to 11 June.
Supt Irvine Watson said everyone involved had put in a "huge amount of work" to ensure it would be another "tremendous festival".
He said police would be working in "all areas of the venue" with stewards to "keep everyone safe".
''Our priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our communities, including the community that gathers for the weekend at the Eden Festival," he said.
"We want people to have fun and enjoy what is sure to be another excellent festival.
"Security is constantly under review at all our major events in Dumfries and Galloway."
He said police worked closely with organisers to ensure there was "appropriate security" at every event.
"At the same time we want those attending the festival to look after themselves, have respect for others and be mindful that what is against the law in Scotland is also against the law within any festival venue in Scotland," he said.
"Police Scotland will adopt the same pro-active approach to the dealing and misuse of drugs at the Eden Festival as we do across the rest of Scotland."
He added that part of the condition of entry to the festival was that New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) - also known as "legal highs" - were not permitted on the site.
