About 40 turkeys were taken along with smoked salmon and other festive food from Caesar's Arms Farm Shop in Creigiau on Christmas Eve.
Caesar's is bringing in replacements from suppliers and promised all orders would be met.
Manager Steve Scarrett said the theft was "horrendous".
"We came in this morning and some nice people have broken into our fridges and stolen our turkeys.
"It is not us who will be affected it's the poor people who want turkeys tomorrow but, fortunately, they (the thieves) have not won, because we have managed to replace them."
One customer said: "I feel very sorry for the shop and for the customers. One woman in front of me was in tears."
South Wales Police said officers were investigating a burglary at the shop between midnight and 05:00 GMT.
"A quantity of produce was stolen from the meat fridge," a spokesperson said.
