Derek Moore inquest hears of Bosley mill fire devastation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest has heard of the "scene of devastation" that greeted rescue workers after the Bosley mill explosion in Cheshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derek Moore, 62, was one of four people killed in the blast at the Wood Treatment Ltd Flour mill on 17 July.
The inquest into his death was opened and adjourned in Macclesfield so his family can now hold a funeral.
Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg said Mr Moore suffered head and spine injuries resulting in his "immediate death".
His "badly burned body" was discovered at the site almost a week after the explosion, the inquest at Macclesfield Town Hall was told.
Mr Moore suffered brain stem and spinal cord injuries, the coroner said.
Det Ch Supt Philip Jones, from Cheshire Police, gave evidence to the inquest about the "difficult and dangerous operation" for police and firefighters.
He said the first officers on site found "fires raging" around them with "many walking wounded".
Mr Jones described how rescue workers were "tunnelling into collapsed buildings' as they searched for missing workers".
Warning that the investigation is likely to be "lengthy", he said detectives are working to establish whether there is any "culpability under criminal law".
The inquest was told the body of one of the four victims, Jason Shingler, has still not been recovered and small fires are still burning at the site.
It was adjourned to a later date.
