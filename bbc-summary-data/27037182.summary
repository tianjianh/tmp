[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee school buildings are in line for a £2m improvement and repair programme.

Councillors are set to approve investment in a number of primary and secondary schools across the city.
Plans include improved dining facilities at eight primary schools for the introduction of free school meals for P1-3 pupils, and provision for under-threes at seven primaries.
The council is also currently advancing plans for several new schools in Dundee.
The council's city development committee will decide on Monday whether to award tenders for the works, including more than £900,000 for the improved dining facilities.
Other proposed work includes a new science laboratory for Menzieshill High School, a £480,000 replacement heading system and a new fire alarm at Longhaugh Primary, curtain walling replacement at Forthill Primary, new lifts and ramps at Braeview Academy and improvements to the gymnasium at Craigiebarns Primary.
City development convener Will Dawson said the work would benefit hundreds of pupils across the city.
"There has been a huge investment in new schools around the city in the last few years," he said.
"We are also committed to ensuring that every school building in the city is a safe and inspiring learning environment for our pupils.
"These improvements are part of an ongoing programme of maintenance and includes provision for new initiatives for free meals and nursery places for two-year-olds from workless households.
"Building conditions in our schools are monitored on an ongoing basis and there are regular reports to the council."
The last school estate review sent to the education committee in September 2013 judged several city school buildings to be in poor condition, "showing major defects and/or not operating adequately".
However the majority of these, including six primary schools, two academies and a nursery school, are being replaced as part of an ongoing £55m new-build programme, including the £31m Harris Academy.
