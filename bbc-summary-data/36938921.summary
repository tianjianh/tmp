Anti-social behaviour in Wrexham tackled with £100 fines

Action to combat anti-social behaviour in Wrexham town centre comes into force on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An order gives police and council officials powers to disperse anyone causing a nuisance, rough sleeping, consuming alcohol or taking drugs.
People in breach of the public space protection order (PSPO) will be issued with a £100 fixed penalty fine.
Councillor Hugh Jones, who is helping to lead the project, said it "aims to reduce inappropriate behaviour".
But North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones raised concerns that the order may move problems elsewhere and not solve them.
A council report in June said there had been more than 300 incidents in the last 12 months involving drink and drugs, fights and harassment.
It said vulnerable people would be given welfare help and warnings before any action was taken.
