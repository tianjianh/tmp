York City winger Michael Coulson has agreed to switch to St Johnstone for next season.

The English League Two outfit say they are "surprised and disappointed" to learn the 27-year-old has signed a pre-contract agreement with the Perth club.
"The club is particularly disconcerted with the timing," York's website said.
"The club hopes that Michael Coulson is still committed to his current employer and is focused on York City's fight for Football League survival."
Coulson, who has been capped at England C level, joined York after leaving Grimsby Town in 2012 and signed a new two-year contract in 2014.
He has made 22 appearances this season, scoring six goals, for former Dundee United and Partick Thistle manager Jackie McNamara's side, who sit second bottom of the table.
Coulson started his career with Scarborough before switching to Barnsley.
He had loan spells with Northwich Victoria, Chester City and Grimsby before his permanent move to the Mariners.
