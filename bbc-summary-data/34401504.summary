[SN]TITLE[SN]
Witham acid attack was 'mistaken identity'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who had acid thrown in his face was a victim of mistaken identity and in the "wrong place at the wrong time", a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wayne Ingold, 56, suffered horrific burn injuries outside his home in Witham, Essex, on 8 August 2014.
Aaron Isaac, 19, of Elverson Road, Lewisham, south London, and a 16-year-old boy deny carrying out the attack.
Martin Mulgrew, prosecuting, said Mr Ingold was attacked after he answered the communal door at a block of flats.
"He suffered horrific burn injuries to his face and neck and but for the fact he was wearing spectacles it's likely the fluid would've gone into his eyes," he said.
Giving evidence on the first day of the trial at Chelmsford Crown Court, Mr Ingold told the jury: "[The acid] hit my hands, my face, my neck. I went into my flat and looked in the mirror.
"My face had turned yellow. It looked like melted wax."
The court heard the boy, from Mitcham, south London, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to hospital after the attack with an acid burn to his eye.
Mr Mulgrew said: "The Crown says he was throwing acid and it splashed back into his left eye."
Both teenagers deny throwing a corrosive liquid with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
The trial continues.
