Real Sociedad are famous across Europe for the high standard of their academy and Malaga have promised to bring their best prospects.
The Spanish teams will play in the competition's Premier Section.
Sociedad are managed by former Everton and Manchester United boss David Moyes, a long-time supporter of the international youth tournament.
Moyes regularly sent teams to the Milk Cup when he was in charge at Everton and he conducted the draw in 2003 along with Wayne Rooney, the current United captain who played in the tournament for the Toffees.
"It's a fabulous event which seems to enhance its reputation as the years go on," said Moyes.
"The atmosphere it generates around the region and its high standard of football at all levels is superb - a real credit to the volunteers who painstakingly organise it to exacting standards."
Former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso and Arsenal's Mikel Arteta are products of Sociedad's youth system.
Only one Spanish club has  won the Premier Section - the sparkling Barcelona team including Sergio Busquets and Giovanni dos Santos which defeated a Chelsea side coached by Brendan Rodgers in the 2005 final.
Meanwhile, Chilean outfit O'Higgins will be returning to the 26 July-31 July tournament in the Premier Section.
