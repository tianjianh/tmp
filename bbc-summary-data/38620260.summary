In a hard-fought game of few chances, the League One visitors came closest to a first-half breakthrough when Ryan McGeever's header was blocked on the line.
Ayr's Gary Harkins forced a neat save from Queen's goalkeeper Willie Muir.
Neither goal was severely threatened in a terse and scrappy second half.
Most of the action came in the opening 45 minutes with the visitors pressing early, and Harkins forced to clear McGeever's header away from the goalmouth from Queen's first corner.
Paul Woods might have done better with a 12th-minute chance from eight yards which brought a good save from Greg Fleming in the Ayr goal before Harkins then tested Muir with a good 25-yard effort.
With the interval approaching, Scott McKenna's header again called Muir into action, but after half-time, neither side created a chance worthy of winning the tie.
