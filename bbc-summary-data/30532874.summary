[SN]TITLE[SN]
Disabled Irish boy is awarded £10.5m damages

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An eight-year-old boy brain damaged at birth has been awarded £10.5m (13.5m euro) by the Irish High Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The award was made to Gill Russell from County Cork towards care for the rest of his life.
The judge, who had spent weeks hearing evidence in the case in relation to the boy's future care, said it was a reasonable sum, fair to both sides of the case.
Legal sources said this decision would have implications for future cases.
In 2012, the Health Service Executive (HSE) and Cork University Maternity Hospital apologised to the then six-year old boy as part of the partial settlement of the case.
The boy cannot walk, has cerebral palsy and must use a wheelchair.
Through his mother, he sued the HSE alleging negligence in the circumstances of his birth at the Erinville Hospital, Cork, on 12 July 2006.
Liability was admitted and the case was before the court for assessment of damages only.
