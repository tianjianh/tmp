A jury has retired to consider its verdict in the trial of footballer Adam Johnson.

The former Sunderland player pleaded guilty to grooming a 15-year-old girl and one charge of sexual activity on the first day of his two-week trial.
The 28-year-old denies two more serious counts of sexual activity with a child.
The charges relate to an incident in Mr Johnson's Range Rover on 30 January 2015 after he met up with the girl in County Durham.
The player admits kissing the teenager but told the jury at Bradford Crown Court that the encounter "went no further".
The girl told the court the former England winger "put his hands down her pants" and she performed oral sex on him.

His ex-partner and mother of his child, Stacey Flounders, watched from the public gallery with members of the player's family.
Judge Jonathan Rose told the jury: "When you retire, you must reach verdicts on which you are all agreed.
"I can only accept unanimous verdicts in this case, 12-0 is the only possible score."
Born in Sunderland, Mr Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland for Â£10m in 2012.
