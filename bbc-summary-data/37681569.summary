[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bayern Munich 2-0 B M'gladbach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich cruised to victory over Borussia Monchengladbach thanks to goals from Arturo Vidal and Douglas Costa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chile midfielder Vidal put Bayern ahead early on when he headed in Rafinha's cross after good work by Arjen Robben.
Bayern increased their advantage when Brazil winger Costa capitalised on Oscar Wendt's slip in the area and finished clinically at the back post.
Carlo Ancelotti's side are three points clear of second-placed Hertha Berlin.
Andre Hahn went closest to scoring for Monchengladbach in the second half at the Allianz Arena when he struck the post.
But Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was rarely tested throughout the contest as the home side efficiently clinched the three points.
Dutch winger Robben may be in the latter stages of his career but he continues to sparkle for the German champions.
While the 32-year-old has lost a little of the pace from his Chelsea days, he still possesses the guile and skill to give defenders nightmares.
Robben was instrumental in Bayern's opening goal as he teased the visitors' defence before he released Rafinha to cross for Vidal.
With Ancelotti having decided to rest captain Philipp Lahm, Bayern needed their experienced players to be influential and Robben led the way.
