The charity Morayvia plans to establish a science and technology centre at a former primary school site near Forres.
Those plans have now been given a "massive boost" after successfully tendering for one of the search and rescue helicopters.
The Lossiemouth Sea Kings were mothballed and replaced with helicopters run by the private sector.
Stan Barber, chief executive of the Morayvia Science and Technology project, said:  "We are absolutely overjoyed to be able to announce that the MoD's Disposal Services Agency has agreed that Sea King Mk3 XZ592 should be sold to Morayvia.
"This is the result of the fantastic effort and support we have had from civic, community and political leaders from throughout Moray, as well as from people far beyond our region with a love and understanding of just what the Sea King means to people in this part of the world.
"Above all it has been the support of the general public that has inspired us to put in so much time and effort to secure this fantastic aircraft."
Morayvia chairman Mark Mair said: "The total cost of establishing the Sea King in Moray will be around Â£30,000 - a considerable sum and thanks to the generosity of people in recent months we have some of this funding in place.
"However, we are some way short so in the next few days we will be launching a crowd funding effort aimed at securing all the funding required to ensure we have in place a fitting tribute to the SAR service in Moray for future generations to appreciate and admire."
