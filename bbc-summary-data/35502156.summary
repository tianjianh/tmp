The family of a Denbighshire man whose death is at the centre of a murder probe have described it as "a nightmare we can't wake up from".

The body of Liam Hill, 44, was found at his Rhyl flat on 8 January, two days after he was last seen.
A post mortem examination raised concerns about the cause of his death.
Speaking on Friday, Mr Hill's sister Colette Sudlow said: "We are angry someone's actions have taken Liam's life and destroyed ours."
Officers previously appealed to football fans for help as Mr Hill was seen at Rhyl's Bar Bow pub watching Everton v Manchester City on 6 January.
At a press conference, Ms Sudlow said: "For Liam to be taken away from us at such a young age and in such a cruel way is heartbreaking.
"This has been a very difficult time for the whole family and it's been made worse by the sudden passing of Liam's older brother Sean on Tuesday night."
Police previously said Mr Hill sustained significant head, upper and lower body injuries.
Det Supt Mark Chesters of North Wales Police said Mr Hill was well known in the area and he was "a little disappointed about the lack of information from the local community".
He added: "We have no doubt that Liam's injuries were sustained as a result of a deliberate and sustained attack by one or more people."
