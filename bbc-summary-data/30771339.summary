The 38-year-old forward trended on Twitter as he took a photo of himself with a mobile phone handed to him by one of the club's coaching staff.
But Totti is not the first player to celebrate a goal in that way, with Dom Dwyer doing the same for MLS side Sporting Kansas City in July.
The American, though, was booked.
The selfie photograph has grown in prominence over the past 12 months, with World Cup winners, golfers and motorsport stars celebrating success by taking a photo of themselves and posting it on social media.
Here, BBC Sport takes a look at five of the top selfies taken in sporting celebrations over the past 12 months.
