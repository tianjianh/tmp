The 22-year-old was unattached after he was one of nine players released by the Sky Blues in May.
Coventry-born Thomas began his career with City and went on to make 117 appearances over six years at the club.
He spent time on loan at Liverpool in 2011 but did not make a first-team appearance for the Premier League side.
"If you speak to anyone at Coventry, you know they hold him in very high regard," chairman Lee Power told BBC Wiltshire. "I think he'll be a fantastic signing for the team."
