[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One leaders Dunfermline slumped to a surprise defeat at home as Jamie Bain struck for Airdrieonians.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bain slammed in a low cross from David Cox after 30 minutes after the visitors had absorbed some heavy pressure.
Michael Paton went close with a free-kick for the Pars, while Michael Moffat miscued in front of goal.
Faissal El Bakhtaoui messed up a close range header and the hosts' top scorer was inches away with a shot late in the game as Airdrie held on for victory.
Airdrie, who were stubborn in defence and well organised throughout, move up two places to fourth in the table.
Dunfermline, who had not lost in the league since mid-September, will have their lead cut to four points if nearest challengers Ayr United beat Stenhousemuir on Saturday.
