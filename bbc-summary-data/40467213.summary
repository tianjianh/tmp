At one stage only two of its 14 platforms were open, and points were being manually operated.
Network Rail confirmed all lines had now reopened and said station staff were monitoring the situation.
A spokesman for the rail operator apologised and warned disruption would last until the end of the day.
Cross Country Trains has assured passengers affected by the delays that they can apply for ticket refunds via its website.
Earlier, all lines were blocked and Cross Country Trains said none of its trains were currently moving in the area, as engineers worked to restore services.
Passenger Hattie Revans who was travelling from Bristol to Weston-super-Mare to get to work, described the situation as "quite stressful", and said "the longer this takes the more money I lose".
On Twitter, fellow passenger Shabana Hussain said Network Rail was "making commuter lives hell" and it was "not good enough".
Steve Payton described the situation as "total chaos" and Dale Miller called it "an absolute joke".
