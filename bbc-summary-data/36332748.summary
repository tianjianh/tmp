One day she joined in the no makeup selfie trend on social media and created waves with her honesty and bravery.  As a result of her selfie, many other women from across the world found the confidence to post their own no makeup selfies.
Special makeup to cover up her birthmark was given to her by the NHS who gave advice and support as she approached her teens.   Since then she has perfected her look.
Amy now encourages other young women with birth marks to post their makeup free selfies and also gives make up hints and tips to advise people on what products are best should they want to wear make up to cover up their birthmarks.  You can find out more about Amy and read her advice on her blog.
