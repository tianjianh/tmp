The 38-year-old, who joined Juve in 2001, helped the Turin club to a fifth consecutive Serie A title this season.
"I hope my fantastic story with this club will go on and bring even further success," said Buffon, whose new deal will take him to 17 seasons at Juve.
Defender Andrea Barzagli, 35, has also signed a new deal until 2018, saying Juve is the "best place" to improve.
Barzagli, who has 54 caps for Italy, will retire from international football after Euro 2016.
But Buffon, who has 156 caps for the Azzurri, hopes to play international football beyond the age of 40 and retire after the 2018 World Cup.
His longevity at Juventus has seen him win seven Serie A titles, not including two that were stripped over the Calciopoli corruption scandal, and the Serie B title they won after their demotion.
"I'm immensely proud in the faith Juventus have placed in me once more," said Buffon, who has made 579 appearances for the Turin club.
Buffon has played 44 times for the club this season and set a new Serie A record in going 973 minutes without conceding a goal.
He remains the most expensive goalkeeper of all time following his Â£32m move from Parma in 2001.
Juve could complete a domestic double in Italy if they add the Coppa Italia to their league title when they meet AC Milan in the final on 21 May.
