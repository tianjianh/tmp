The 30-year-old started his career at Portman Road and returned on a short-term deal in September.
He has made six appearances in his current spell, but made his first start on Saturday, scoring in the 1-1 FA Cup draw with Southampton.
Meanwhile, full-back Frederic Veseli and striker Frank Nouble have had their contracts cancelled by mutual consent.
Nouble, 23, joined a year ago from Wolves and scored five goals in 58 games, but has been on loan at Coventry this season.
Former Manchester United and Manchester City prospect Veseli, 22, has played once for Town since arriving in 2013 and has spent most of this season on loan at Port Vale.
And striker Jack Marriott has agreed to continue his loan spell at Woking until the end of the season.
Former Crystal Palace and Birmingham City man Ambrose had spoken this week of how his return to Ipswich had rekindled his enjoyment of the game.
"It's been a difficult few years, not playing. But I've got the love back now, playing with this team and this manager," he told BBC Radio Suffolk.
"It's changed my opinion of football once again and now I love it again."
