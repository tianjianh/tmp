[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Parkin, Kieran McIntyre and Liam Scott set upon four boys, aged 14 and 15, who were camping in woods on the outskirts of Dundee in March last year.
They pulled the boys out of their tents in a "terrifying" attack before demanding valuables.
The three men, all from Dundee, pleaded guilty to assault and robbery.
Scott and Parkin admitted further charges of possessing an air rifle without lawful authority on 7 March 2014.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard that the four boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were camping in Baldragon Woods in Clatto Country Park when they were attacked.
Twenty-year-old McIntyre along with Scott and Parkin - who are both 19 - sat the boys on rocks and shone torches in their eyes, the court was told.
One of the boys had the barrel of a rifle put against the back of his head by Parkin who took him into this tent to get his mobile phone.
The group were then ordered to stay in their tents until sunrise or they "would be shot".
One of the men later told police it was "intended as a joke".
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told the court the boys were left "fearing for their lives" by the attack.
"All of the males were dressed in camouflage, military-style clothing with faces masked and only eyes visible.
"Parkin was also wearing a cape and was described as being 'like the leader'," she said.
The teenage campers were forced to hand over mobile phones, cash and cigarettes,
Miss Robertson added: "The boys described the incident as 'shocking' saying they were 'in fear for their lives', 'shaken', 'terrified', and 'frightened'."
Lawyers for the three men said they were "extremely apologetic", "disgusted" and "extremely contrite".
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC deferred sentence until January for psychological assessments on Parkin as well as further reports on the other two.
She said: "These were terrifying offences. In my view it is quite clear that these offences justify custody."
