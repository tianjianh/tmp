[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides wasted good chances in the first half to take the lead.
However, the deadlock was broken when the visitors failed to deal with a free-kick, and Kyle Benedictus' cross found the head of Toshney.
Kevin Cawley almost provided a perfect cross for Eamonn Brophy to finish but the striker could not get to it as Raith held on to claim the win.
