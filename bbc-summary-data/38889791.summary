[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 2-1 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster's 10-game unbeaten run came to an end as Carlisle ground out a 2-1 win at Brunton Park to get their own promotion hopes back on track.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicky Adams fired the Cumbrians into a first-half lead and a niggly, tense affair was settled late on when defender Niall Mason just failed to clear a Jabo Ibehre effort on the line.
Tommy Rowe headed an injury-time consolation for Rovers and Carlisle had some desperate defending to do before the final whistle.
A speculative 25-yarder from Gary Liddle had Doncaster goalkeeper Ian Lawlor hurrying across his line to cover the left-hand post as the ball zipped inches wide, but Rovers' top scorer John Marquis had the best early opportunity only to slice his shot wildly over the crossbar from well inside the area.
The first half became a cagey midfield tussle with Doncaster edging possession.
But it was Carlisle who took the lead in the 34th minute when John O'Sullivan got free on the right and his cross to the far post was volleyed home by Nicky Adams.
Reggie Lambe almost doubled the advantage shortly afterwards but his close-range drive was well blocked by Lawlor.
A second goal five minutes from time clinched it for Carlisle. Adams set substitute Ibehre free to the left of goal and his cross-shot just found its way across the line despite a last-ditch effort to clear by Mason.
There was still time for Rowe to head past Mark Gillespie and Carlisle were glad to hear the final whistle as the visitors pressed for an equaliser.
