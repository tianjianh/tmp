"The sending off was a big blow. Having just looked at it quickly, I've got no complaints.
"We looked really solid, really organised. I couldn't remember us giving too many chances away other than the opportunity just before half-time.
"I'm delighted with the players because the spirit they showed and the fight they showed to get a result was terrific with ten men."
