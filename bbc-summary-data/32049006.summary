The Â£400,000 compartment fire simulator is part of an expanded partnership between the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd.
Similar facilities will be installed in airports in Inverness, Stornoway and Kirkwall over the next two years.
Bosses said the scheme would improve access to training across the country.
SFRS Chief Officer Alasdair Hay welcomed the expansion of the partnership with HIAL.
He said: "Our primary aim is to ensure all employees have the skills and knowledge required to perform their role competently, with the focus of increasing firefighter safety and reducing risk to our local communities.
"Improving the quality, efficiency and infrastructure of training provision and commercial opportunities through this partnership enables us to ensure that effective training is provided to all employees in a consistent, professional standard and quality - irrespective of geographical location."
David Hackett, airport fire service operations manager for HIAL, added: "As one of the largest airport fire groups in the UK, our professional firefighters train for a wide variety of potential scenarios, which are quite distinct from the challenges faced by SFRS firefighters.
"We therefore welcome the opportunity to work with the team at SFRS and share best practice. It will be a valuable learning experience for both partners, and we look forward to expanding this partnership approach at other HIAL airports."
