Leicestershire lose 16 points and given suspended fine for dissent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicestershire have been docked 16 points by the England & Wales Cricket Board for five incidents of dissent towards umpires and opposing players.

The county admitted the offences at a disciplinary hearing on Friday, and the deduction effectively cancels out one of this summer's two Championship wins.
The Foxes had previously endured a 37-game winless run in first-class cricket before beating Essex in June.
"We believe that the sanction imposed is severe," said CEO Wasim Khan.
"[Head coach] Andrew [McDonald] and I have worked hard, and continue to do so, to improve the expected standards and levels of discipline expected of Leicestershire cricketers."
Leicestershire were also handed a suspended Â£5,000 fine, which will be imposed if the county's players commit two further fixed penalty offences within the next 12 months.
But the points deduction leaves Leicestershire, who beat Derbyshire to secure their second win of the season on Monday, 32 points adrift of eighth-placed Kent at the bottom of County Championship Division Two.
"The conclusion to today's hearing is bitterly disappointing to us considering the superb win earlier this week against Derbyshire and taking into account the significant strides we have made this season," Khan added.
"Clearly more needs to be done, but we will brush ourselves off and remain determined to do everything possible to improve every aspect of the club."
