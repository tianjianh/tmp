It is thought they had been in a dinghy and returning to their yacht after visiting the Hotel Eilean Iarmain in Isleornsay.
An emergency call was made at 01:20 when they failed to arrive.
Coastguard rescue teams from Kyle of Lochalsh, Portree and Broadford were called out. The Mallaig lifeboat was launched as part of the search.
A coastguard spokesman said: "We recovered two casualties from the water.
"It appears to be two males and we suspect they had capsized."
The men were taken by lifeboat to Mallaig where they were transferred to an ambulance and transported to Belford Hospital in Fort William.
