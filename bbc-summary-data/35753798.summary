The first will take place on 24 March and the second will be broadcast on 1 May, days before the 5 May election.
The broadcaster is also commissioning a poll to find out about the issues that matter to the electorate.
In addition, the leaders of Scotland's main political parties will be quizzed on BBC Radio Scotland by presenters Gary Robertson and Kaye Adams.
Head of news and current affairs at BBC Scotland, Gary Smith, said: 'We are developing an in-depth and compelling range of content for our audiences across all our platforms.
"Voters are centre-stage and we'll be giving them all the breaking news and views from the campaign trails, as well as expert analysis on the issues that count, as they prepare to go to the polls."
