The Swiss, 35, won 6-3 6-4 to reach the last 16, where he will face Spanish 14th seed Roberto Bautista Agut.
"I feel like I earned it more," said Federer, the champion in 2005 and 2006. "I was more the aggressor. It was more my racket, and I like it that way."
In the women's singles, German top seed Angelique Kerber beat Risa Ozaki of Japan 6-2 6-2.
Twelfth seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark progressed after Spanish sixth seed Garbine Muguruza retired when feeling dizzy in the heat at  7-6 (7-1) down.
"I started normal, and then like at 3-3 or something like this I started to feel headache, pain in my stomach," said Muguruza. "And then it kind of went more and more during the match.
"When I was getting to the 5-4, something like this, I started to feel a little bit dizzy. I think it was the heat. The heat affected me suddenly like that."
Wozniacki will next face Czech Lucie Safarova, who beat Slovakian fourth seed Dominika Cibulkova 7-6 (7-5) 6-1, while Czech second seed Karolina Pliskova brushed aside compatriot Barbora Strycova 6-1 6-4.
Venus Williams, who last won the tournament in 2001, saw off Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-3 7-6 (7-4).
In the men's singles, top seed Stan Wawrinka, who has never won the event, overcame Tunisia's Malek Jaziri 6-3 6-4, while Australian Nick Kyrgios edged past Ivo Karlovic in a deciding tie break 6-4 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (7-2).
Czech 10th seed Tomas Berdych beat Luxembourg's Gilles Muller 6-3 6-4 and goes on to play Frenchman Adrian Mannarino.
