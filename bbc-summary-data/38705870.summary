The seven Dutch nationals were arrested in Amsterdam and Valencia in Spain.
The armed gang, disguised as airport workers, stole the diamonds as they were about to be put onto a plane.
Some of the diamonds were recovered from a getaway car but stones worth an estimated €40m are still missing.
Correspondents say the theft was one of the world's biggest ever jewellery heists.
