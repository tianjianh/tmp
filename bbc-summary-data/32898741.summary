[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two police officers have been disciplined for failures in an indecency case in which a man exposed himself to three children in Belfast.

The suspect reportedly approached three young girls in the east of the city last August, asking them to touch him.
The father of one of the girls complained to the Police Ombudsman's Office over the PSNI's response.
The PSNI has apologised, saying it had "failed" to provide a professional service on this occasion.
The Police Ombudsman found that police failed to treat the initial 999 call as an emergency and failed to secure CCTV pictures.
After delays on the part of the police, some CCTV footage was automatically wiped clean.
The suspect has still not been caught.  The girls were about seven-years-old at the time.
The Police Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, has concluded that although police subsequently went to "great lengths" to find the suspect, their efforts were undermined by "failures in the early part of the investigation".
The ombudsman's staff were given access to all police radio transmissions, phone calls and documentation related to the investigation into the incident on the Beersbridge Road. They also interviewed a number of people involved in case.
Dr Maguire's team established that the initial 999 call was made at 16:26 BST on 4 August, and that a police despatch officer circulated a description of the alleged offender within two minutes of receiving the call.
However, when the dispatch officer entered a report of the incident on the PSNI's computer system, the ombudsman's office found they had given it "a grading which indicated that while the issue had a degree of importance, it did not require an emergency response".
The initial 999 caller told police the suspect ran off towards a nearby river, but police received a second call 32 minutes later telling them he was still in the area.
Following the second call, the police dispatch officer's supervisor stepped in and instructed that the incident should be dealt with as an emergency, sending a police vehicle to the scene.
Dr Maguire said the police dispatch officer had "failed to assign police officers to the call and failed to consider the young age of the girls and the fact the alleged perpetrator had left the scene".
"This report required police to attend immediately; regrettably this did not happen. Police lost 32 minutes in responding to the call and with this an opportunity to apprehend the man," the ombudsman added.
The policewoman who was then tasked with leading the investigation had technical difficulties getting CCTV footage from a nearby petrol station.
The Police Ombudsman's investigation found that "she failed to ask for the necessary technical help from colleagues or to explain the urgency of the task, all of which contributed to a delay, during which time the footage was automatically wiped clean".
Police Ombudsman investigators also identified CCTV footage from a nearby shop which had been "overlooked" by the the PSNI.
The surviving footage was then seized by police but the ombudsman said that "despite a thorough investigation from this point onwards", the suspect has not been caught.
Both the police dispatch officer and the Investigating Officer have been disciplined as a result of the ombudsman's findings.
In a statement,  District Commander Nigel Grimshaw said: "As a police service, we are committed to providing a professional service to the community and apologise that, on this occasion, we failed to do that.
"While such failings reflect badly on the Police Service of Northern Ireland, it is a single incident, one which we must learn from, but it does not reflect the excellent work which our officers do every day to support the local community and keep people safe."
