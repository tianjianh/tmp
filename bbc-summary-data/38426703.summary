PC Paul Briggs: No appeal against ending life support

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision to allow doctors to stop providing life support treatment to policeman who has been in a minimally conscious state for 18 months will not be challenged, lawyers have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Briggs, 43, suffered a brain injury in a crash on his way to work for Merseyside Police.
A judge ruled on Tuesday that Gulf War veteran Mr Briggs should go on to a palliative care regime at a hospice.
His wife Lindsey said she was "happy and relieved" there would be no appeal.
Mrs Briggs had told the Court of Protection treatment should be stopped "given his previously expressed wishes" and he should be allowed to die.
But doctors treating Mr Briggs had opposed the withdrawal of treatment.
Mr Justice Charles ruled in her favour after a hearing in the Court of Protection, where judges consider issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to take decisions.
Lawyers had suggested the Official Solicitor, which acts for people who are vulnerable because of their lack of mental capacity, may seek leave to appeal against the decision.
But a spokeswoman for Irwin Mitchell, the law firm which represented Mrs Briggs, said on Friday the Official Solicitor's office had decided not to appeal.
Driver Chelsea Rowe was jailed for a year for crashing into PC Briggs in Birkenhead as he was riding his motorcycle on the way to work a nightshift in July 2015.
He suffered a bleed on the brain and five spinal fractures. He has been kept alive through medical intervention.
