The 21-year-old kicked 35 points over two legs in the Championship play-off final as Bristol won promotion.
Sheedy has not featured at all for Bristol in the Premiership this season after suffering a hamstring injury.
"He's worked his way back to fitness and should be an exciting addition to our back-line," Jersey head coach Harvey Biljon said.
Sheedy will be on the bench for injury-hit Jersey as they travel to Merthyr Tydfil to face Cardiff Blues Premiership Select in the British and Irish Cup on Saturday.
