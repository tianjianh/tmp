Dundee Sheriff Court heard the 16-year-old boy had attended a party in Dundee last November and left with three friends for another address.
The teen, who cannot be named, held the blade to driver Mohammed Ashar's neck on their return to the party.
One boy, 16, pleaded guilty to assault and another, also 16, admitted theft. Sentence was deferred until next month.
The attacker, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had previously served custodial sentences for assaults committed when he was 14 and 15.
The court heard the boy had visited a party in Mossgiel Crescent and left with three other friends at 03:00.
On their return to the party Mr Ashar told the four they needed to pay their fare before exiting the car.
The teen then pulled out a machete, which was shown to the court, and held it to the driver's neck.
He fled the taxi screaming for help prompting one of the other boys, who cannot be named, to steal a drawstring bag containing the driver's change as they made off.
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told the court the boys then went back to the party.
She said: "The other three boys had intended just to commit taxi fraud but were all surprised when the other boy pulled out the machete.
"Officers attended the party around 4am and the machete was found in plain sight on the kitchen floor."
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until next month for social work background reports.
