[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 1-1 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Dagnall's 100th league goal secured Crewe a comeback point from a 1-1 draw with Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dagnall flicked Zoumana Bakayogo's cross from the byline into the roof of the net on 56 minutes to cancel out Pat Hoban's 51st-minute header.
A draw was a fair outcome as both sides lacked quality in the final third. Hoban drove high over with an early shooting chance for the Stags, while James Jones' volley was comfortably fielded by Scott Shearer.
Shearer was alert to repel a shot on the turn from Dagnall and a fierce blast from Ryan Lowe.
But it was Mansfield frontman Danny Rose who went closest in the first half with a diving header which arrowed inches past the post.
Rose featured at the other end when he got his foot in the way to divert a goal-bound shot by Jones as Crewe stepped up the pressure before the interval.
But it was Mansfield who forged ahead soon after the break when Hogan drifted free at a corner to glance Kevan Hurst's cross into the bottom corner.
The lead was short-lived though as Dagnall struck - and it was Crewe who were chasing a winner in the closing stages. But the dependable Shearer pushed away a header from George Ray and fellow substitute Dan Udoh drove a later effort into the side netting.
