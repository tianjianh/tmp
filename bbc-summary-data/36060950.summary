The Pirates led 2-0 at the break thanks to Billy Bodin's strike and Lee Brown's well-struck 20-yard free-kick.
The away side hit back early in the second half when Jake Taylor curled a shot past home keeper Steve Mildenhall.
But Taylor's clinical finish ensured the win that leaves Rovers one point behind third-placed Oxford United.
