David Cameron laughs as UUP's Danny Kinahan offers ideas for his next job

If David Cameron is looking for a new job as he steps down as prime minister, he was given plenty of ideas by Ulster Unionist MP Danny Kinahan.

Paying tribute to Mr Cameron during his final Prime Minister's Questions, the MP suggested a complete career change.
He said leadership roles were available as manager of the English football team, presenter of Top Gear or as the next occupant of the White House.
Mr Cameron laughed but said the posts sounded "even harder" than his own job.
The prime minister was given a standing ovation by Conservative MPs in the House of Commons, as he prepared to hand over power to Theresa May on Wednesday.
Mr Kinahan commended Mr Cameron's record in office, saying: "May we thank the prime minister for all his hard work and his leadership and particularly his commitment to the union and to Northern Ireland."
The South Antrim MP said his party was looking forward to working with the next prime minister but also offered the incumbent some career advice.
"I'm told that there are lots of leadership roles out there at the moment," Mr Kinahan said.
"There's the England football team, there's Top Gear, there's even across the big pond a role that needs filling."
Mr Cameron thanked the UUP member for his "kind remarks and fascinating suggestions for future jobs."
He added that most of them "sound even harder than this one, so I think I'll pass".
During his tribute, Mr Kinahan said the prime minister had visited Northern Ireland "often" during his six-year tenure.
He reminded him of the time he went for an early morning dip in Lough Erne, when County Fermanagh hosted the 2013 G8 summit and he invited Mr Cameron back to swim in Lough Neagh.
In response to Mr Kinahan's final question - about the threat to the UK posed by its decision to leave the European Union - Mr Cameron said Northern Ireland was stronger now than when he came to power six years ago.
