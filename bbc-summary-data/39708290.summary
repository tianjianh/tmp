Paul Robinson: Birmingham City club captain on FA violent conduct charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City club captain Paul Robinson has been charged with violent conduct by the Football Association following Sunday's Second City derby defeat at Aston Villa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robinson, 38, appeared to aim a kick at Villa skipper James Chester after Gabby Agbonlahor's 68th-minute winner.
The incident was not seen by the match officials but was caught on video.
Full-back Robinson has until 18:00 BST on Wednesday, 26 April to reply to the charge.
The FA have the power to act on any off-the-ball incidents not seen at the time by the match officials, which are then referred to a panel of three former elite referees.
The former Watford, West Bromwich Albion, Bolton Wanderers and Leeds United defender was sent off in Blues' other away West Midlands derby this season - a 2-1 win at Wolves nine games ago - before his red card was overturned by the FA on appeal.
