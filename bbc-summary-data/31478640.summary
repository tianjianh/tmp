Translink: Bus and rail fare increases come into effect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bus and train fare increases have come into effect, with prices rising by more than three times the rate of inflation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
NI Railways journeys have increased by an average of 4.5%.
Ten pence has been added to most Metro fares, while Ulsterbus journeys have gone up by an average of 4%.
The fare increase was announced last December. At the time, Translink said the rise was a "last resort" and that fares across all of its services had been frozen since 2013.
The rate of inflation in December 2014 was 1.6%, according to the Retail Prices Index (RPI).
The Consumer Council has called on Translink to be clear about the actual level of fare increases that passengers face.
Aodhan O'Donnell, the council's interim chief executive, said: "Put simply, if Translink are asking passengers to pay more they must be clear with their customers by how, and for what services."
"The fact is that there are so many different ticketing options available on Translink's services that many people will not understand exactly what their new fare will be from 16 February."
