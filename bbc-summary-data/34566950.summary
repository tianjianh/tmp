[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The restoration of a Surrey canal has taken a step forward with the signing of a lease for a stretch of land.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wey & Arun Canal Trust said it can now restore 400m of the waterway's Bramley Link section, south of Guildford.
The trust has so far carried out work on more than half of the 23-mile canal route.
It has fully restored three-and-a-half miles in the Loxwood area where it runs public excursion boats.
The new lease is for farmland owned by trust supporters Susan and Malcolm Brenton.
It will enable a stretch of the canal from Shalford down to the Tannery Lane Bridge near Bramley to be restored.
A year-long environmental impact assessment, a civil engineering design study and a full flood study are being carried out.
The trust said the studies will support a planning application in summer 2016.
The first fully restored section in Surrey, on the Summit Level between Alfold and Dunsfold, is due to open in September 2016.
