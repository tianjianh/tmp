The 38-year-old ended his playing career with the Blues in 2014 and has been working as a television pundit.
Iwelumo replaces Ian Sharps, who moved to League One side Walsall to become their first-team coach.
"Can't wait to get started at such a brilliantly run club," he said on Twitter.
Iwelumo scored once in 10 games for Chester before retiring after a career which saw him play for 19 different clubs including Stoke City, Wolves, Colchester, Burnley and Watford.
