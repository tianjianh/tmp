[SN]TITLE[SN]
Winston Churchill's War Rooms clock fails to sell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A clock that belonged to Winston Churchill and took pride of place in the Cabinet War Rooms during World War Two has failed to sell at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wooden desk clock was given to George Rance, clerk and custodian of the complex beneath Whitehall in London, at the end of the war in 1945.
It had been valued at between £400 and £600 by auctioneers Stride and Son of Chichester, West Sussex.
Peter Parker from the auction house said he was "very disappointed".
The ebonised clock, which has the letters PM stamped on its back, has "fantastic provenance" according to Mr Parker.
Prior to Friday's auction, Sir Nicolas Soames, the Conservative MP grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, said he could imagine seeing the clock on his grandfather's desk.
