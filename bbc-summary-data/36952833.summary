DCI Paul Moxley said: "This is thought to be a targeted attack and we have no reason to believe there is any wider threat to the community."
"A concerned member of the public found the boy on the floor, they called the ambulance service who called us," he said.
"The individual's family are at the hospital - they're a large family," he added.
