Derek de la Haye said the Games had cost £1.9m to stage, with £1.3m of the funding from the States.
The Island Games is a biennial multi-sport event for small island communities around the world, similar to the Olympic Games.
Nearly 3,000 athletes will compete, including from British Islands like the Isle of Wight, Ynys Mon and Shetland.
Mr de la Haye said they had been planning the Games in Jersey for more than five years.
He said: "We've tried to look at the legacy, the budget is £1.9m and the States put £1.3m. We believe it will boost the economy with so many people here.
"We believe that will turn into about a £4m boost but it goes way beyond that as the improvement in facilities and motivation for people to stage other events will have an impact."
There are athletes from 24 islands around the world competing in sports such as shooting and swimming.
The Island Games start with the opening ceremony in Howard Davis Park, where about 6,000 people are expected.
Jersey last hosted the Games in 1997 and the last British Games was in the Isle of Wight in 2011.
