The knife and axe attack on a German train came too late for the country's print press, but the websites of the main newspapers have been following the story closely.

On Tuesday, several newspapers focus on reports that a hand-painted flag of the militant group Islamic State (IS) was found at the room of the attacker - a 17-year-old Afghan who was shot by police.
Four people were injured - two critically - in the assault in a regional train near the southern city of Wuerzburg.
German tabloid Bild highlighted reports that the teenage attacker was shouting "Allahu akbar", and quotes an eyewitness as saying that the scene of the attack resembled a "slaughterhouse".
The Die Welt daily had an image of the interior of the train after the attack, shot from the outside through a window.
News magazine Der Spiegel carried a picture of shocked passengers being led away from the train. Elsewhere, it covered the outrage that greeted a tweet by prominent Green politician Renate Kuenast in which she questioned the police's decision to shoot the attacker.
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung ran a live page, which features a map showing the train's route when the attack happened. It also reported that the attacker lightly wounded a local resident after fleeing the scene on foot, adding that he got about 500 m (1,640ft) away from the train before being shot.
