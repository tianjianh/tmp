Kilmarnock rallied from two goals down to win 3-2 at League Two Berwick, but League One Peterhead upset Dundee 2-1.
An Iain Vigurs hat-trick helped Inverness Caledonian Thistle to a comfortable 5-1 victory at Dunfermline.
Motherwell stuttered before beating East Stirlingshire 3-0, while Partick enjoyed a 4-1 win at Stenhousemuir.
Peterhead shocked Premiership side Dundee with a 2-1 win at Balmoor, leaving Paul Hartley's men with an uphill battle to progress.

Forfar got the better of group leaders East Fife 2-0 at Station Park.
James Lister gave the League two hosts the lead before Andy Munro doubled it five minutes after the break.
The result keeps both teams still in the hunt. East Fife have finished their group games but could still be overtaken for a top-two finish on goal difference.
Brechin and St Johnstone could not be separated after 90 minutes, with the home side prevailing 4-2 in the penalty shootout to claim the bonus point.
Andy Jackson's bullet header gave the League One side a first-half lead, but Chris Kane rescued a draw for Saints with an equaliser four minutes from time.

Vigurs punished a poor kick from Pars keeper David Hutton to score from distance, against the run of play, and despite Andy Geggan's fourth of the season for the hosts, Vigurs' free-kick put them ahead at the break.
Billy King extended Caley Thistle's lead in the second half and Vigurs completed his hat-trick with a well-placed header.
Carl Tremarco's late fifth put the icing on the cake for a potent Caley side.
Arbroath and Cowdenbeath meet on Wednesday in the other Group C match.

Ayr top the table on nine points having completed their four games, but could still be overtaken by Hamilton, who visit Edinburgh City on Wednesday, and St Mirren.
Souleymane Coulibaly inspired a thrilling comeback as Kilmarnock avoided a cup shock against League Two outfit Berwick Rangers.
Goals from Jonny Fairbairn and on-loan Hibs youngster Sean Mackie had Lee Clark's charges staring down the barrel of a chastening defeat at Shielfield Park, following their home humbling by Morton.
But Coulibaly responded with two superb instinctive finishes in five minutes to restore parity, and the turnaround was complete after 85 minutes when Rory McKenzie headed home the winner to make it 3-2.
