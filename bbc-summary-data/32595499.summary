[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP has suspended two members of their party following scuffles at rally held by the Scottish Labour leader and comedian Eddie Izzard in Glasgow.

A spokeswoman confirmed Piers Doughty-Brown and James Scott had been placed under "administrative suspension".
Protesters, who shouted "Red Tories out", drowned out Jim Murphy as he tried to speak on Monday.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said those who took part in the protest had "crossed the line".
On Monday, Ms Sturgeon condemned the scenes but had said they had "nothing to do with the SNP".
The pair were suspended on Tuesday, pending an investigation.
A SNP spokesperson said: "Mr Doughty-Brown has been placed under administrative suspension from the SNP, as was James Scott. The SNP will always act on these matters - unlike Labour, who have still taken no action against senior Labour activist Ian Smart for his vile tweets.
"As Nicola Sturgeon has said, this is a fantastic election campaign, and we should all be out there putting forward positive messages and engaging constructively with the people of Scotland."
Speaking on the BBC's New Channel, the SNP leader said she "condemned anybody who behaves unacceptably".
She added: "We will condemn, we will take action where that is appropriate because I will never, ever condone action that I think falls short of the democratic standards we should all expect."
The protest was organised by Sean Clerkin, who described his group as "anti-austerity campaigners".
He told the BBC that details of the event had been passed to him by a disillusioned member of the Labour Party in East Renfrewshire.
The veteran campaigner said only one of those involved in his group was a member of the SNP, although he personally planned to vote for the party because of its call for increased public spending.
Mr Murphy said the protest was evidence that the SNP was trying to disrupt the democratic process, while Mr Izzard condemned the "violent emotion".
Demonstrators interviewed by the BBC on Monday denied they were there on behalf of the SNP and the party said it had nothing to do with the protests.
Piers Doughty-Brown describes himself on Twitter as a "medically retired union official" and has posted a picture of himself on the social media site protesting at a previous Labour event on Buchanan Street during the independence campaign.
James Scott is a member a group called the Scottish Resistance.
Last month, Nicola Sturgeon challenged Scottish Labour Deputy leader Kezia Dugdale to take action against Labour activist Ian Smart, who previously described the SNP as "fascist scum" online.
Ms Dugdale said she would look into the matter.
