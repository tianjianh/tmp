Birmingham doctor Ali Mao-Aweys is in front of a Medical Practitioners Tribunal panel, accused of facilitating FGM both in the UK and abroad.
The charges relate to a telephone call and meetings in April 2012, in which he was said to offer to aid the practice.
Dr Mao-Aweys was arrested in May 2012 on suspicion of arranging an operation, but was not prosecuted.
If the panel finds him guilty of the charges, he faces being struck off the medical register.
The hearing is due to last two-and-a-half weeks.
