Danny Rose agrees with Shearer's 'laughing stock' comment after Sam Allardyce exit

England left-back Danny Rose says Alan Shearer was right to call the national team a "laughing stock" following Sam Allardyce's departure as manager after just 67 days and one game in the job.

"It's hard to say, but I agree a bit," said Tottenham defender Rose.
"I don't want to say it's a mess, but it's not nice for English football."
Allardyce left his role after being exposed for telling undercover reporters posing as businessmen how to "get around" player transfer rules.

Allardyce took over from Roy Hodgson in the aftermath of England's embarrassing Euro 2016 exit at the hands of Iceland.
The former Sunderland boss won his one and only game in charge - a 1-0 World Cup qualifying victory over Slovakia - before his sudden exit.
At the time, Shearer, who scored 30 goals in 63 games for his country, said England had hit rock bottom with Allardyce's departure.
"I didn't think England could stoop any lower from what happened in the summer at the Euros," he told BBC Sport.
"Now here we are, a laughing stock of world football."
Gareth Southgate, who has been England Under-21 boss, will take charge of the senior side for four games, starting with World Cup qualifiers against Malta at Wembley on 8 October and in Slovenia three days later.
"I hope the next England manager will be one for the long term and help us to improve a bit in tournaments," added Rose.
"Everyone - the players, the manager and all the staff - we've got to take it on ourselves to try to lift the opinion of English football over the next few games."
Rose, who played in the win over Slovakia last month, said he had texted Allardyce to thank him for selecting him and to wish him the best for the future.
"He was brilliant when he was there," added Rose. "He was such a good laugh, really approachable and he allowed us to play as well."
