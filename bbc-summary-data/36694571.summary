[SN]TITLE[SN]
ScotRail staff holding 24-hour strike on Sunday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of ScotRail staff are striking on Sunday after talks to resolve a row over driver-only trains broke up.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
ScotRail is running replacement buses and estimated that about 70% of services would be unaffected.
The dispute relates to driver-only-operation (DOO) trains, where the driver is asked to close the doors at stations, instead of the conductor.
The RMT union says the move poses a risk but ScotRail said it would always schedule a second person on trains.
Members of the RMT already staged four walkouts and the latest action forms part of a further series of strikes.
Talks have been taking place to resolve the dispute, however on Friday, conciliation and arbitration service Acas said discussions between the RMT and ScotRail had adjourned "to allow both sides to consider their positions".
The Scottish government said it had contacted both parties, calling on them to "put their differences to one side and reach an agreement in order to minimise disruption for the public".
RMT's revised programme of strike action:
* 00.01 to 23.59 on 3 July
* 00.01 on 10 July to 23.59 on 11 July
* 00.01 to 23.59 on 14 July
* 00.01 on 16 July to 23.59 on 17 July
