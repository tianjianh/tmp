[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial service has been held in Staffordshire for people who have been killed on roads.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was arranged by charity RoadPeace and took place at the National Memorial Arboretum, near Alrewas.
Motorway police and bereaved families read names from oak leaves, which were then buried.
The charity said it gave an opportunity to give "public recognition of these tragic and unnecessary deaths".
Roadpeace said 29 people were killed on Staffordshire roads, and 56 across the West Midlands, in 2014.
About 120 people attended the ceremony, which is one of many events during August marking National Road Victim Month.
