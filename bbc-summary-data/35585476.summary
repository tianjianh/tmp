Government 'dithering' over HMP Reading future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has been accused of "dithering" on the future of Reading Jail by a senior councillor.

The Grade II-listed prison was shut in 2013 and Reading Borough Council has hopes to take it over the site.
But, deputy leader Tony Page said: "We're still none the wiser - we need a much more urgent timetable."
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said no progress had been made since it confirmed in November the site would be sold for housing.
Mr Page said: "This constant delay in dithering by the government is not helping matters.
"The last indication we had, informally from officials at the Ministry of Justice, was that this wouldn't take place until next year which is far too late.
"They say they are moving as quickly as possible which clearly isn't fast enough... it's still moving forward at a snail's pace."
The empty jail cost the MoJ about Â£262,000 in the 2014/15 financial year, which covered security and utility bills.
Andy Brown, Historic England's south east planning director, said it "desperately" needed redeveloping.
"There's a real problem with buildings like this that sit unused for a long period of time because if dry rot or wet rot sets it becomes hugely expensive to sort out, so we're really hoping we can play a part in unlocking this," he said.
Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the building was not suited to be adapted for housing.
She said the government was in a "panic" about its future.
"They want to sell it off obviously because they want the capital money, but at the same time they've completely failed to sort out the prison population so they're having to keep places like Reading just in case it gets even worse," she said.
