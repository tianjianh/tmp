The attack, which was being treated as a possible hate crime, happened on Saturday evening on Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan.
The images released by the New York Police Department (NYPD) show the man leaving the scene.
The 35-year-old woman, from Glasgow, was returning from sightseeing.
The woman, who has not been named, felt a warm spot on her arm and turned and saw the clothing on her arm on fire and a man with a cigarette lighter.
She was able to pat out the fire with her hands and did not suffer any injury.
The NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident. There have been no arrests and the investigation is ongoing.
The police said that two additional incidents had been reported in the same area on Saturday evening.
In one incident, a man appeared to ignite a lighter next to a woman's leg.
In another case, two women walking down a staircase to a train platform had a flame placed near their arms.
None of the women were dressed in Muslim attire.
The newly-released images from the attack on the Scottish woman show a black man wearing a black hat, black tank top, black trousers and black shoes walking in the street.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "This must have been a very frightening incident.
"The Scottish government condemns all hate crime and hopes anyone with information about this assault contacts the NYPD."
