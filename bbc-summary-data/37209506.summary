[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The last BHS store in Northern Ireland has closed its doors for good.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Belfast store, on Castle Place in the city, was among the last 22 of the chain's UK outlets to cease trading on Sunday.
BHS stores in Lisburn, Newtownabbey and Belfast's Holywood Exchange also closed in recent weeks.
The retailer was placed in to administration in March but failed to find a buyer.
The brand will now disappear from the high street after almost 90 years of trading, marking the end of an era for some shoppers.
Staff in the Belfast city store were seen toasting the closure in the shop's window on Sunday afternoon.
The store was stripped of all stock and customers said they were given free hangers.
Michaela Lafferty, area organiser of Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW) said some staff were angry.
"The shock that they (the staff) felt has now settled, they are angry.
"The staff built and rebuilt this store through the dark days of the Troubles and now they have spent the last few days dismantling it.
"It has been soul destroying."
The future for some of the staff in Belfast is unclear as talks continue between Sir Philip and the pensions regulator.
If they fail, then 11,000 BHS staff who have lost their jobs could get a smaller pension than expected.
