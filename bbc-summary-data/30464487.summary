Up to 150 people aged between 18 and 24 could benefit from the project which is designed to transform their housing, education and employment outlook.
The government money has been given to Aspire Gloucestershire - a partnership between the P3 and CCP charities - to be spent over three years.
It begins in January with the aim of "breaking the cycle of homelessness".
A spokesman for Aspire Gloucestershire said each person referred to them would have a link worker "who will provide intensive, personalised support that begins by helping them find a stable place to live.
"They will also be offered guidance on education, training and employment options for the duration of the three-year project that will help them avoid the cycle of homelessness," added the spokesman.
In April, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced that the government was making £30m available to improve the prospects of up to 20,000 vulnerable young people.
