[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two brothers who tortured two other children in South Yorkshire have been granted lifelong anonymity.

The boys, then aged 10 and 11, lured their victims to a ravine and carried out a "sadistic" attack in Edlington, near Doncaster, in 2009.
They were sentenced to five years' detention in 2010 and granted anonymity until the age of 18.
The High Court has now given them lifelong anonymity on the grounds they would be "at serious risk of attack".

The boys were released earlier this year after a decision by the Parole Board, but lawyers sought an injunction to extend their anonymity as one of the boys approached his 18th birthday.
The brothers claimed that to identify them would breach various sections of the Human Rights Act.
The High Court ruling places them alongside only four other individuals who have lifelong anonymity orders in place:
The brothers' victims, aged nine and 11, were throttled, hit with bricks, made to eat nettles, stripped and forced to sexually abuse each other in the attack.
A sink was dropped on the older boy's head, and the younger boy had a sharp stick rammed into his arm and cigarettes pushed into the wound.
Parts of the attack were recorded on a mobile phone.
The brothers had moved to Edlington just three weeks before the attack to live with foster parents.
Sentencing them at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Justice Keith said they had committed the "prolonged, sadistic" crimes for no other reason than they got "a real kick out of hurting and humiliating" their victims.
