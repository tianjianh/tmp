Nottingham Panthers coach Corey Neilson says he is hopeful the club's injury crisis appears to be easing ahead of a busy Christmas period.

The Panthers will play six games in 11 days between 23 December and 2 January, including back-to-back games against arch-rivals Sheffield Steelers.
Neilson told BBC Radio Nottingham: "I hope (new signing) Jason Williams will be in and David Clarke will be fit.
"I am hopeful Geoff Waugh and Jeff Dimmen are close, they look close."
Panthers beat Elite League leaders Cardiff Devils 5-2 at the National Ice Centre on Sunday, following a 7-4 defeat at Belfast Giants the previous night.
"Waugh has recently started skating and Dimmen will start skating this week," continued Neilson.
"When they come back, we turn into a different animal. We can then maybe rest guys, like (Alex) Nikiforuk and (Matt) Carter, who are playing injured at the moment.
"It all comes down to bodies. I am not making excuses, we are running on fumes."
The exact date of Williams' arrival is not yet known, and the club say that "the player has family commitments in North America but, with the visa now approved, the Panthers office will be working closely with the player with the hope of getting him to the UK as soon as possible".
