[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors have set out new guidelines on whether messages posted on social media should be treated as a crime.

Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland said the test was simple: "If it would be illegal to say it on the street, it is illegal to say it online."
The Crown Office said it would not pursue satirical or mildly offensive humour or provocative statements.

The Lord Advocate said the aim was not to deny freedom of speech, but the law would target internet trolls posting sectarian, homophobic or violent messages or pictures.
In an interview with the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, the Lord Advocate was asked how "grossly offensive" could be defined when it could be seen as relative.
He replied: "The guidance sets out that it would not include, for example, humour, satirical comment, which is part of the democratic debate, so there's guidance to prosecutors as to what's not included.
"It doesn't include offensive comment because we recognise that, in a democratic society, with use of social media you can have offensive comment which wouldn't be criminal but it's really the category above the high bar grossly offensive which has a significant effect on the recipient of the comment.
"We've all seen on the media reports of what you described, internet trolls, where this kind of comment, grossly offensive comment, is sent out to directly wound and has quite a significant effect."
He added: "There's very detailed guidance of all the factors that prosecutors will take into account when they assess whether or not to raise criminal proceedings in relation to grossly offensive comments posted on social media."
