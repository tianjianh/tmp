The 21-year-old came through the Rams academy and has played 27 first-team games, including eight this season.
Hanson, an ex-England Under-20 player, can also play in defence.
"Jamie is an exciting prospect and Derby feel that his development will be better served by coming on loan to us," said Wigan boss Warren Joyce.
