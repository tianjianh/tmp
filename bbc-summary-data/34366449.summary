Mal Benning's long-range volley put the Stags ahead early on but Matt McClure quickly equalised from 25 yards.
Ashely Chambers scored twice for the Daggers in two minutes to earn a two-goal cushion before Matt Green pulled one back by the break from the spot after being fouled by Clevid Dikamona.
But Krystian Pearce's powerful late header and Adi Yusuff's neat finish secured Mansfield's dramatic comeback.
Dagenham & Redbridge manager Wayne Burnett told BBC London 94.9:

"The goals were a joke. An absolute joke. Our players were not good enough.
"I could single out individuals, but collectively we've all been beat.
"From the off, every ball that went into the box from a corner or a free kick, they won every header."
