The former Wales Under-20 international made 50 appearances in five seasons with the capital region.
The 23-year-old will strengthen the loose-head resources available to the Dragons.
"With Cardiff Blues my chances were limited, being added into the team and then taken out of it continuously, so I am looking forward to challenging for a first team position," said Davies.
Dragons Head Coach, Kingsley Jones added: "Thomas is a player highly rated amongst his team-mates from age grade ranks through to senior level.
"He will bring great cover for (the injured) Phil (Price) in the short term and will go on to challenge for a regular first choice spot in the longer term."
