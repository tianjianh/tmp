Bobby Colleran was struck on Leyfield Road, West Derby, at about 15:25 BST on Friday.
Paramedics attended and he received treatment at the scene but he died from his injuries shortly after.
In a statement, Bobby's family, from Huyton, said: "Our Bob lit up a room, he was the most loving little boy."
They added: "As well as being a cherished son and brother, he was a grandson, nephew, cousin and friend to everyone he met.
"He loved life and school, always coming home with achievement awards to put up on the fridge, playing football when it wasn't too cold, but most of all watching his favourite programme, the Lone Ranger.
"Now re-united with his Grandad and best mate who he missed so so much."
The family also thanked staff at Alder Hey Children's Hospital.
Merseyside Police are appealing for witnesses to the collision to contact them.
