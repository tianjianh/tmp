Council mergers: Leighton Andrews 'disappointed' by response

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Local councils who failed to respond to consultation on mergers have been criticised by public services minister Leighton Andrews.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He said he was "disappointed" that 11 of the 22 councils "had nothing to say about how we shape local government".
The Williams Commission report in January called for a cut to 10 or 12 councils.
Only one of its recommended mergers - Conwy and Denbighshire - has been supported by the councils in question.
Criticism of the councils came as Mr Andrews published more than 170 responses from organisations and members of the public to the formal consultation on local government reorganisation.
However, several of the councils which did not respond to the formal consultation have submitted their views on voluntary mergers following a separate appeal by the minister.
