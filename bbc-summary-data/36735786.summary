The Maidstone-born 26-year-old made 90 appearances during a three-year spell at Ashton Gate.
But he started only one league match for the Robins last season.
"I'm delighted to sign for Gillingham. I've got a lot of friends and family this way, which adds to my excitement about joining," Wagstaff told the Gills' website.
Wagstaff began his career at Charlton, and played 120 league games for the south London club.
He has also had spells on loan at Bournemouth, Leyton Orient and Northwich.
