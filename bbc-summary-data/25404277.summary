The guide wheels came off The Smiler ride in November, hitting Kevin Hayes-Heath in the shoulder, his partner Wayne in the face, and two others.
As well as the free tickets, the couple said their park tickets on that day have been refunded.
Park bosses have declined to reveal any settlements made.
"It took some emails backwards and forwards and a call into the Merlin Group headquarters in Poole, Dorset, but finally we came to the agreement," said Mr Hayes-Heath.
A father and his teenage daughter were also injured on the ride, the couple said. Park bosses said no-one required hospital treatment.
The 14-loop Smiler opened in May.
But it was shut for four days on 21 July after a piece fell off the track and 48 people had to be rescued.
It closed again in August for five days due to a "technical issue".
An Alton Towers spokeswoman said: "I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to discuss guest resolutions as we consider them to be a private matter between the individuals concerned."
