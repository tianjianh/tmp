Jon Nolan: Shrewsbury Town sign Chesterfield midfielder on three-year deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury have signed midfielder Jon Nolan from relegated Chesterfield for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old joined Chesterfield in May 2016 from Grimsby, where he played under Paul Hurst, now Shrewsbury manager.
Nolan has also played for Stockport County, Lincoln and Wrexham.
He has signed a three-year deal and becomes the League One side's third summer signing, after strikers Lenell John-Lewis and Arthur Gnahoua.
Having kept hold of defender Mat Sadler, 32, and winger Shaun Whalley, 29, Hurst is still waiting on offers made to teenage keeper Shaun Rowley and 21-year-old midfielder Bryn Morris.
But midfielder Gary Deegan has left to join Cambridge United.
