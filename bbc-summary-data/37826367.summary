Guernsey are aiming for team medals at the 2017 Island Games, says the head of the island's Golf Union.

Their team for next year's event in Gotland includes only Di Aitchison and Steve Mahy from the players who competed at Jersey 2015.
Aimee Ponte, the 2015 women's gold medallist, and men's bronze medallist Bobby Eggo are among those not named.
"I think realistically we're looking more at a team medal as being the goal," Eric Legg told BBC Guernsey.
"We've got a younger men's team possibly than normal and I'm hoping they will rise to the occasion,
"The ladies will be trying their hardest, as they do, and as they proved against Jersey they were up for the challenge, so I'm really looking forward to seeing how well they will do."
Guernsey golf team for 2017 Island Games:
Men: Steve Mahy, Tom Le Huray, Sean Mills, Jeremy Nicolle.
Women: Di Aitchison, Mandy Webber, Julie Creed, Laura Jeffrey
