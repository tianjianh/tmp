Jamia al-Hudaa Residential College faces new criticism

An Islamic girls' school facing a court battle over its partial closure has again been criticised by inspectors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamia al-Hudaa Residential College in Nottingham lodged an appeal in 2016 after it was ordered to stop taking boarders due to poor Ofsted reports.
A new inspection in January found progress in areas such as promoting British values but continued issues with safeguarding and teaching.
Overall, Ofsted said the school did not meet all national minimum standards.
The school opened in 1996 and has 237 pupils, including 153 boarders.
After a series of Ofsted reports which highlighted concerns over cultural awareness, careers advice and facilities for boarders, the Department for Education placed restrictions on its intake.
But the Madni Trust, which runs the school, challenged this and is currently allowed to operate normally.
Following the recent inspection, Ofsted said progress continued to be "variable" with the attainment of year 11 pupils well below the national average.
The report added: "The level of the secular-based courses is too low to ensure that students achieve qualifications that enable them to prepare effectively for life after they leave the school."
It also said national standards were not met in aspects of safeguarding, bullying prevention, health and safety and leadership.
However, the standards were reached in teaching respect for English law, precluding partisan political views and ensuring basic standards in accommodation.
A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: "Independent schools that are not meeting the independent school standards must improve.
"Where there is evidence to suggest that children do not have access to a good quality education, or other standards are not met, we will take action to enforce improvement."
While the school has yet to comment to the BBC, it told the Nottingham Post it had been told to improve "minor things" and it would organise an "independent" inspection.
