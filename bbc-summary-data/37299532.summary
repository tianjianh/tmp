MP Richard Arkless has voiced frustration in the House of Commons over one debtor he said had forced Penman Engineering into administration.

The company, which makes armoured vehicles at a site near Dumfries, made the move last week.
Mr Arkless said the debtor - who he was not allowed to name - had received "huge public sector contracts".
He asked for export support for Penman but also how other businesses could be made to pay their bills on time.
The Dumfries and Galloway MP raised the issue during Prime Minister's Questions.
He said the firm had been put in an "impossible position".
"Penman has to continue to trade with this debtor as well as pursuing the debt," he said.
Prime Minister Theresa May said her thoughts were with the families affected by the administration.
"The administrator does have a role in ensuring that any sale of the business protects the maximum number of jobs," she said.
She said Scottish Secretary David Mundell had made clear preserving posts was his priority.
"Obviously the administrator will be looking to ensure the best possible options are found for the company," she added.
