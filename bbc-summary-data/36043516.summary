Ringo Starr has joined a growing list of artists and businesses boycotting North Carolina to protest its change to transgender laws.

The former Beatle had been due to play at the Koka Booth Amphitheatre in Cary, near Raleigh, in June.
"We need to take a stand against this hatred," he said in a statement.
Cyndi Lauper, however, has opted to turn her concert into "an entire day to build public support" to repeal the law.
She will be donating all profits from the show on 4 June to Equality North Carolina's efforts to have the law, dubbed HB2, reversed.
"The pressure to repeal HB2 is building and it is beautiful," she said.
"In the dark haze of such oppression, people and companies are stepping up to fight back against this unjust law and ensure that all North Carolinians are treated with dignity and respect, especially the transgender community."
Bruce Springsteen pulled out of a gig on Sunday "to fight against prejudice and bigotry".
Starr added: "I'm sorry to disappoint my fans in the area, but we need to take a stand against this hatred. Spread peace and love.
"How sad that they feel that this group of people cannot be defended.
"This law opens the door to discrimination everywhere by limiting anti-discrimination laws against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity."
The new law, brought in three weeks ago, invalidated several local anti-discrimination measures that protected gay and transgender people.
It also requires people to use public toilets that correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificates.
Its implementation has drawn ire from anti-discrimination campaigners, as well as companies including PayPal, Apple and Facebook.
North Carolina governor Pat McCrory is now seeking to roll back some of the measures included in the bill he signed, to protect LGBT rights - but not those relating to public toilets in schools and government buildings.
