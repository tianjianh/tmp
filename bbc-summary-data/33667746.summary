[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust described the shortage of spaces as "stressful and frustrating" for patients and visitors.
It has applied for planning permission for a temporary 140 space car park for staff next to Reiver House.
As part of a reorganisation, the area closest to the main entrance has been reserved for patients and visitors.
Staff have also been issued with new parking permits.
The trust said in a statement: "The trust fully recognises that it can be very stressful and frustrating for patients attending appointments, visitors wanting to see their loved ones and staff who are about to start their working day, if they cannot park without difficulty."
