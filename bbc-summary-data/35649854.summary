O'Sullivan, 40, qualified for the tournament after his 9-5 victory over Neil Robertson in Cardiff on Sunday.
Five-time world champion O'Sullivan was originally scheduled to play Jimmy White in an exhibition match in Morocco on 12 March which has now been moved.
The World Grand Prix will take place in Llandudno, north Wales, from 8 to 13 March.
O'Sullivan suffered defeated in last year's final, losing 10-7 to Judd Trump.
After the World Grand Prix, just two ranking events - the Players Championship and China Open - will remain before the season-ending World Championship in Sheffield.
Englishman O'Sullivan recently said he is "not really bothered" about the Crucible event and will "treat it like a vacation".
