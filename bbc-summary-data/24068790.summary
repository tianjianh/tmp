[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish League One ins and outs summer 2013

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers were under a signing embargo until 1 September but still managed to be the most significant players in the transfer market this summer in Scotland's League one.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pre-contracts agreements with free agents allowed them to persuade four players to step down from top-flight clubs in return for higher wages, while last season's top scorer in the division, Nicky Clark, switched from promoted Queen of the South.
Initially, their new signings were only permitted to play a limited number of games at trialists, but they are now fully registered to play with last season's Division Two champions already top of the table.
While Rangers are now free of the on-field problems resulting from liquidation, relegated Dunfermline Athletic were the most restricted side in terms of movements because of their summer in administration.
East Fife and Airdrieonians had the highest turnover of players, with the Methil club in particular making some eye-catching signings, former Hearts striker Christian Nade being the best known of a number of arrivals from overseas.
Forfar Athletic also added some top-flight experience with veterans Rab Douglas, Darren Dods and Marvin Andrews arriving at Station Park.
