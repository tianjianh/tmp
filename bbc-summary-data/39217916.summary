Wales' players have to "knuckle down" and get through their Six Nations losing run, says forwards coach Robin McBryde.

Ireland come to Cardiff on Friday night with Wales facing criticism after defeats by England and Scotland.
"Perhaps it's a new experience for this group of players but they've got to come through it," said McBryde, who played 37 Tests between 1994 and 2005.
"They've got to knuckle down and they've just got to get through it."
And the former hooker added: "Until we do get that victory that pressure is going to mount considerably and in adversity that's when you show your true colours.
"We're in a goldfish bowl in Wales and we're aware of it and if the national team doesn't succeed you're going to get a bit of flak and nothing changes.
"[Head coach] Rob Howley, [kicking coach] Neil Jenkins or myself - anyone who was involved in Welsh rugby in the 90s or whatever - we know what it's like and we know there's no other way through it other than just rolling your sleeves up and just going at it again."
Individual players have been singled out for criticism by former pundits while the coaching team has faced accusations of becoming stale.
Wales have conceded they are out of the title race and have not lost three games during one Six Nations tournament since 2010.
And since 2005 they have won three Grand Slams and one championship title.
It contrasts with a period between 1994 and 2005 when Wales did not win a Six Nations title.
McBryde is hoping the players can channel the pain of a first defeat against Scotland in a decade when they take on an Ireland side trying to set-up a championship showdown with England in Dublin on 18 March.
"For myself personally there's still a level of hurt there from the Scottish defeat," he added.
"I'm sure the players are feeling that as well so we have to react in a positive manner in the opening exchanges against what will be a very confident Ireland team."
Wales have named an unchanged match-day squad with lock Luke Charteris passed fit for his place on the bench after completing return-to-play protocols following a head blow suffered playing for Bath against Wasps on 4 March.
"There's no changes so there's no excuses there really," said McBryde.
"We've shown faith in them as coaches that there is a lot more to come from that group of players and they are deserving of their opportunity and this is their shot at it."
McBryde confirmed Ireland have agreed to the roof of the Principality Stadium being closed for the match.
England insisted that it stayed open for their 23-16 win over Wales in February.
