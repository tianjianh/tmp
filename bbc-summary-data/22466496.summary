[SN]TITLE[SN]
Find the 'never events' in your NHS trust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 750 patients have suffered after preventable mistakes in England's hospitals over the past four years, a BBC investigation has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incidents, such as operating on the wrong body part or leaving instruments inside patients, are categorised by the Department of Health as "never events".
This means they are incidents that are so serious they should never happen.
NHS England admitted the figures were too high and said it had introduced new measures to ensure patient safety.
Find out how many "never events" occurred between 2009 and 2012 within NHS trusts in your area in England by clicking on the table below.
Please note these figures do not reflect the total number of procedures performed in each NHS trust. This means that even if your trust has a high number of "never events" it may also deal with more patients than other trusts.
*In 2012 Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust downgraded one never event in the category of retained foreign object post-operation.
