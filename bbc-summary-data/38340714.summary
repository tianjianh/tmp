[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old joined on a two-year deal from Australian NRL side Cronulla Sharks in November 2015, making 18 appearances and scoring four tries.
But chairman Michael Carter said Tupou and his family were "suffering a lot with homesickness".
Carter told the club website: "Unfortunately things did not work out as well as we all had hoped."
