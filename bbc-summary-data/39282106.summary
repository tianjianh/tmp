[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend "changed his story" on a number of occasions, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police interviews with Michael Lane questioning him as to his whereabouts on the morning of Shana Grice's murder have been played to Lewes Crown Court.
The 19-year-old's body was discovered with her throat cut at her home in Portslade, East Sussex, on 25 August last year. Mr Lane, 27, denies murder.
CCTV footage seen by the court showed him nearby at the time she was killed.
The court heard that police believe Ms Grice died sometime between 07:25 and 08:00 BST, based on the fact that she was conducting a text message conversation with a friend.
A message was sent to her at 07:42, but phone records show she never opened it.
The jury was shown two taped police interviews carried out with Mr Lane.
In the first, police showed him CCTV footage of his movements on the morning of the murder.
The court heard that Mr Lane had said he had left his home in Portslade at 08:00 that morning, but the CCTV showed him near Ms Grice's house in Chrisdory Road at 07:29.
The detectives asked him why he appeared to have changed his story, to which he replied he must have been confused about the time.
In one exchange, a detective told him: "If you killed Shana that would be one explanation as to why your story keeps changing.
"The truth is you went and killed her. Is that correct?"
Mr Lane replied: "No."
The detective then said: "So why all the changes?"
Mr Lane said: "Because of how it looks."
The trial continues.
