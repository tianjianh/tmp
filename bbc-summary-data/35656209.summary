Britain trailed by 10 points early in the fourth quarter but came back to win in a thrilling finish.
Johannah Leedham led GB's scoring with 28 points, while Ella Clark added 15 and Azania Stewart 12.
Great Britain's next match in November is away to group leaders Italy, where they will need another win.
They currently lie third in Group C, behind the unbeaten Italians and Montenegro, with only the nine group winners and six best second-placed teams making it through to the finals in the Czech Republic.
Clark, who hit three three-pointers in her 15 points and took a game-high 12 rebounds, told BBC Sport: "It's a bit of a blur now when you think about it but it was definitely a team effort.
"We were in that rut where we don't do what we do well and we were missing open shots, but even then we were like 'we can still do this - it's only 10 points.'
"It's a big mental thing to know that we still have the chance to qualify."
Montenegro led 35-33 at half-time on Wednesday before increasing their advantage to 58-48 with eight minutes remaining.
But Leedham, Clark and Rachael Vanderwal inspired Britain's late 21-4 surge to ensure they stay in with a chance of qualifying ahead of November's final two matches.
