Charles Bronson sentenced for prison governor headlock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charles Bronson has received a further two-year jail term for holding a prison governor in a headlock.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bronson, 61, whose history of violence earned him public notoriety and led to a film biopic, is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap.
At Amersham Crown Court, Bronson admitted causing actual bodily harm to the boss of HMP Woodhill, Alan Parkins.
The February attack left Mr Parkins with cuts, bruising and a nosebleed.
Thames Valley Police said Bronson gripped Mr Parkins around the neck so tightly he could not breathe and hit him several times on the head.
A number of officers then came to the defence of the governor before Bronson was eventually restrained.
The prisoner was also made to pay a victim surcharge of Â£100 by the court.
Bronson, from Luton, who changed his name by deed poll from Michael Peterson in the 1980s, is currently held at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes.
He was first jailed for armed robbery in 1974. Since then he has held fellow prisoners and staff hostage on a number of occasions and carried out several assaults.
While at the prison in 1994 he infamously held a guard hostage and demanded an inflatable doll, a helicopter and a cup of tea as ransom.
In June, artwork by the prisoner sold for thousands of pounds which he spent on sending his mother on holiday.
