Nicola Sturgeon announced that the Scottish government would work with the UN to offer female peacemakers training in negotiation and communication.
The initiative emerged from discussions between the first minister and the UN special envoy for Syria.
Ms Sturgeon said the work related to UN resolution 1325, which reaffirms the role of women in preventing and resolving conflicts.
She said: "In recent months the world has been both touched by the plight of refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria and horrified by the terrorist atrocities of Daesh.
"Scotland is playing its role welcoming refugees into our communities and we have also provided funding to help support aid agencies responding to the crisis in Syria and surrounding countries.
"However, we are also open to exploring other avenues to assist where we can."
She said she had recently met the United Nations special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, who proposed that Scotland could play a useful role in the peace process through support for female peacemakers.
"In particular, he has asked for our support in training Syrian peacemakers in negotiation and communication skills to best-prepare them to maximise their role in the talks," she said.
Ms Sturgeon said the exact details of the initiative were still to be finalised.
She added: "This is work which I hope can involve politicians across the political spectrum in the Scottish Parliament, but most importantly can also play a small but important part in helping the people of Syria find a lasting peace."
Mr de Mistura said: "Women's leadership and participation in conflict resolution are critical for sustainable solutions. The engagement of women in shaping the future of Syria is more important now than ever before.
"I am, therefore, glad that the Scottish government has agreed to work with the United Nations on this initiative."
