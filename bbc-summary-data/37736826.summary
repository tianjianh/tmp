[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 1-0 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late headed winner from substitute Lee Novak secured Charlton a scrappy triumph over Chesterfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chesterfield's Dan Gardner was unfortunate to see a bending 27th-minute drive from inside the box hit the post.
It was the Addicks' turn to be denied by the woodwork seven minutes later as Nicky Ajose burst through on goal and beat Ryan Fulton, only to see his effort come off the post.
A superb one-handed save by Ryan Fulton prevented Josh Magennis heading Charlton in front shortly before the break.
Northern Ireland international Magennis again went close with his head 12 minutes into the second half, placing his attempt inches off target after being picked out by Ricky Holmes' delivery.
Ajose should have broken the deadlock with a quarter of an hour remaining but instead headed wide when it looked easier to score.
But the opener eventually arrived four minutes from time when substitute Novak headed home from a Holmes cross.
Jay O'Shea almost grabbed a stoppage-time equaliser for the Spireites with a shot that was deflected agonisingly behind for a corner as Charlton held on to seal back-to-back home victories.
