An MoD spokesman said the paratrooper "was a man of integrity and principle".
"He was a natural and talented soldier who loved his work and the military lifestyle.
"He personified the great British Paratrooper - selfless, humble, cheerful and utterly reliable. He did his duty, relishing discomfort as a personal test, and always acting in the greater interests of the team."
Craftsman Andrew Found, of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, serving with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, was killed by a bomb in the Gereshk Valley area of Helmand.
His wife Samantha said of the father of two: "You're my husband, my best friend and are my world. I cannot explain my pain and the hole you have left in all our lives.
"You are the best husband anyone could have wished for; a great dad, friend and you have touched the hearts of many in your life.
"You loved your job, your family and friends and always loved a good joke. You always made me smile. I will love you always and forever. You were my rock and my hero and always will be. I love you so much."
The couple had a son, Jaxson. Craftsman Found also had another son, Michael, from a previous relationship.
His parents Jennifer and Alan Found, and his brother Simon, said: "Even though we are all in pain now, we will remember the fun, the laughter and all the love he brought to all the people he knew and loved."
