[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme on Great Patrick Street has been bought by London-based Olympian Group.
It had been owned by Yorkshire-based Patton Developments, which got the scheme through planning in January. The sale price has not been disclosed.
Construction is expected to begin in July 2016.
Simon Murray-Twinn, Chief Executive Officer of Olympian Homes, said the company was "excited to be bringing forward [the development]".
He said it would contribute to the regeneration of "this much neglected area of the city centre".
