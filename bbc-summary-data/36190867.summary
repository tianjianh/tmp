During its biennial overhaul in Merseyside the ship was given a technical service whilst the passenger lounges received a makeover.
The 12,500 tonne Ben-my-Chree has served the island for 18 years.
A company spokesman said the ferry was back in Douglas and will return to full service on Wednesday.
During its overhaul, the Manannan covered all passenger and car services whilst the MV Arrow covered freight.
