Jordan Botaka then hit the crossbar for Leeds, while Marco Silvestri denied Wolves substitute Joe Mason late on.
Earlier, Chris Wood had four first-half chances to score for the home side, coming closest when he hit the post with a shot from 18 yards.
It is the second time this season that Steve Evans' Leeds have registered three consecutive Championship victories, while Wolves have won only three of their past 17 league games.
Leeds United head coach Steve Evans:
"I thought the second half was quite stunning. This is a Wolves team that are very well organised under a top manager. They don't concede chances let alone goals, yet if we'd scored seven in the second half it might have been deserved.
"But Leeds being Leeds we concede late and have to rely on a big save from our goalkeeper, the one thing he's possibly had to do all evening.
"I'm delighted. It's three good wins against quality clubs."
