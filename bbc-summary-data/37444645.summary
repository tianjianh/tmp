[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police across three counties tracked the vehicle before stopping it Junction 11 at Dunstable, Bedfordshire.
The lorry, which is thought to have set out from Romania, was heading north from Essex when it was halted.
The East of England Ambulance Service said it assessed all those who were found aboard, all of whom are in a stable condition.
Bedfordshire Police said some were experiencing breathing difficulties and were taken to hospital as a precaution before being taken into custody.
A police spokeswoman said: "The driver was Romanian so it may be those on board came from Romania."
A police helicopter has been searching the area for any more suspected illegal immigrants.
