The two clubs, as well as Morton assistant manager Craig McPherson, also face misconduct charges.
SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan took the disciplinary action following a mass confrontation on the touchline when the two sides met last week.
Lennon and Duffy were both sent to the stand by referee Nick Walsh.
The Hibs  boss has been charged with breaching disciplinary rule 203, committing misconduct on three occasions by "adopting an aggressive attitude" to Morton striker Kudus Oyenuga, Duffy and the match officials.
Duffy and McPherson have been charged under the same misconduct rule for entering the Hibs technical area and adopting an aggressive attitude towards Lennon.
Hibs and Morton face misconduct charges under disciplinary rule 204 for "three or more players and/or members of staff" being "involved in a confrontation with opposing players and/or staff".
Tempers flared during stoppage time in the 0-0 draw after Oyenuga was dismissed for a foul on Hibs defender Jordon Foster.
Oyenuga was confronted by Foster's team-mate, Darren McGregor, and fell to the ground, resulting in McGregor being sent off for violent conduct, a charge he has appealed against.
Lennon remonstrated with Oyenuga, prompting Duffy and other members of the Morton backroom staff to then clash with the Hibs manager and others.
The two sides meet again at Cappielow on Saturday and all three individuals, as well as both clubs, have until 11 April to respond to the notice of complaint. A principal hearing date has been set for 20 April.
Lennon said after the game that he would wait to see Walsh's report before deciding whether or not to appeal against his dismissal.
McGregor is likely to hear this week if his appeal against the red card for violent conduct has been upheld.
Lennon told BBC Scotland after the match: "It's a disgraceful challenge right in front of my technical area.
"Then he gets up and Darren McGregor confronts him and he feigns a head butt.
"I have the Morton staff in my technical area having a go at me and then I have the Morton players, acting the big hard men, having a go at me.
"So, I think I have been harshly done by, I think my players have been harshly done by in that incident as well."
Duffy said afterwards that he was "embarrassed" by his conduct and later rejected a claim by Lennon that he had challenged the Hibs manager to a "square go".
