[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 2-0 Dagenham & Redbridge (agg: 3-1)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers set up a National League promotion final against Tranmere Rovers after a 3-1 semi-final aggregate victory over Dagenham & Redbridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With the tie level at 1-1 from the first leg, Christian Doidge put Rovers ahead against his former club when he turned home Kaiyne Woolery's low cross.
Keanu Marsh-Brown, scorer in Rovers' play-off semi-final last term, curled in from the left to double the lead.
The Daggers were unable to create any clear chances as Rovers defended well.
Woolery nearly added a third for Forest Green in added time, but Mark Cousins saved the one-on-one chance, before a pitch invasion at full-time.
The result means there will be no instant return to the English Football League for John Still's Dagenham, after finishing fourth in the table this season.
Rovers will be hoping to put behind them the disappointment of last season, when they were defeated 3-1 in the Wembley final by Grimsby Town, with Marsh-Brown also getting the Gloucestershire side's goal that day.
They will take on a Tranmere side that ended the regular season second behind champions Lincoln City and beat Aldershot 5-2 on aggregate in their play-off semi-final.
The promotion final at Wembley will take place on Sunday, 14 May.
