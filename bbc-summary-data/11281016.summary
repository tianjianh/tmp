The 104th Regiment Royal Artillery volunteers will take possession later of the Worcester vinegar works built by Hill, Evans & Company in the 1850s.
It was refurbished by developers Carillion Richardson in exchange for the army's former HQ in Silver Street.
The developers want to convert the former base into an Asda store.
The artillery regiment said the new development in Lowesmoor would boost the local profile of the army.
The Great Filling Hall, where vinegar barrels were stored, would be used by the TA as a parade hall and offices.
Lt Col Phil Shepheard-Walwyn said: "We now have some excellent new facilities in Worcester which will boost our training capability at an important time.
"The regiment is currently focused on providing unmanned aerial vehicle operators, to support current operations in Afghanistan, and training personnel who will form part of the British contribution to the United Nations Forces in Cyprus next year."
Col Tim Weeks, Chief Executive of the West Midlands Reserve Forces and Cadets Association said: "This is a development of national significance and will boost the profile of the armed forces in Worcestershire."
Martyn Richardson from Carillion Richardson said: "We are delighted to provide this vital facility for the TA at this important time and the whole of this development will create much needed jobs and provide a massive boost to the regeneration of the city."
