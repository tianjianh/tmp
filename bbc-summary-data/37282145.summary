His ashes arrived from Ciudad Juarez, the border city where he grew up, and were taken to the capital's Palace of Fine Arts.
Ten of thousands are expected to visit the palace in the next few days.
A prolific singer and composer, Juan Gabriel combined Mexican genres such as mariachi, ranchero and norteno music.
Security was tight for the huge crowds that turned out on Monday, despite the rain, to see the singer's ashes carried through the streets in a hearse.
A musical tribute also took place at the palace for fans who made the journey to Mexico City.
Juan Gabriel, whose real name was Alberto Aguilera Valadez but was known as Juanga, died of a heart attack in Santa Monica, California, days after performing to 17,000 fans at the Los Angeles Forum.
He sold tens of millions of records, received six Grammy nominations and had his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Fan Paty Berumen, 39, travelled from El Paso in Texas to say goodbye to her hero.
"I don't just like Juanga, I love him," she said outside the Palace of Fine Arts.
"That's why I came here. I didn't warn my family because they wouldn't have let me come. I've slept here, in the street, facing rain, heat and cold. But it's worth it."
