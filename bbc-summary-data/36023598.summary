Police Scotland said a 27-year-old man would appear at Selkirk Sheriff Court at a later date.
The incident happened during the final which Edinburgh won against Jedforest.
Police said four other spectators were charged with minor assaults or disorder but praised the 12,000-strong crowd's general behaviour.
Insp Robbie Noble said: "We worked closely with event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and British Transport Police to ensure a safe and enjoyable tournament for all.
"I want to thank the vast majority of supporters  and the local community for their exemplary behaviour and co-operation with staff, stewards and officers throughout."
