The next series of The Apprentice is going to look somewhat different.
The 42-year-old comedian has confirmed he will no longer be presenting the BBC Two spin-off show You're Fired.
"After five years hosting You're Fired, I've decided to pass the chair on to someone else," he explained.
His exit comes after PR expert Nick Hewer stepped down as Lord Sugar's right-hand man on the main show.
Dara has revealed he wants to spend more time on his own comedy.
"I'm back on tour again this year and I'd like to enjoy getting laughs off my own incompetence for a while," he said.
"Best of luck to whoever takes over the chair, you'll have lots of fun with them."
More than six million viewers tuned in for the final of the last series of The Apprentice.
Patrick Holland, executive producer of reality show, said: "Dara has been an absolutely fantastic host.
"It has been a great privilege to work with him and we wish him the very best with his next projects."
There is no word on who will replace Dara just yet.
