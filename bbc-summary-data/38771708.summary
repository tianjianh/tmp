Birchfield Harrier Peake cleared 4.15m to take the title.
Paralympic gold medallist Aled Sion Davies threw a personal best 14.95m to win the senior men's shot put.
Wales' David Omoregie ran a personal best of 7.63 seconds in the 60m hurdles to finish second behind Olympian Andrew Pozzi.
The event was the first chance for Welsh athletes to earn qualification points for places at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.
Omoregie narrowly missed out on the 2016 Rio Olympics.
European junior world record-holder Omoregie met the Olympics qualification standard a week after Team GB named their squad for Rio.
Davies had an impressive 2016 taking gold in the F42 shot put in Rio and winning the European title in the same discipline last June.
