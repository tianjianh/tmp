County Championship: Derbyshire finish bottom after failing to beat Leicestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derbyshire are guaranteed to finish bottom of the County Championship for the first time in six years after failing to take the final two wickets they needed to beat Leicestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After declaring on their overnight score of 286-8, Leicestershire were set an unlikely target of 347.
The hosts looked on course when, after Mark Cosgrove (110) and Paul Horton 61) had gone, the Foxes slipped to 242-8.
But Rob Sayer (32 not out) and Richard Jones saw them to 301-8.
Tony Palladino's 4-64, which took him to 38 Championship wickets for the season, proved in vain while Leicestershire ended just 46 short of victory after an unbroken 59-run ninth-wicket stand.
Bottom club Derbyshire were denied a first win of the season and the only side they could catch, Glamorgan, defeated newly-crowned Division Two champions Essex.
Leicestershire complete their season with a home game against Glamorgan at Grace Road, starting on Tuesday, Derbyshire travel to Worcestershire having extended their unwanted county record of "wooden spoons" to 16.
