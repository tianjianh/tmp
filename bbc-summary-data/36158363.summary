The 24-year-old has made eight appearances for Worcester this season, three of them in the Premiership.
"Newcastle is a club which is set to go places and I want to be part of that. It is a huge opportunity," he said.
Sowrey is the sixth Falcons signing for next season following Sam Egerton, Vereniki Goneva,Sam Lockwood, Joel Hodgson and Harrison Orr.
"Ben is a quality player and we look forward to his arrival for pre-season," said director of rugby Dean Richards.
"He is a strong scrummager, a good line-out technician, very skilful and our sort of all-round player."
Newcastle are currently next to bottom of the Premiership, but seven points clear of London Irish with two games remaining.
