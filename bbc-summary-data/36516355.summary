England will beat Wales and go a long way in Euro 2016 if they maintain the high standards set in the draw against Russia, says midfielder Jack Wilshere.

Eric Dier's free-kick put England ahead - one of his side's 15 shots - but Vasili Berezutski's 92nd-minute header earned Russia a point in Marseille.
Wilshere has called for a more clinical approach against Wales on Thursday.
"If we'd won the game people would be saying we can win this tournament," Wilshere, 24, told BBC Radio 5 live.
"We've got to concentrate on the positives - playing out, keeping the ball, sustaining attacks and really making the opposition work for the ball.
"The standard in training is high, everyone is fighting to play. If we can replicate that again and score goals we will win the game."
Wilshere, a second-half substitute for captain Wayne Rooney on Saturday, believes Roy Hodgson's team is technically better than England sides in previous tournaments.
"That's one thing we've added to our game over the last couple of years," added the Arsenal midfielder.
"When we were attacking down one side we didn't panic, we came out, went through Eric Dier into Rooney and into the pockets.
"We've set a standard now, a high standard from ourselves, and we need to keep that going and hopefully we can take some more chances and win games."
Hodgson and Rooney have appealed directly to fans to "stay out of trouble" after repeated violence marred the start of Euro 2016, leading to a threat of expulsion from Uefa if there are further incidents.
Wilshere added that the players were not letting the threat of a ban affect them.
