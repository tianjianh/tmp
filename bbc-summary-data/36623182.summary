Japan v Scotland: We need calm heads - Josh Strauss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland must keep "calm heads" and "not be too fancy" in their tactical approach to Saturday's second Test against Japan, says Josh Strauss.

The Glasgow back-rower will start only his fourth Test as the Scots aim to seal a 2-0 series win in Tokyo.
"We are just looking at keeping calm heads," he said. "In this humidity, the ball gets a bit wetter than you expect.
"The boys are sweating a lot so we have to be clever, play a more structured game, carry hard and not be too fancy."
South Africa-born Strauss, 29, admits he was frustrated at not making the match-day 23 for last week's first Test in Toyota City, which Scotland won 26-13.
But he has been drafted straight into the side at blind-side flanker for Saturday's match, with John Barclay moving to open-side and John Hardie dropping to the bench.
"I want to get my hands on the ball as often as possible, and just be a physical presence," he told BBC Scotland.
"If we can keep the ball and choke the game out, be more clinical when we get opportunities in the scoring zone, that is what we want.
"We have to keep the ball better and be smart about it."
Strauss made his debut against Japan as a replacement in last autumn's World Cup, a few days after he qualified for Scotland on residency grounds.
He started subsequent group games against USA and South Africa before returning to the bench, with only one further start - against France in the Six Nations - until now.
Japan may be lifted by the presence of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko at the Ajinomoto Stadium, but Strauss believes the visitors will rise to the occasion, too.
"It is great motivation for them but it is a great occasion for us as well, knowing the Emperor will be there and what a big occasion it is for them.
"Japan have shown a lot of growth. I remember watching them at the 1995 World Cup [where they lost 145-17 to New Zealand].
"They have grown so much from then until now, and their performance in the World Cup last year was immense.
"But we always want to improve ourselves and after last week's game there is a lot to improve."
