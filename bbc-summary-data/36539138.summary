Cards from comedian Noel Fielding, actor Richard E Grant and artists around the world have been sold to raise funds for Kendal's flood relief.
About 3,000 properties in the Cumbrian town were damaged in December's storms.
Organiser Helen Pateman, from Kendal Arts Community (KAC), said the response had been "absolutely overwhelming".
The group had appealed for donations for the Card2Kendal exhibition and sale from complete beginners, local amateurs, world-famous artists and celebrities and it "just ballooned", Ms Pateman said.
They have had more than 200 donations of oil paintings, water colours, photographs, digital art, embroidery, crochet and one stained glass "postcard".
"We've had cards from Portugal to South America, USA, Australia and the warmth and love that people have been sending with the cards is just phenomenal," Ms Pateman said.
Established Cumbrian artists such as Jill Pemberton and John Hodkinson have also contributed. Comedian Eddie Izzard and presenter Karl Pilkington have also sent signed cards.
Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding from The Mighty Boosh "sent some very strange sketches" that their fans would love, Ms Pateman said.
"I did a painting swap with Richard E Grant," she said.
"I sent him a little painting I did of Wet Sleddale Hall, which is in Withnail and I.
"In return, he sent me a self portrait which I'm really chuffed we've got."
Cards are being sold for a minimum of £10 with those by well-known artists and celebrities auctioned.
They are being exhibited at Kendal Arts Community's unit in the K Village outlet shopping centre.
Organisers hoped to raise at least £1,000 for the Kendal flood relief effort.
The Environment Agency said it expected to spend £10m on repairs in Cumbria after about 5,000 homes and businesses across the county were damaged during Storm Desmond.
Bridges and roads were damaged or closed, leaving some towns and villages isolated and forcing residents and visitors to take long detours.
A Flood Recovery Appeal set up by Cumbria Community Foundation has raised £10m, including government match funding - ten times its original target.
KAC said some Kendal artists had been badly affected by the floods themselves and "understand what a traumatic time it has been".
More than £900 was raised on Saturday with further sales expected via the group's Facebook page, Ms Pateman said.
