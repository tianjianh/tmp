A large bang or explosion sound has been reported in the Swindon area.

Wiltshire Police said it received three calls from people between 06:24 and 06:38 GMT saying they did not know where the noise had come from.
BBC Wiltshire received calls, texts and tweets from people in Rodbourne, Old Town and Pinehurst who heard the sound.
The British Geological Survey (BGS) said it was not thought to be down to an earth tremor, while the MoD scotched suggestions of a sonic boom.
The Wiltshire force said officers had not attended any explosion-related incidents.
A BGS seismologist scrutinised signals from the nearest seismograph sites to Swindon and found no evidence of a seismic disturbance of any kind, a spokesman for the society said.
"It may well be the case that people did experience something but, whatever it was, may have been so localised and too small to be recorded," he said.
Asked whether the noise could have been a sonic boom - the noise when jets break through the sound barrier - a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: "There is nothing to suggest it was anything to do with us.
"There are no reports of activity from a military perspective."
