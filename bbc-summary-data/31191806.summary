Nafea Faa Ipoipo (Tahitian for When Will You Marry?), by French artist Paul Gauguin, has just been bought for Â£197 MILLION.
It was previously owned by a Swiss art collector, who had loaned it to a museum in Switzerland for decades.
The buyer's identity hasn't been revealed, but it's reported to be a museum in Qatar, in the Middle East.
The previous record holder was a painting called The Card Players by another French artist, Paul Cezanne. It fetched Â£158 million.
