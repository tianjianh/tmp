The ITF said 25-year-old Wozniacki - selected as the Danish flagbearer for the Olympic Games - had not played enough Fed Cup games to qualify.
The Danish Tennis Federation appealed against the decision as an ankle injury had forced her to miss matches.
"It's been a long wait but I am officially going to Rio," she said.
As well as featuring in at least three Fed Cup matches, players must also be in the top 56 of the world rankings.
Wozniacki was knocked out in the first round at Wimbledon by 13th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova on Tuesday.
