[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh Lib Dem leader urges 'openness and tolerance'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Liberal Democrats are the only party "fighting for openness, tolerance and unity", its Welsh leader will tell members in Wrexham later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceredigion MP Mark Williams will claim the UK government has been taken over by "dogmatists who continue to stir up a climate of fear" over Brexit.
Labour was failing to stand up for "our nation and communities", he will add.
"There is a desperate need for liberals to stand up ... and fight for the values and beliefs that we hold dear."
