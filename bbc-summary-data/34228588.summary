England v Australia: Eoin Morgan hails squad strength after win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Eoin Morgan hailed England's squad strength after David Willey played a big part in their three-wicket win over Australia which squared the one-day international series at 2-2.

The recalled all-rounder dismissed Australia's top three batsmen before hitting the winning runs with a six.
"We've said we need 15 or 20 guys, not be relying on just 11," said Morgan.
"David Willey took advantage of the conditions - so him producing a performance like that was outstanding."
Willey, playing on the ground where he will line up for Yorkshire next season after agreeing a move from Northants, had to be patient for his first appearance of this series in the fourth game, which came after fellow all-rounder Chris Woakes was ruled out by injury.
After Australia won the toss, Willey's left-arm seam struck the early blows as Joe Burns, Aaron Finch and captain Steve Smith were all sent packing to leave the tourists precariously placed at 30-3.
Willey, who had 3-12 from 4.3 overs at that point, told BBC Test Match Special: "It was great to get a decent start for the lads, take the new ball and make early inroads.
"As people will know, I'm not express pace, I do rely on swinging the ball, it was a bit overcast, there was a bit of moisture around and I was able to swing it."
Morgan added: "He opened the floodgates with Australia three down for 30 which was pretty unexpected. The wicket was quite dry and I didn't expect it to swing like it did."
While Willey regularly opens the batting for Northants in limited-overs cricket, his international career has found him batting at eight or nine, but a late flurry of wickets allowed Willey to strike John Hastings for a straight six to seal the win.
"We got off to a decent start but we let them score a few too many in the last five overs, though a great knock from Morgs got us close and everyone batted around him," he added.
"Fortunately, there wasn't much left to do when I batted - the important thing was not to give my wicket away.
"After two losses, to level the series is a great set-up for Sunday, it should be exciting."
Australia pace bowler Pat Cummins, meanwhile, praised team-mate Glenn Maxwell for his two stunning catches - the second of which was a remarkable effort on the boundary to prevent the ball from going for six.
During a delay while the third umpire satisfied himself with the legality of the catch, Cummins said: "We all knew the rule... well, maybe a couple didn't.
"But he was pretty confident running in and there was a couple like that in our last domestic summer.
"Maxi's got to be up there with the best in the world. He saves us plenty of runs every game and probably kept us in it with those two catches in the last 10 overs."
Morgan said: "I'm unclear on the rules, to be honest. I think it's changed a couple of times and I'll be asking in order that I know in the future.
"You see it probably more so in T20 games because you play on shorter boundaries and catches like that are more common, but it was a really good catch."
Meanwhile, assistant coach Paul Farbrace credited one-day captain Morgan, named as man of the match for his 92, for England's resurgence.
"Eoin plays in a way which allows others to play, he backs up the talks we have about playing with freedom," Farbrace told Sky Sports.
"The way he skips down and puts the ball on the roof of the stand, others think they can do that.
"In the last two games, certainly with the bat we have been a lot more aggressive, and people have gone in and played how they want to play. Whatever happens on Sunday, it has been an incredible summer."
The series concludes on Sunday with the fifth and final game at Old Trafford.
