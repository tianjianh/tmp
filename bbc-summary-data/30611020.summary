Mr McAuley is charged with assaulting and threatening to kill his wife.
Pauline McAuley, a former Sinn FÃ©in councillor, was injured at a house at Keelderry, Kilnaleck.
Her husband appeared at a special sitting of Cavan District Court. He is also accused of threatening two other people.
A detective told the court that the defendant, with an address at Canal Bank Walk, Castleforde, Ballyconnell, County Cavan,  made no response to the charge of assault causing harm.
In response to the charge of threatening to kill his wife, the detective said he replied: "I didn't say I was going to do it. I didn't set out to kill or harm Pauline McAuley."
He was remanded in custody to Castlerea Prison.
He will appear again before Harristown Distict Court in County Roscommon on 2 January.
