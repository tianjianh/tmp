The accident was reported at 10:00 BST on Sunday morning. The man did not fall into the sea.
Rescue teams from Larne and Ballycastle brought the man by inshore lifeboat into Ballygalley harbour, where an ambulance was waiting to treat him.
He was taken to hospital for treatment to arm and head injuries. The man is said to be in a stable condition.
A doctor and paramedic accompanied the casualty as the lifeboat made the short journey back to Ballygalley beach.
Speaking following the call out, Larne RNLI helm Pamela Leitch said: "Due to the nature of the cyclist's fall, the position for extraction was challenging via land and the best decision was to remove him from the beach side.
"We would like to wish the cyclist a speedy recovery following what must have been a frightening experience for him.
"Today's call out was a great example of different agencies working well together to bring someone to safety."
