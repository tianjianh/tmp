Teams from the nations have been kept apart in European competition this season in light of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk and Dynamo Kiev and Russia's Zenit St Petersburg could be in Friday's draw.
Should all three sides reach the last four, Dnipro will play Dynamo while Zenit will play a fourth qualifier.
That is likely to be Napoli, with Rafael Benitez's Italian side having beaten Wolfsburg 4-1 in their first leg in Germany. Zenit trail Sevilla 2-1 from their first leg in Spain before Thursday's return leg.
Dynamo are tied 1-1 with Fiorentina after a first leg in Kiev while Dnipro are level at 0-0 with Club Brugge following their meeting in Belgium earlier this month.
European football's governing body Uefa also confirmed a final between a Russian and Ukrainian club would go ahead as planned. The fixture will be held at the National Stadium in the Polish capital of Warsaw on 27 May.
