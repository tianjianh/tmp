US mother says she killed children found in Detroit freezer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Detroit mother accused of killing her two children has said she wants to plead guilty to their murders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mitchelle Blair was arrested in March when officials carrying out an eviction order found the bodies of a boy, 9, and a girl, 13, inside her freezer.
Two of the woman's other children, aged 11 and 17, were found at a neighbour's home and placed in protective custody.
Ms Blair, 36, made her remarks on Friday after a judge found that she was mentally competent to stand trial.
She said she was guilty and did not need any more time to think about her defence, the AP news agency reported.
She was charged with murder, torture and child abuse after what Detroit police chief James Craig called a "terrible find".
A medical expert testified that the two children had been beaten and burned before they died.
Ms Blair is due back in court on 26 June.
