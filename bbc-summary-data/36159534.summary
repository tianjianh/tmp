World Snooker Championship: Barry Hawkins says O'Sullivan win affected him

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barry Hawkins said his draining final-frame win over Ronnie O'Sullivan was the reason for his "terrible" start in his quarter-final defeat by Marco Fu.

The world number 11 came back from 9-1 down against Hong Kong's Fu, only to lose 13-11.
"I shouldn't use that match against Ronnie as an excuse but it just seems to have happened every time I've won a big match here," Hawkins said.
"In the next session I have come out and been terrible."
Hawkins had to face Fu less than 15 hours after his epic victory over pre-tournament favourite O'Sullivan, which he completed late on Monday.
"It must have some sort of effect on me because you're buzzing all night and can't sleep," Hawkins, 37, added.
"I felt really good at the end. I thought if I could just get going I wouldn't lose a decider.
"It was a battle to get back into that match but that first session cost me and it was too much of a mountain to climb after that."
But Hawkins, who had reached at least the last four at the Crucible in his previous three visits, felt upbeat about next season after a much-improved 2016.
The London-born left hander was a beaten finalist in the Masters at the start of the year and also made the semi-finals of the Players Championship.
"I have to draw the positives because I almost pulled off an amazing comeback," the 2013 World Championship runner-up said. "And since Christmas I've been good - I was a bit ropey before Christmas and my form wasn't good.
"I've had some good tournaments in 2016 and a great result here beating Ronnie - it is something I will look back on in years to come.
"Not many people have done that here over the years and it was all positive after Christmas so I've got to take that into next season now."
