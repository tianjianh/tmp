Nick Blackwell says he holds "no hard feelings" towards Chris Eubank Jr as he continues his recovery following their fight in London last month.

The 25-year-old boxer suffered a bleed on the skull and was placed in an induced coma after losing his British middleweight title to Eubank Jr.
Eubank Jr, 26, who said he had not heard from Blackwell, tweeted: "Hope there's no hard feelings."
Blackwell responded: "We were both doing a job and it was unfortunate."
It came following an initial post by Blackwell in which he said he was on the mend and had been "very lucky".
Blackwell spent more than a week in an induced coma after he was taken to hospital following the fight, which referee Victor Loughlin stopped on the advice of the ringside doctor in the 10th round.
The boxer said last week he was getting "better by the day".
Eubank Jr said he would like to visit Blackwell in hospital, adding: "I've tried reaching out since you woke."
