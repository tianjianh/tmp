An MSP has told the Scottish Parliament next year's Jim Clark Rally is "within weeks of being cancelled".

Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire Conservative John Lamont asked Sport Secretary Shona Robison for a response to concerns over the event's fate.
It came after a joint inquiry into deaths at the 2014 rally and the 2013 Snowman Rally was announced last week.
Ms Robison said the Scottish government recognised the economic importance of such events.
However, she said that needed to be balanced with the "imperative for a high degree of safety, both for spectators and road users".
Mr Lamont said he welcomed the fact that progress was now being made in investigations into the deaths of Iain Provan, Elizabeth Allan and Len Stern in 2014.
"The Jim Clark Rally contributes greatly to the Borders economy, and its loss over the past few years has impacted significantly on local businesses," he added.
"Thoughts are now turning to the 2017 event, which the organisers have told me is within weeks of being cancelled.
"Will the government do all that it can, alongside Police Scotland and Scottish Borders Council, to facilitate the holding of a closed-road rally event next year?"
He also asked her to confirm that the holding of a fatal accident inquiry would not preclude the rally taking place.
Ms Robson said she was aware that the event organisers had notified Scottish ministers of their intention to hold the rally next year.
She added that they had submitted a report that set out how the promoters intended to implement the Motor Sports Association's stage rally safety requirements.
"That report is under consideration," she said.
"As ministers, we continue to have a higher-level supervisory role.
"John Lamont will be aware that, as the lead road and traffic authority, Scottish Borders Council, along with Police Scotland, remains the authority that authorises the detailed arrangements for the rally."
She stressed that another factor which needed to be considered was the announcement of the joint inquiry into the deaths at the two rallies.
"I am happy to make sure that the member is kept abreast of consideration of the report that I mentioned," she added.
"I will ask the minister for public health and sport to write to him to keep him apprised of the facts if there are any further developments."
