The 27-year-old Middlesex paceman was injured on the final day of England's 10-wicket fourth Test defeat against Pakistan at The Oval last weekend.
He will miss the one-day series with Pakistan but hopes to return before the end of the county season.
An England and Wales Cricket Board statement confirmed: "Steven Finn has sustained a left hamstring tear."
The ECB added: "He is anticipated to be available in approximately four weeks.
"He will start a rehabilitation programme with Middlesex and England, and is aiming to play a part in Middlesex's Championship campaign in September."
The 6ft 7in bowler made his international debut in 2010 and has played 35 Tests, 65 one-day internationals and 21 Twenty20 matches for England.
He played in three of the four Tests against Pakistan and took five wickets at a cost of 70.40 runs apiece.
