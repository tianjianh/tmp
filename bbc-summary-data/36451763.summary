Penzance outdoor swimming pool reopens after algae outbreak

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An outdoor swimming pool in Penzance, Cornwall, has reopened after too much sunshine caused it to be temporarily closed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tempus Leisure, which runs the Jubilee Pool, said a combination of sunshine and warmth created an algal bloom which shut the lido on Friday.
The Art Deco pool was wrecked by severe storms in January and February 2014 and underwent a Â£3m restoration.
The lido's official reopening ceremony was held on Saturday 28 May.
