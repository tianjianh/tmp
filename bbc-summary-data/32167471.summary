Eishtec is setting up an operation in the Silverwood business park.
The company, which was founded in 2011, employs more than 1,100 people. It has a major contract with EE, the telecoms and broadband company.
The development is being supported with Invest NI and Department for Employment and Learning grants of more than £1.5m.
Recruitment websites are advertising the Eishtec positions at £6.75 an hour plus commission.
Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster said: "There are a variety of roles, including management and team leader positions.
"They will offer excellent training and employment opportunities to a wide range of people, from those with experience in customer service to school leavers and the unemployed."
Employment Minister Stephen Farry said: "Northern Ireland continues to show that it has the talent and skills available to support business needs and this is evident in Eishtec's decision.
"I am committed to working with our inward investors and local companies to help them meet their skills needs and hence achieve their business objectives."
Colm Tracey of Eishtec said its new operation would "also service other clients and play a vital role as we diversify and grow our business".
"With the right training and career progression we can create a positive environment for our new employees to develop and help us further strengthen our offering to clients," he said.
