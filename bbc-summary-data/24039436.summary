Ex-DJ Chris Denning rearrested by Operation Yewtree police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning has been rearrested by detectives from the Operation Yewtree inquiry into allegations of sexual offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 72-year-old, who has not been named by police, was arrested in east London and bailed until October.
He was originally arrested on June 3 on suspicion of sexual offences and later released on bail.
Mr Denning was one of the original Radio 1 team when the station was launched in 1967.
He also worked as a music producer for The Beatles, helped launch the careers of the Bay City Rollers and Gary Glitter and ran his own music and video production business.
The Metropolitan Police investigation, Operation Yewtree, was launched in the wake of sexual offence allegations against ex-TV presenter and Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Savile.
The operation has a number of strands. One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second at allegations of sexual offences against "Savile and others".
Mr Denning's arrest falls within a third strand, relating to allegations against suspects unconnected to the Savile investigation.
