[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has told how a bride in need asked him to get her to her wedding when the vintage blue Rolls Royce carrying her broke down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Ian Jepp found Dianne Hunnibell, of Lakenheath, broken down near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.
Ms Hunnibell had just 25 minutes before her wedding to fiancÃ© Sean was due to begin 16 miles away in Stowmarket.
PC Jepp turned chauffeur and, with blue lights on, got Mrs Hunnibell and her father Peter to the wedding on time.
"It's not something you expect to happen on your wedding day," said Mrs Hunnibell. "We got in the car and it kept stopping and starting the whole ride.
"It finally gave up on the fly-over near Sainsbury's on the A14 in Bury.
"An officer pulled up in a police car and I asked 'will you take me to my wedding?'
"He was really sweet and went away, made a call on his radio and then came back and said, 'yes.'
"The officer was really lovely and calm.  He kept telling me not to worry.  My dad, Peter, on the other hand was like a little boy on Christmas Day when the officer turned on the blue flashing sirens."
PC Jepp said: "I was happy to be of assistance.
"As a Roads Policing Officer, we usually deal with incidents such as collisions and drink-drivers so it was really nice to deal with something positive for change.
"I can't say that I have ever helped a bride to get to her wedding on time before in my policing career, but it shows how diverse policing is."
"I wish them a happy future together."
