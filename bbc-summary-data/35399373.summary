Steven Naismith: Norwich City 'communication' must improve

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forward Steven Naismith says Norwich's poor communication cost them dear in their 5-4 defeat by Liverpool.

The Canaries went 3-1 ahead before Liverpool fought back and Adam Lallana scored a 95th-minute winner.
"I think if we'd have had a bit more communication within the team we maybe hold that 3-1 lead longer which makes Liverpool a bit more nervous," debutant Naismith told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"That's probably the biggest thing we will be disappointed with."
He continued: "A lot of people will look at the defence, but it's the whole way through the team. They passed the ball through us far too easily at times and that's something we need to improve on as a team if we want to pick up results."
Naismith marked his first Canaries appearance since his move from Everton with a goal, but Liverpool overcame the two-goal deficit and went 4-3 ahead after James Milner capitalised on a poor Russell Martin backpass, only for Sebastien Bassong to make it 4-4 in injury time. Lallana's dramatic late intervention then gave the visitors all three points.
The defeat left Norwich just one place above the relegation zone.
"When you lose that many goals in a game, [communication] is going to play its part in why it's happening," said Naismith.
"I've only been here a few days, but what I've seen in that short time is there's a lot of quality that can go forward and I think we showed that with the goals scored."
