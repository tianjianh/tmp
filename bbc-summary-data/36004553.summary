Rovers took the lead early on when Kieffer Moore fired Sam Wedgbury's cross in from close range.
Danny Carr's penalty drew the visitors level after the break after midfielder Bruno Andrade had been fouled by David Pipe inside the box.
And Cameron Norman powered a shot past goalkeeper Steve Arnold in injury time to secure the win for Woking.
Rovers are second in the table, now nine points behind local rivals Cheltenham Town with two games to play, while Woking climbed to 14th place.
Forest Green boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"I'm extremely disappointed - we should have won the game by five or six.
"Especially in the first half, we should have been three or four-nil up - it's just being ruthless in front of goal.
"That's what let us down and then to concede two poor goals that just sums up the game, the game should have been dead and buried at half time in my opinion."
Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"We rode our luck a little bit and I was very pleased to be one-nil down at half-time and there is no doubt about that.
"We shown a lot of character and I think we tried to play football the right way in the first half. I felt we bossed it in the second half and we were certainly the better side.
"It's nice to see one of the young lads Cameron Norman get the goal and we've been waiting a long time not only as a management team but also as supporters.
"They come up and come down to be here and everywhere to support us and I am so pleased for them."
