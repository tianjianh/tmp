[SN]TITLE[SN]
Police officer in court over 'witness statement lie'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer "deliberately lied" in a witness statement claiming a man had behaved in an "extremely abusive" way, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC David Norman, 52, of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, made the false statement after being called to a dispute between neighbours in Milford Haven.
Swansea Crown Court heard he was "caught out" by a CCTV recording.
He denies carrying out an act tending or intending to pervert the course of justice.
The court heard PC Norman, who worked for Dyfed-Powys Police, arrested the man for a public order offence on 21 January, 2016.
He later wrote a statement saying he had became "extremely abusive, shouting and screaming" and was swearing.
But John Hipkin, for the prosecution, said PC Norman was "caught out" because the man had CCTV on his house which recorded images and sound and showed he spoke only in a normal voice.
Mr Hipkin said that what PC Norman later told investigating officers might be the reason for the false statement.
According to Mr Hipkin, he said: "I have been in situations with him before when he has been incredibly hostile to me and I have listened to him spouting out abuse and was shocked by his language."
The man was arrested and spent two days in custody before being released, the court heard.
Mr Hipkin added PC Norman "was adamant that he had not done it deliberately nor had he intended to pervert the course of justice".
PC Norman added that he was having personal problems at the time of the incident.
The trial continues.
