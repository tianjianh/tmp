The police have said they found "nothing untoward" after reports of a bomb at the west Belfast home of Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams.

On Thursday the party president was warned that a bomb was left at his family home in the city.
It follows a spate of attacks and threats on Sinn Féin figures that the party blames on dissident republicans.
Mr Adams said he would not be deterred by the incident.
"There can be no place for these type of actions nor will they deter Sinn Féin from working to advance the peace process and advance our political objectives."
In Londonderry, cars belonging to two Sinn Féin councillors were attacked.
One car was set alight in Kildrum Gardens around 02:00 GMT on Wednesday and the windows of a car were smashed at Oakbridge Park at 02:30 GMT.
The cars belong to Sinn Féin councillors Colly Kelly and Sandra Duffy.
Two men, 17 and 23, have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said there was "no doubt anti-democratic dissidents" were responsible.
He said on Twitter: "Peace and democracy are the only way forward. Ongoing concerted dissident attacks on Sinn Féin elected representatives and their families will fail."
ACC Stephen Martin told BBC Radio Foyle that he believes the attacks are linked to the general election.
"These attacks pose a risk to lives. They are reckless.
"Martin McGuinness had his house attacked with paint this week. When you add all that up then there is a high probability that this is all linked to the election.
"We are determined to do our best to place people before the court."
Sinn Féin's East Londonderry candidate Caoimhe Archibald has also claimed she received a death threat on a sympathy card which came to her house in the post.
The other East Londonderry candidates are Yvonne Boyle of the Alliance Party, the DUP's Gregory Campbell, UUP's William McCandless, SDLP's Gerry Mullan, CISTA's Neil Paine and the Conservative's Elizabeth St Clair-Legge.
