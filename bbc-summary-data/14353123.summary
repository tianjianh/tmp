Taunton 'legal high' shop is raided by police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have raided a shop in Taunton which sells "legal highs" after some people who bought products there became ill and were taken to hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A man and a woman, both 25, were arrested on the premises on Bridge Street at about 13:00 BST on Friday.
Substances thought to contain class B and class C drugs were seized and will be forensically tested.
The shop is part of a chain in the South West and also sells tobacco products and smoking equipment.
Sgt Tony Crowter, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: "This action was in response to the potential health risk posed to the public in addition to suspected illegal activities in selling controlled drugs.
"Members of the public provided us with information about instances where they had become ill after consuming items bought from this shop."
Trading standards officers will also investigate whether some products have misleading labelling which they believe "could pose a risk to the public if consumed incorrectly".
