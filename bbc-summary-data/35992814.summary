Masters 2016: Jordan Spieth takes control at Augusta

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reigning champion Jordan Spieth is the clear early clubhouse leader at the 2016 Masters after storming to a six-under-par 66.

With Rory McIlroy and world number one Jason Day among the later starters, Spieth birdied three of the first nine holes at Augusta National.
The 22-year-old American added three more on the back nine as he went through his round without a bogey.
His playing partner, England's Paul Casey, stayed in touch at three under.
England's Lee Westwood ended the day on a one-under 71, but it was South Africa's Ernie Els who was the talk of the course after a horrific putting display on the first green.
The four-time major winner, who has twice finished second at the Masters, reached the green in three but then seven-putted from within three feet.
It was the worst ever first hole score at the National, and left the 46-year-old six over as he trudged to the second tee.
Rickie Fowler was another big name to endure a nightmarish start as a double bogey on the first and an eight on 13 contributed to an eight-over 80.

After a stellar 2015 Spieth came to Augusta in less certain form.
But his remarkable record on this course - runner-up to Bubba Watson on his debut in 2014, champion in a record-equalling score a year ago - continued in good scoring conditions.
The Texan birdied the 10th, 13th and 18th on the back nine, Casey moving within a shot with a birdie on the 16th before dropping back with a bogey on the par-four 17th.
More to follow.
