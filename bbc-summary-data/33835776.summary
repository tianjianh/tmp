South Wales Police are "concerned over the well-being" of Alec Warburton, 59, who has not been seen since 31 July.
Officers have been searching in and around his home in Vivian Road and a police tent was erected on the street on Thursday.

Police are also trying to locate Mr Warburton's green Peugeot 205, which CCTV inquiries have confirmed was being used until 2 August.
A CCTV image of the car, registration M805 HFJ, has been released by officers in the hope somebody will recall seeing it.

"We urgently want to speak to David Craig Ellis - a tenant of Mr Warburton - as we believe he may have vital information which could help with our investigation."
