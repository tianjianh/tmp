Three kidnappers took Ogere Siasia from the family home in Bayelsa state in the oil-rich Niger Delta.
Her son appealed for her release, and said the gunmen's motive was unclear.
The BBC's Chris Ewokor in the capital, Abuja, says kidnapping, often for ransom, is common in parts of Nigeria and footballers' families are increasingly becoming targets.
Nigeria international Christian Obodo was abducted in Warri, southern Nigeria in June 2012.
A year earlier, the father of Nigerian footballer and Chelsea player John Obi Mikel was kidnapped in Jos, central Nigeria.
"I only beg them to please release her unhurt. I was told they shot sporadically into the air before taking her away on a motorcycle," Samson Siasia told BBC Sport.
"We've not heard from them to know their motive, but right now I'm only concerned about her safety," he added.
Mr Siasia was in The Gambia at the time of the attack as the coach of the Nigerian Under-23 team, preparing for the Confederation of African Football Under-23 Championship in Senegal later this month month.
The Nigerian Football Federation's president Amaju Pinnick also appealed for the kidnappers to release Mrs Siasia.
"Samson is on a critical national assignment presently and the last he needs is this kind of distraction," he said.
