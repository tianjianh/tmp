Harbour Law won a dramatic St Leger as Laura Mongan became the first woman to train the winner, after favourite Idaho unseated his jockey at Doncaster.

The 22-1 chance, ridden by George Baker, triumphed from Ventura Storm and Housesofparliament after the odds-on favourite unshipped Seamie Heffernan.
Epsom-based Mongan said winning the world's oldest Classic, first run 240 years ago, was "surreal".
"I'll go down in history. At least I've done something right," she said.
"It was brilliant. I think I screamed a lot. I'm in shock," added Mongan, who is assisted by her husband, former jockey Ian.
It's brilliant. It's so nice to have a horse like that in the yard
Both Heffernan and Idaho were reported to be fine after the incident.
Harbour Law is the first Classic winner in 47 years to be trained in the town associated with the Derby.
Idaho was bidding to give Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien his fifth Leger victory but appeared to take a false step just under four furlongs out, and left Heffernan on the turf.
"When Idaho clipped heels it made it a very open race," said Baker after victory by three quarters of a length.
"I can't believe it, I'm so happy for Ian and Laura, they had so much faith in him and really deserve it."
Heffernan was taken to hospital as a precaution.
Analysis - BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght:
"On a day when the 'Leger' was in danger of being severely upstaged by an outstanding Irish Champion Stakes, the famous old race made its presence well and truly felt with a staging that dripeped with history and drama.
"The glass ceiling associated with female trainers in major horse races has long been shattered by the likes of Jenny Pitman and, on the flat, by Criquette Head-Maarek, but Laura Mongan's win is still a notable result for the final Classic.
"That she achieved the success after the stumble and departure of hot favourite Idaho - saving the bookies a Â£5m pay-out apparently - makes it all the more memorable. Everyone was okay; terrific race."
