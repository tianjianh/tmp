Prince William and Catherine saw the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, which represents a graveyard.
One survivor told them about his time at Auschwitz, where his parents were killed, and recalled the smell of burning bodies.
The couple are on a five-day tour of Poland and Germany with their children.
After looking around an underground museum at the memorial, the royal couple learned about some of the stories of the six million Jewish people killed during the Holocaust.
The duke and duchess then met a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Leon Schwarzbaum, 96, told them what life was like inside the camp.
At the age of 21, he worked as a runner for the camp commander.
Mr Schwarzbaum showed the duke and duchess pictures of his family and told the duchess six people slept in one bunk.
He spoke about the smell of bodies while pointing to a chimney, adding: "You could smell the chimney throughout the whole camp. It was a terrible smell."
The couple also met several children on their first day in Berlin, at a centre for mental health and young people and also at the Strassenkinder charity for disadvantaged children.
The duke and duchess also met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and attended a private lunch.
Prince William and Catherine were expected to discuss European politics, global issues and volunteer work.
The royal couple, accompanied on the tour by Prince George, three, and Princess Charlotte, two, arrived in Germany after spending two days in Poland, where they met its first democratically-elected president, Lech Walesa, and visited a former concentration camp.
On Thursday the royals will move on to the German city of Heidelberg, which is twinned with Cambridge.
A boat race is planned which will see William and Catherine cox opposing rowing teams in the race, with crews from Cambridge and Heidelberg.
