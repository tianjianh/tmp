Irish sailor Annalise Murphy has won an Olympic laser radial silver medal - four years after agonisingly missing out at London 2012.

Murphy's fifth spot in Tuesday medal race in Rio moved her from up from the bronze position and behind Dutch winner Marit Bouwmeester.
Denmark's Anne-Marie Rindom won bronze, while Britain's Alison Young was eighth after winning Tuesday's race.
Murphy, 26, led for most of the way in London only to end up fourth.
Her success in Rio was Ireland's second medal of the Games after the silver won by Cork rowing brothers Gary and Paul O'Donovan last week.
The Dubliner's achievement comes 36 years after the last Irish Olympic sailing medal won at the Moscow Games in the Flying Dutchman class by David Wilkins and Jamie Wilkinson.
Murphy was thrilled by her performance as she held her nerve in Tuesday's high-pressure race to banish memories of her 2012 disappointment.
"This time four years ago, I had just finished fourth and it was the hardest day of my life," said the Dun Laoghaire sailor.
"But I said I was going to come back and try and get a medal.
"I didn't think I was going to be in this position even a few months ago. I was sailing really badly so to be able to come and do it when it matters is really incredible."
Instead of merely defending her overnight third position, Murphy opted to attack the medal race and looked at one stage as though she might challenge Dutchwoman Bouwmeester for the gold.
"I knew if I was scared, I was going to end up losing out so I just went for it," added Murphy, who dived into the water along with Danish bronze medallist Rindom in celebration immediately after Tuesday's race.
