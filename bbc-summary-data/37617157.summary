World Cup 2018: Jonny Evans says NI will have to be 'perfect' to trouble Germany

Jonny Evans says Northern Ireland will have to produce a "perfect" display to prevent Germany from winning Tuesday's World Cup qualifier in Hanover.

Northern Ireland restricted the world champions to a 1-0 win at Euro 2016 as Germany missed a host of chances and keeper Michael McGovern starred.
"They never let us get near the ball," said Evans, 28, of the Paris game.
"The way they controlled the game against us, the timing of the pass, the angles they play at."
Only two nations, Portugal in 1985 and England in 2001, have recorded wins over the Germans in their 86 World Cup qualifiers.
And after Northern Ireland were given the run around in the Euro 2016 game, Evans describes Joachim Low's side as "one of the best teams we've played in a long, long time".

"It takes a lot of time for a team to understand how to play against a side like that," added the West Brom defender.
"We will have to play almost the perfect game, we will have to defend - they know they will have a lot of possession - but hope that on the break we can put the ball in the box and make more of an opportunity from them."
But with Michael O'Neill having guided Northern Ireland to a 12-match unbeaten run before their defeat by Poland at Euro 2016, Evans says the the Irish will not be daunted by the task.
"We will go there with the belief that we can get something and I think that's a big indication of how far Northern Ireland have come in recent times.
"They will know they will be in for a hard game. They dominated the play at the Euros but they raised their game and hopefully we can catch them on an off-night."
Famously, Northern Ireland achieved 1-0 home and away wins over the then West Germany in the qualifiers for the 1984 European Championships when Ian Stewart scored the winner at Windsor Park with Norman Whiteside netting in Hamburg.
Germany and Azerbaijan both have a maximum six points from their opening two games in Group C with Northern Ireland on four after their 4-0 win over San Marino in Belfast on Saturday.
