[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-man Bury let slip a two-goal lead - and missed out on a seventh straight league win - as they drew with Wigan.

Nathan Cameron opened the scoring with a bullet header into the top corner before Shakers substitute Tom Pope headed in Reece Brown's cross.
Bury had Chris Hussey sent off for a second bookable offence, and a Cameron own goal then gave Wigan hope.
Their comeback was complete when Craig Morgan drove in an equaliser from the edge of the box to earn a point.
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I'm looking at the game overall and we certainly did enough out of possession to win the game, we were in control.
"I never felt threatened until the sending off. I never felt they laid a glove on us, they got up to our 20-metre win and then if fizzled out.
"The inconsistency of the referee's performance - he was making it up in the end.
"Wigan's not beaten us, the situation of poor officiating has just ripped the heat out of the result."
Wigan boss Gary Caldwell told BBC Radio Manchester:

"It wasn't great to be honest. When you're coming away from home you want to be solid and not give anything away.
"We said we wanted to be brave on the ball and dictate the game and I thought we were outstanding at that.
"We had a lot of composure, we played our game, but we can't defend our box the way we did and give teams a two-goal start.
"I know a lot about the character of the group, that's there in abundance, they never know that they're beat, but we need to be more ruthless in both boxes."
