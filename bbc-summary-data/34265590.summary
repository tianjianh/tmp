[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Arsenal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mathieu Flamini scored a superb volley to give Arsenal victory in their League Cup third-round tie at Tottenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flamini slotted the visitors into the lead after Spurs keeper Michel Vorm could only parry an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain shot back into his area.
Tottenham's Danny Rose had a penalty appeal rejected before the hosts equalised when Calum Chambers scored an own goal from Nacer Chadli's cross.
Midfielder Flamini then volleyed in from 20 yards to secure the win.
How Wednesday's League Cup drama unfolded
The France midfielder scored two goals in a game for the first time for Arsenal - and could not have picked a better opposition than their fierce north London rivals.
There had been speculation about how much of a role he would play this season having been overtaken by Francis Coquelin in the holding midfield role, and this was his first appearance of the campaign.
"I'm happy for the team and personally," he told Sky Sports. "I've heard many things in the press and I am still here. I don't have any problems with anyone at the club.
"It is never easy when you don't play every game. I had a point to prove."
Harry Kane remains without a goal for Spurs this season, though he did come close to scoring.
He had an opening in the first half when he controlled the ball on his chest eight yards out but took another touch instead of shooting and the chance was gone.
Kane later led a Spurs counter-attack but could only drag his effort wide from just outside the area,
The England striker did produce an acrobatic volley at the far post following an Andros Townsend corner, but the shot was cleared off the goalline by Kieran Gibbs.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: "It was a missed opportunity because we dominated the second half and had the better chances.
"We need to be happy in the way we played and disappointed with the way we lost the game. In general the performance was very good.
"Yes, we and our supporters will feel very bad, when you play against your sporting enemy you want to win more, but this is football."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "You do not expect Mathieu Flamini to score two goals but he was frustrated for a long time and he went for it.
"He is a fighter, Mathieu, and a winner as well. I told him at the start of the season it might be difficult for him to be a starter, but he decided to stay and fight.
"Overall we responded well mentally and physically to the challenge we faced and it was a convincing performance."
