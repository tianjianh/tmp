The reward for finding Ranjit Power, owner of the Ramada Park Hall Hotel & Spa in Wolverhampton, has been increased to Â£25,000.
His daughter Emma Power said: "We need to feel that more is being done."
He was reported missing on 14 May. The Foreign Office said it would "continue to support the family wherever we can".
Mr Power's partner Angela Bir said he left the UK on 7 May and was set to return on 14 May.
"It's not strange for dad to go over to India for business, but it is strange for him to book it 48 hours beforehand," his daughter Emma said.
The family believe that any possible kidnapping could have been planned in the UK.
His son, Gian Power, said people in India had been questioned by the Punjab Police, but as for arrests, "we don't know".
Indian journalist Ravinder Singh Robin said the Punjab Police "don't want to reveal any development in the case right now, they said it could affect their investigation".
The Foreign Office said in a statement: "We understand this is a very difficult time for the family. We have been providing consular assistance and liaising closely with local authorities from the outset."
West Midlands Police said it was aware Mr Power was missing.
