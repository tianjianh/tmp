Christy Ring Cup: Neil McManus's nuptials rule him out of Antrim's Down game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antrim will hope Neil McManus' absence will not unduly hinder them in Saturday's Christy Ring Cup game against Down at Cushendall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McManus is getting married on Saturday to Dunloy and Antrim camogie player Aileen Martin.
The Cushendall man played a pivotal role as he struck 1-13 in last weekend's dramatic 3-20 to 2-22 extra-time win over Carlow.
Paul Sheehan hit 0-15 for Down as they beat Roscommon 2-24 to 1-20.
However, Down's recent form suggest that the Saffrons should still be good enough to see off the Mourne County with something to spare despite McManus' absence.
