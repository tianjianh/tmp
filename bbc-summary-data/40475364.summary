The 26-year-old, who finished fourth at the US Open last month, finished on 12 under par to edge out American Peter Uihlein.
Uihlein had shared the overnight lead with Alexander Bjork and shot 68 while the Swede carded a 71.
England's Ross Fisher was seventh, with Lee Westwood rounding out the top 10.
The Open at Royal Birkdale begins on 20 July.
Fleetwood, who is from Southport, was ranked 133rd in the world this time last year and is expected to move into the world's top 20 when the rankings are updated on Monday.
His victory in Paris, his second of the year, moves him to the top of the Race to Dubai rankings.
Fleetwood had wiped out Uihlein's overnight lead with two early birdies, while the American bogeyed the fourth and fifth hole.
He moved further ahead with birdies on the 13th and 14th and although Uihlein picked up shots on the same holes and birdied the 17th, the American could not hole a bunker shot on the 18th to force a play-off.
Fleetwood, who has had five top-five finishes this year. said: "I played great today, felt comfy again and it's always great to test your game and test what you work on every day under the ultimate pressure.
"Life's just been great. I'm engaged, expecting a baby, my fianc√© is my manager, my caddie's one of my best mates in the world. Thommo [Alan Thompson], I think is the best coach in the world - everybody around me I have really strong relationships with and when you enjoy doing your job, that's a massive positive.
Speaking about playing The Open in his home town, Fleetwood added: "It's going to be a massive week for me. I'm going to be playing in front of crowds that I never have before and people that you have grown up with.
"It's going to be an amazing experience from start to finish. Whether I do well or do bad I'm going to have a lot of people rooting for me and that's going to be lovely."
