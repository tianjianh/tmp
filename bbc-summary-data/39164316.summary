Greenock Morton 1-0 Queen of the South

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greenock Morton moved above Dundee United into third in the Championship with victory over Queen of the South.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aidan Nesbitt should have broken the deadlock when he volleyed over the bar after Queens goalkeeper Lee Robinson punched the ball into his path.
However, Morton were ahead when Ross Forbes cut inside from the right and found the net from a tight angle.
It was enough to move Morton to within three points of second-placed Falkirk with two games in hand.
The scoreline could well have been more handsome for the home side, though Joe Thomson did have the ball in the net for the Doonhamers only for the offside flag to cut short celebrations.
Laurence Shankland saw a long-range effort tipped over the bar by Robinson, with Lee Kilday then heading the resulting corner just wide.
Jamie Lindsay also went close when he burst into the box and rifled in a low drive that the goalkeeper did well to repel with his feet.
Morton substitute Ricki Lamie shaved the crossbar but one goal was enough for the hosts.
