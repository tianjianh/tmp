[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jay Emmanuel-Thomas' late winner eased the pressure on Gillingham manager Justin Edinburgh as they scraped a 2-1 victory at Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emmanuel-Thomas' free-kick six minutes from time eased the Gills away from the drop zone and into mid-table, where they are now above the Saddlers.
Gillingham went ahead in just the second minute, Cody McDonald looping home a close-range header after Walsall's defence made a mess of clearing Bradley Dack's low cross.
Walsall profited from similarly poor Gills defending to level on nine minutes, Jason McCarthy charging down Baily Cargill's clearance before sliding a cool finish between goalkeeper Stuart Nelson's legs.
Billy Knott whistled a 25-yarder just over on the half-hour for the Gills before Walsall came close to going ahead right on half-time but Franck Moussa's deflected shot was cleared off the line by Cargill.
Walsall pushed Gillingham back for most of the second half but did not really work Nelson, with their best effort, an Erhun Oztumer sighter, whistling a couple of feet wide.
And Gillingham snatched the points on 84 minutes as Emmanuel-Thomas drilled in a low 20-yard free-kick that took a nick off unwitting centre-half Max Ehmer.
