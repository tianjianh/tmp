Simon Mignolet: Liverpool keeper signs new five-year deal

Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet has signed a new five-year contract running to the end of the 2020-21 season.

Mignolet, 27, joined the Reds from Sunderland in 2013 for Â£9m and has made 122 appearances for the Anfield club.
"I am the sort of character that wants to be a leader, wants to speak in the dressing room and help the defence," Mignolet told the club's website.
The Belgian's record of 15 clean sheets in 2015 was more than any other Premier League goalkeeper.
He had come under pressure after high-profile mistakes, most recently in the 3-3 draw with Arsenal, but received the backing of Reds manager Jurgen Klopp.
His deputy Adam Bogdan also proved error-prone in the 3-0 loss at Watford and 2-2 FA Cup draw against Exeter, prompting Klopp to recall 22-year-old Danny Ward from a loan spell at Aberdeen.
Mignolet, who has seven clean sheets this term, added: "I know signing a new contract comes with new responsibility. I am getting older as well and coming into the years where people would say those are the years a goalkeeper is at his best.
"I will try to work hard together with the goalkeeping coach and staff here, who are behind me and have given their confidence with a new contract.
"I would like to thank them for that but you can't really do that with words, you have to do that with performances on the pitch. That is what I will try to show."
Liverpool are ninth in the league after Sunday's 1-0 home defeat by Manchester United.
