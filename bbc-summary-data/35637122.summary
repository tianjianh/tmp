Following a number of misses by both sides, the game sprung into life in the 86th minute when George Cooper fired home a 25-yard free-kick to give the visitors a shock lead.
However, the hosts were awarded their second spot-kick of the match after Ben Nugent fouled Jamar Loza in the box.
Tyrone Barnett had seen his first-half penalty saved by keeper Ben Garratt.
The draw leaves Southend a point off the play-off places, while Crewe have slipped eight points adrift of safety.
Crewe Alexandra manager Steve Davis told BBC Radio Stoke:
"We were terrific. We deserved to win. That is all you can ask from them, the penalty incident aside at the end. We have gone to a tough place, battled away and shown the ability we have.
"The players can be proud of their performance. We have gone head to head with a team who are looking to get into the top six and were the better team.
"We know George Cooper is capable of scoring free-kicks like that. He did that against Coventry in his early days in the team and slowly he is getting that confidence back."
