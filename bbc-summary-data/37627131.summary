[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff City 1-1 Sheffield Wednesday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield Wednesday climbed into the Championship play-off places with a draw which denied Neil Warnock a second win as Cardiff manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff led at half-time thanks to Peter Whittingham's exquisite free-kick.
Daniel Pudil's low strike brought the visitors level but they were thwarted by a stubborn defensive effort.
Wednesday are now sixth in the table, while Cardiff are up to 22th but still in the relegation zone.
Carlos Carvalhal's side had their eyes on the play-off places following Sunday's Yorkshire derby win at Huddersfield, while Cardiff had started Warnock's reign with a stirring derby victory of their own against Bristol City on Friday.
Whittingham had given Cardiff the lead with a casually taken penalty on that occasion, and he was similarly insouciant as he curled a delicate free-kick over the wall to put them ahead against Wednesday.
The visitors enjoyed as much as 78% possession in the first half but they were shackled by their industrious opponents, who could have scored a second goal moments before half-time when Sean Morrison's header was cleared off the line.
Wednesday were sharper after the break and the introduction of Fernando Forestieri - who scored the winner at Huddersfield - brought pace and invention to their attacks.
Carvalhal's side struck after 55 minutes, Gary Hooper's fizzing cross finding its way to Pudil, whose low shot hit Cardiff goalkeeper Ben Amos on its way into the net.
They continued to dominate possession but found it difficult to create clear scoring opportunities against a resolute Bluebirds defence which dropped deeper to frustrate their opponents.
