The tour will also include displays at The Black Watch Museum in Perth, Scotland and Caernarfon Castle, Wales.
Derbyshire artist Paul Cummins was behind the installation.
He was inspired to produce a poppy for every death in the British forces during World War One, a total of 888,246.
The installation at the Tower of London - which marked 100 years since the start of World War One - drew more than five million visitors.
Part of the display - known as the Wave - is currently on show at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.
It is due to move to Lincoln Castle from 28 May to 4 September 2016.
Mary Powell, spokesman for Lincoln Castle, said: "We don't know exactly where the poppies will be going … the designer came up a week ago and I think he has several ideas but he wants to have the sense of the poppies heading over the walls.
"It is important that they are positioned correctly so we are looking forward to working with him and artists to make sure that we get it absolutely right here."
She added: "It will be logistically really challenging … but the British Legion are keen to help us with the stewarding."
Earlier this year, Lincoln Castle underwent a £22m renovation, which included the building of a new vault to house one of four original copies of the Magna Carta.
Over the years, the castle has been the site of battles and sieges and has welcomed a host of royal visitors. In the Georgian and Victorian eras, the castle was used as a prison, and was the scene of numerous hangings.
Another section of the poppy display - known as the cascade - or Weeping Window - will go on display at Black Watch Castle and Museum, in Perth, Scotland, from 30 June - 25 September - and at Caernarfon Castle from 12 October - 20 November 2016.
