Gloucester police HQ relocation plan scrapped by PCC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan to vacate an "ageing" police base in Gloucester in favour of building new offices has been scrapped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme to build a new divisional headquarters on Eastern Avenue is "now regarded as too expensive", according to the police and crime commissioner.
Instead, Martin Surl has announced some police staff will remain at Bearland - a building he previously described as "ageing" and "past its sell-by date".
The desire for new city facilities has been under discussion since 2010.
"Many of the county's police stations were either closed or earmarked for closure before I was elected," said Mr Surl.
"Bearland was to be replaced by a new station on Eastern Avenue, but that is now out of the question.
"There is no way we could afford to build a brand new police station, especially when we know our budgets will come under more pressure after the next election.
"And given Bearland's prime location, keeping a presence there for the foreseeable future offers the public best value for money."
The on-site custody cell's are being closed in the new year when the new Â£12.4m custody suite opens in Quedgeley - four miles (6km) away.
A number of staff will be relocated to work there, with a number of staff also transferring to another new building - Prism House - which is being converted to house some of the force's investigative teams.
