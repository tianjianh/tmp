Northants v Sussex: Ben Duckett dominates again to make double century

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northamptonshire opener Ben Duckett extended his career-best score to within 18 runs of a triple century on 282 after another rain-interrupted day against Sussex at Wantage Road.

After resuming on 292-2, with Duckett on 178, the hosts progressed to 481-7 before bad light intervened.
Teenager George Garton has taken three wickets on his Championship debut.
But the Sussex bowlers have otherwise struggled, not helped by dropping Duckett twice.
After 82 overs on the first day, only 53 overs were managed on day two, during which 21-year-old Duckett reached eighth position in the all-time annals of best individual innings for the county, going past Wayne Larkins, Allan Lamb and Dennis Brookes on that list.
But, for all Duckett's dominance, Northants ended four runs short of a fifth batting point, having only reached 396-5 at the 110-over mark.
