The 24-year-old was a regular in all formats last season, scoring his maiden first-class century and averaging 35 in the County Championship.
Hughes made 86 appearances in total during 2015, scoring 1,456 runs and taking 60 wickets in all competitions.
"Alex performed well across all three competitions, making several match-winning contributions," said elite performance director Graeme Welch.
"He's a versatile player who provides options with both bat and ball. It's important that he now kicks on and continues to perform to a high standard."
