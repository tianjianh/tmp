The former Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss replaces Louis van Gaal, who was sacked on Monday, two days after United won the FA Cup.
Discussions, which started on Tuesday and were delayed by negotiations over Mourinho's image rights, finally finished on Thursday.
The 53-year-old Portuguese is expected to sign a three-year contract.
Mourinho's appointment has been backed by some former United players, including Peter Schmeichel, Rio Ferdinand and Steve Bruce.
"I have heard many say the 'Mourinho way' is not the Manchester United style of playing football," Ferdinand wrote on his Facebook page.
"However, the Chelsea team that Jose put together first time round, when he entered the Premier League, played with wingers and hurt teams with quick attacking play.
"This is a sign he knows how to get a team playing in a way Manchester United fans can look forward to seeing."
He added: "One thing I can tell Manchester United fans is that they have got themselves a true winner in all aspects. His CV shows success."
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who worked with Mourinho at Inter Milan, could be on his way to Old Trafford, too.
The Sweden striker has left Paris Saint Germain and said he has had several offers from around the world.
"The future is written," said the 34-year-old. "I made my choice a long time ago. I just have to push the button."
Asked about a move to United, he responded: "Let's see what happens."
