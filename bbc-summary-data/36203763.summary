[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald has agreed an extension to his contract that will keep him at the club until at least 2019.

Archibald, 38, took over as interim manager in January 2013 and led Thistle to promotion to the Premiership.
They subsequently finished 10th and eighth in the top flight, and currently lie ninth with three games remaining.
Archibald's assistant Scott Paterson, plus managing director Ian Maxwell, have also agreed new long-term deals.
"Alan and Scott have done an incredible job since taking over midway through our promotion season," said Thistle chairman David Beattie.
"Every season since, we have challenged them to drive the team forward and achieve more in the league with what other teams would regard as restricted resources - and every season they have achieved what we have asked of them.
"Undoubtedly there have been bumps in the road, but both Alan and Scott have taken everything in their stride and risen to the challenges very effectively."
While Thistle, who travel to Kilmarnock on Saturday, still require at least a point to be sure of avoiding the Premiership play-offs this season, Beattie has challenged the management duo to deliver a top-six finish next season.
"No-one should be in any doubt that Partick Thistle means business," he added. "Following three-and-a-half years of constant progress, growth and development, we are now in a stable position to build something really special here over the next three seasons.
"That means that not only do Alan and Scott have the board's full backing but we will also give them all the resources we can to ensure we go one step better next season and grab a top-six spot with both hands."
