Play workshops in Caerphilly and Conwy will benefit, along with a new nursery in Wrexham and clubs in Cardiff.
It will also pay for staff training and places at centres which provide care for children with autistic spectrum disorder in Pembrokeshire.
The Welsh government said it would help address gaps in childcare provision.
It comes a few months after the Family and Childcare Trust claimed just 5% of Wales' 22 councils had sufficient out-of-school activities for 12-to-14-year-olds.
Its report said Welsh councils also lagged behind those in England and Scotland in having enough holiday childcare and said finding decent, affordable care for school-age children was "down to luck" for many families.
Announcing the funding, Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths said childcare played a central role in improving children's well-being and reducing inequalities.
It also ensures parents can work and do further training, she said.
