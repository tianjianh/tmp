The Premier League club are in the US capital Washington preparing for their second pre-season game at United Soccer League side Richmond Kickers on Sunday.
But Rangel has described how road closures for the president's motorcade made the players late for training.
"I'm sure managers have heard some great excuses over the years," he said.
"I don't think anyone has ever blamed American President Barack Obama. Well we did - and it was genuine.
"With our hotel a short distance from the White House, they closed all the roads in the vicinity for an hour because Obama was due to return from official business.
"At first we thought they had closed the roads off because chairman Huw Jenkins had arrived - but it was only the American President!" right back Rangel told the Swansea City website.
Swansea won their first pre-season game at Charlotte Independence 4-0 and striker Andre Ayew could return for the visit to Richmond, 110 miles south of Washington, following an extended summer break after helping Ghana qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations.
