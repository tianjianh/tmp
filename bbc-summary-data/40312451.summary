Finn Russell aims to force himself into the Test reckoning in New Zealand following his late call to the British and Irish Lions squad.

The fly-half and prop Allan Dell only learned of their selections on the team bus after Scotland's tumultuous 24-19 win over Australia in Sydney.
"Nobody really wants to go on tour just to make up the numbers," said Russell.
"Everyone is going there pushing for positions. The three stand-offs are there just now, so it'll be tough."
Welsh quartet Cory Hill, Kristian Dacey, Tomas Francis and Gareth Davies have also been added to Warren Gatland's squad.
Russell and Dell had heard Lions' rumours before the Test against Australia but didn't know if they were true.
South Africa-born Dell, 25, came off the bench in Australia to win his 10th cap, while stand-off Russell, 24, was magnificent at the Allianz Stadium, scoring a try and kicking three conversions.
"I'm so happy, I'm just lost for words," was all Dell could manage.
The pair will leave for New Zealand on Sunday with Russell saying that he will have a big job on his hands to learn the game plan as quickly as possible.
"I have to get up to speed," he said. "I'm looking forward to meeting up with everyone and getting to know the guys."
"We've just come off the back of a big win and I'm celebrating that, but I'm pretty tired from the game, so it hasn't really sunk in.
"I'm just going to try to take it in my stride."
After the thrilling victory against the Wallabies, head coach Gregor Townsend said that Russell had probably played his greatest ever game.
"Everybody played amazingly," responded Russell. "It makes it easier for me when everybody else does their job. It was a tough game, especially defensively, but it went all right, so happy with that."
Russell was a contender for Gatland's original squad but missed out to Dan Biggar of Wales, with Johnny Sexton and Owen Farrell the other number 10s on Lions duty.
He didn't harbour any frustration, however.
"You find out the Lions squad that's travelling and after that you just focus on Scotland," he said. "I haven't thought too much about it.
"That's just sport for you, that's the team that Gatland picked. There would have been a few boys who would have been disappointed but you have to go with these things, you have to move on to the next thing quickly. It was tough, but you get on with it."
Russell wore a protective plaster under his right eye against the Wallabies and suffered a blow to a previous cut during the game.
"A couple of stitches and it'll be fine. I got an elbow in it today," he explained. "I'm good to go. It was awesome to beat Australia anywhere but to beat them here is amazing.
"We had grit and determination to come away with a win. After the game it was nice to think that we'd done them on their own soil. You could say revenge, but to do them over here makes it more satisfying after the last couple of games."
