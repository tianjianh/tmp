Possible strike action could disrupt sleeper services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Possible strike action could disrupt Caledonian Sleeper services between London and Scotland over Christmas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) members working for the service will be balloted next week over whether they want to take industrial action.
The union has said train defects have caused delays and cancellations.
Serco, which took over the running of the sleeper eight months ago, said it has been working hard to improve the service.
Members of the RMT will decide by 15 December whether to launch a campaign of industrial action.
The union said it had a "litany" of safety concerns which operators Serco had failed to act on.
The RMT said the service, which links Inverness and Fort William with London, had been suffering from defects such as broken toilets and fire alarms.
The union would have to give seven days notice of any action, raising the threat of a strike over Christmas.
Serco said it was disappointed that RMT members were considering strike action, but that it was committed to continued dialogue with staff.
It said it had worked hard to improve the service for customers and staff since it took over the franchise.
