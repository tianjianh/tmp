The refurbished Clinique Pinel will help people aged 65 and over with problems such as depression, anxiety, psychosis and dementia.
There are two wards with a total of 28 acute assessment and treatment beds.
Health Minister, Deputy Anne Pryke, described it as an "outstanding environment for residents".
Beech Ward is suited to those living with mental health illnesses such as dementia and experiencing difficulties living in the community.
Cedar Ward specialises in assessment and treatment for other mental health issues which come on suddenly, such as depression, anxiety or psychosis.
Deputy Pryke said the new services would be provided in partnership with third-sector organisations including Jersey Alzheimer's Association and MIND Jersey.
