[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 1-1 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rob Hall scored his first goal since returning to Oxford with a brilliant equaliser in an ill-tempered draw with struggling Oldham at the Kassam Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The winger, who re-joined the club over the summer, rifled a 20-yard drive into the top left corner of the goal after 54 minutes to cancel out Cameron Burgess' early opener.
Latics were reduced to 10 men four minutes after Hall's strike when Ousmane Fane fouled Marvin Johnson and was sent off for his second yellow card.
And later, Oxford boss Michael Appleton and a member of Oldham's coaching staff were both sent from the dug-out for remonstrating over a booking.
On-loan Fulham centre-half Burgess fired Oldham in front in the 10th minute.
Keeper Simon Eastwood failed to collect Ollie Banks' free-kick, and the ball ran loose for Burgess to knock into an empty net from five yards.
Almost immediately, Kane Hemmings should have levelled as he slid in to meet Chris Maguire's cross, but diverted the ball over the net from four yards.
Oxford dominated the second half and Connor Ripley saved well from Chris Maguire, Marvin Johnson twice and Chey Dunkley as Latics held out for a point under severe pressure.
