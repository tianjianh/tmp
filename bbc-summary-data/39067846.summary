An anti-rubbish campaign has been launched, fronted by a litter-picking llama.

Domingo's owners Paola Albertazzi and Richard Haggerty of Eryrys, near Mold, regularly carry out local litter picks and bring their pet llama along to help out.
He has a bespoke harness to carry rubbish more easily.
Now Domingo is now the official mascot for Keep Wales Tidy's Spring Clean Cymru campaign.
The pair got Domingo in 2009 to be a companion for one of their horses - and said he is now part of the furniture.
"I have always gone out litter picking and I noticed that having Domingo with me makes people take a bit more notice," Paola told the BBC's Post Cyntaf programme.
"And of course, he loves the attention."
Community groups, schools and businesses are being encouraged to take part in the campaign, which runs from 1 to 5 March.
