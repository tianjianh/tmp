[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 0-2 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Bostwick's second-half strike secured a comfortable win for Peterborough over MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Hughes, who opened the scoring early on, and Bostwick both netted their first goals of the season as Posh leapfrogged their opponents in the League One table.
The visitors took little more than a minute to record the game's opener after Marcus Maddison's free-kick found Hughes unmarked at the front post - the former Newport defender poking the visitors ahead from inside the six-yard box with a well-taken volley.
It took Karl Robinson's side almost 30 minutes to record their first meaningful chance through Daniel Powell.
Nicky Maynard had found himself through on goal before slotting the ball across the box for the winger but the 25-year-old's shot was superbly saved by veteran Posh keeper Mark Tyler.
Grant McCann's side then snatched a second after 71 minutes despite a brief second-half revival from the hosts.
Maddison again turned provider from a free-kick as the leaping Bostwick headed past Dons goalkeeper David Martin from inside the box.
