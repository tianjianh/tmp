Morris will join the Oval side in July when West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo leaves south London to play in the Caribbean Premier League.
The 28-year-old will be available for Surrey's final six group matches.
The Pretoria-born right-hander made his Test debut for the Proteas against England last month.
Morris has played two Tests, 11 one-day internationals and six T20 matches for South Africa - and hit 68 off 34 balls to help set up a one-wicket win in the fourth one-dayer of the recent series against England.
He is set to play for Delhi Daredevils in this year's Indian Premier League, having previously represented the Chennai Super Kings.
"Chris is an exciting, three-dimensional cricketer with bat, ball and in the field," said Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart.
"He has shown his match-winning abilities in the recent South Africa versus England 50-over and T20 series."
