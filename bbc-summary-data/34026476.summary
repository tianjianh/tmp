Police said the "beloved pet" called Herby was taken from a garden shed in Crosslea Avenue, Sunderland.
The family, who have asked not to be named, are said to be devastated and fear the animal may not survive if it is abandoned.
Herby is about 1ft (30cm) long and weighs around 15 lbs (7kg) with a white line down the middle of his shell.
Ch Insp Sarah Pitt, of Northumbria Police ,said: "This has had a massive impact on the owner.
"An offender has forced entry into an outhouse and stolen the animal from the back garden of the property leaving the family completely devastated.
"We would ask neighbours and people living in the area to check their gardens to see if the tortoise has been dumped by the offender."
A spokesman for the family, who have offered a reward for the safe return of the tortoise, added: "We are desperate to have Herby returned home to us as he has been in the family for as long as we can remember.
"All we want is for him to be returned to us safe and unharmed. This incident has left us really distressed.
"Herby has spent his entire life in our home and must be really frightened to be in such a strange place."
The theft happened on the evening of 17 August.
