According to The Hollywood Reporter, the film will not be a biopic but an action adventure set in the 1970s.
No writer, director or actors are yet attached to the project, which will be produced by the brains behind the Twilight and Maze Runner franchises.
Born Stanley Lieber in 1922, Lee teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create such iconic comic-book properties as the X-Men, the Hulk and the Fantastic Four.
Spider-Man and Daredevil are among the other characters he co-created.
Lee's cameo appearances in the Marvel blockbusters have become a staple of the series, while his "Excelsior!" sign-off is legendary in fan circles.
Mary Bowen and Wyck Godfrey, co-founders of Temple Hill Entertainment, are on board as producers of the 20th Century Fox picture.
