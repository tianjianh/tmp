A 10-year master plan for a North Yorkshire spa town has gone on show.

The report and drawings will be exhibited at St Peter's Church on Cambridge Road until Saturday.
Plans could include a five star hotel and spa, outdoor cafes, improved public transport, pedestrianised areas and a casino.
Harrogate Councillor Michael Harrison said the public view would be taken into account so the drafts could be refined.
Planning consultants from Peter Brett Associates will be at the exhibition on Friday 16 and Saturday 17 January to answer questions.
The proposal has been put together based on a survey of 100 town centre businesses and 300 shoppers who were asked how it could be improved.
A six-week public consultation is to be held later in the year.
Mr Harrison said a redevelopment strategy was essential to Harrogate's success.
"We've got a tourist and a conference offering but we need a leisure offering," he said.
"It's how those things sit together, and what could be done to connect the railway station with different parts of the town centre."
Harrogate District Council's principle planner James Langler said improving the area around the train station was a "long-term aspiration" for the council, as was a more usable public square.
A council spokesperson said there were no costings for the project because it was at an early stage in the process.
"We will not be able to produce an accurate estimate of costs until the master plan and strategy has been developed further," the council said.
