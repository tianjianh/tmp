Oxford United 3-0 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United made it two wins from two at the start of their League One campaign by beating Portsmouth at the Kassam Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wes Thomas and Josh Ruffels were on target for the second week running, having both bagged in Oxford's season-opening victory at Oldham last week, while Gino van Kessel scored a brilliant individual goal.
It was the visitors who had the first sight at goal when Kyle Bennett tried his luck from 20 yards, which Simon Eastwood parried for a corner.
Jack Whatmough headed straight at the U's goalkeeper while Pompey forward Brett Pitman had a goal disallowed for a push in the back just before half-time.
Oxford capitalised on the let-off early in the second half when Thomas bundled in from three yards after Luke McGee failed to hold Christian Ribeiro's cross-shot.
It remained that way until the 82nd minute, when substitute Van Kessel, signed on loan from Slavia Prague, marked his introduction by beating two defenders and slamming home an angled drive.
Ruffels then slid in a third in the fourth minute of stoppage time to complete Pompey's miserable second half.
