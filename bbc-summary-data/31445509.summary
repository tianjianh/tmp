[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlyon Bay plans approved by Cornwall Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Designs for a new development on the site of the old Cornwall Coliseum building at Carlyon Bay have been approved by Cornwall Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Demolition of the existing buildings is still subject to a bat mitigation licence being granted by Natural England.
Commercial Estates Group (CEG) was granted permission in 2011 to redevelop in Carlyon Bay.
The Â£250m redevelopment project would include housing and leisure facilities.
The site, near St Austell, was previously home to the Cornwall Coliseum complex, which hosted acts such as Cliff Richard, Status Quo and The Who.
CEG development director John Kenny said the company was planning a "major development which will have major benefits", including providing more than 400 construction jobs and 500 jobs after completion.
