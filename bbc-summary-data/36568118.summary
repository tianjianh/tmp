John Lewis pipe burst keeps Nottingham store closed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Lewis's Nottingham store is to remain closed longer than expected after 80,000 litres of hot water leaked from a ruptured heating pipe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Torrents of water brought down a suspended ceiling and damaged stock in the Victoria Centre store at about 22:40 BST on Tuesday.
Managers had hoped for a weekend reopening but it is now closed "until further notice".
Staff have been helping with the clean-up operation.
Water poured through from a rooftop room, leaving the top floor under three inches of water and stock "significantly" damaged.
A spokeswoman said: "Our teams are working around the clock to get the shop open as quickly as possible and we're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused to our customers."
