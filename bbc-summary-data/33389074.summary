[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Doggrell, 45, has been charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, the BBC has learned.
The offence relates to a woman who suffered seven broken ribs and a collapsed lung during a Blackmore and Sparkford Vale Hunt meeting.
He will appear in court at a date yet to be fixed.
The hunt has said the collision last August, at the meeting on the border of Somerset and Dorset, was an accident.
The Crown Prosecution Service said the charges were made under the CPS's Victims' Right of Review scheme.
Rachael Scott, Head of the CPS South West Complex Casework Unit, said: "After careful consideration of all the evidence in this case, including additional new evidence, I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and that it is in the public interest to charge Mark Doggrell with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm."
