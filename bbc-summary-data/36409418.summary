Monaco Grand Prix: Daniel Ricciardo 'screwed' by Red Bull mistake

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo said he felt "screwed" by the pit-stop error that cost him victory in Monaco.

The Australian was poised to take the lead from eventual winner Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes only for a slow pit stop because his tyres were not ready to delay him.
The problem followed a mistake costing him a win in Spain two weeks ago.
"I got called in and the tyres weren't ready. I didn't make the call," Ricciardo said.
"The guys were running around like ducks, I don't like being up here and being miserable because I got a podium in F1 and it should be a good day but when it happens two races in a row it is hard to take."
He had earlier told the team over the radio on the slowing-down lap: "Nothing you could say would make that any better. Save it."

Ricciardo pitted a lap after Hamilton finally made a stop to switch from his 'extreme' wet tyres, which he had used from the start of the race, and had built enough of a margin on that tour to reclaim the lead. But the delay at the stop meant Hamilton blasted past as he rejoined the track.
He added: "I felt it should have been me. If Barcelona wasn't clear, this one was crystal clear. I took Barcelona on the chin and this one I don't know if I can handle it as good as I did.
"This is such a prestigious race. I may win it in the future but this one I will never get back so it hurts a lot more than any other."
As for any explanation from the team, he said: "Right now I don't want to hear it. I just want to get out of here. It will be talked about but now is not the time to do it."
Red Bull motorsport chief Helmut Marko said: "We presented it to Mercedes. Unfortunately, a lot of misunderstanding and not the right communication.
"We will investigate and find out [what happened], but it was a human mistake.
"We will check it, make an investigation, and then we can tell you more. I feel really sorry [for Ricciardo], all we can do is apologise to him."
