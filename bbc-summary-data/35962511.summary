[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A family has paid tribute to a man who was one of two people found dead at a house in Canterbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Relatives said Simon Gorecki, 47, was "warm, bright and loving" and had "optimism, even where there was little to be found".
His body and that of Natasha Sadler, 40, were found at Dickens Avenue on 29 March.
Foster Christian, 53, also of Dickens Avenue, is due at Maidstone Crown Court on 5 April, charged with their murder.
Mr Gorecki's family said he was "infectiously fun to be with" and added: "He leaves behind so many who loved him, and of course his children who will miss him more than any of us can bear.
"As a family, our task is to now celebrate his life, and to support each other as we try to come to terms with the loss of his life."
Kent Police said post-mortem results were provisional and would not be released.
Last Friday officers charged Naomi Toro, 35, of Keyworth Mews in Canterbury, with assisting an offender.
Another woman, aged 18, who had been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice, was released on bail until 3 May.
