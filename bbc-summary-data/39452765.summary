[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flats damaged in an explosion in Oxford will be demolished, the housing association which owns them confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A2Dominion said that a "small number" of the "severely damaged" properties in Gibbs Crescent, Osney, will be dismantled after an explosion.
A three-storey block of flats fell down in the explosion on February, and others were damaged.
Thames Valley Police said human remains found at the scene were thought to belong to resident Guido Schuette.
Residents of the severely damaged flats are still in temporary accommodation.
A2Dominion director Dawn Wightman said: "Our priority at the moment is to retrieve as many personal belonging as possible from these flats for the residents who will not be able to return.
"Once we have completed this, we will finalise arrangements with our structural engineers for the damaged properties to be taken down safely. We are aiming to do this as soon as possible."
The housing association has not said when the flats will be demolished, or where residents will be housed.
An investigation into the cause of the explosion continues, and an inquest into the death of Mr Schuette will be held at Oxfordshire Coroner's Court.
The 48-year-old was missing and believed dead before test results proved human remains found in the rubble of the explosion were his.
