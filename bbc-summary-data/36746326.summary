2016 Autumn Tests: Rugby Park to host Scotland v Georgia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rugby Park will play host to Scotland's Autumn Test match against Georgia on Saturday 26 November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will be the second rugby international to be held at the home of Kilmarnock Football Club
The Scots defeated Tonga 37-12 in Ayrshire in November 2014.
Vern Cotter's men kick-off their Autumn Test Series against Australia at BT Murrayfield on Saturday 12 November, followed by Argentina, also at Murrayfield, the following Saturday.
The 2014 victory over Tonga was the first international to take place on a fully artificial surface.
Glasgow Warriors played at Rugby Park twice last season as a result of flooding to their Scotstoun pitch.
Ayrshire-born Glasgow and Scotland prop Gordon Reid said: "Rugby Park is a fantastic sporting venue. Having played there both for Scotland and Glasgow Warriors, I know there's always a great buzz and atmosphere around the ground on game day.
"Personally, I really enjoy playing on the artificial surfaces which is another bonus of playing at Rugby Park. It makes for a quick game and the skill level is usually higher, so it should prove an exciting game for the fans.
