South Korea election: Polls open to choose new president

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Koreans are voting in a presidential election, called early after a huge corruption scandal brought down their former leader.

Left-leaning Moon Jae-in is the clear front-runner with centrist Ahn Cheol-soo his nearest challenger.
The election is being closely watched at a time of economic uncertainty and heightened tensions with North Korea.
Mr Moon wants to increase contact with the North in contrast to ex-leader Park Geun-hye who cut almost all ties.
On the final day of campaigning, Mr Moon called for an "overwhelming victory", saying it would help to heal a national divide caused by the downfall and impeachment of conservative Ms Park.
Mr Ahn, campaigning in swing states, said he was still confident he could win.
In March, Park Geun-hye became the first South Korean president to be removed from power by impeachment.
She denies wrongdoing - though has repeatedly apologised  - and is standing trial on charges of bribery and abuse of power.
Mr Moon narrowly lost to Ms Park in the last presidential election in 2012.
He has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.
He says he favours a two-track approach to encourage change, using increased dialogue alongside sanctions.
The BBC's Korea correspondent Stephen Evans says this could lead to tensions with Washington.
If US President Donald Trump pursues a hard line against the North - especially if it stages another nuclear test - Mr Moon's approach could cause greater tension between Seoul and Washington, he says.
As well as North Korea, domestic issues are high on the agenda for voters.
All the candidates are promising to protect the fragile recovery in South Korea's economy - the fourth largest in Asia - and to bring down youth unemployment, which remains stubbornly high.
There are also promises to rein in perceptions of elitism in South Korean political society and reform the family-run conglomerates - chaebols - which dominate the domestic economy.
Observers are expecting a high turnout at the ballot boxes, with numbers boosted by younger voters.
Polls close at 20:00 local time (11:00 GMT), with the winner expected to be announced soon after.
