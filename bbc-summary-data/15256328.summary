It is understood that Imran Shahid, 34, sustained minor injuries during the assault by another prisoner, but did not require hospital treatment.
Shahid is serving a minimum of 25 years for the murder of Kriss in March 2004.
The 15-year-old was abducted by Shahid and other men, stabbed several times and then set on fire.
Shahid is believed to have been recently transferred to Saughton from Shotts Prison in North Lanarkshire.
A spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service confirmed that an inmate ay Saughton had been assaulted on Monday night by another prisoner.
Shahid, his brother Zeeshan Shahid and Faisal Mushtaq were all sentenced to life in November 2006 after being found guilty of murdering Kriss.
He was said to have led the gang which snatched Kriss because he was white and Shahid wanted to avenge some earlier insult outside a Glasgow city centre night spot.
Shahid was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years for the murder - his brother received a minimum of 23 years and Mushtaq 22 years.
