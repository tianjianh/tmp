[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Govan-born union leader Mr Reid attracted international recognition for leading a "work-in" of thousands of Clyde shipbuilders in the 1970s.
The Upper Clyde Shipbuilders' (UCS) forced the government to rethink closing the yards.
Mr Corbyn will give the lecture in October in Govan Old Parish Church.
Left wing think tank The Jimmy Reid Foundation has held an annual memorial lecture since Mr Reid's death in 2010 and speakers have included Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon and Len McCluskey.
Mr Corbyn will give this year's address on the topic of industrial strategy and credited Mr Reid for saving Scotland's shipbuilding industry.
He said: "Jimmy Reid was one of the most outstanding trade unionists and socialist fighters that Scotland has ever produced. He led the UCS work-in whose legacy is that we still have shipbuilding on the Clyde today."
When the lecture takes place on 6 October, the battle between Owen Smith and Mr Corbyn for the leadership of the Labour Party will have been decided.
