NI jobless figures drop for 14th consecutive month

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits in Northern Ireland is down for a 14th consecutive month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The jobless total fell in May by 300 to 31,200.
However, official figures show a continued rise in the long-term problem of economic inactivity, which reflects the number of people neither in work nor looking for a job.
It now stands at 27.2%, after the biggest quarterly jump in eight years.
The last Northern Ireland Executive developed a strategy to tackle the issue, but it was never implemented for budget reasons.
