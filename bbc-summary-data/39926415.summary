John Jamieson and Graham King, both 36, left Peter Shickle dying in his flat in Stevenage with 75 injuries, last November Luton Crown Court heard.
Jamieson admitted he hit the father of two twice with the TV thinking Mr Shickle was holding a Stanley knife.
A pathologist said the injuries were consistent with the TV being used as well as punches, kicks and stamps.
Dr Nat Carey told the court the 58-year-old suffered a traumatic brain injury, 16 fractured ribs, damage to his voice box, a fracture to the nose and jaw and a split liver.
The court had been told that Jamieson from Wigram Way, Stevenage, and King, from Harrow Court, Stevenage, had gone to Mr Shickle's flat a few days after he had a row in a pub with Jamieson's mother.
Prosecutor Martin Mulgrew said Jamieson had decided on "a plan for brutal retribution" after "fuming" that Mr Shickle had grabbed his mother by the throat and hit her head hit against a wall.
On the day of the killing the two men were said to have looked for Mr Shickle in two Stevenage pubs.
Jamieson told a barmaid at the Old Post Office pub: "If you see him. Tell him he is a dead man."
King, who was described as "muscle back-up" did not give evidence, but his barrister Abbas Lakha QC said there was no evidence of his client going to the flat to cause any harm.
Both defendants will be sentenced on Friday following psychiatric reports requested by the judge.
