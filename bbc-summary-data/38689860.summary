Top seed Murray made short work of American Sam Querrey, winning 6-4 6-2 6-4 in one hour and 59 minutes.
"Sam, especially in the first set, was hitting a huge ball," added Murray, who had no recurrence of an ankle problem.
"There was a key moment at 3-4 when I saved a break point and then managed to break the next game and had the momentum after that."
Murray will now face Germany's Mischa Zverev, the world number 50, on Sunday.
Querrey was the man who upset then world number one Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last summer, but Murray made sure he did not fall victim to another shock after the Serb's surprise defeat by Denis Istomin on Thursday.
With six-time champion Djokovic out, Murray is a clear favourite among many observers to finally land the third leg of the career Grand Slam.
"I don't worry about that, really," said Murray, who has lost four Melbourne finals to Djokovic.
"Obviously, if you're to get to the final, then it has an effect. A lot of the times when I've been in the final here, I've played against him. Had some tough ones."
Querrey gave the Scot plenty to think about in the early stages of their third-round match, attacking the net and hurrying the top seed, but a first-serve percentage of just 57% was not enough to keep Murray at bay.

The American missed a fleeting chance with a break point in game eight and Murray immediately took advantage, getting the break himself in the next game with a beautiful lob.
He took a firm grip on the match with a run of six out of seven games, easing through the second set with two more breaks.
There was a flurry of resistance as Querrey reeled off three straight games to lead 3-2 in the third set, but Murray once again turned up the pressure with his return to break for a fifth time on his way to a comprehensive victory.
"There was a key moment at 3-4 when I saved a break point and then managed to break the next game and had the momentum after that."
Murray will start as a strong favourite against Zverev, but there is plenty of danger lurking on the Scot's side of the draw.
Former winner Stan Wawrinka, the US Open champion, is through to the last 16 after a 3-6 6-2 6-2 7-6 (9-7) win over Serbia's Viktor Troicki.
The Swiss, a potential semi-final opponent for Murray, will play Andreas Seppi next after the Italian beat Belgian Steve Darcis 4-6 6-4 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-2).
Should Murray get past Zverev on Saturday he could face a daunting quarter-final against four-time champion Federer, seventh seed Berdych or fifth seed Kei Nishikori, with Slovakia's Lukas Lacko the outsider in that section.
