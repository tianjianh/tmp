Corey Collinson, 25, was sentenced to three years and nine months for possessing a stun gun and possessing cannabis with intent to supply.
Police raided his home with a drugs dog in Tiverton, Devon on November 3, 2016.
They found 204 grams of cannabis with an estimated street value of Â£1,350, and Â£2,375 cash kept on top of a wardrobe.

Collinson, of Park Street, Tiverton, claimed a friend had left the weapon at his house, but Devon and Cornwall police officers suspected he used it in his cannabis dealing.
He was found with the weapon in a box kept on top of a wardrobe, alongside drugs, scales, and snap bags.
The judge, Recorder Mr Martin Meeke, QC told him: "I have given this case anxious consideration. It was not a rifle, shotgun or pistol and could not discharge a bullet and to that extent it differs from what is normally seen as a firearm.
"There is no suggestion you had it for any specific intent although there must be suspicions when a weapon is found in the hands of a drug dealer, which you undoubtedly were.
"I take into account your personal circumstances and the fact you are hard working, have good references and I am conscious of the imminent birth of your child."
