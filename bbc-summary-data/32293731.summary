[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Ex-Premier League footballer searched for players to help "fix" lower league matches, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Delroy Facey, 34, is accused of acting for two men who have already been convicted of match-fixing.
The prosecution claims the former Bolton Wanderers striker had acted as a "middleman" for them in November 2013.
Mr Facey is on trial at Birmingham Crown Court alongside former non-league player Moses Swaibu. Both deny conspiracy to commit bribery.
At the start of a three-week trial, Nick Mather, prosecuting, said the case would be looking at the "ugly side" of football.
He also told the jury they would not need to know anything about the sport to reach a verdict.
The prosecution alleges the case surrounds an attempt to profit from rigged bets targeted at the lower leagues.
The jury were told Mr Swaibu was one of the players targeted by Chann Sankaran and Krishna Ganeshan, who were both convicted of match-fixing in 2014.
Mr Facey had played for a range of clubs including Bolton Wanderers, Bradford, Burnley, Hull City, Lincoln City, Notts County, Oldham Athletic, Rotherham United, Tranmere Rovers, West Bromwich Albion and Wycombe Wanderers.
His role in the plot was as a "fixer", Mr Mather said.
"He was somebody who cast his net around to find players who might be willing to take part in match-fixing."
Mr Mather said there was no question the conspiracy had taken place.
"The issue for you to decide is whether you are sure that firstly, Delroy Facey, and secondly Moses Swaibu, was a part of that agreement.
"This case is focused on them and what they did, and why they did it."
Mr Facey, of Woodhouse Hill, in Huddersfield, and Mr Swaibu, of Tooley Street, Bermondsey, in south London, deny conspiring together with others to commit bribery between 1 and 27 November 2013.
The trial continues.
