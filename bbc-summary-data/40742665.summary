Centre-half De Havilland made 23 appearances for the Chairboys last season after signing from Sheffield Wednesday in July 2016.
The 22-year-old started his career at Millwall, before moving to Hillsborough in 2014.
"I really like it here - like Wycombe, it's a very tight-knit squad," he told the club website.
