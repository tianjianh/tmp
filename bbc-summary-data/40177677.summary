[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC moved up to third in Super League with an impressive win at second-placed Salford Red Devils.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victory moved the visitors to within a point of Salford, who missed the chance to close the gap on leaders Castleford.
Clinical Hull FC led 22-0 as Fetuli Talanoa and Danny Washbrook went over either side of Albert Kelly's brace.
The hosts crossed through Niall Evalds but fell further behind to Carlos Tuimavave and Jamie Shaul tries, before Weller Hauraki's late consolation.
Jake Connor's five successful kicks further bolstered the visitors' margin of victory, as Salford lost for the second game in a row, having won their previous seven.
The result was in huge contrast to April's reverse fixture, when Salford had won 54-18 at Hull.
Missing Scott Taylor, Marc Sneyd and captain Gareth Ellis through injury but welcoming back Liam Watts and replacement Josh Griffin, Hull FC played with the ruthlessness of the side that won the Challenge Cup last term.
They took full advantage of opportunities presented to them, with Shaul running the length of the field to earn his second-half try after picking up a loose ball inside his own 10m line.
The win came at the end of a week in which Hull have mourned the death of legendary coach, Arthur Bunting, aged 80.
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford:
"We had spoken about it during the week and anyone who knows a little bit about the history of the club realises Arthur's importance and impact on the club.
"That was for you, coach."
Radford added to BBC Radio 5 live sports extra:
"Defensively, we were really sound. Everybody had written us off a couple of weeks ago, but nothing is won yet and nothing is lost yet.
"We lost Danny Houghton this morning with a stomach bug. We slipped Danny Washbrook in there - for him to get Man of the Match was very pleasing."
Hull FC stand-off Albert Kelly told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra:
"We came here with a game plan and we did it to the best of our ability.
"We needed a clinical performance tonight and I think the boys turned up with the right mind to get the win."
Salford Red Devils coach Ian Watson:
"We started off lacking energy and were a bit soft physically. Hull just got on a roll and taught us a lesson on how to play really direct and quick.
"We were very flat and we didn't start with the attitude we normally do. We didn't play with any kind of enthusiasm and energy. They came to beat us and the speed at which they played was very good and they were very clinical.
"It's definitely not a panic situation for us. The defeat today would have hurt the players but we need to remember that we are a good team and get back to doing what we can do."
