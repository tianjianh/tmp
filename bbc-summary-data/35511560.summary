About 400 people gathered at the city's National Museum before joining a New Orleans funeral-style procession and rally on Saturday.
Organisers of the demonstration said the budget proposals "threatened the future of culture in the city".
Cardiff council said it was currently considering feedback from its public consultation and stakeholders.
The crowd, which included artists and cultural workers, waved banners and signs while others played instruments as the procession got under way.
March organiser and spokeswoman Rabab Ghazoul said: "Cardiff has seen many marches over the years. This is the first ever organised that's dedicated to supporting, safeguarding and celebrating one of the city's most precious assets - its culture."
She said she hoped the demonstration would "send a strong message to the city council that we don't want a Cardiff without culture".
A council spokesman said: "Most of the budget cuts related to the arts are about delivering an alternative delivery model for St David's Hall and the New Theatre which are heavily subsidised by the council.
"Rather than closing these buildings, we are working to explore new ways to manage them.
"With the arts sector, we will continue to work with the Welsh government and our external partners to promote and celebrate Cardiff as a great place for the arts."
Changes to the proposals are expected to be made public on 12 February before going to cabinet and then full council at the end of the month.
