A prison service spokesman said the injuries were "minor" and that he had been returned to prison after Saturday's incident.
Pistorius denied he had tried to kill himself, the spokesman said.
Last month, prosecutors said his six-year jail sentence for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013 was too lenient and they would appeal.
A report by City Press said Pistorius had been taken to hospital on Saturday. It quoted an unnamed security guard at Kalafong Hospital in Pretoria as saying the athlete had wounds to his wrists that had been bandaged.
It said blades had been found in a subsequent search of Pistorius's cell.
A spokeswoman for the Pistorius family said she had no comment at this stage.
The 29-year-old athlete was initially given a five-year term for manslaughter, but was found guilty of murder on appeal last December.
He had admitted killing Ms Steenkamp but said he mistook her for an intruder at his home.
Pistorius was once one of the world's most admired sportsmen, inspiring millions with the way he overcame his disability to achieve athletic success.
He won six Paralympic gold medals and at London 2012 became the first athlete to compete in both the Paralympic and Olympic Games.
