Fly-tippers have left a council with a £1m waste disposal bill after six incidents in less than four months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liverpool City Council said it had been forced to pay out after thousands of tonnes of waste were dumped at vacant industrial sites in Merseyside.
The authority believes the waste is being moved from other parts of the UK in a "highly sophisticated operation".
People are being urged to pass on any information following incidents in Everton, Garston, Speke and Aintree.
The council has released photographs of a lorry suspected of being involved in one incident at Wilbraham Street in Everton in August.
Councillor Steve Munby, cabinet member for neighbourhoods, said: "This is a highly sophisticated operation taking place during the day using professional equipment with workers in hi-vis jackets.
"In most cases people don't think it is suspicious and just think it is normal activity on an industrial estate.
"The fact of the matter is that this is illegal dumping of household waste on a massive scale."
Anyone with information is urged to contact the council or Crimestoppers.
