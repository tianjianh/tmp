Humberside Airport evacuation amid 'false alarm'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Humberside Airport was evacuated for more than three hours after a "suspicious package" was found in a car - but it turned out to be a false alarm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Passengers and staff were removed from the terminal after concerns were raised about a package in a vehicle left in the car park at about 10:45 BST.
The building reopened at about 14:00.
Flights were diverted as a precaution and the A18 was closed both ways at Kirmington.
