Song lyric to strong password in six steps

If you needed a reminder that strong passwords are important online, the Russian website  showing thousands of live video feeds could be it.

To protect your email, social networking accounts and the rest of your online life, strong passwords are essential.
But setting and remembering it can be as easy as singing your favourite song.
Here's our step-by-step guide to how lyrics can help you stay safe online.
We'll pick the Foo Fighters, because they're generally great. But it could be anyone you like, or U2. As long as you can remember some of the lyrics to one of their songs.
The catchier the better, to make sure you can remember those words. Something from Nothing seems like a good track to go for, fresh from the Foo's new album Sonic Highways.
It could be the chorus or the bit you like the most. We've gone for the opening lines: "Give me the flammable life, I'm cold as a match." Sing it, Dave.
Take the first letter of each word to make the basis of your password. That gives us GMTFLICAAM. Not bad, but it could someone who knows your music taste possibly guess it?
Mix lower and upper case letters to make the password a little harder to guess. You should end up with something like: GmTFLICaam
Swapping letters for numbers and symbols can make your password even more difficult to guess. So, a capital G looks a bit like 6, we'll swap F for 4 because four begins with f, L and I both look like 1s so that's an easy swap. The @ signs are a good alternative to the letter a. It probably goes without saying, but ours is just an example and not one you should use. Stay safe!
