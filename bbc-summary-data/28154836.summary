A surgery in Bristol may have to close after two doctors resigned saying they could not cope with the workload.

The pair said they could not find new partners to help run St Martin's surgery in Knowle and have told the NHS they will leave in three months.
One of those, Dr Holly Hardy, said they made a "difficult decision" to ensure "patient safety in the long term".
NHS England has until September to find replacements but said the surgery would not necessarily close.
"We will be seeking a provider for an interim GP service whilst options for the long term future of the surgery are considered," the NHS said in a statement.
Dr Hardy added: "We have reached the end of a line. We've been working, and our staff, exceptionally hard, for the last six months to keep the practice going.
"We've reached the point that we can't go on any longer."
Local MP, Labour's Dawn Primarolo, said: "Inevitably there's a danger that patients won't be able to get the access they need.
"I have asked NHS England to call an emergency meeting of all the GP practices in the area so we can sit down and work out how I can make sure... my constituents get access to their GP."
Dr Beth McCarron-Nash from the British Medical Association said it was "something we're hearing about across the country".
"It's something we've raised with the government and NHS England as a matter of urgency," she added.
