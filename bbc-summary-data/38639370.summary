[SN]TITLE[SN]
Week ahead in the European Parliament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This week will see a changing of the guard in Strasbourg, with members of the European Parliament selecting the assembly's next president.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With an agreement between the body's two largest political groups having broken down, this year's contest is unusually open.
Two Italians - social democrat Gianni Pittella and centre-right MEP Antonio Tajani - lead a packed field of seven candidates vying for the top job.
They are racing to secure votes to replace German Martin Schulz, who is  not standing for a third term after five years in the post.
Whilst in recent years the position has emerged from agreements between the heavyweight groups, no such unity candidate is running this year.
Regardless of the result, Mr Pittella has warned that the time has now come for his group's informal co-operation with the centre-right to end.
That decision could have important consequences for the assembly's internal politics and the future direction of the EU.
As well as deciding on a new president, MEPs will also elect 14 vice-presidents and allocate MEPs to the body's 20 standing committees.
They will also debate intelligence sharing between national security agencies and the future of EU social and employment law.
Here's what's coming up in the week ahead...
In lieu of a full day's proceedings, there will simply be official announcements of the candidates for President, at 17.00 GMT.
The day will get underway at 08.00 GMT, when each of the candidates can make a short speech to outline their reasons for standing.
Voting by a secret ballot will get underway thereafter, with a candidate requiring a majority of the total valid votes that are cast - not necessarily a majority of the total number of MEPs - to be elected.
If no winner can be found after the first round, then there will be a second and then possibly a third secret ballot involving all the candidates.
If this is the case, then this may be the point when we see some candidates decide to withdraw.
If a winner has not been found after three ballots, then a fourth and final ballot will take place between the two candidates with the most votes in the third round.
The election has only been pushed to this final stage once before - when four ballots were required to elect Dutch MEP Piet Dankert in 1982.
If this happens, then it means the election could turn into an all-day affair.
The morning session has been earmarked for the first ballot for elections for the Parliament's 14 vice-presidents.
If required, then filling these posts may also require and second, and potentially third ballot in the afternoon.
MEPs will also vote to approve the size of the Parliament's 20 standing committees and two sub-committees.
The allocation of specific MEPs to different committees will be announced in the evening, before a confirmation vote on Thursday.
The chairs and vice-chairs of the committees will be chosen next week, when the new committees meet for the first time.
Before lunchtime, MEPs will have their first substantive debate, on Malta's time in charge of the EU's rotating presidency, which began this month.
Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat will make a speech outlining how his country's priorities for the role, due to last until the end of June.
In the afternoon MEPs will also be joined by European Council President Donald Tusk to debate last month's summit of EU leaders.
The occasion could provide an opportunity to chew over the many problems facing the bloc in the coming year.
After balloting to elect five parliamentary quaestors - or administrative MEPs - the evening will see a debate on talks for an EU-wide financial transactions tax.
Plans to introduce the tax were scuppered in mid-2012 after not enough member states agreed to it.
However a group of 10 EU states remain committed to implementing the plan under the controversial enhanced co-operation procedure.
The plans are strongly opposed by the UK, which has even launched an unsuccessful legal challenge against the plan.
In the evening, MEPs will also debate plans to get EU states to share more information on potential terror suspects, and a report outlining recommendations for the EU's freight transport sector.
The final sitting of the week will see a debate on plans announced last year to create a "European pillar of social rights".
An outline of the plan has been out for public consultation for around ten months, with concrete proposals promised early this year.
It it not yet clear which moves - if any - the European Commission will propose making to EU social and employment law.
At lunchtime MEPs will vote on a draft motion will calls for any changes to apply to the entire single market, not just the eurozone as suggested by the Commission.
Their draft text also calls for changes to EU law to guarantee "decent working conditions" for internships and apprenticeships.
This will be followed by a debate on whether the EU should send more aid to migrant camps affected by recent freezing weather.
After this, there will be short debates on this month's three human rights motions - relating to Indonesia, the Central African Republic and Burundi.
At the lunchtime voting session, there's a notable vote on a draft motion to reject a proposed blacklist of countries with possible links to money laundering and terror financing drawn up by the European Commission.
The list names eleven countries whose companies and individuals would face stricter checks when doing business in the EU.
Two parliamentary committees have recommended rejecting the list, describing it as overly limited.
The short afternoon sitting will see just one debate - on moves to improve the EU's data economy.
Please note: This agenda is subject to modification at the opening of the session on Monday afternoon.
