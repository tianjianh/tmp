The fire broke out in a building being renovated in Harpur Street, leaving three workers stranded on the top floor of the four-storey block.
More than 30 firefighters tackled the blaze which started shortly before 17:30 BST on Wednesday.
One of those rescued was taken to hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation.

The fire destroyed half of the roof but most of the rest of the building was undamaged, Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said.
It took about an hour-and-a-half to bring the blaze under control, but firefighters' efforts had been "hampered by the high winds" which made the rooftop rescue more difficult, a fire service spokesman said.
