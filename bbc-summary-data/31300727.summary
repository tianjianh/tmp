Woodseats Medical Practice wants to open the centre on the site of the existing Woodseats Library on Chesterfield Road.
Sheffield City Council said if plans were approved the building would include a new library to replace the current facility.
A public consultation on the plans will until 6 March.
Mazher Iqbal, Labour cabinet member for communities and public health, said: "This is a great opportunity for us to secure the future of Woodseats Library within a brand new building alongside health services.
"I really want local people to tell us what they think and help shape these important local plans."
Woodseats Library is one of 12 still run by the council after a number were handed over to community groups as part of efforts to save Â£1.6m by 2016.
A council spokeswoman said the current library "is in a poor condition and not economical to repair".
If planning permission was granted, construction could start in the summer, she said.
