Labour lost 40 seats to the SNP, which took 56 of Scotland's 59 seats and has just one Scottish MP - the same as the Lib Dems and Conservatives.
Mr Murphy, who lost Renfrewshire East to the SNP,  said Labour had been "overwhelmed" on a "dreadful night".
But he said he would stay on as leader and stand for Holyrood in 2016.
Speaking at a news conference in Glasgow, Mr Murphy said Labour had "faced a perfect storm" following last year's Scottish independence referendum.
"Firstly the 'Yes' vote finding a home in one party while the 'No' vote was spread over three," he said.
"We were hit by two nationalisms - English nationalism, stoked up by David Cameron, and the Scottish nationalism of the SNP."
Mr Murphy also said Scottish Labour had lacked "continuity of leadership" with "five leaders in just seven short years".
He said that he and deputy Kezia Dugdale had not had the time to reform the party and were "determined to have a period of stability".
He said: "We will bounce back, and be the change that working people need".
Mr Murphy was the biggest casualty of the night for Labour in Scotland.
His once safe majority in Renfrewshire East - a seat he had held for nearly 20 years - was eliminated by the SNP's Kirsten Oswald who swept to victory with 23,564 votes to Labour's 19,295.
