Lanning worked for channels including Sky Sports and ITV, and covered 50 successive speedway world finals.
He described the moment in 1984 when John Lowe made television's first nine-dart finish at the World Matchplay.
"Dave was one of the pioneers of televised darts and his dulcet tones entertained us for over 30 years," said PDC chairman Barry Hearn.
"He gave us so many great memories with eloquence and style behind the microphone.
"He is now reunited with his old sparring partner Sid Waddell, and they can share a drink together again tonight."
