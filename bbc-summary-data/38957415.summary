Simon Eastwood: Oxford United goalkeeper signs two-year contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United goalkeeper Simon Eastwood has agreed a two-year contract extension with the League One club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eastwood, 27, rejoined the U's in June after being released by Blackburn Rovers and has made 42 appearances in all competitions this season.
He initially signed a one-year deal but impressive performances, including a penalty save against Newcastle in the FA Cup, have earned him an extension.
"I'm really happy to be committing my future to the club," Eastwood said.
