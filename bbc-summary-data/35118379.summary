It is reported that the man fell overboard from a Spanish trawler.
RTÃ‰ says the incident happened on Wednesday evening about 40 nautical miles west of Valentia.
The Valentia Lifeboat is at the scene, but the Shannon-based rescue helicopter was forced to leave the area due to poor visibility.
The Irish naval vessel LÃ‰ Aisling is expected to join the search early on Thursday morning with the rescue helicopter crew also due to return.
