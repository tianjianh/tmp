The author of a biography of Victoria Wood has delayed its publication by a month following criticism it placed too much emphasis on the TV star's weight.

Chris Foote Wood, the late comedienne's brother, said he was "revising the book to ensure this aspect of her life is reduced and put in its proper context".
Victoria Wood Comedy Genius - Her Life and Work will now be published on 25 November.
It will reportedly feature extracts from diaries written by Wood's father.
Victoria Wood died of cancer in April at the age of 62.
The Sunday Mirror reported over the weekend that Foote Wood's book featured extracts from a journal written by Wood's father Stanley.
The extracts are understood to be critical of his daughter's eating habits, mood swings and penchant for watching television.
A spokesman for Wood's children, Grace and Henry Durham, said they had not been aware of Foote Wood's book and that an "official" biography would be published next year.
In a statement, Foote Wood insisted he had written to Wood's children and his two surviving sisters of his plans to write a biography.
"To say the rest of our family did not know about my book is totally untrue," he said.
"I make no apology for writing this book," his statement reads. "It tells Victoria's... full story, from unpromising beginnings to national treasure.
"It cannot be a 'betrayal' to tell the full, true story, especially as Vic herself has made public her early [weight] problems."
Foote Wood is also behind a campaign to create a statue of the entertainer in her home town of Bury.
