The dining-entertainment venue, based on the Greek taverna featured in the Abba-themed film Mamma Mia!, is the idea of Abba star Bjorn Ulvaeus.
He was joined for the opening night by Benny Andersson, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, and Agnetha Faltskog.
They were last seen in public together in 2008, news website thelocal.se said.
Fans and guests paid 1,340 kronor (Â£110; $157) for a ticket to the opening night of Mamma Mia! The Party at the Tyrol restaurant in Grona Lund, Stockholm, on Wednesday, it added.
The venue's website says punters will enjoy a Mediterranean-style buffet while the show takes place.
"Everything happens on a magical evening in several acts filled with singing and dancing, daredevil stunts, Greek Gods, flirty waiters, and perhaps a zorba and an ouzo or two," it says.
"No evening is like any other and no-one knows how it ends. It all depends on where Abba's songs take us."
The four Abba stars were last seen in public together for the film premieres of Mamma Mia! in London and Stockholm in 2008, thelocal.se said.
