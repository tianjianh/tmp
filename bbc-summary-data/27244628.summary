[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Olympic marathon runner who has run at least a mile a day for 50 years has had a road in his home town of Accrington named after him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Ron Hill MBE has competed in three Olympic Games. He also won gold at the European Championships in 1969 and at the Commonwealth Games a year later.
The 75-year-old has run over 159,000 miles, or six times around the world, since he started logging his training.
Ron Hill Way, off Blackburn Road, is part of a major regeneration project.
The site, in West Accrington, is part of a Â£55m scheme to build 500 new homes in the area.
Dr Hill said it was an "unbelievable gesture".
He said: "I have no intention of stopping running at all. I just hope I can inspire people of all ages to take up running or to continue running as long as they can."
Dr Hill was the first British runner to win the Boston marathon. In later years he went into business, setting up a sportswear company.
He set several world records during his career, including a 2:09:28 time at the 1970 Commonwealth Games marathon in Edinburgh.
