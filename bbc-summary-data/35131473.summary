The picture shows the royals together in the garden at Kensington Palace.
It was taken in October by photographer Chris Jelf, who said: "I hope everyone enjoys this photo and I am honoured that the duke and duchess have decided to share it with the public."
The family released the picture as part of an announcement that Prince George will be starting at nursery in January.
Kensington Palace said that the royal couple were "very much looking forward to their first Christmas as a family of four" and "hugely appreciative of all the warm messages they have received about their family this year".
