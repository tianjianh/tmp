The number of pupils missing secondary school is at the lowest level ever recorded, but the figures remain highest in deprived areas.

Absenteeism in Wales has fallen since 2006 and was at a record low of 6.2% in 2014-15, Welsh government figures show.
The highest levels were recorded at schools with a high number of pupils claiming free school meals.
Education Minister Huw Lewis said the falling absence rate was "excellent news".
Schools in Vale of Glamorgan had the lowest rate of overall absence, while Caerphilly had the highest.
Flintshire had the lowest unauthorised absences (0.3%) and Cardiff had the highest (2.5%).
The overall figures for all schools was 1.3%.
The number of persistent absentees - those who missed at least 20 half days - has fallen every year since 2007/08 and is down from 10% to 4.5%.
The most common reasons for missing school was illness, followed by medical appointments, religious holidays, study leave, traveller absence and agreed family holiday.
Mr Lewis added: "We know school standards are rising across the board in Wales and we are committed to ensuring young people are given every opportunity to fulfil their potential. Regular attendance at school goes a long way towards achieving this."
David Evans, Wales secretary of teachers' union NUT Cymru, said: "There are many different reasons for absences and teachers strive to understand and thereby mitigate any cause for the same.
"It is very pleasing to see that records show that those efforts are having the desired effect."
