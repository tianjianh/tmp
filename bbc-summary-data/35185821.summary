[SN]TITLE[SN]
East Midlands Trains disruption caused by driver shortage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A shortage of train drivers has caused disruption on rail services run by East Midlands Trains.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company has been forced to cancel several services between London and Derby, Nottingham and Leicester.
Some replacement buses have been provided but passengers have been warned to check timetables.
The company apologised for any inconvenience but said the timetable would return to normal on Monday.
The staff shortage has also affected routes between Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, trains to Sheffield and Leeds and the Liverpool to Norwich service.
Some passengers took to Twitter to express their anger with many others confused over the changes.
Simmer_yo tweeted: "@EMTrains how convenient that you wait for people to book their trains for Christmas and THEN announce there will be cancellations & delays"
Gary Barnes tweeted: "@EMTrains very poor planning & service today! No reservations! No catering! But hey! we're only passengers!"
In a statement, East Midlands Trains said: "Due to a short term issue with driver availability, we are unable to run our full Sunday timetable.
"We have worked hard to provide as many services as possible and we will be providing extra carriages on the trains that are running."
