Sawyers, 24, who has been linked with ex-Walsall boss Dean Smith's Brentford, now has a three-year deal on the table.
Sam Mantom, 24, Anthony Forde, 22, and Jason Demetriou, 28, have been offered two-year deals.
One-year deals have been offered to Craig MacGillivray, Paul Downing, Amadou Bakayoko, Andy Taylor, Milan Lalkovic, Jordan Cook and Liam Roberts.
The player have until 20 June to either accept or decline their deals, after which time the contract offers lapse.
Midfielders Levi Rowley and Jordan Murphy have been released by the Saddlers, who missed out on promotion via the play-offs this season.
Former Aston Villa winger Isaiah Osbourne, who failed to make an appearance last season because of injury, has been invited back to attend pre-season training so that he can be assessed.
Academy players Rory Oliver and Kory Roberts have been offered first-year professional contracts.
Walsall are still to make a decision over who will be the manager next season, having been taken to the League One play-offs by interim boss Jon Whitney, who has been in charge for the last two months.
