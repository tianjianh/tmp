Anthony Stokes says Hibernian have "a big place in my heart" after returning for his third spell at the club.

Head coach Neil Lennon had been pursuing the striker all summer, and Hibs do not expect to make any more signings during this transfer window.
Stokes previously signed for Hibs in 2009 and 2016, the latter leading to playing a role as they won the Scottish Cup against Rangers.
"I am delighted to be coming back to Hibernian," the 29-year-old said.
"The club is where I've played some of my best football.
"It's an environment that can get the best out of me and I am looking forward to getting back scoring goals again.
"The scenes of celebration following the cup win will live long in my memory, and the only disappointment from my last spell was that we didn't get promotion.
"The boys did brilliantly last season and now I'll be looking to help us push on back in the Premiership."
Stokes scored twice as Hibs ended their 114-year wait to lift the Scottish Cup again in May 2016. He was on loan at Easter Road at the time from Celtic, and has since spent a season at Blackburn Rovers, where he made 18 appearances and scored three goals.
"Anthony's a quality player that we all know well, and will be a massive addition to our strike force," Lennon said.
"I've been really pleased with the work we've done over the summer - the squad is in good shape and we've made several strong additions.
"We now have competition in every area of the park and are ready for the start of the league campaign on Saturday [against Partick Thistle]."
Hibs have already signed Efe Ambrose, Ofir Marciano, Steven Whittaker, Deivydas Matulevicius, Vykintas Slivka, Danny Swanson and Simon Murray this summer.
Having started his career at Arsenal, Stokes enjoyed a successful loan at Falkirk before moving to Sunderland. The Black Cats loaned him to Sheffield United and Crystal Palace before he moved to Hibs in 2009, going on to score 24 goals.
Following that spell he joined Celtic, leaving Glasgow after his 2016 loan spell at Hibs.
