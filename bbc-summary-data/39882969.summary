The incident happened as the Labour leader arrived at the Institution of Engineering and Technology in London for a party meeting to discuss the draft general election manifesto.
Mr Wooltorton was said to be in good spirits while waiting for an ambulance.
By the evening, he was on his way home with two broken toes and bruising.
Mr Corbyn was driven to the meeting by officers from the Metropolitan Police's royalty and specialist protection unit.
A Met Police spokesman said the incident had been referred to the directorate of professional standards, which is responsible for the conduct of officers in the force.
In a statement released shortly after the incident, the BBC said: "An experienced BBC cameraman has been injured while filming at the Labour Party manifesto meeting.
"He has been taken to hospital for assessment and treatment. At the moment the BBC are focusing on their duty of care, making sure that he is OK."
Police have interviewed witnesses and a senior Labour source said the party was "looking into" the incident.
