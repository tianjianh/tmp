Northern Ireland's Rea finished second after an exciting duel with Welshman Davies at the Spanish circuit.
Rea led for most of the race after starting ninth on the grid and briefly hit the front again on the last lap.
Despite not winning for the first time this year, Rea has extended his championship lead to 50 points.
Marco Melandri of Italy was third with England's Tom Sykes in fourth place.
Davies crashed in Saturday's race one while leading in the closing stages, and the victory sees him regain second place in the overall standings.
Rea, 30, is attempting to become the first rider to win three successive WSB titles.
"I tried my hardest but it wasn't enough," said Rea.
"I had a good first few laps and got stuck into a rhythm but, with the slipstream, the group stayed together.
"It was so windy, it was quite scary.
"On the last lap, Chaz made a mistake and opened the door but then he quickly closed it again.
"Congratulations to Chaz - he did a good job after what happened yesterday."
Rea started the season with double wins at Phillip Island and Thailand, and made it five out of five by winning the first race at Aragon.
