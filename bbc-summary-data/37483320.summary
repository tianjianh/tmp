The 38-year-old former Ireland international suffered the injury in Sale's 34-34 draw at Worcester.
Stringer joined the Sharks from Bath last season and made 24 appearances in his debut campaign.
"He snapped his bicep tendon on Saturday so he's going to be out for two to three months," director of rugby Steve Diamond told BBC Sport.
"The rest of the walking wounded are about two or three weeks away."
Diamond also confirmed that former Bath, London Welsh and Newport Gwent Dragons winger Nick Scott has joined on a deal until Christmas.
