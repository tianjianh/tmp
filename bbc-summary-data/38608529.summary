Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton hopes his players can make amends for the disappointment of their last home game against Linfield when the teams meet at Mourneview Park on Saturday.

A last-minute equaliser saw Linfield grab a 2-2 league draw in November, the Blues having played for more than 80 minutes of the match with nine men.
"We were very disappointed that day but if we get our attitude right, play as we have in our last few games and take our chances, then we can beat anyone in this league," said Hamilton.
The dismissals of Matthew Clarke and Roy Carroll within the first 10 minutes of the Premiership clash two months ago appeared to have ended Linfield's hopes of claiming anything from that fixture, but Paul Smyth's late equaliser ensured that they secured a potentially precious point.
New Lurgan Blues striker James Gray gave the club a boost by scoring twice in last week's Irish Cup fifth round win over Portstewart.
Linfield have defender Jimmy Callacher available again after missing the Irish Cup extra-time win over Glentoran because of an automatic one-match suspension.
David Healy's side lie seven points behind leaders Crusaders, who travel to the Oval to face Glentoran on Saturday.
Glens manager Gary Haveron has Steven Gordon back following a back injury, while Marcus Kane made a return to action from the substitutes' bench in the Irish Cup defeat by Linfield.
Meanwhile third-placed Cliftonville include midfielder Kym Nelson in their squad for the Premiership clash with Ards at Solitude, the midfielder having been signed from Glentoran during the week.
Coleraine have been boosted by the return to fitness of strikers Gary Twigg and James McLaughlin, the Bannsiders having won their last three in all competitions.
Oran Kearney's outfit have taken maximum points form their last five Premiership games with Portadown and will hope to extend that run at Ballycastle Road.
Portadown will be without suspended pair Robert Garrett and Garry Breen, while manager Niall Currie has injury concerns over Keith O'Hara, Sean Mackle and Mark McAllister.
Ballymena United have new acquisition Joe McKinney available for the visit of Dungannon Swifts and the Sky Blues will hope for improvement in their league form, having conceded eight goals in losing their previous two fixtures.
The Swifts are unbeaten in their last four in all competitions and have won one and drawn one of their two league encounters with United during the present campaign.
