Scottish commercial property consultant Ryden is expanding its operations in England after agreeing a merger with investment agents Mason Philips.

The merged firms will operate under the Ryden name, with Mason Philips' London office becoming Ryden's base in the capital.
The deal significantly increases the size of Ryden's property management business in England.
It will manage a portfolio with a rent roll of about Â£40m, from 2,100 tenants.
Mason Philips provides specialist advice on UK commercial property investment and asset management to institutional, private and property company clients based in the UK and overseas.
As a result of the merger, almost half of Ryden's management income will come from English property, and about 20% of its total turnover will be generated outside Scotland.
Edinburgh-based Ryden said the merger formed part of its strategy for growth in England. Last year, it merged with Leeds-based asset management firm Hill Woolhouse.
Managing partner Bill Duguid said: "We have a large and growing number of English-based clients who know and value the service levels Ryden provides.
"It has been a cornerstone of our business planning over the last three years to continue to reinforce our market leader position in Scotland but also, beyond that, to grow the presence of our brand in England."
Ryden is one of the largest commercial property advisers in the north of the UK, with 35 partners and 110 staff across six offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Leeds, Dundee and London.
