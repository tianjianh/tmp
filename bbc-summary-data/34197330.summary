[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven MPs have been appointed to the Parliamentary committee in charge of overseeing the UK's security services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prime Minister David Cameron announced three Conservatives, three Labour MPs and one SNP MP would join the Intelligence and Security Committee.
The Tories include former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and ex International Development Minister Sir Alan Duncan.
The nine-strong committee is drawn from both the Commons and Lords.
In the previous Parliament, it was chaired by Conservative Sir Malcolm Rifkind.
He quit the post in February saying he did not want the committee to be "distracted or affected by controversy as to my personal position", following a newspaper investigation into "cash for access" claims.
The new chairman or chairwoman will be elected by their fellow committee members.
The seven MPs appointed are:
Once the new committee is up and running, it will face calls to investigate the RAF drone strike that killed two British Islamic State jihadists in Syria.
Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman and Mr Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader have called for the ISC, which can summon intelligence chiefs to give evidence, to consider whether the strike was legal.
Mr Grieve has said the decision to launch the attack could be "legally reviewed or challenged". Ministers say it was a "perfectly legal act of self defence".
During prime minister's questions, Mr Robertson asked Mr Cameron whether the ISC would be provided with "all relevant information" to allow it to review the action.
Mr Cameron said he would be happy to discuss this with the next chair of the committee, but said any ISC investigation would have to be retrospective, rather than overseeing current operations.
"I am not going to contract out our counter terrorism policy to someone else," he said.
