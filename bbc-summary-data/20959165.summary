[SN]TITLE[SN]
Liberia's against Caf case turned down again by Cas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liberia have failed in a second appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) over the Confederation of African Football's decision to change its rules on presidential elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The appeal has again been ruled "not admissible" by the court.
Liberia had requested the suspension and cancellation of the governing body's changes.
Cas once again said that it accepted Caf's contention that its own appeals procedure must be followed first.
The latest decision follows the ruling by Cas in November that Liberia had submitted their case too early.
At the time Liberia Football Association chief, Musa Bility said his body had chosen not to appeal to Caf, despite the court's instructions.
Cas has always maintained it is unable to get involved because it recognises Caf's own internal appeals procedure.
Liberia's concern is that any appeal would not be heard until Caf's General Assembly in March, the same meeting at which the presidential elections are due to be held.
The new amendment determined that only voting members of the Caf executive committee can run for the presidency - which prevented Jacques Anouma and Danny Jordaan from bidding for the role.
It effectively left the current president, Issa Hayatou, unchallenged for the job.
The Cameroonian, who is bidding for a new term that will keep him in power until 2017, has been in charge of African football's ruling body since 1987.
