He had been at the wheel of a Mazda Premacy when it collided with a Ford Transit van near Kegworth in Leicestershire.
A 27-year-old man who was also killed in Monday morning's crash has been named as Michael Joesph Luciw.
Highways England said the car was heading north on the southbound carriageway before the collision.
Mr Luciw, from Nottingham, was a passenger in the Ford Transit. The vehicle's driver is in a stable condition at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.
Mr Luciw's mother, Andrea Shelton, said in a statement: "Michael was a loving father, son, brother, uncle, grandson and nephew.
"He was a huge part of all our lives and will be deeply missed."
Witnesses who saw the aftermath reported seeing the white Ford Transit van on the motorway's central reservation.
The crash, which caused hour-long delays for most motorists, saw the closure of the southbound carriageway until 21:30 BST.
Highways England said spilt diesel on the road surface caused extensive damage and resurfacing work took several hours to complete.
