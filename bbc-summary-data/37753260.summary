PC Semple murder: Witness heard 'someone throwing up on the carpet'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A partygoer who called at the home of a man allegedly strangling PC Gordon Semple has told a court he thought someone was "throwing up on the carpet".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man arrived at Stefano Brizzi's London flat for a sex party on the night of the alleged murder.
Mr Brizzi denies murder but has admitted disposing of PC Semple's body.
The witness said he arranged to go to the flat on 1 April but got lost on the Peabody Estate.
Eventually he found the flat and told the jury: "I just remember standing in front of the building door ringing his flat buzzer.
"I was trying to understand why it was taking so long."
Referred to as CD, he told the jury Mr Brizzi spoke first explaining that they had "kind of a situation here".
The witness added that Mr Brizzi said somebody was feeling ill or unwell but "not to worry because they were taking care of it, whoever was there".
"I asked if there was anything I could do to help and he said no, everything was under control but our party is cancelled", witness CD told the jury.
"He sounded concerned, a little bit upset. He did not sound too worried.
"To be honest, I thought when I left, somebody was throwing up on his carpet."
The witness, giving evidence anonymously, told jurors they rescheduled their date for the following Friday night, but Mr Brizzi did not confirm.
The court has previously heard Mr Brizzi may have cooked and eaten parts of Mr Semple after strangling him.
Giving evidence earlier, the police officer who found his remains told the jury the flat smelt strongly of chemicals and "gone off meat".
PC Charlotte Edwards said the bath was full of "flesh globules" floating in murky turquoise water.
She added the floor was covered in a "layer of slime".
The defendant allegedly told the officer he had "tried to dissolve the body" and that he had flushed "flabbery bits" - taken to mean internal organs - down the toilet five minutes before, the court heard.
PC Edwards said Mr Brizzi had told her: "I've killed a police officer. Satan told me to."
She told jurors he told her a voice told him to "kill kill kill".
She said, he then told her: "I didn't know he was a police officer until after I killed him."
The court heard Mr Brizzi told her he had written about Satan as a fetish online, saying: "I'm from a Catholic family so when I found out I was gay I found out I was from Satan."
The trial continues.
