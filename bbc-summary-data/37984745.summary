Where can you have a day out for less than £25?
The BBC's Price of Football study has analysed data from 223 clubs across Britain and Europe to find out how much is costs supporters to follow their team.
Overall, 36% of ticket prices in the division went up compared to last year's study - the biggest percentage increase across the men's leagues in the UK.
The average cost of the cheapest matchday ticket has gone up to £22.11 - a six-year high - while the most expensive matchday tickets average £36.13.
The average season ticket prices are at their lowest since 2013 - with the cheapest averaging £322.83 and the most expensive averaging £568.15.
A £30 away ticket cap was introduced in the Premier League at the start of the season, in the same year that a record £8bn TV rights deal came into effect.
With no cap in the Championship, the average price of the most expensive away ticket is £31.57 - more than £2 dearer than the top flight.
However, the average in the cheapest away ticket category has fallen by 9% to £20.98 since last year.
Twelve Championship clubs offer away tickets for more than £30: Aston Villa, Barnsley, Brentford, Brighton, Derby, Ipswich, Leeds, Newcastle Norwich, Nottingham Forest, QPR and Sheffield Wednesday.
