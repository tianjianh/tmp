Alistair won Olympic gold in London, with Jonny in third place, and the brothers finished 1-2 at last year's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
Jack Maitland will speak about 'The Art of Endurance' at the Gaiety Theatre at the annual Isle of Man Sport Lecture.
The talk will take place on 18 November at 18:00 BST.
It will explore the long-term development of the athletes, coaching methods and the programme used to achieve Olympic and World success.
Isle of Man Sport's Trevor Christian believes the lecture will be relevant to sports enthusiasts, competitors, teachers and coaches.
He said: "It is a great opportunity for anyone keen to learn about Jack's experiences in taking junior athletes on a journey to Olympic success."
Last month, Jonny said 2015 had been "a bit of a nightmare year" for the brothers due to injuries as they both look to qualify for the 2016 Olympics.
