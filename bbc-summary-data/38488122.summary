Bonnyrigg Rose FC said 30-year-old Shaun Woodburn died in "tragic circumstances" on Sunday.
In an online post, they said he was a "true gentleman" who decided to take a break from football in July 2015 to concentrate on his young family.
Police said they were treating Mr Woodburn's death as murder.
He died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after suffering serious injuries in an incident in Great Junction Street at around 02:00 on Sunday.
Bonnyrigg Rose said Mr Woodburn joined the the club in February 2012 and he was part of the team which won the East of Scotland Cup in 2013.
Paying tribute to him, a team statement said: "He didn't have a bad word to say about anyone and nobody had a bad word to say about him, which makes this all the harder to understand.
"Still only 30 he had his whole young life ahead of him to look forward to.
"Am sure like many of our supporters who have heard the news over the past 24 hours and who knew Shaun, we are truly heartbroken."
He had also played with Newtongrange Star, Whitehill Welfare and Loanhead Amateurs.
In a post on their Facebook page, Newtongrange Star said Mr Woodburn was a "very fine player" and a "good man".
Police said a 16-year-old boy and an 18-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the incident.
They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court later.
Det Insp Graham Grant appealed for help from anyone with information which could help the police investigation.
He added: "My thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who has sadly passed away.
"A murder inquiry is now being carried out and there will continue to be a police presence in Leith as we conduct our investigation and provide support to the local community following these tragic events."
