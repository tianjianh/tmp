After Warwickshire declared their first innings on 362-8, Oliver Hannon-Dalby picked up the early scalp of England Test opener Sam Robson for 12.
But Rogers (85) and Neil Dexter (70) put on 127 for the fourth wicket before both fell to Recordo Gordon (2-45).
John Simpson contributed 53 as the hosts closed only 52 behind on 310-6.
After losing most of the second day to rain, Warwickshire's declaration was forced by the need to seek a victory to keep them in touch with leaders Yorkshire and second-placed Nottinghamshire.
It looked like a good decision as they reduced the home side, themselves looking for a win to move away from the relegation zone, to just 65-3, with Robson, Nick Gubbins and Dawid Malan all departing.
But captain Rogers and all-rounder Dexter stood firm for 39 overs, with the former becoming the first Middlesex player to reach 1,000 Championship runs in 2014 - Malan the next highest with 915.
After both went to Gordon, with Rogers taken down the leg-side by wicketkeeper Peter McKay, Simpson added his fourth half century of the season before he went lbw to Keith Barker (2-81) as they game seemingly moved towards a draw.
BBC London 94.9's Kevin Hand:
"Despite a nervy start, Middlesex kept Warwickshire at bay with a defiant batting display that leaves the match destined for a draw unless the captains can agree on a chase, but time is against then.
"The pitch was again helpful in the morning session but batting became easier as the day wore on and the ball softened. Both Chris Rogers and Neil Dexter batted with control to build the crucial partnership with the latter taking on spinner Jeetan Patel throughout, preventing him from settling into his usually dangerous pattern.
"The new ball was taken immediately but departed as quickly as it was bowled, although John Simpson's fine fifty came to a close moments after he passed the milestone.
"Middlesex could declare behind overnight and leave the ball in Warwickshire's court as to how desperate they are for a win to keep them in with a chance of winning the Championship."
