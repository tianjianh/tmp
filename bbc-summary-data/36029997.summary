England winger Wade scored four tries in the first half before adding two more from interceptions in the second to seal a play-off place for Wasps.
Worcester scored six tries of their own in a game which totalled 14 at Sixways.
Wade, 24, equalled the previous record set by Saracens' Ryan Constable against Bedford exactly 16 years to the day.
The British and Irish Lion's incredible individual display, on his 100th appearance for Wasps, saw him move to second on the leading Premiership try-scorers chart for this season, two behind Exeter's Thomas Waldrom with 13.
His first try came after Frank Halai had scored Wasps' opener in response to an early Ryan Mills penalty, and by half-time Wade had stretched his personal tally to four, either side of Francois Hougaard and Cooper Vuna scores for the hosts.
Wasps were seemingly out of sight at 33-15 ahead, but Worcester scored four more tries of their own in the second half to pick up a bonus point.
However, Dean Ryan's side could never keep up with Wasps and especially Wade, as he broke away for two more of his own before replacement fly-half Alex Lozowski completed their scoring late on.
Wasps climb above Exeter into second and look well set for a home semi-final in the play-offs with two games to play.
Worcester director of rugby Dean Ryan:
"We don't want to be involved in any end-of-season jamboree as we have a responsibility to the league.
"The first 40 minutes weren't acceptable as we didn't apply ourselves as we were easily picked off.
"I've no idea where that first-half performance came from, and comebacks are irrelevant.
"I'm not dressing it up. We made it easy for them as we haven't been at the races for the past two games and I'm not prepared to let the season drift to an end."
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young on Christian Wade's performance:
"He's up there with the best. He's deadly and I wouldn't swap him for anyone.
"It was a timely reminder from him that he's still about and shouldn't be forgotten for either the Saxons or England tours this summer."
Saracens and England winger Chris Ashton on Wade's prospects of being named in Great Britain's Olympic sevens squad for Rio 2016: "He is amazing at sevens because he is so jinky and so quick of the mark. He's impossible to defend.
"I'm sure he is thinking about Rio - and if I was him I would be too."
Young on Wasps' win: "It was a great game and I really enjoyed watching it as both teams were prepared to play rugby and throw it about.
"We had a couple of lucky breaks and interceptions at crucial times, which made it easier for us.
"The dry pitch suited us but we looked a bit tired at times. We couldn't quite win the collisions and obviously we didn't want to ship that many points."
