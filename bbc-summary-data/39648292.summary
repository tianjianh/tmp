British and Irish Lions 2017: Scots better as team than individuals - Shanklin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland do not have the individual talent to match Warren Gatland's British and Irish Lions squad selections, says former Wales and Cardiff Blues centre Tom Shanklin.

Only Tommy Seymour and Stuart Hogg have been called up to the squad for the tour of New Zealand in June.
"He's gone for the best. That's why he hasn't gone for many Scotland players," Shanklin told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"[That is because] Scotland perform better as a team."
New Zealander Gatland chose 16 England players, 12 from Wales, and 11 from Ireland for his Lions squad, and just two players from Scotland.
"I think they got the most out of their players in the Six Nations but, when you look at them individually and mark them against other players, I think it's the right choice," former Lions tourist Shanklin continued.
"You could argue that Finn Russell or Fraser Brown at hooker should be named, but the players he's picked are individually better than the Scots."
Dan Biggar will be making the trip to New Zealand, and the Ospreys fly-half says he was "a little bit lucky" to be selected, but Shanklin says Gatland, who has coached Wales to two Grand Slams, chose players he was familiar with.
Shanklin said: "Dan Biggar was 50-50 but for me it was a choice between him, George Ford and Finn Russell, and he's gone with what he knows.
"With Biggar, he's probably gone with the most competitive person on that tour and he knows what he will get out of him."
