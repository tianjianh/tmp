Aribo set up three goals in Monday's 4-1 win over Bristol Rovers, adding to an assist against Southend on 31 December.
Robinson worked with Alli at previous club MK Dons before the 20-year-old moved to Tottenham Hotspur.
"Four assists in two games is incredible. I have seen it before with a very special talent who is working in north London now," he said.
Robinson handed Alli his Dons debut as a 16-year-old in November 2012, and the midfielder scored 24 goals in 88 appearances for the Buckinghamshire club before joining Spurs in the summer of 2015.
Aribo, 20, made his first-team debut for Charlton in October, and last month extended his contract with the Addicks until 2019.
"South-east London is a hotbed for talent and I do class myself as a developer," Robinson added to BBC Radio London.
"I spoke to the owner [Roland Duchatelet] after the game at Southend and he was really excited about Joe.
"My job is to keep that fire fuelled and this club moving forward."
Meanwhile, Robinson says he has taken Ademola Lookman "out of the firing line", with the winger linked with a move away from The Valley in the January transfer window.
The 19-year-old is on the brink of a Â£10m move to Everton and has missed the Addicks' last two matches.
"A deal has not been done," Robinson, 36, said.
"But there is so much talk surrounding the young man I can't see it being too long. There is no smoke without fire."
