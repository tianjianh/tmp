The singer revealed the news on his Instagram page on his 34th birthday by posting a picture of him kissing his partner's belly.
He said: "Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes! This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets."
Timberlake and Biel married at a private ceremony in Italy in 2012.
It will be the first child for both of the stars.
There had been rumours that Jessica Biel was pregnant for weeks, but Timberlake's post is the first official confirmation.
Timberlake's 'N Sync bandmate Joey Fatone appeared to reveal the baby news in December.
"He told me a while ago, and I kept my mouth shut," Fatone told In Touch magazine.
"But now I can talk about it. Jessica is awesome, and Justin is a kid at heart. They'll have fun."
