The British cook will join pastry chef Johnny Iuzzini as a judge on The Great Holiday Baking Show, as amateur bakers attempt a series of themed challenges.
The four-week special, hosted by Nia Vardalos, of My Big Fat Greek Wedding fame, and husband, Cougar Town star Ian Gomez, will debut on 30 November.
Last month's Bake Off final became the UK's most-watched TV show of the year.
An average audience of 13.4m viewers tuned in to see Nadiya Hussain crowned the winner of the sixth series.
US network CBS remade a version of The Great British Bake Off in 2013, called The American Baking Competition, but it premiered to dire ratings and was cancelled after its first seven-episode season.
The Great Holiday Baking Show will be produced by Love Productions for the ABC Television Network.
