Work is under way on a digital project to "bring to life" the stories of the crews who served on Bomber Command during World War II.

It is part of a scheme by the Lincolnshire Memorial Trust that will see the creation of an interpretation centre and memorial in Lincoln.
The first phase will see the Rolls of Honour, housed inside the city's cathedral, put on a database.
They list the names of 25,611 airmen killed while based in the county.

Nicky Barr, from the trust, said: "The interpretation centre will house the world's largest digitised database on Bomber Command.
"The concept behind the plan is to enable modern technology to tell the stories by incorporating scanned documents, service records, personal stories and photographs."
Lincolnshire-based firm Pretorian UK is transcribing the cathedral's records.
Managing director Dave Gilbert said: "This is such an important project to so many people and we are delighted to lend our expertise and time to ensuring that generations to come can learn about Bomber Command and all those who served, or supported its work."
The trust is also bidding to build a 50m (164ft) steel spire on Canwick Hill, facing Lincoln Cathedral, with the names of the airmen inscribed on it.
Bomber Command veteran Syd Marshall said: "I am delighted that there will, at last, be somewhere to tell people all about Bomber Command and let them find out more about those people that served, many of them losing their lives in the process.
"We have been forgotten for such a long time that to have the facility to tell our story is hugely important."
The project is also being supported by the Imperial War Museum, University of Lincoln and a number of squadron associations.
The database will be accessible via the trust's web site - with full accounts available at the interpretation centre.
Future plans will include adding details to the database of all 125,000 airmen, ground crew and support staff who were part of Bomber Command.
