Cardiff rail work to affect Wales v Georgia football fans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail services in Cardiff will be cancelled for maintenance work this weekend, affecting football fans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wales take on Georgia at Cardiff City Stadium in a World Cup 2018 qualifying match from 17:00 BST.
But there will be no services between Queen Street and Cardiff Central throughout the weekend.
Replacement bus services will not pick up or drop off at Grangetown between 18:00 and 20:30 on Sunday due to crowding concerns.
Arriva Trains Wales said it was due to essential Network Rail modernisation work.
A spokesman said: "We are asking fans to take the earliest possible service in to Cardiff as services are expected to be busy and to return directly back to the relevant stations at the end of the game.
"We will be adding extra capacity where possible but this will be limited."
