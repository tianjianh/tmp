They include a man caught on CCTV who appears to be aiming a missile at police officers.
Up to 4,000 people met up for a waterfight on the hottest day of 2016 so far, but it descended into violence.
The Met Police has cancelled all officer leave in the wake of the incident.
The festivities turned hostile as the evening wore on when some people reportedly attempted to set up an illegal sound system.
Three people, including a police officer, were stabbed in the violence that spilled into Marble Arch, yards from the shops on Oxford Street.
A second police officer was injured at the scene by a flying bottle.
The police are yet to make any arrests and Scotland Yard has now publicly identified eight people they want to trace.
The suspects include the man appearing to throw the object in Hyde Park and three others who are alleged to have committed offences in the Marble Arch area.
They are wanted alongside four men, three of whom are wanted in connection with violent disorder in Hyde Park and one over trouble in Marble Arch.
Detectives are continuing to study CCTV from the area.
There were also violent clashes in Hackney, east London, as police went to break up a so-called block party.
An 18-year-old woman and two 17-year-old girls were arrested on suspicion of committing grievous bodily harm in violent clashes on the Stamford Hill Estate, in Hackney.
Cdr Nick Downing said: "We have a number of specialist officers who are reviewing hours of CCTV footage and whilst we are still in the early stages of the investigation they have been able to identify key individuals who are believed to have taken part in the disorder in some way or form.
"We are appealing to the public to help us identify the individuals...or if you are the person in the images now is your opportunity to make yourself known to police.
"As the investigation continues we are still keen to hear from any witnesses or anyone with any information."
