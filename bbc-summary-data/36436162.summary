New Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers says he has been discussing his future plans with some of his senior players.

The former Liverpool boss succeeded Ronny Deila 10 days ago and has already moved into his office at the club's Lennoxtown training ground.
Rodgers, 43, revealed he invited captain Scott Brown, 30, to his London home for a discussion over dinner.
"It was good to get his opinion on how things are and how it looks for him at the club," Rodgers told Celtic TV.
"It was also good for me to introduce myself to him as the club captain and talk through my ideas and how I'd like to work.
"He's been here a long time, so he's been here through good times and tough times."
Brown's fellow Scotland international Charlie Mulgrew, 30, is out of contract at Celtic and revealed that Rodgers telephoned him to ask if he would stay for another season.
"I've spoken to a number of the players on the phone also," said Rodgers.
The Northern Irishman will have six weeks to prepare the Premiership champions for their first competitive outing, in the second qualifying round of the Champions League on 12 or 13 July.
"I'm really looking forward to 20 June, the first day back in and getting to meet all the players and talk through how we want to go forward," Rodgers added.
"That's when the hard work begins. It will be a long season, a hard season, but it will be really exciting. I can't wait to get started."
