[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greenock Morton 0-1 Dunfermline Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dunfermline ended promotion hopefuls Greenock Morton's year-long unbeaten run at home with a narrow Championship win at Cappielow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nat Wedderburn scored the only goal of the match after a mistake by Morton goalkeeper Derek Gaston.
The hosts pressed in the second half but found Pars keeper Sean Murdoch in wonderful form.
Callum Morris netted but the goal was disallowed for a foul by the Dunfermline defender.
Jim Duffy's side, who play leaders Hibernian on Wednesday, miss the chance to go second as they remain level with Falkirk and four points ahead of fourth-placed Dundee United while Allan Johnston's men are four above the relegation zone.
Morton were bright early on, Lee Kilday's header flying over the bar and Lawrence Shankland going clean through on goal only to be stopped by Lee Ashcroft's intervention.
But it was Dunfermline who went ahead. Kallum Higginbotham's corner was not dealt with at all by Gaston and Nicky Clark flicked the ball on to Wedderburn, who applied the tap-in and was booked for going into the crowd to celebrate.
Shankland was in on goal again following Mark Russell's pass but shot wide and Morton's Ross Forbes was booked for simulation in the Pars' penalty area.
Michael Doyle and Andy Murdoch were denied by Sean Murdoch as the home side searched for an equaliser.
And the Dunfermline stopper produced an impressive point-blank save to prevent Kudus Oyenuga scoring.
Gaston was also tested, doing well to keep Clark's effort out.
The Pars thought they had doubled their lead but Morris's header was chalked off for pushing.
It mattered little, though, as Dunfermline held on for the three points and bounced back from last week's home defeat by Ayr United while Morton can only reflect on a frustrating and disappointing day.
Dunfermline Athletic manager Allan Johnston: "It was an incredible record to go a full year unbeaten at home; it just shows you the consistency they've shown since the start of the season.
"Jim Duffy has done a great job here so we're delighted to come here and get the three points. The win is massive, but the work rate today was exceptional from not just the defence, but the midfield, the wide players getting back in, the strikers dropping back in, it was real team performance today."
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "It's extremely disappointing; a lot of aspects were below par. One or two individuals did ok but defensively I don't think we were anywhere near good enough.
"I think in midfield, the creativity was missing and up front I felt we lacked a spark. Credit to Dunfermline, they score from a mistake but overall, I don't think we can complain about losing that today.
"In open play I didn't feel we were quite calm enough in the final situation, and you've got to show that composure. That's the difference - top players show composure at key moments and I felt that when we got wide, we kind of rushed a cross, or scuffed a cross, things like that. Dunfermline deserved to win."
