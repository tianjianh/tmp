[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 0-0 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon and Peterborough United's match at Kingsmeadow had all the hallmarks of a pre-season game as they played out a dour goalless draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With the Dons lying 13th and Posh 11th in League One, both sides granted opportunities to youngsters as the end of the season approached.
Right-back Toby Sibbick made his debut for the Londoners, while left-back Lewis Freestone played in his second successive game for the visitors.
The result leaves the two sides comfortably locked in mid-table with Bradford upcoming for Wimbledon and Bristol Rovers next for Peterborough.
In a quiet first half, Marcus Maddison came close but Wimbledon goalkeeper Joe McDonnell did well to hold his bulleted effort.
The home side then had a great chance in the 36th minute, when Lyle Taylor crossed for George Francomb, but Luke McGee kept the winger's header out.
In the second half, Wimbledon had a couple of chances as Taylor and Tyrone Barnett came close.
With six minutes left, Paul Robinson had a glorious opportunity to win it, but his header flew just over the crossbar.
