Care homes in Melness and Melvich could close

A group set up by the health board to examine the future of health care in the area has recommended shutting the homes in Melness and Melvich.
A location has still be to suggested for the new building.

NHS Highland and Highland Council expect to consider a more detailed proposal early next year.
