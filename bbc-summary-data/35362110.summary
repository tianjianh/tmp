The 21-year-old suffered soft tissue damage during Saturday's second warm-up match against the United Arab Emirates.
Earlier in the game Overton struck an unbeaten half-century, but was then only able to bowl four overs.
"It is a real shame that Jamie will not take part in this series," said Lions head coach Andy Flower.
"He was starting to really hit his straps on this section of the tour."
Overton will now return to Taunton, where he will undergo a rehabilitation programme to start his recovery.
