Walsall have signed young goalkeeper Craig MacGillivray from Conference North side Harrogate Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A compensation package has been agreed with the Yorkshire side to bring 21-year-old MacGillivray to the Bescot Stadium on an initial one-year deal.
"Craig is one we've had our eye on for some time now," said boss Dean Smith.
"We've received plenty of glowing reports on him from various sources, so we decided to get in there early and broker a deal with Harrogate Town."
MacGillivray, who has spent two seasons with Harrogate after signing from Stalybridge Celtic in August 2012, becomes Walsall's first summer signing.
Despite beating off several other Football League clubs to get their man, Walsall have signed MacGillivray only as deputy to last season's first-choice ever-present Richard O'Donnell.
But Smith, who has gaps in his squad to fill after releasing eight players and losing skipper Andy Butler to Sheffield United, insists that McGillivray will figure in their long-term plans.
"He has the pedigree to really challenge for a first-team place here," added the Saddlers boss.
"He's a bright, young lad who has played a number of first-team games at Conference North level.
"He's the right age and has all the attributes that we are looking for.
"It's a one-year deal initially, but the opportunity is there for him to show what he can do and extend that.
"We thank Harrogate Town for the way in which they conducted themselves during the negotiation process and we look forward to working closely with Craig and helping him fulfil his undoubted potential."
