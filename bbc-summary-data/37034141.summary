Oldham Athletic manager Stephen Robinson has joked he is still learning some of the players' names after his summer recruitment drive.

He joined in July from his role as Northern Ireland assistant and started with just seven contracted players.
"I think I'm still trying to get to know half of the players' names," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"I don't know if there are many managers who have signed 18 players in four weeks but that's what we've done."
He added: "I'm not expecting miracles overnight. It wasn't a disaster losing at Millwall and we haven't made it by winning against Wigan."
