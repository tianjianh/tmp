Wigan Athletic 0-1 Queens Park Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queens Park Rangers edged a tight match at Wigan to avoid a third straight Championship defeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a goalless first half, Yeni Ngbakoto shot straight at Adam Bogdan for QPR, while Wigan had Craig Morgan's far-post header disallowed for offside.
The winning goal came just minutes into the second half, when Nedum Onuoha lashed in after Jake Bidwell's free-kick was only half cleared.
Max Power fired wide and Will Grigg headed over for Wigan as QPR held on.
The first five minutes saw Ngbakoto almost put the visitors ahead, but his shot failed to trouble Bogdan in the Wigan goal, while Morgan's header was the best chance for the hosts in the opening period.
QPR went into the game on the back of defeats by Barnsley and Preston, but showed great resilience once they had taken the lead, epitomised by Alex Smithies' save at full stretch to deny Luke Garbutt.
Wigan had found the net at least once in their past 16 league outings, but despite those late efforts by Power and Grigg, it was QPR who took all three points.
QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink:
"For us it was important we came here and made sure our platform and organisation was right.
"We also had to make sure we didn't give a lot away, and made it difficult for them. We knew how they wanted to play, and how dominant they can be.
"I think we pushed them all over the pitch, and at times we could have been better with the ball and calmer with the ball.
"Overall it was a very solid performance, it was a grinder, and at times a little bit nervous. That is normal away from home. We stayed together as a team and we ground out a good win."
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell:
"It's frustrating again. I thought we created opportunities, even more so towards the end of the game.
"We could have switched play better, we could have played in wide areas better, we know they're a team that plays narrow.
"Again we conceded a poor goal, and we have to learn that clean sheets are going to be the bedrock of our success this season. We have to stop conceding poor goals.
"There were a few positives, we created opportunities, the players gave me everything, they kept going. We just have to work hard and make sure we get the little things right that become big things in the game."
