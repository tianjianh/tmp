[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth City Council is paying temporary managers a total of more than £10,000 a day, a council report says.

The findings, to be discussed by the cabinet, revealed 17 "interim staff" were being paid more than £500 a day and two cost more than £800.
Opposition Conservatives have criticised the spending as exorbitant.
The Labour-led unitary council said the expertise was needed to oversee a restructuring programme designed to save money in the long-term.
The council said many of the temporary staff were providing short-term expertise on a project which aimed to save £30m by changing the way the council delivered services.
Conservative councillor Ian Bowyer said: "It seems to me at this moment in time Plymouth taxpayers are being asked to take a tremendous leap in the dark in the hope that we get a result at the end of the day.
"It's far from clear what that result might be."
The council said it was recruiting permanent staff for five of the posts.
