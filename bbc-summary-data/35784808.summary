United midfielder Fellaini appeared to catch Can with an arm during Thursday's first leg at Anfield and could face retrospective punishment from Uefa.
But 22-year-old Can said: "Fellaini is a fair sportsman. He touched my throat with his elbow but it is OK.
"It was just a small fight. It was not a boxing ring punch."
Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo produced six bookings in the game, but did not produce a card for Belgian midfielder Fellaini for the clash with Can.
Liverpool dominated Thursday's game and won it through a Daniel Sturridge penalty and second-half goal from Roberto Firmino.
The home side could have had a bigger lead to take to Old Trafford for next Thursday's second leg were it not for United keeper David De Gea, who made a number of good saves.
"De Gea is a very good goalkeeper but we created chances, played well and scored two goals," added Can.
"It was incredible, a very good score for the second leg and we have to keep going like that."
