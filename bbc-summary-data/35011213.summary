East Midlands Airport blames Monarch for drop in travellers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
East Midlands Airport has blamed a drop in passenger numbers on the withdrawal of an airline.

Monarch Airlines announced last year that it would stop its services at the airport following a review.
From April to September, the airport welcomed 2.9 million passengers - 6.5% down on the 3.1 million that arrived in the same six-month period last year.
Despite the decrease, a report revealed the airport gained Â£37.4m in revenue in half a year.
28,313
passenger flights
360,248 cups of coffee sold
503,186 breakfasts served
82,480 fragrance items sold
Manchester Airports Group (MAG), which runs the airport, said the passenger decrease was "driven by the withdrawal of flights by Monarch".
"The airport has partially mitigated the impact of the withdrawal through improved load factors to other destinations," the report said.
"Cargo income has benefitted from growth in e-commerce and internet shopping, with integrated express carriers expanding their operation and contributing to 8.8% growth in revenue at East Midlands - the biggest airport for dedicated cargo traffic in the UK."
MAG also confirmed work is under way at the airport to improve the short stay car park and immigration hall.
The airport celebrated its 50th anniversary in April.
