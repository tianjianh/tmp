The 24-year-old is set to be out for 12 weeks and will miss England's tour of Argentina in June.
"The issue needs addressing immediately," Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston said.
Clifford lasted just five minutes of Quins' defeat by Saracens at Wembley on Saturday because of a head injury.
