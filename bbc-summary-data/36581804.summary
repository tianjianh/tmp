He enjoyed a 42% success rate in the group stage, correctly guessing the outcome of 15 of the 36 games.
The only group he failed to get a single result in was Group F, which saw Hungary and Iceland spring a surprise by finishing first and second.
Before the tournament Lawro chose 11 of the 16 teams that are through to the first knockout stage, including France, his pick to win the tournament on 10 July.
Along with almost 350,000 of you, Lawro is taking part in the new BBC Sport Predictor game. He is going head-to-head with pundits, presenters and commentators from across BBC Sport. He's doing well, though he's not top as things stand:

Match report & highlights
This is a rematch of the final of Euro 2012 and the tie of the round. I am expecting Germany to be waiting for the winner in the quarter-finals too and, whether it is Italy or Spain, that will be another cracking game.
Italy made eight changes in their final group game against the Republic of Ireland and were unrecognisable from their first two matches of the tournament.
I am expecting them to be back to their usual selves, but I am not sure it will be enough.
Spain were cruising along in Group D until they lost to Croatia but I see that as just a blip. It won't be easy for them against Italy's defence, but they will find a way to score and I don't think Italy will.
Lawro's prediction: 0-1
We know what to expect from Iceland - they will sit back, try to stay in the game and play on the break.
It has worked for them so far but I just think that, if England turn up, they will create as many chances as they did in their group games, and this time the goals will come.
Iceland boss Lars Lagerback did not lose to England in six matches as Sweden boss, but I think he will taste defeat on Monday.
If England do play France in the last eight, it will be hard for them of course - but it is the same when you get to the quarter-finals of any major tournament.
Lawro's prediction: 3-0
