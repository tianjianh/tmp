The heifer, named Seren, survived the fall on to Traeth Bach, near Llangrannog, Ceredigion, unhurt apart from cuts.
Food was taken down as she remained trapped for days before better weather allowed a rescue on Thursday.
An RNLI crew and volunteers held her head and tail above water as she swam to an accessible beach.
A crowd gathered to greet Seren on to shore near Llangrannog village as boat owner Mickey Beechey and others helped.
Farmers Geraint and Delyth Griffiths praised the "community spirit" shown in the rescue operation.
Seren was taken back to their farm, where she spent time grazing on a grassy paddock.
