[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colchester United 2-3 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter edged a five-goal thriller to beat Colchester and end the hosts' unbeaten home record.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grecians went ahead in the eighth minute through Robbie Simpson's close-range effort, after Jordan Moore-Taylor's header had hit a post following a free-kick.
Simpson should have scored again soon after when he blasted over from 10 yards following Jack Stacey's pass.
And two minutes later, Colchester equalised when Sammie Szmodics converted after Luke Prosser had headed a free-kick back across goal.
Colchester keeper Sam Walker denied Jake Taylor before Colchester went ahead seven minutes before half-time through Kurtis Guthrie, who deftly headed in Brennan Dickenson's corner.
But Exeter equalised five minutes after the break through Ollie Watkins' fine low shot from the edge of the area, and Joel Grant restored Exeter's lead midway through the second half when he slid in to convert Stacey's cross at the far post.
Bobby Olejnik denied Prosser and Tarique Fosu and Szmodics hit the outside of a post late on as Exeter claimed victory.
