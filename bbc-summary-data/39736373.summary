A would-be terrorist attempted to fashion a bomb using a pressure cooker and fairy lights, a court has heard.

Zahid Hussain, 29, filled the appliance with shrapnel and made "improvised igniters" from the festive decorations, jurors were told.
Birmingham Crown Court heard he had researched railway lines as a potential target for the "non-viable" bomb, which he wrongly thought capable of causing devastation.
He denies several charges.
Prosecution QC Annabel Darlow said Mr Hussain was found in possession of a number of books which contained instructions on sabotage and guerrilla warfare tactics.
She said: "After his computer was recovered, material showed that Mr Hussain held a pronounced interest in Islamic State and events in Syria.
"In his own words he had become bedroom radicalised - turned into a radical by material he had accessed in his own bedroom."
Miss Darlow said the defendant had tried to build "a number of explosive devices", including a pressure cooker bomb and fairy light igniters.
Mr Hussain also attempted to create a remote-control "initiator" for a device by modifying a wireless doorbell, she said.
Jurors were told Mr Hussain, formerly of Naseby Road, Alum Rock, Birmingham, was arrested on 9 August after reports of a man carrying a hammer and behaving suspiciously near his home.
He was taken to a police station where officers found handwritten recipes for explosives, a modified fairy light and a hand-drawn map showing a drainage chamber in Alum Rock.
Officers then went to his home where they found an "improvised laboratory" and four allegedly viable igniters fashioned from fairy lights, the court heard.
Mr Hussain, who was flanked in the dock by two psychiatric nurses, has pleaded not guilty to preparation of terrorist acts, two counts of making explosives and one of attempting to make explosives.
The trial continues.
