[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 1-1 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Howard's brilliant second-half penalty save preserved a point against MK Dons and kept Bolton top of the League One table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Sheffield United goalkeeper pushed Kieran Agard's spot-kick onto the crossbar moments after the Dons had brought themselves level through Ryan Colclough.
Phil Parkinson's side took a seventh-minute lead when Jay Spearing's corner was headed back at the far post by Jamie Proctor and Mark Beevers swept home from close range.
Wanderers dominated the half and should have doubled their advantage when David Wheater headed over from close range.
Agard missed a chance to open his account for the season when he failed to get a touch on Dean Bowditch's low cross, but the Dons were level nine minutes after the restart when Colclough slotted home at the second attempt following a save from Howard.
Agard then won a penalty after being pulled down by Lewis Buxton, only to be frustrated by a magnificent stop from Howard.
Almost immediately Bolton had a good claim for a penalty of their own turned down when Proctor appeared to be fouled in mid-air by Joe Walsh.
The home side turned the screw and Newcastle loanee Sammy Ameobi had two late efforts kept out of the net by some excellent goalkeeping by David Martin and some frantic defending.
