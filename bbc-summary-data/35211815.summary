Armand Gnanduillet netted a consolation for Stevenage with the last kick of the game, tapping in from eight yards for his sixth goal of the season.

"It was disappointing to go in a goal down when you are on the front foot and feeling good about the way things are going."
On Mansfield's penalty: "It was seen by everyone in the ground that it's hit his hand. From my view if you're giving it last week then that's a stone-wall penalty, without a doubt. We're not getting that rub of the green at the moment.
"Was it a free kick for their goal? I don't know. The man has skipped over a challenging leg, I don't know whether it's much of a free kick myself. It's given, and he puts it in the top corner."
