Hundreds of mourners gathered for the funeral service at the Jamia Masjid Bilal mosque in Huddersfield.
Mr Yaqub's coffin was carried out of the service by family and friends before being driven away for burial.
Earlier his father, Mohammed Yaqub, told BBC Radio Leeds: "He will be missed by us very deeply. He will still live on in our hearts day-to-day."
Bradford Coroner's Court heard Mr Yaqub had been shot through the windscreen of an Audi car after a "hard stop" on the motorway slip road.
He died from gunshot wounds to his chest.
Coroner Martin Fleming was told a firearm had been found in the front passenger footwell of the Audi.
Four unmarked police cars were involved in the incident with one, a Mercedes, cutting across the front of the Audi, coroner's officer Chris Dalby told the hearing.
"During the incident an officer discharged a firearm in the execution of his duty," he added.
Mr Fleming adjourned the inquest until 31 March.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is investigating the operation which led to Yassar Yaqub's death, said none of the officers involved were using body-worn video cameras and no relevant CCTV footage of the incident has been found.
A non-police issue firearm was found in the Audi in which Mr Yaqub was travelling, the IPCC confirmed.
The white Audi was one of two cars stopped by police on the slip road. The other vehicle was a white Volkswagen Scirocco.
Mr Amin appeared at Leeds Magistrates' Court charged with possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, possession of a sound moderator and possession of ammunition.
He was remanded in custody and is due to appear before Leeds Crown Court on 3 February.
Four other men arrested as part of the operation have been released on police bail.
