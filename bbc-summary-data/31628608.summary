A Star Wars super fan has sold off another chunk of his collection for more than £24,000.

Craig Stevens, 45, made headlines last month when a collector paid £18,000 at auction for his Boba Fett figure in its unpunched packaging.
He sold 15 more rare figures at Vectis auction house at Thornaby, Teesside, which fetched a further £24,650.
A figure of the IG-88 droid which still had its £1.40 original price sticker on the box went for £4,200.
A Han Solo figure in Bespin outfit from The Empire Strikes Back film went for £2,000 after two internet bidders went up against each other for the rarity.
Afterwards Mr Stevens, who is married and lives in Croydon, south London, said: "That was a great result from the auction - £24,000 was the hammer price which was a great return on my original investment of a few pounds in the 1990s."
That came on top of the £41,000-plus his other figures sold for last month.
The couple say they will use the cash to buy a new house.
Mr Stevens still has a 10,000-strong collection of Star Wars memorabilia and his advice for other fans is to get in the attic and have a look for old toys.
"The holy grail for Star Wars collectors is the Jawa with a vinyl cape which were made for a short time before they replaced it with a cloth cape," he said.
"It was only made for four or five months before they replaced it. There are more out there in people's cupboards and attics.
"Unpackaged you are talking £400-£500 and in the packaging, unopened, the sky's the limit."
Vectis sold one last year for more than £10,000.
Valuer Kathy Taylor said: "People didn't really believe another one has turned up because they are so scarce.
"I do believe there are more out there undisturbed lying around in people's cupboards and attics."
Mr Stevens is writing a book on Star Wars and plans another on collecting.
"I'd like to share my knowledge," he said. "Let's face it, everyone has stuff in their attics and cupboards."
