World number one Andy Murray has pulled out of his first exhibition match at Hurlingham Club with a sore hip.

The Briton, who was knocked out in the first round at Queen's last week, was due to play France's Lucas Pouille at the Aspall Tennis Classic.
Murray is still expected to play on Friday before he begins the defence of his Wimbledon title on 3 July.
The 30-year-old last played at Hurlingham in 2014 after he lost in the last 16 at Queen's.
Elsewhere, world number two Novak Djokovic managed just nine minutes of play against Canadian Vasek Pospisil at Eastbourne before rain led to play being cancelled for the day.
The Serb, appearing in his first pre-Wimbledon tournament for seven years, was forced to save two break points in his opening service game.
Elsewhere, Britons Katie Swan and Tara Moore were knocked out of Wimbledon qualifying.

This is an "ultra-cautious" decision according to Murray's team, and it's expected he will play his other scheduled match at the Hurlingham Club on Friday.
Murray has been practising at Wimbledon in recent days - with young Canadian Denis Shapovalov amongst others - but the disruption is far from ideal given his first-round exit at Queen's Club last week.
It means Murray will have a maximum of two matches on grass before he begins the defence of his Wimbledon title.
