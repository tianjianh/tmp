The former captain, on 52 overnight, was finally out lbw to Nathan Buck (5-90) for 161 as the visitors moved from 108-2 to 434 all out at Wantage Road.
Tom Kohler-Cadmore hit 76 and skipper Joe Leach made 50 as Worcestershire gained a first-innings lead of 196.
Northants closed on 53-2 with Ben Duckett unbeaten on 25.
Northamptonshire's Nathan Buck told BBC Radio Northampton: "The pitch didn't do as much. We bowled well in patches and produced periods of pressure.
"But we couldn't contain as much as we'd liked and leaked a few too many.
"We didn't put the ball in the good areas as consistently as we wanted ."
Worcestershire opener Daryl Mitchell told BBC Hereford & Worcester: "Northants have actually been a bit of a bogey team for me until the last couple of years, so it's nice to get a few.
"Four hundred is always our target and we got there with a couple of decent partnerships. Tom played a really important knock.
"We've had two good days here and got a big lead on a deteriorating pitch so hopefully we can press home the advantage."
