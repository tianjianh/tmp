Eurovision 2015: Reporter's diary from Vienna

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This year's Eurovision Song Contest has taken place in Vienna.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BBC's Emma Saunders was in the Austrian capital to report from behind the scenes.
So it's goodbye to Vienna.
Before leaving for the airport, I managed to clarify the frankly very confusing situation regarding the votes from Macedonia and Montenegro, and it's all a bit of an anti-climax.
Turns out the EBU took 100% of those countries' votes from the televotes i.e. from Joe Public, and disqualified the juries' votes. It should have been 50/50. So ultimately, it made no difference to any of the scores. Thank goodness for that.
Host Austria woke up with a big hangover this morning - from Conchita mania to nul points in one fell swoop. Eurovision can be brutal. At least Austrians could share their pain with their neighbour Germany, who also went home with zilch.
The so-called big five - including the UK - were left largely disappointed, bar Italy, who came third.
No doubt there will be more soul-searching after another poor show for the Brits, despite Electro Velvet's valiant efforts. Deja vu. Again.
So that's it from me - auf Wiedersehen. See you in Sweden.
So Sweden's Mans Zelmerlow wins Eurovision - he's been the favourite pretty much all the way through, so not a huge surprise.
It's the sixth time Sweden has won the competition. Pretty impressive.
The inspired graphics coupled with a contemporary Aviici-style dance track clearly appealed across the continent, not least in the UK, which was one of many countries to give it 12 points.
It was a three-horse race between Russia, Italy and Sweden until near the end but Zelmerlow looked blown away when the presenters announced that they'd "done the maths" and Sweden were the winners.
He was given a huge hug from Conchita as she handed over her Eurovision crown.
"I have so much to say... I'm so extremely happy," Zelmerlow said as he accepted the award.
"We are all heroes, no matter who we love , who we are or what we believe in."
It was yet another disappointing night for the UK, who managed to get just 5 points, leaving them in 24th position.
So the voting is well underway and Twitter has been in overdrive since the contest started. Here's some funny ones to keep you amused while you wait for the results.
On Georgia
@PIXELATEDCROWN  "Woah can't believe they let an actual raven compete in eurovision I hope they win."
On Eurovision in general
@Louisxmichael "Hungary has made me hungry for better music #eurovision."
On Spain
@richardosman  "Nice reworking of 'Old McDonald Had A Farm' #spain #Eurovision"
On Latvia
@popbangcolour "You know those toilet roll covers your gran has, Latvian lady has dressed like one of those... #Eurovision."
On Montenegro
@Lozbotron "No one in the world is more embarrassed of their dad than some kid from Montenegro right now."
On Austria
@Cleverdever "Piano fire just got put out. Because there's way too much hairspray in this arena for that to go on for long"
Hungary - After all that drama, Hungary's delicate and soulful ballad comes as something of a relief. Boggie's Wars for Nothing is an acoustic number which builds up vocally as she's joined by four harmonising backing singers.
It's got a traditional Eurovision peace message (clue is in the title) which could go in its favour. Again, it's all about the voices but there is a very impressive constellations image projected on to the floor during the first half of the song. Thank goodness for aerial cameras.
Georgia - Nina Sublatti has a strong voice and she looks pretty scary as she belts out her anthem Warrior wearing a Goth-style leather jumpsuit with thigh high boots. And she's taken epaulettes to a whole new level - frankly, it looks like two ravens are poking out of her capped sleeves.
She says her song is about feminism, Georgian women's history, and honesty. Good on her. And it's another entry that's offering something different from the pop and ballads on offer. I just wouldn't want to be the one to tell her she hasn't won.
Azerbaijan - Hour of the Wolf isn't a bad song but I'm afraid I was so distracted by the contemporary dancers  in harem pants swirling around Elnur Huseynov that it's hard to comment. And one of them was bare-chested, shock, horror.
But I do recall it had a hint of Hozier about it, at least in the verses. It's not Elnur's first time at Eurovision - in 2003, as part of duo Elnur & Samir, he came eighth. I'm not sure he'll be able to top that tonight.
Russia - Polina Gagarina's A Million Voices is now one of the favourites to win. Some commentators in Vienna feel it sticks in the craw a little, given the song's message of peace and tolerance opposite Russia's handling of the crisis in Ukraine and its anti-gay stance. But that's not Polina's fault.
The song is very Eurovision and although she looks a bit nervous, her voice doesn't suffer for it. It will be some turnaround if Russia do take the Eurovision crown after last year's entry was booed by some members of the audience.
Albania  - Gosh, this was a hard one to sing. The notes are all over the shop.  Elhaida Dani gives it a good crack though. The staging could have been a bit more interesting.
Again, not a bad song but it's probably going to get lost in the penultimate spot, especially sandwiched between big hitters Russia and Italy.
Italy - any Il Divo fans out there? You're going to love Il Volo. Some think the fact it's sung in Italian could go against it but it's a beautiful language so I can't see it myself. Simple staging for this trio - the music speaks for itself.
It's been a favourite for months and should feature highly even if it doesn't win. I doubt the boys will be too bothered if they don't - they've already sold one million records and collaborated with Placido Domingo and Barbra Streisand.
Montenegro - This is only Montengro's second appearance in a Eurovision final. Knez is a huge star in his home nation and his Eurovision entry Adio has a traditional regional feel, featuring a folky instrumental opening that transports you straight to the shores of the Adriatic.
And actually, that's no bad thing. A bit of old school Eurovision never hurt anyone. We were also treated to some traditional dancing with his five lovely backing singers. What's not to like?
Germany - Sophie Ann stepped into the breach when the contestant that won the selection contest in Germany earlier this year shocked presenters by telling them he didn't want to go to Eurovision after all.
So instead of Andreas Kummert's acoustic ballad, we get to hear Black Smoke, a funky number from a singer who grew up in Hamburg, was born in London and studied in New York. How very international.
The song isn't unpleasant but it all feels just a little bit dated. And she spends the entire first verse with her back to the audience - how rude. "We're only left with black smoke," Sophie Ann smoulders. I'm still worrying about that piano.
Poland's entry, Monika Kuszynska, was very emotional about getting through to this year's final. She was in a rock pop band who were involved in a serious car accident in 2006, which left her paralysed from the waist down. "Sometimes we can only see the dark side but many beautiful things can go with a terrible event," she said after making it through the second semi-final.
In the Name of Love is another ballad, written by Monika herself, about how she overcame the trauma she suffered. The melody is pretty run-of-the-mill but it's hard not to feel moved by the sincere performance. And she blows a little kiss to the audience at the end. Nice touch.
Latvia - This is very different to everything else on offer and has polarised opinion here in the Austrian capital. Aminata's Love Injected is an electro ballad, which the 22-year-old penned herself. I reckon Aminata could be Latvia's answer to La Roux. She certainly sounds like Elly Jackson, particularly during the verses.
Aminata is wearing a red dress that wouldn't look out of place on Diana Ross but she does own the stage (I'm back in Cowell mode). And she should be applauded for entering something unusual.
Romania - Yet another pared-down set, this time for Romanian artist Voltaj with his song De La Capat (All Over Again). The stage is scattered with strategically placed suitcases though. Is he hoping to make a quick getaway? But I like the way he chops and changes between Romanian and English throughout his performance.
The song is about supporting children whose parents have to leave their homeland to work abroad and he finishes with a message to the audience: "Don't leave the children behind". Er, I think he might be aiming this at me. Kids, I'll be back from Vienna on Sunday. Promise.
Spain - now this, folks, would be just another ballad if it wasn't for the costume gimmicks! Bring it on! Edurne - David de Gea's girlfriend for the footy fans amongst you - starts off by climbing over a man lying on the stage. Good start. And it gets better. So she's wearing a red evening dress with a Kylie-style snood hood that she pushes back before launching into the strong chorus.
Meanwhile, the long train of her dress is billowing behind her thanks to a bit of wind machine action and the man who was lying on the floor has recovered himself sufficiently to pull the train, resulting in Edurne's dress flying off to reveal a glittery gold number underneath!
I was worried there might be a Madonna moment as he tugged on the train but they must have sensibly opted for Velcro. Well, it worked of Buck's Fizz. Not only that, there are also some ambitious dance lifts a la Strictly (Len would definitely NOT approve).
Cyprus - John Karayiannis says his influences are Ed Sheeran and John Mayer, although to be honest, you wouldn't know it by listening to his Eurovision entry, One Thing I Should Have Done. Personally, I think he sounds more like Will Young. This is probably the most traditional ballad in the contest.
It does have quite an old-fashioned feel so maybe that's why the first verse was broadcast in black and white. Members of the audience wave their obligatory phone torches in time to the music and John looks like he's about to cry by the end of the song. Oh dear. John says his eyesight is so bad he can't see further than the end of his nose but he has 9 spare pairs so he should be alright.
Australia - This is the perfect antidote to Cyprus (no offence but there are a LOT of ballads in this year's contest). This year's wildcard has split opinion in terms of whether it should have been allowed to enter but lighten up people! The Aussies love Eurovision and this is a really decent pop song from established artist, Guy Sebastian.
We're not quite sure why he's got the M6 backdrop behind him - it's not saying exotic Gold Coast to me - but we're loving the jaunty hat and the dancing's not bad either. Tonight Again could land top five.
Belgium - Loic Nottet came second in the 2013 Belgium version of The Voice as part of BJ Scott and this entry, Rhythm Inside, is a bold effort and has more than a touch of Lorde's hit Royals about it. Australian artist Sia recently re-tweeted Loic's version of her hit Chandelier, which must say something.
There's a teetering pirouette in the middle which looks pretty risky plus one of the dancers appears to be doing a floor workout gym-style for some inexplicable reason. The track might be too cool and edgy for Eurovision's audience but it made it through the first semi-final so watch this space.
Austria - Conchita is a hard act to follow and this year's Austrian act has been somewhat in the shadow of the 'Queen of Austria' this week in Vienna. Rock band The MakeMakes are giving it a good crack with their song We Are Yours!
It's pretty low key after the whirlwind that was Conchita but they certainly haven't disgraced themselves on the big stage in front of a home crowd. And they do all have facial hair to keep the beard theme going. And we have another gimmick - woo hoo! The piano is set on fire! Er, health and safety anyone? Where are the EU regulations when you need them?
Greece - Phew. They've either put out the piano fire or they've wheeled in another for Maria Elena Kyriacou's  entry, One Last Breath. This is another typical Eurovision ballad, with a predictable 80s-style drum beat joining in for the second verse.
She's got a fine pair of lungs on her though and the wind machine is in full action as she builds up to the finale. Maria Elena co-wrote the song herself. Before winning a Greek talent show, she was a professor so at least that's something to fall back on if the wind doesn't blow in her favour (sorry!)
Armenia - Genealogy, had to change their song title from Don't Deny to Face the Shadow after it was deemed too political by the powers that be with its apparent reference to the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks 100 years ago. Not quite sure what the point was given the lyrics remain unchanged.
But anyway, it's a powerful rock ballad sung by a six-strong group, featuring opera-style warbling plus your more standard pop voices. There's some pretty impressive harmonies here, too.
Lithuania's upbeat This Time comes from yet another male/female duo, Monika Linkyte and Vaidas Baumila. The song can certainly hold its own and there's a three-second kiss between the pair midway through the performance which seems to go down very well with the audience. There's definitely chemistry there.
Serbia's entry has the perfect ingredients for a Eurovision hit. Big diva voice, spooky dancers with masks who strip off to reveal new costumes, reminiscent of Bucks Fizz, and an "I am what I am" message from its plus-size singer, Bojana Stamenov. Beauty Never Lies starts off as a ballad before building into a classic Euro discobeat dance track that is sending audiences wild in Vienna.
And hats off to the backing vocalists/dancers for presenting the chorus in sign language while leaping around the stage. This could be a surprise winner.
Norway's entry is a real grower and duo Morland and Debrah Scarlett have to be one of the coolest acts in this year's final. Some songs don't need gimmicks and this is one of them. Their song, A Monster Like Me, is creeping up in the betting odds and it's a really hard one to call - it could be too slow for voters hearing it for the first time and it's not typical Eurovision fare. Then again, that could work in their favour.
Kjetil Morland comes from southern Norway but has spent most of his adult life in the UK, after moving there to study. This of course explains his very English accent which threw me off guard in yesterday's press conference. So worth cheering them on along with Electro Velvet if you like the UK connection. (Don't tell anyone but this is my favourite).
Sweden is favourite to win this year's contest with Mans Zelmerlow's Heroes and it's not hard to see why. The Aviici-style track is being belted out by Eurovision fans across Vienna (including on a tram last night on the way back the press centre) but its trump card is the stunning background graphics.
The innovative and interactive projections wouldn't look out of place at the Brits or Grammys. Whether the graphics should be as important a factor as the song itself is a debate that will no doubt rumble on should Sweden win.
Slovenia - This was a slick opening performance from married duo Marjetka and Raay. Their act is called Maraaya, a combination of... you've got it, Marjetka and Raay. Here For You has a genuine contemporary edge with a catchy chorus that should see it do well tonight. And it can't be easy kicking off a show watched by nearly 200m people on TV.
Not sure if the huge headphones paired with a wedding dress is a good look but anything goes at Eurovision.  Their act also features a very energetic dancer playing an imaginary violin, plus Raay making love with the camera from his piano seat. Whatever floats your boat.
France - Not one act who has been placed second in the line-up at Eurovision has ever won. So it's a tough ask for France's Lisa Angell. Let's hope her lucky routine is in place - when her daughter is backstage with her, Lisa kisses her on the forehead and if she's not there, she keeps a picture of her close by. Bless.
Lisa's a fantastic and powerful singer live but I can't see this ballad doing the business, despite the men in uniform flanking her on either side. It's one of the few entries this year to be sung in a native tongue, titled N'oubliez Pas. Or Don't Forget. Sorry Lisa, we just might.
Israel - Golden Boy, Nadav Guedj, certainly lives up to his name here in the press centre. They absolutely love the 16-year-old bundle of energy who intends to prove he's "the king of fun". For his tender years, he oozes confidence and totally owns the stage (I'm channelling my inner Simon Cowell).
And check out his bling winged gold trainers. His track covers all angles, starting off with a ballad-like solo which morphs into a Justin Timberlake-style dance track before it leads into a Middle Eastern-influenced chorus. Hold on to your hats.
Estonia - Elina Born and Stig Rasta certainly have their country behind them - they picked up 79% of the vote from Estonian TV viewers in the selection contest. Goodbye to Yesterday has some pretty odd lyrics in places ("I'm all alone, lying here naked waiting by the phone" for starters). Songwriter Stig rarely sings himself, he usually just writes for other people. And you can tell.
Don't get me wrong, he can hold a tune but Elina definitely has the stronger voice. However, the song is strong and the pair will be hoping for a second win for Estonia in Vienna. The piece de resistance is a clever illusion which sees Stig "disappear" into thin air at the end of the performance. Hurrah, the first real gimmick of the night!
United Kingdom - Rolling Stones tribute act singer Alex Larke and vocalist Bianca Nicholas are really enjoying the ride here in Vienna. Their song, Still In Love With You, has been the subject of much debate on social media and Alex himself has described it as a "Marmite" song i.e. you either love it or hate it. But it's a fun ditty and in a Eurovision Song Contest sadly lacking in gimmicks this year, Electro Velvet's performance should stand out.
Keep your eye on those costumes, that's all I'm saying. Not to mention Bianca's fabulous hair extensions and some pyrotechnics for good measure. Don't forget, Sandie Shaw won in Vienna in 1967 with Puppet On A String. Let's hope it's a good omen.
The show is being hosted by three women, Mirjam Weichselbraun, Alice Tumler and Arabella Kiesbauer but Conchita is clearly the lady of the moment as she pops up out of a podium in a sparkling pink number - and now the 'Queen of Austria' is flying across the stage!
All the contestants walk up to the stage surrounded by their respective flags.
I'll be giving you my thoughts on each entry.
The show is just about to start, and the noise has really ramped up in the last 15 minutes or so. We'll be lucky to hear the performances at this rate!
And if you're having a party, get in touch with Graham Norton and he might just give you a shout-out.
So hold on tight, here we go...
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more - I've arrived at the press centre and will be here for the duration.
Just before leaving the hotel, I saw Electro Velvet dashing back out, presumably on their way to the arena.
And I literally bumped into Graham Norton as I came out of the lift - or should I say, he bumped into me. He looked in a bit of a rush. For your information, the beard is looking well-groomed ahead of the final.
On the way to the arena, I passed dozens of fans streaming out after the final dress rehearsal, soaked to the skin.
It's rained pretty much solidly since I arrived - I bet the sun comes out tomorrow just as I board the plane.
Flags are flying already inside the press room and elbows are out. A French radio station has already stuck its label on the BBC's allocated table. This could be war!
On a lighter note, I've just been introduced to Terry Vision - a puppet who is a reporter for unofficial Eurovision website ESC Insight.
Hmmm. Do you think he might be based on someone closer to home with a strong Eurovision association?
Eurovision fans, it's the day you've been waiting for - the grand final!
It's raining here in Vienna (just for a change) but that isn't dampening anyone's spirits.
I've just spotted Alex from Electro Velvet in the hotel foyer looking relaxed ahead of the final dress rehearsal this afternoon and the place is swarming with fans - I bumped into several members of one unofficial fan club from London who did an impromptu dance routine in the hotel reception complete with LED light gloves, presumably in honour of Electro Velvet's illuminating stage show.
Not to mention their specially made T-shirts carrying the slogan: "Sounding Good, Sugar", a line from Still In Love With You.
The bookies' odds have made interesting reading during the week, with fluctuations aplenty following each semi-final.
According to Oddschecker this morning, which compiles all the big bookmakers, Sweden are still out in front, followed by Russia - who have edged past Italy, now lying in third.
Belgium and Australia are also in the running.
Electro Velvet are somewhere in the middle.
But who knows? Last year, it was predicted that the UK would claim a top five place but we ended up coming a disappointing 17th.
The Eurovision experts here in Vienna have also been sharing their thoughts about how it might go tonight.
Paul Jordan, best known as Dr Eurovision, told me: "Sweden is one to watch, they usually do well.
"It's not the best song but it's contemporary and his performance is really innovative.
"Russia could do well. Given the wider political context it will be interesting to watch the reaction for this [they were booed last year]."
That's unlikely to happen this year, though.
According to The Moscow Times, Eurovision organisers have "sound-reducing" technology at the ready to silence the audience should any booing occur this evening.
In Copenhagen last year, Russia's Tolmachevy Twins were repeatedly booed, although they ended up in seventh place.
The pair took the flak for their mother country's stance on Ukraine and Russia's record on gay rights.
We'll find out tonight if Russia's entry this year, Polina Gagarina, with her song about tolerance and peace, will suffer the same fate.
Just bumped into Kathrin Zechner, director of television at ORF, Austria's state broadcaster.
She was responsible for choosing Conchita to represent Austria at last year's contest and is in charge of the show's production.
"We went for the most challenging and she has a wonderful voice. She is so laidback and wise for her age.
"I told her to present six songs and Phoenix just stood out."
"Tears, happiness and pride! When they said Austria was in the lead, I nearly fainted!"
"The theme of the eye is about the vision of life and keeping an eye on the people around you.
"We've put the green room in the middle of the room, so it's really part of the show, as are the audience.
"The Building Bridges theme is about diversity, between old and young, women and men, different races, sexuality.
"I'm the only female director on my board, so that's my focus. Men will never give a place to women for free, you really have to push.
"We wanted three Austrians who are multi-lingual, from different ethnic groups. They're all professionals and all working mums."
"Keep an eye on your neighbour, Austria is a great place to visit and we built the longest, sparkly bridge - to Australia and back!"
We're all a bit bleary-eyed in the press centre this morning after the semi-final last night but thankfully, one of the BBC producers has come armed with PG Tips to keep us going. I managed to grab UK hopefuls Electro Velvet for a quick chat ahead of the first dress rehearsal for the final.
Bianca: "We just can't wait to get up there. The nerves are starting to come a little, but that's a good thing. It just means that you care a lot about it."
Alex: "I think we'll be quite pumped on the night, there'll be a lot of adrenaline!"
Bianca: "All that stuff is totally outside of our control. If you focus on where you're going to come, how you're doing in the odds, it can distract you from the performance which is the most important thing."
Alex: "We've put ourselves in our own little bubble, so we're not communicating with the outside world. We're just getting on with making sure our performance is tip top and then hopefully the rest will fall into place."
Bianca:  "I hope we'll feel on top of the world and feel proud of what we've done wherever we come."
Alex:  "There might be a glass of wine!"
Bianca: "We're quite lucky we're on early so we can then enjoy everyone else's performances. We've made some really good friends, it's like one big family. So we'll get to see some of our friends' performances and we're rooting for them, too."
Alex: "We did a little stint on the ukulele (at last night's semi-final). When they announced the UK, the place went nuts - it's been great, it lifted me."
Bianca: "It's so nice that a complete stranger wants to approach you and wish you good luck. It's really encouraging."
Bianca: "Eurovision is very fan-led, the staging is getting better and better and we're using state-of-the-art technology in our performance, it's just moving with the times."
More and more fans are descending on the Austrian capital as Grand Final day looms and I caught up with Mike and Louise, a couple from Nottingham, who are first-timers at Eurovision.
Michael: "We wanted to come to Vienna anyway so we thought, 'let's kill two birds with one stone'. We're more festival-goers really, we're off to the Isle of Wight later this year. It took us two days to get here because Louise doesn't fly!
Mike:  "I think it's OK, I think it was wrong to put in the old has-beens - Englebert and Bonnie - in it.
Louise: "Electro Velvet were just put together for this, it's just one record and we might not hear from them again."
Mike:  "We went to the first semi-final. Most of the songs were big ballads or very poppy and I think Electro Velvet have been quite clever, it's slightly off-beat.
Louise: "I think the song's catchy."
Mike:  "They played it live in the auditorium and it came across OK with the sound system beefing it up."
Louise: "Everyone was cheering. You can never tell!"
Louise: "It's me really! It's always been there since you were young. In the last 8-10 years it's changed again, young people are having parties. In England we always know we're never going to win. Good bands don't want to be part of it."
Michael: "If Take That or Blur entered, they wouldn't win... It's all political."
Louise: "I love Italy but having seen Serbia, I think with the lyrics, the big ballad start-off and then the beat, it's got all the ingredients.
Michael: The Australian one was good. That's a good pop song.
So we now have the order of the 26 acts in grand final. The UK is in fifth - Alex from Electro Velvet told me just now he was pleased with the slot, adding that many of the upbeat songs are in the first half. They are sandwiched between a strong track from Estonia and Armenia's moody protest ballad. France had better start worrying though - no-one who is second in the line-up has ever won Eurovision. Here's the list in full.
1.Slovenia
2.France
3.Israel
4.Estonia
5.United Kingdom
6.Armenia
7.Lithuania
8.Serbia
9.Norway
10.Sweden
11.Cyprus
12.Australia
13.Belgium
14.Austria
15.Greece
16.Montenegro
17.Germany
18.Poland
19.Latvia
20.Romania
21.Spain
22.Hungary
23.Georgia
24.Azerbaijan
25.Russia
26.Albania
27.Italy
And breathe... now we know the entire line-up for Saturday's grand final.
The biggest cheers went up in the press room for performances from Azerbijian, Montenegro, Slovenia, Israel, Norway and Sweden during the second semi-final - and that was reflected in the vote tonight, as they all went through.
They were joined by Lithuania, Poland - which seemed to be something of a surprise to some - Cyprus and Latvia.
Everyone held their breath as they waited for the last act to land a place in the final -  and it went to Israel's 16-year-old Nadav Guedj.
Sadly, the other 16-year-olds in the competition - San Marino duo Michele Perniola and Anita Simoncini - will not be joining him.
Multiple-Eurovision winner Ireland also missed the cut, as did Malta, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Iceland.
I spoke to Eurovision expert John Kennedy O'Connor after the results were announced: "Heartbreak of course in Ireland. It's 20 years now since their run of incredible Eurovision glory was halted and for the second year in a row, they didn't make the final.
"The poor Czechs were bounced out again and they are yet to ever appear on the final stage. San Marino of course disappointed and the youngest singers in the contest couldn't capitalise on their experience in the junior event last year."
So who is responsible for the outcome?
Viewers at home were able to vote in the semi-final if their country was performing in it. The UK are one of the "Big Five" who will go straight through to the final but Brits were allowed to vote on Thursday night.
The public determined half of the vote and the other half was down to the national juries of all the countries taking part or allocated to the semi-final.
As the results came through, the betting odds online began frantically changing before my eyes as we finally knew for definite who would be singing on Saturday night.
Russia, Belgium and Serbia are looking good while Sweden and Italy are still the favourites. Australia, Estonia, and now Norway, could also be in the running.
There was a jubilant atmosphere at the press conference that followed the show - the losers and their supporters must have sneaked out the back.
I think I was the only Brit among a sea of excitable Israelis surrounding me on all sides of the seating area, and it wasn't long before they broke into a spontaneous rendition of Guedj's Golden Boy.
Poland's entry, Monika Kuszynska, was very emotional about getting through. She was in a rock pop band who were involved in a serious car accident in 2006, which left her paralysed from the waist down.
"I feel I've got something to say, a message to put in my songs. Sometimes we can only see the dark side but many beautiful things can go with a terrible event. I always look on the bright side, that's why I'm here."
Sweden's Mans Zelmerlow said he was feeling "happy and relieved" after going through  before admitting, "I could have done some things better tonight. I was a bit rushed in the second verse, so I hope I'll be in the running to be champ!"
Don't worry Mans, you have three dress rehearsals before the big event to make it perfect.
There's a frisson in the air today in the Eurovision press centre as the 'Austrian Queen', aka Conchita, is in the house.
Her press conference was crammed to the gills with journos and Eurovision superfan bloggers. She didn't disappoint, entering the room wearing a dress slit to the waist to the strains of her single You Are Unstoppable.
What's it like hosting the green room at the semi-finals, ahead of Saturday's grand final?
"Three days ago I thought: 'Why would I agree on doing this? Last year, the last thing I wanted was for anyone to ask me how I felt! But I really do enjoy it, it's a new experience. I'm pushing my boundaries - I have just one minute and 48 seconds for each contestant."
How have you dealt with the fame that came with your win last year?
"I'm still not used to being a known person outside Austria. It's something I really appreciate."
And you've written a book about your life already!
"I'm just 26, it was too early to write my memoirs - there weren't that many! But then we came up with a concept that everyone liked, a book that I myself would like - with many pictures!"
Midway through proceedings, the MD of Sony Records in Austria surprised Conchita with a platinum award for her self-titled album.
Conchita: "What are you doing here? Am I fired? [Then] Thank you so much, gosh, that's unbelievable, thank you so much to my fans, that's huge."
How do you feel about Conchita lookalikes?
"I'm flattered people copy my look at carnivals etc - it's easy, a man just doesn't have to shave!"
Why are you known now just as Conchita, not Conchita Wurst?
"I heard the only way you get an Oscar is to drop your surname!"
You're a very positive person but some things must make you angry?
"Any negativity in the last year was about me and my character and I really don't care about other peoples' opinions.
With things in society - all I can do is reach as many people as possible through a camera and hopefully reach other people who have more influence than I do.
"I would love to meet President Putin. I would love to spend a week with him to understand what it's like to be President Putin, but I don't know if it's going to happen!"
Do you have a favourite in this year's contest?
"I do and I won't tell you!"
Guten morgen from Vienna.
The Australian fans are the big story at Eurovision this year, as Guy Sebastian vies to take the Eurovision crown beyond Europe's shores for the first time in the competition's history.
I caught up with an Aussie family - mum, son and daughter - who had travelled from Queensland to join the party.
So what's brought you all the way from Australia?
Nick: "We're here because Conchita won and we love Conchita."
Michaela (mum):  "I was born in Austria so for me, Conchita's win was a huge thing. That's why I had to come back and they came with me."
Have you always been big Eurovision fans?
Michaela: "Yes. I used to make them sit and watch. I grew up with Eurovision in the '70s, so they just had to listen - there was no escape!"
How did you feel when you found out that Australia were going to be part of the competition this year?
Eloise: "It was pretty exciting as we were coming anyway."
What do you think of Guy's song, Tonight Again?
Nick: "I think he'll do really well, it's a good song, everyone likes it over here and he's a great performer. We voted for him when he was on Australian Idol."
Have you had a good reception here in Vienna?
Eloise: "Everyone loves Australians (we're kind of a novelty)."
Michaela: "Everyone is friendly and we've come from afar. There have been mixed reactions to us being in it, but such is life."
Nick: "They think it's kind of weird we've come all the way - it is a bit odd as we're not in Europe. I think a lot of people are perplexed as to why we love it so much."
Why do the Australians love Eurovision so much?
Nick: "It's the immigrant population: Greeks, Italians, English, Austrian.
Michaela: "For the older generation, it's like a part of home for us. When we watch it, it brings Europe a bit closer. I think that's why a lot of the immigrants like it - and then their children either grow up liking it or hating it!"
And do you have any other Eurovision favourites this year?
All (in unison): "Belgium, we love Belgium!"
After a whirlwind introduction to the craziness of the press room, we raced down to Vienna's beautiful City Hall Square - home to the Eurovision Village all this week. Crowds had gathered and the stage was set for the "Big Five" contestants (France, Italy, the UK, Germany, Spain) plus wildcard Australia to prove themselves ahead of Saturday's grand final.
The square was packed with fans from across the continent and beyond, despite the heavy rain which decided to make an appearance just as the bizarre warm-up acts - lindy hop and flamenco dancers anyone? - got going.
Guy Sebastian was first up, receiving a raucous welcome, not least from a substantial group of Aussies who clearly felt it was worth the air fare and 24-hour flight to join the party.
"You guys are awesome for staying in the rain. We love Eurovision in Australia  and we are super-excited to be taking part."
Guy chose to perform an acoustic rendition of Tonight Again, saying he wanted to save the full show for Saturday.
French contestant Lisa Angell was up next, with one of the few Eurovision entries this year not to be sung in English, N'oubliez Pas (that's "Don't Forget" to me and you).
So does she want to win? "If I want something, I want something," she said. "If I want bread, I want bread, if I want cheese, I want cheese, so if I want to win, I want to win." Er, ok.
It was soon time for the Brits to cheer as Electro Velvet - Alex Larke and Bianca Nicholas - arrived, complete with the obligatory apology from Alex for "bringing the weather with us".
With the rain now streaming down, the lyrics "Don't go out in the pouring rain / You might get wet, I'd be upset" seemed just a little ironic.
For some reason, Germany's Ann Sophie wasn't present so we had to make do with the video that accompanies her track, Black Smoke.
Italy and Spain rounded off the evening, with Italian trio Il Volo belting out their Il Divo-esque Grand Amore. It got the biggest ovation of the night and many here believe it's a serious contender for the Eurovision crown.
Spain's Edurne then belted out her gutsy number Amanecer as the rain finally cleared up and the crowds began to disperse.
So I've made it into the frankly massive Eurovision press centre - 800 square metres with 800 separate work spaces.
A dress rehearsal for tomorrow night's second semi-final is just about to begin. Nerves are jangling, as the elimination of PKN at last night's show proved no-one is safe.
The rehearsal is being beamed across the press centre on giant screens but, sadly, I'm not allowed to give you any updates - none of the rehearsals can be reported on.
Meanwhile, Vienna itself has gone Eurovision crazy. The city's Madame Tussaud's now has a wax figure of last year's winner, Conchita Wurst, and there's even a display in the Leopold Museum titled Nul-Pointers.
The exhibition contains - you guessed it - a portrait of each of the 34 Eurovision participants whose performances did not earn them a single point. According to the museum, "they represent icons of failure".
Talk about a back-handed compliment.
Earlier, I spotted my first gay-themed pedestrian traffic light (see above). They were due to be removed in June but Maria Vassilakou, in charge of traffic issues in the local council, has said they will now remain.
Right, it's time for me to hop off to the Euro Village to see the "Big Five" performing. I'll report back later.
Malta's enigmatic singer Amber has been spreading the Eurovision message of peace and equality ahead of her performance at the second semi-final on Thursday.
Yesterday, she was seen sporting a "Yes" badge when she met Ireland's Molly Sterling in Vienna, to show her support for the marriage equality referendum - which takes place on Friday in Ireland. It's the world's first referendum on same sex marriage and is, of course, being closely followed by the many gay fans of Eurovision.
Earlier today, Amber was spotted at Vienna's Learning Cafe, a free service for kids and teenagers from refugee families.
Amber plans to become a primary school teacher after Eurovision, so at least she has something to fall back on should her song, Warrior, not make it through to the grand final.
Press accreditation sorted, with much excitement surrounding the goody bags handed out to journalists - salami, sausages, you name it. Shame I'm vegetarian. Still, the chocolate and random shoe polish makes up for it.
I've not even left the airport lounge yet and the first big shock of Eurovision 2015 has happened without me. PKN, Finland's hotly tipped and much-hyped punk outfit, failed to make it through the first semi-final last night.
Shame - their song made a change from the plethora of power ballads on offer this year (even if it wasn't that easy on the ear).
The Netherlands may be four-times Eurovision winners, having last won in 1975, but any hopes of adding to that tally were also dashed on Tuesday night when they fell at the first hurdle.
Four other contenders will also be going home disappointed - Moldova, FYR Macedonia, Belarus and Denmark.
But it's not all bad news - Moldova's early exit means Eduard Romanyuta can go back to his PhD thesis on Ukranian tax policy. I kid you not.
Here are the 10 countries that did make the grade:
See you in Vienna!
And we're offâ€¦ 16 countries will go head-to-head at the first Eurovision semi-final tonight live from Vienna, with 10 lucky acts going through to Saturday's grand final.
Among those could be Finland's punk rock outfit PKN, Russia's Polina Gagarina - with a song about unity, fairness and equality - and Estonia's ones to watch, duo Elina and Stig.
This year's competition has a lot to live up to after Conchita Wurst stormed to glory in 2014 in Copenhagen.  The self-styled "bearded lady" will Rise Like a Phoenix once more to host this year's green room in both the semis and the final itself.
And never fear, the UK's entry, Electro Velvet, has a guaranteed slot on the stage this Saturday. As one of the "Big Five" which contribute the most money to the European Broadcasting Union - along with Italy, Spain, France and Germany - the UK goes through automatically. Phew.
As last year's winner, Austria also gets a bye into the final as does this year's surprise package, Australia, which has been invited to take part to celebrate the song contest's 60th anniversary.
You can watch both semi-finals (the second takes place on Thursday) on BBC Three at 20:00 BST tonight and on Thursday.
