Luke George restored parity five minutes into the second half, before Tom Shaw side-footed Chester into the lead in the 58th minute.
With the clock winding down, Johnny Hunt saw red for saving a goal-bound effort on the line in the 84th minute and Corey Whitely made no mistake with the penalty, before Maguire-Drew clinched it in stoppage time to move Dagenham up to second.
