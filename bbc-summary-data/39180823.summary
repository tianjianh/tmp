Theresa May told the Sheffield Star last month's investment announcements by Boeing and McLaren were a "spectacular success" for the region.
Both firms have announced facilities at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre between Rotherham and Sheffield.
Mrs May said she wants the model being pioneered in South Yorkshire to be copied across the country.
She told The Star: "Attracting one of the world's most famous car brands and one of the leading names in aerospace to Sheffield were deals built on the city pooling its skills and working together.
"I want to see the prosperity that areas like London and the South East have enjoyed replicated across the country.
"That means developing and supporting key sectors to inspire an economic revival in places like South Yorkshire, and all our great regions and cities."
The Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) at Catcliffe, on the Sheffield-Rotherham border, was founded by the University of Sheffield and Boeing in 2001 on the site of the old Orgreave coking plant.
It is a centre for collaborative research and now houses a nuclear research facility and a Rolls Royce jet engine factory.
Sheffield tech firm The Floow has also recently announced a £13 million investment package there.
In February McLaren announced plans for a £50m supercar chassis factory on the site, creating 200 jobs.
Soon after, Boeing announced a £20m, 2,300 sq m plant - its first European commercial factory - alongside the AMRC to manufacture hi-tech parts for aircraft wings.
Boeing also plans a major research and development programme to develop new manufacturing techniques.
