Isaac Cumberlidge, from Castle Primary School in Mow Cop, Staffordshire, also scored 100% in a Sats maths paper.
The number-crunching prodigy "has the ability to understand complex ideas far beyond his years", his head teacher Jill Mason said.
Isaac's mother, Gail Cumberlidge, said the family were "delighted with his achievement".
Calculating he might be able to streak ahead of his age group, Issac joined weekly maths masterclasses at Congleton High School two years ago.
He also received one-to-one support from the senior school.
The modest maths-master said: "The teachers have been fantastic at both schools and I am looking forward to the next challenge."
Ms Mason revealed Isaac "enjoys the challenge of solving number problems".
She said: "Although we are not surprised by his fantastic performance in the exam, as we knew he would do really well, we are still extremely proud of him and his personal triumph."
His beaming mum added that, although "naturally talented," Isaac had "worked extremely hard this year".
