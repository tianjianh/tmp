Shaun Whiter was helping friend Joey Abbs change a tyre near Newmarket, Suffolk, when the pair were struck by a vehicle.
Jan Adamec, 40, of Haverhill, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He is on remand and will be sentenced in September.
Mr Whiter, 27, said: "Without a doubt it's good to know that the guy is off the streets."
