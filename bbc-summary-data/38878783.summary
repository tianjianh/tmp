[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Heroic tales of holidaymakers protecting loved ones and attempts to save lives have emerged from the inquest into the deaths of 30 British people killed in the Tunisia beach attack.

Gunman Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire indiscriminately at tourists on sunloungers on the beach at the five-star Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba in Sousse on 26 June 2015.
These are their stories.
Teenager Owen Richards tried to shield his grandfather during the Tunisia terror attack in which his brother and uncle were also killed.
Mr Richards, who was 16 at the time, was helping Charles Patrick Evans, 78, try to escape as gunman Seifeddine Rezgui hunted for victims at the beach hotel.
Mr Evans, his son Adrian Evans, 49, and Owen's brother Joel Richards, 19, were all shot dead at the Sousse beach resort.
The West Midlands family were enjoying the first day of their "jolly boys' outing", inspired by their favourite TV programme "Only Fools and Horses", when they heard gunshots from the direction of the beach.
They fled into the indoor pool area and as Rezgui approached, Mr Evans - known to his family as Pat - fell to the floor.
"I was hugging granddad on the floor and then I could see out of my right-hand corner my brother and seeing him dive to the floor," Mr Richards said.
"He lifted the gun up and I closed my eyes, then I heard a bunch of shots."
The four relatives had booked the holiday to celebrate Owen finishing his GCSE exams, his mother Suzanne Richards said.
Adrian Evans worked for Sandwell Council in Oldbury as a manager in the gas services department and Joel was a student at the University of Worcester and a keen football referee.
Mrs Richards said: "We take comfort that they stayed together in their last moments - protecting each other."
Liam Moore battled to save the life of his fiancee Carly Lovett during the attack, the inquest heard.
The couple ran from the beach into the hotel after hearing gunshots, and were hiding in a staff area. Mr Moore said: "We were standing close to each other, just hugging each other and holding each other's hands.
"Carly was saying that she was scared and I said I was too, but that we would get out of there."
The 24-year-old beauty blogger was then injured in an explosion.
"She said that shecouldn't move her legs and that shewas blacking out and she told me that she loved me and I told her that I loved her too," Mr Moore said.
He began CPR on her when she stopped responding.
Ms Lovett, from Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, had recently got engaged to Mr Moore, her childhood sweetheart of 10 years. This was the first couple's holiday together.
Her family described her as "a kind,caring, intelligent,beautifulwoman with a wicked sense of humour".
Cheryl Mellor said her "hero" husband Stephen, 59, sacrificed his life to protect her during the attack.
She told the inquest that her husband of 10 years climbed on top of her as they lay on the beach in between their sun beds when the gunman shot at them.
In her statement, read out at London's Royal Courts of Justice, Mrs Mellor said: "I am only here today due to the bravery of my husband, Steve.
"We were being shot and he protected me. Steve stayed and saved me. He sacrificed himself. Steve is a hero to me."
Yorkshire-born Mr Mellor, a father of three from Bodmin, Cornwall, died after being shot in the chest and abdomen.
Mrs Mellor, who was shot in the leg and wrist, suffered life-changing injuries.
Mr Mellor did not live to see the birth of his third grandchild, a boy called Thomas Stephen, who was named after him.
Sports fan Mr Mellor had a "huge interest" in golf and was "so wellâ€
