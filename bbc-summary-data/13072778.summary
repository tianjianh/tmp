Radio is the most popular medium. State broadcaster Radiodiffusion Television du Burkina (RTB) competes with dozens of private and community radio stations.
Foreign stations such as the BBC, Voice of America and Radio France Internationale also broadcast freely.
There are a handful of private TV stations and many private publications.
The Ministry of Communication and Culture regulates the media. Reporters Without Borders says the written press is "relatively free" and criticism is tolerated.
Many media outlets, particularly private ones, are often critical of the government, although some also practise self-censorship.
Some journalists are reported to have been threatened or arrested. Inquiries into the 1998 killing of the well-known and respected newspaper journalist Norbert Zongo have yet to bring to book those responsible.
Only 4.4% of the country's population have access to the internet, and most of them access it through a mobile device. Broadband subscription costs more than the average yearly income.
