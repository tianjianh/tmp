[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 500kg (1,100lb) device was found on the seabed in Portsmouth Harbour by a barge carrying out dredging works.
The Gunwharf Quays retail complex said it had been ordered to evacuate the area by 23:30 BST so the German device can be safely dealt with.
The Royal Navy said the bomb would be towed out to sea overnight and blown up during daylight hours early on Friday.
