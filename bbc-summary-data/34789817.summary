A pair of white boots worn by Elvis Presley during arguably his most famous TV performance have been bought by a UK collector for £29,500.

The King wore the size-11 Verde boots while singing If I Can Dream during his '68 Comeback Special, broadcast on NBC.
Elvis recorded the song two months after the assassination of Martin Luther King and the lyrics include quotes from the civil rights leader.
The boots went under the hammer at Henry Aldridge auctioneers in Devizes.
Elvis wore a black leather outfit for most of the famous performance before changing into a white suit and shoes for the finale.
Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said Elvis had recorded the song "in several incredibly passionate takes".
He said: "To show producer Steve Binder his performance was so staggering it seemed almost like a religious experience.
"Out on the floor with a hand mic, Elvis fell to his knees. For a moment, it appeared like he was back in church, singing the gospel songs of his youth.
"These boots represent a tangible link to this truly iconic moment in showbusiness history.
"If I Can Dream was the closing number of one of the greatest moments in entertainment history and is regarded by Elvis collectors as one of the 'Holy Grails'."
The boots were sold along with a handwritten letter from stage director Charlie Hodge, who appeared with Elvis on the NBC show.
Mr Hodge wrote in his letter: "These white Verde brand boots are the boots that Elvis wore on stage on his 1968 NBC TV special.
"He wore these in the closing number of the show, If I Can Dream, while he was wearing a white suit. Elvis later gave me these boots."
