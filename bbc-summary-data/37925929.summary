Scottish Borders traffic warden return 'unnecessary'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A study of the possibility of a council introducing its own traffic wardens has concluded the costs would be "prohibitive".

The local authority in the Borders has also been told it would probably be "disproportionate" and "unnecessary".
Police Scotland withdrew its service across most of the country in 2014.
It has prompted claims in the Borders of a "marked increase" in parking problems but it now looks unlikely that will see a return of wardens.
The introduction of Decriminalised Parking Enforcement (DPE) in the region has been debated for some time.
A survey found that the public perception that parking problems were common had heightened in recent years.
However, it would cost the council about Â£200,000 to set up DPE and would initially run at a loss of about Â£15,000-a-year.
A report said that one option for funding could be via existing off-street pay and display parking which runs at a surplus of about Â£36,000 per annum.
The study warned that if DPE proved successful its losses could actually increase due to a reduction in income.
It concluded that it would not be the best way forward at the moment.
Instead, it suggested that increased enforcement from Police Scotland should be sought in "hot spots" like Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk.
An inspection of signage and an investigation of the costs of a disc-based parking system are also being considered.
