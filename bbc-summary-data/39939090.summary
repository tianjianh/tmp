New Widnes loan signing Rangi Chase has a "clean slate" start at the Vikings, says head coach Denis Betts

The 31-year-old half-back joined Widnes until the end of the season after being told he did not feature in Tigers' plans for the rest of 2017.
The former England playmaker was dropped at Cas for three games in March after an "internal investigation".
Chase has swapped table toppers Castleford for bottom-of-the-table Widnes, who have won twice in 13 games.
"It is a great signing for us and I'm excited we've managed to pick up someone of Rangi's quality to come into the side," Betts told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"I know he's excited about playing as he wants to be playing regularly - he wants to start games and play 80 minutes.
"He comes here, he's got a clean slate and he wants to go again.
"He's up for the challenge as he knows we've got our backs against the wall, he knows the situation and he's been told that. He's up for the fight which was really exciting."
