Ex-Newcastle boss Alan Pardew says the direction the club took during his time in charge "was wrong" and owner Mike Ashley has now "learned some lessons".

Pardew spent four turbulent years at Newcastle before resigning to join Crystal Palace in early 2015.
Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League at the end of 2015-16.
"I kept nagging [Ashley], kept telling him I thought the process was wrong. I made that very clear behind closed doors," Pardew told the BBC.
In a wide-ranging interview with Gary Lineker for The Premier League Show, Pardew also:
Pardew guided Newcastle to fifth in the Premier League in 2011-12, but his relationship with the club's supporters deteriorated as results fell away.
And the 55-year-old claimed the Newcastle board put financial concerns ahead of recruiting the right players.
"At times I had a very unbalanced team, very unbalanced squad," he said. "It's very difficult to pick up results when you don't think the players that are being signed for you fit what you want.
"That makes it frustrating a little bit, and I was a bit frustrated at Newcastle. The financial element came first, then the technical side of it.
"But the vision of the manager and how he wants to take the team forward, that must come first.
"I like to think they've learned some lessons. I think Mike, at Sports Direct, has learned some lessons - I think he'd be the first to say that - and he's had to learn lessons on the football side," added Pardew, referring to the recent spotlight on the sportswear firm's working practices.
As one of only four Englishmen managing in the Premier League, Pardew was among the bookmakers' favourites for the England job when it became available after Roy Hodgson's exit in the summer - and again when Sam Allardyce unexpectedly left just 67 days after taking over.
But while he refused to rule out taking the job if it was offered, he believes for now the best solution is to stick with interim boss Gareth Southgate.
"I think this England thing is becoming a bit of a problem for the manager," he said. "It might be a good time to let Gareth have it. I know him very well and he has the attributes to do it.
"I've never been offered the job. If I'm offered the jobâ€¦ I'm English, would I turn it down? I don't know.
"I think I've got the experience to do it. I think I can do it one day. I don't know if this is the time.
"I've just got to hope that at some point we get it right."
Pardew admitted that he was envious of managers given a chance at the very biggest clubs in the Premier League - but said the elite names now gracing the English game deserved their status.
"You earn the right to get in that position and I respect that. The Klopps, the Guardiolas, the Mourinhos - they've earned the right to be at those football clubs. Maybe I haven't," he said.
"But, of course, there is another side to football management and getting the best out of the group you've got - that's all I can focus on.
"It's been a long road for me to get to this level and I'm very proud to be here.
"I do enjoy going up against them [the elite managers] - I've beat a few of them - and I've seen a lot of them come and go already, supposedly very good managers."
