Henrik Stenson: 10 majors may match Zlatan Ibrahimovic in Sweden

Open champion Henrik Stenson says he may need nine more majors before he can be compared to another Swedish sporting legend - footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

Stenson won his first major on Sunday with a record-low total at Royal Troon.
Compatriot Ibrahimovic, 34, is one of sport's most iconic figures and has won trophies in Spain, Italy and France.
"I think I said I needed to win 10 majors to get up to his recognition," said Stenson, 40. "Maybe five will do it. We'll see! One at a time."
Ibrahimovic recently signed for Manchester United after scoring 50 goals in 51 matches for French champions Paris St-Germain last season.
He also won 12 trophies in four seasons with the French club.
Stenson has little time to savour his Open win given the fourth major of the year, the USPGA Championship, starts at Baltusrol on 28 July.
"This is huge back home and it has been quite chaotic with all the media, but it's all good and I'm just going to try to recharge," he said.
The world's top four players - Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson - have all withdrawn from next month's Rio Olympics.
They have cited concerns over the Zika virus, which has been linked to defects in newborn babies and also found to cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that leads to temporary paralysis in adults.
Stenson, now fifth in the world rankings, said he is looking forward to competing in Rio in what is golf's first appearance at the Olympics for 112 years.
"I'm a huge sporting fan in general and to see an Olympic Games from the inside and participate is going to be huge," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"If I can do myself and my country proud by bringing home a medal, that would be awesome. I've got a Claret Jug now and any Olympic medal would be quite nice to put next to it in the trophy cabinet."

Stenson birdied four of his final five holes at Royal Troon and had 10 in total in a round of 63 to finish three shots clear of American Phil Mickelson.
"I was so zoned in the last five holes I didn't know how many birdies I had made in that round," said Stenson.
"I was so focused on getting the job done, it was not until I had that birdie putt at the last that I could let go and realise I've done the achievement of my career.
"It was just an added bonus for that putt to drop and set a new Open record, but it was all about bringing that Claret Jug home to Sweden and be the first Swedish male to win a major championship.
"It's huge and it's going to get better and better with time I'm sure."
