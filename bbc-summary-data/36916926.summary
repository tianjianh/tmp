Plans to connect Denbighshire wind farm to grid approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build a 10-mile overhead cable to connect Denbighshire wind farms to the electricity grid have been approved by the UK government.

Pylons will run the cable between Clocaenog Forest and a sub-station in St Asaph.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy gave Scottish Power Manweb the go-ahead after a six-month consultation.
Residents had fought the plan, claiming it would spoil the landscape.
A series of 15m (49ft) high wooden pylons will be constructed to carry the 132kv electric line.
RWE Innogy has already been granted permission to build a wind farm in Clocaenog and work could start as early as 2017.
Dewi Parry, deputy chair of the Pylon The Pressure group which campaigned against the overhead cable, said it was considering launching a judicial review.
"We are seeking legal advice as to the merits of the case," he said.
"We accept the need for a connection between the wind farm and the main grid but we feel this connection should be underground and not across the landscape."
