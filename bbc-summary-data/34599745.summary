The internet trading platform said revenue fell by 2.4% to $2.1bn (Â£1.36bn) from $2.15bn last year.
EBay makes 50% of its profits outside the US, and the company points out if changes to the level of exchange rates are stripped out, volume was up 6%.
Net income fell to $539m from $673m a year earlier.
Ebay celebrated 20 years in business this year. It split its PayPal business into a separate company in July.
The company, which has 159 million active buyers, said its classifieds and StubHub ticket re-sale businesses had both had strong quarters and remained key company assets.
The results sent shares in eBay up almost 9% in after hours' trading.
EBay's president and chief executive, Devin Wenig, said: "We... marked eBay's 20th anniversary and made progress on executing our strategy to reposition the company to deliver stable and profitable long-term growth."
