[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 2-1 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln scored twice in the final five minutes to secure a 2-1 win against relegation-threatened Torquay and move five points clear at the top of the National League table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gulls thought they had clinched the points 12 minutes from time when Jamie Reid's cross was bundled in at the far post by Ruari Keating.
However, the Imps equalised in the 86th minute when a shot from Adam Marriott was parried by Brendan Moore only for substitute Harry Anderson to score from the rebound.
The home side then secured their fifth successive victory two minutes later when Sam Habergham fired a free-kick into the top corner.
Lincoln dominated the first half and Gulls keeper Brendan Moore had to be on his toes twice to deny Jack Muldoon, although at the other end Paul Farman made a brilliant save to keep out a corner at the near post.
