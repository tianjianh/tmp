The Golden State Warriors missed their chance to break the 44-year-old record of 33 consecutive regular season NBA victories after they suffered their first defeat of the season.

Their run of 28 wins in a row was ended by Milwaukee Bucks, who won 108-95.
The Los Angeles Lakers hold the record for the longest run of successive wins, set in the 1971-72 season.
"Losing sucks even if you are 24-1," said Warriors interim head coach Luke Walton.
