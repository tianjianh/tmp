Perseid meteor shower to be visible over Northern Ireland

If you've ever wanted to catch a glimpse of a shooting star or two, Wednesday night could be your perfect chance.

The Perseid meteor shower appears in our skies every August, but is expected to peak overnight.
For the first time since 2007, the shower will coincide with a new moon - making viewing conditions particularly favourable, weather permitting.
The peak time is expected to be between 23:00 BST and 04:00 BST.
The best places to see the meteors in Northern Ireland are expected to be counties Down, Armagh and Fermanagh, as well as south Antrim.
Andy McCrea, of the Irish Astronomical Association, explained what people could hope to see.
"They can expect to see what are called shooting stars. Shooting stars are not really stars at all, in fact they're little grains of dust that hit the atmosphere at very high speeds, so they vaporise and they leave a trail.
"Those meteors are called the Perseid meteors, so you should expect to see a meteor roughly every 10 minutes if you live in a built-up area.
"If you can get away to a nice dark site, you should see one every minute."
The Perseids are pieces of Comet Swift-Tuttle; each August, the Earth passes through a cloud of the comet's debris.
"Last year conditions were similar to this year and I was able to see five or six," Mr McCrea said.
"The benefit this year is we don't have a full moon or anything like that, so the moon's out of the way and that allows the sky to be darker and we stand a better chance of seeing meteors.
"They're best seen in the wee small hours, so if it's dark, if it's clear, put it off until as late as you possibly can and you stand a better chance of seeing the meteors."
BBC Northern Ireland weather presenter Cecilia Daly said that cloudy skies over Northern Ireland on Tuesday night stopped most people from seeing the meteors.
"This coming night, skies will be clearer across the island and this coincides with peak shower activity," she said.
"It is difficult to say when the best of the clear skies will be, but southern and eastern counties stand the best chance of catching sight of the dazzling show. Prime viewing is after 11pm, so keep scanning the skies for cloud breaks."
Astronomy Ireland is urging people to count the number of meteors they see every 15 minutes and send the results to its website.
"This will help us tell if the shower is getting weaker or stronger as the years pass," said David Moore, editor of Astronomy Ireland's magazine where the counts will be published.
An added bonus for sky watchers is that Saturn is also currently visible above Northern Ireland.
"It'll be visible as a fairly bright star, but low down in the sky in the south-western part of the sky - it's been there for most of the summer months," Mr McCrea said.
"Through a telescope Saturn's spectacular, but you'll see it with the naked eye tonight."
