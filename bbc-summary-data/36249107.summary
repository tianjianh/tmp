Dilapidated beach huts in Lincolnshire are to get a £50,000 makeover in an attempt to attract more holidaymakers.

The row of huts on Mablethorpe promenade will be "rejuvenated and enhanced" with the money.
Fourteen other coastal landmarks in England will benefit from a share of £700,000 from the Coastal Revival Fund.
Communities Minister Mark Francois said: "We've got heritage hooks to be proud of, but some of these places need some tender loving care."
He said: "This country has sightseeing gems that are a match for anywhere in the world and I'd urge people to take a trip down to the seaside to discover them."
The beach huts have been at Mablethorpe and Sutton-on-Sea for more than 70 years.
Grants of up to £50,000 will be awarded to landmarks from Durham in the North East to Dorset in the South West.
A disused lido in Morecambe, Lancashire, will become a venue for festivals, arts and leisure, while Herne Bay Pier in Kent will be given a "sturdy stage" with lighting, changing room and screen.
Ilfracombe Museum in Devon will receive £50,000 to "protect and preserve its unique collection of Victorian curiosities right on the seafront".
A full list of the projects can be seen here.
In March, £800,000 was also announced for seaside communities in the South West from the Coastal Communities Fund.
Mr Francois said he hoped the work would encourage "a wave of enthusiasm" for seaside trips, and help boost the £4bn already generated each year by tourism to coastal communities.
