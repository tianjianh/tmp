Rare 18th century Pembrokeshire cottage to be restored

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the last unaltered examples of a classic Pembrokeshire cottage is to be restored by the National Trust.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grade II-listed "two up two down" home near St Davids, which dates back to the 1700s, was left to the charity by its late owner Glyn Griffiths.
The cottage needs "substantial" repair work and Mr Griffiths left it with the wish that it would be restored and its character preserved.
Once renovated it will be let as a holiday cottage.
The coastal home is a traditional lime-washed house with outbuildings, and was lived-in by Mr Griffiths since childhood.
It has been unaltered since it was built and its photo has featured in several publications celebrating the special character of the Pembrokeshire landscape.
Jonathan Hughes, the National Trust's general manager for Pembrokeshire, said: "We're delighted that Mr Griffiths has chosen the National Trust to safeguard his cottage and we know it holds a special place in the hearts of many people.
"The restoration work planned will preserve the layout as far as possible to provide simple accommodation, whilst retaining the spirit and charm of the traditional Pembrokeshire cottage."
Renovation work will be funded by the National Trust's Neptune Coastline Campaign, set up to protect coastal heritage.
Visitors will be able to view the repair work at a series of open days and people will eventually be available to rent it for short stays.
