The 36-year-old was taken to a London hospital in a critical condition at about 03:45 after he became unwell at an address in Carshalton Road, Mitcham.
He died in hospital shortly after 07:00 GMT and his next of kin have been informed.
A police spokesperson said they were treating the death as "unexplained" and enquiries at the home were ongoing.
It is not believed that any other person was involved.
The spokesperson added that there was "no evidence to suggest that the incident is linked to extremism or terrorism".
Surrounding roads were closed as emergency services including fire engines carrying specialist chemical detection equipment attended the scene.
However, these have since reopened.
