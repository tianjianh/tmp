[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Borders councillors cleared of code breach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Borders councillors have been cleared of breaching their code of conduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leader David Parker and Alec Nicol, who chairs the petitions and deputations committee, were the subject of a formal complaint.
The Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in Scotland investigated the allegations.
He has now concluded that the actions of both councillors did not amount to a breach of the code of conduct.
The complaint was lodged by Brian McCrow after a meeting of the council's petitions and deputations committee in October last year to discuss a permanent home for the Great Tapestry of Scotland in the Borders.
He alleged Mr Parker had breached the code by failing to treat him with respect.
Mr McCrow also claimed that Mr Nicol had failed to declare an interest.
Both councillors denied any wrongdoing.
Following a review of the allegations, the commissioner concluded that: "In all circumstances the matters raised did not amount to a breach of the code of conduct."
Mr Parker said: "I take the councillors' code of conduct very seriously and behaved entirely appropriately when considering the petition lodged by Mr McCrow.
"The petition was carefully considered and all those involved were treated with courtesy and respect and I am pleased that this matter is closed with the very clear conclusion that I had no case to answer."
Mr Nicol said he worked "very hard" to ensure everyone involved in the petitions and deputations committee was treated "fairly and with respect".
"I am delighted that the commissioner has found no substance to these allegations and concluded that I behaved entirely appropriately in my role as chairman," he added.
