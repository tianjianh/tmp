Michael Gilbert, 26, and Robert Gregg, 38, both of Galashiels, are accused of assaulting a man to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
It follows an early morning incident in Langlee - the largest housing estate in Galashiels - on Saturday.
Both men made no plea or declaration at Selkirk Sheriff Court and their cases were continued for further examination.
Mr Gregg also faces a charge of being in possession of a bladed item in a public place.
The men were remanded in custody by Sheriff Peter Paterson and are expected to appear in court again next Tuesday.
