He struck twice as the Bluebirds rose to seventh in their 4-1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.
The 31-year-old former Aston Villa player has moved from central midfield to a wider role this season.
"I'm roaming it, in and out of positions trying to get in pockets," said Whittingham.
"And when you've got people like Rallsy (Joe Ralls) and Stuart O'Keefe finding you with the ball, it's always going to be fun.
"The last couple of years it's been a case of playing in front of the back four and trying to dictate play and trying to get Cardiff as a whole playing.
"It was always going to come to a halt at some stage, but I'm playing on the left now."
Whittingham helped the Bluebirds reach the Premier League in 2013-14 and hopes to help them reach the top flight again.
He says last Saturday's win will have impressed all their Championship rivals.
"The whole league will look at it and think 'wow, that was a huge statement by Cardiff," said Whittingham.
Cardiff now hope to underline their promotion ambitions at third-placed Middlesbrough on Tuesday.
"They're a good team," added Whittingham. "They seem to pass the ball around well.
"It's a game we've got to look forward to, these big games now, the games you have to be winning and that's what we'll go out to do.
"We're close to the play-offs and have a couple of big games coming up.
"We have to take it as it comes and try to steal some wins."
