The artwork, called Equanimity, was produced by artist Chris Levine to mark 800 years of the island's allegiance to the Crown.
The original has already been on show at the gallery as part of a tour.
Chief Minister Senator Ian Gorst will present the copy on behalf of the island to mark the Diamond Jubilee.
The work that will be given to the National Portrait Gallery is a new, more technically refined version of the original piece.
It was the product of two sittings with the monarch where more than 10,000 individual photographs were made using a tracking camera.
Senator Gorst, who is hosting an official reception in London on 21 May, said: "Equanimity is a remarkable portrait and a fitting tribute to Jersey's long-standing allegiance to the Crown."
The work will also appear on a Â£100 note and holographic stamp to mark the Jubilee.
