[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of Bushmills distillery in County Antrim has lodged plans for a £30m expansion of the facility.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2014, the whiskey brand was bought by Mexican headquartered firm, Jose Cuervo.
It has now filed a planning application for a new distillery facility which it says will "effectively double production capacity."
The expansion should lead to the creation of up to 20 jobs.
The distillery currently employs around 150 full-time and agency staff.
The plan adds that there will also be around £3m of capital expenditure at the facility every year for the next 10 -15 years.
The application also discloses details of a new tourism and visitor centre at the distillery.
It says these are at an early stage, but are aimed at producing a "world class" facility.
The application will be considered by the planning committee of Causeway Coast and Glens Council.
Bushmills Distillery claims to be the oldest licensed distillery in the world.
Distillation has taken place there since at least the 17th century.
Jose Cuervo is owned by the Mexico-based Beckmann family. Their distribution firm, Proximo, controls a number of premium whiskey and rum brands.
