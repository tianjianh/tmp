[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dinner on 26 May is thought to be one of his first major addresses since his term as president came to an end.
The event at the EICC is being organised by The Hunter Foundation.
It is being supported by Royal Bank of Scotland and is fully booked.
Mr Obama will also answer questions from the audience at the event, which is being held to raise money for charity.
The foundation was set up by leading businessman and philanthropist Sir Tom Hunter.
All of the cash raised will be split between children's charities in Scotland and the Obama Foundation, set up by the former president and his wife Michelle.
Sir Tom also plans to set aside some seats at the event for local young people.
He said: "Demand for this dinner has been unparalleled in our own experience and we can only apologise to those who we cannot accommodate at the dinner."
