Nottingham ganglord Colin Gunn loses human rights case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A notorious Nottingham crime boss has failed to persuade High Court judges that being moved to a higher security prison breached his human rights.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Gunn was jailed for life for planning the 2004 murder of John and Joan Stirland in Lincolnshire.
He claimed his rights were violated when he was moved to a "prison within a prison" at HMP Belmarsh, amid fears he was mounting an escape bid.
Mr Justice Bean ruled it was a "reasonable" decision at the time.
Gunn, 47, made millions as the gangland ruler of the Bestwood estate in Nottingham until he was jailed for conspiracy to murder in 2006.
The Stirlands were found shot dead at their bungalow in Trusthorpe in a revenge killing after Mrs Stirland's son killed an associate of the Gunn family.
In May 2013, he was transferred from HMP Frankland in County Durham to what was described by a national newspaper as a "Silence of the Lambs"-style cell.
The court heard Gunn had arranged for an inmate to pass a note to a prison officer on which was written the address of the officer's disabled brother, telling him, "Well, you now work for me and Colin Gunn".
Gunn's barrister, Philip Rule, argued that the four months in top security unlawfully interfered with his ability to receive visitors and therefore his right to respect for private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights.
The judge said that "it was a reasonable decision at the time", and ordered Gunn to pay Â£1,000 towards the government's legal costs.
