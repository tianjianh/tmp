[SN]TITLE[SN]
Daniel Pelka death: Doctor 'lacked urgency'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A GP should have been "more proactive" after concerns were raised about a four-year-old boy a month before he was killed, a disciplinary panel has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Pelka was starved and beaten for months before he died in March 2012 at his Coventry home.
His mother Magdelena Luczak and her partner Mariusz Krezolek were jailed for a minimum of 30 years in 2013.
Dr Mohammad Pathan, accused of failing to intervene, denies his fitness to practise is impaired.
A Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) panel heard Daniel's deputy head teacher made the "unusual step" of calling Dr Pathan as she was worried about his condition.
Gillian Mulhall told the GP about his weight loss, that he had been stealing food and that he was soiling himself at home, the panel was told.
At the time of his death the schoolboy weighed just over a stone-and-a-half (10kg).
The General Medical Council (GMC), which brought the fitness to practise hearing, said Dr Pathan had advised Mrs Mulhall to ask Daniel's mother to make an appointment, which was never booked.
The GMC said the GP's actions "did not reflect an urgency" to examine Daniel, despite his mother's documented history of depression, misuse of alcohol in the home and records showing Daniel would have been exposed to domestic violence.
Kevin Slack, representing the GMC, said."Had he [Dr Pathan] taken these into account, it is the GMC's case that the doctor should have acted much more proactively and should have arranged to see him in 24-48 hours."
Dr Leonard Peter, an expert witness for the GMC, said Dr Pathan "should have realised that the features added up to a child who was at significant risk".
Dr Pathan said he did not look at the boy's mother's records because he did not suspect neglect or abuse and maintains he had no reason to do so.
The GMC said Dr Pathan's actions did not cause Daniel's death, but "rather that his sad death forms part of a background to alleged failings in this case".
A serious case review in September 2013 found a number of chances were missed to save Daniel and criticised a number of agencies involved.
Dr Pathan admits failing to record adequate details of the phone conversation and to formulate an action plan, but denies his fitness to practise is impaired.
The hearing continues.
