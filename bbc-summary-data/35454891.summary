The blaze engulfed some 3,000 sq metres (33,000 sq ft) of the building and took more than five hours to put out.
Russia's child rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov said the victims were migrant workers who had been living and working in the building.
Of the three children who died, one was a small baby, he said.
State investigators are looking into the cause of the blaze, which broke out on Saturday evening, and said arson has not been ruled out.
Some reports say the workers were from Central Asia.
