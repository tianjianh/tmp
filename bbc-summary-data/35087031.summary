The husband-and-wife pair beat South Korea's third seeds Ko Sung-hyun and Kim Ha-na 21-14 21-17 in the mixed doubles decider in Dubai.
The Britons played some smart rallies to take an early lead in the first game which they never let slip after that.
"This is a very big win for us," said Chris Adcock.
"The Koreans have been superb all year. We really wanted to try and put right what we didn't do against them in the past so to come through with the win is amazing."
The Britons had not beaten their Korean rivals in their three previous meetings but opened up a 12-6 lead in the first game before going six points up again later (18-12) and closing out the opener.
They went 12-8 ahead in the second game before their opponents made it 15-all.
But two winners from Chris gave the Britons the initiative again and they wrapped up victory in 37 minutes for their second Superseries title after success in Hong Kong in 2013.
