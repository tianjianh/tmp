Fresh Bovine TB cattle plans to be outlined in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Farms in parts of Wales where bovine TB is rife could face tougher restrictions under plans set to be outlined later.

The Welsh Government will announce a fresh approach to combat the disease in cattle after a public consultation.
Farmers had been asked to give their views on the idea of splitting the country into areas of low, intermediate and high risk, based on levels of TB.
Farming unions said Wales' TB restrictions were already among the strictest in the world.
They urged measures to tackle the infection in badgers but Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths has ruled out a widespread badger cull, like the one being carried out by the UK government in parts of England.
However, she said she was considering allowing badgers to be trapped, tested and humanely killed on farms with chronic TB problems.
Under the draft proposals, first unveiled in October:
In 2015-16, the Welsh Government spent Â£26.4m on tackling the disease, which included money from the EU.
It is an expensive, complicated problem that has plagued several different governments and ministers, as well as causing misery and financial ruin in rural Wales.
The number of cattle being slaughtered, particularly in west Wales, as a result of the disease has increased sharply in recent years, causing concern for farmers.
The Welsh Government has insisted this rise is due to its efforts to drive out the disease for good.
Latest figures suggest bovine TB is now at a 10 year low, with more than 95% of cattle herds in Wales currently free of the disease.
In May, the Welsh Assembly's Climate Change, Environment and Rural Affairs Committee called on ministers to set a national target date for the disease to be wiped out completely in Wales.
Farming leaders are worried ongoing issues with TB could affect any future trade deals to export Welsh beef after Brexit.
Stephen James, NFU Cymru president, said he wanted to see a "complete TB eradication programme that addresses not only the issues on farms but also in wildlife as well".
He said: "It's not fair that we as an industry keep getting more and more regulation and the wildlife part of it is overlooked."
Mr James added the Welsh Government had been "too slow to act" in parts of Wales where the disease is at its worse: "We've lost thousands of cattle as a result of it, and that's not fair on us."
Two years ago, a badger vaccination programme in north Pembrokeshire was put on hold following a global shortage of the TB jab.
There is no indication yet when or if that experiment will be able to resume.
Wildlife groups remain resolutely opposed to any badger culling, while some scientists point out that latest research suggests it could actually make the problem worse.
The environment secretary is set to announce her latest plans in the Senedd at about 16:30 BST.
