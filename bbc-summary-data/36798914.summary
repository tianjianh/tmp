[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder, 30, had an operation in the close season but the club said the injury was worse than anticipated.
Leadbitter made 41 league appearances for Middlesbrough last season as they won promotion from the Championship.
Left-back James Husband and defender Daniel Ayala are also injury worries for the club, with Husband waiting for an operation on a dislocated shoulder.
