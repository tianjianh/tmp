The 25-year-old has joined for the Segunda Division club after scoring 13 goals in 39 appearances last season at Tynecastle.
Head coach Robbie Neilson told the Hearts website: "Juanma has expressed a desire to play regular first-team football.
"So we decided a loan move would be the best solution for both parties."
Juanma had joined the Scottish Premiership outfit after leaving Greek Superleague club Kalloni last year.
"We have brought in a number of strikers over the course of the summer months, so needless to say there is a great deal of competition up front," added Neilson.
"Hopefully this will enable him to get plenty of game time under his belt over the course of the season."
