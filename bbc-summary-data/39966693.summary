Brendan Rodgers says it would be a "remarkable achievement" for Celtic to complete an unbeaten league season.

Rodgers' men thrashed Partick Thistle 5-0 on Thursday and must avoid defeat by Hearts on Sunday to finish their title-winning campaign without defeat.
"We matched 33 wins, which is the most wins in the history at Celtic," Rodgers told BBC Scotland.
"We go one behind in the record for goals. Now we're on to 104. So, we've got everything to play for."
Celtic are looking to become the first team to go a 38-game Scottish Premiership campaign unbeaten.
They have gone unbeaten in a season once before, in 1897-98, winning 15 of the 18 games played. Glasgow rivals Rangers followed suit a year later, winning all 18.
Leigh Griffiths, who would later appear to question being substituted, scored Celtic's opener at Firhill from the penalty spot after Patrick Roberts was fouled by Callum Booth.

Tom Rogic netted Celtic's second from a low Griffiths cross, and Roberts swept in their third before the break.
Strikes from outside the box by Callum McGregor and Roberts followed in the second half.
"It was a joy to watch the team," said Rodgers. "Five special goals and, fundamentally, the players worked very, very hard. It was an outstanding team performance.
"If you go 38 games of a season [unbeaten] with all the games we've had, the level of games, perform like we have done then it's a truly remarkable achievement relative to the time that we're playing in."
Asked if there was any chance of keeping Roberts, who is due to return to parent club Manchester City this summer, Rodgers replied: "I don't know. You have to respect he is a Manchester City player.
"The only thing I would ever say is if there ever is a possibility that he's going to leave Manchester City then of course Celtic would be certainly there to want to bring him here.
"I still think he's got a lot of development left in him. At 19 years of age, he still needs a lot of education, a lot of training. He's getting a wonderful education here with the club, the size of the club.
"He's a wonderful talent. He's very much a part of the team structure and that's great to see.
"When he has the ball, especially in the final third, he truly is a little magician. He was one of a number of outstanding team performers.
"He took his goals absolutely brilliantly. He's always a threat in the penalty box - gets the penalty and scores two other wonderful goals."
Partick Thistle boss Alan Archibald accepted his side had been outclassed and said of the gap between Celtic and the other top-flight clubs: "It's huge and you need to get everything right to get anything off them. The worry is the gulf could get bigger.
"They were miles ahead of us tonight and they have been all season and miles ahead of most of the league.
"We stood off them and I think Celtic could smell that fear in some of our individual battles and if you do that against a good side, they'll certainly hurt you and we gave them a gift with the opening goal, which didn't help."
