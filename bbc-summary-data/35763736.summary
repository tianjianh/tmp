[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' top doctor has urged people with symptoms of flu or norovirus to stay away from hospitals.

Hospitals across Wales have had to close a number of beds to prevent the spread of norovirus among vulnerable patients.
This means they cannot admit new patients quickly from A&E departments.
Wales' Chief Medical Officer, Dr Ruth Hussey, said the surge in cases followed the recent cold snap which increased demand.
"We are asking people not to visit friends or relatives in hospital if they have experienced any sickness or diarrhoea in the last 48 hours," she said.
"Norovirus is highly contagious and can spread rapidly, just like flu, and some hospital patients could be particularly vulnerable."
Emergency departments and the Welsh Ambulance Service continue to experience significant peaks in demand - attendances have peaked at 25% higher than the average daily number so far this year.
