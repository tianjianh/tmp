After the retirement of two partners at St Martin's practice in Knowle, the two remaining GPs said they were unable to manage the centre's 6,000 patients.
However, the practice will now be run by Concord Medical Centre in Little Stoke for an interim 12-month period.
NHS England said Concorde will take over services on 15 September.
Spokeswoman Linda Prosser said there would be "minimal impact on patients" when the change takes place.
"The practice has reassured NHS England that it has sufficient capacity to provide the temporary contract without any negative impact on its services for current patients," she said.
In July, the two remaining doctors at St Martin's, both of whom were working part-time told the NHS they were resigning.
One of those, Dr Holly Hardy, said they made a "difficult decision" to ensure "patient safety in the long term".
Of the takeover, Dr Hardy said the practice will "benefit from the support of a bigger organisation".
