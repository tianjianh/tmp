Sinn Fein's Máirtín Ó Muilleoir is the new Lord Mayor of Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Ó Muilleoir, a prominent businessman, has been a councillor for the Balmoral area of south Belfast since 2011.
He said: "I'm very privileged to be the new Lord Mayor of the great city of Belfast."
Alderman Christopher Stalford of the DUP was also elected as the deputy Lord Mayor at Monday's annual general meeting of Belfast City Council.
Mr Ó Muilleoir, 53, is the managing director of the Belfast Media Group and the publisher of the Irish Echo in New York.  He has stepped down from his business interests for the duration of his term as Lord Mayor.
He added: "I am picking up from Gavin Robinson of the DUP, who has had a great year in office.
"In the year ahead, I want the help of all our citizens to make Belfast better. My theme for my year in office will be 'Building the future Belfast - together'.
"First and foremost, that means building the peace and working hard to bring our sometimes divided people together. It also means striving to create jobs and doing all I can to help put the city's economy back on track.
"And of course in all our work we have to ensure that our working class communities enjoy a greater share of the peace dividend."
Mr Ó Muilleoir previously served on the council from 1987 to 1997, before quitting politics to go into business.
