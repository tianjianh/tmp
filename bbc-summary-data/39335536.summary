[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 1-2 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow kept their National League promotion hopes alive with their second away win inside four days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bluebirds climbed three places to sixth as goals from Richie Bennett and Jordan Williams sentenced poor Chester to a fifth straight home defeat.
Bennett latched onto a defence-splitting through ball to put the visitors ahead after just three minutes. And, but for two good saves by home keeper Alex Lynch, it could have been more.
Chester responded towards the end of the first half, as top scorer James Alabi and captain Tom Shaw both had shots blocked.
But, fresh from Saturday's 4-2 win at Solihull, Barrow continued to look the greater threat after the break. And they clinched all three points 14 minutes from time when Williams cut in from the left to fire a low shot which Lynch allowed to slip under his body.
Shaw pulled a goal back in the 88th minute but it was too little, too late.
Chester remain only eight points clear of danger ahead of Saturday's trip to 20th-placed Torquay, while Barrow next face a third successive away game at another struggling side Maidstone.
