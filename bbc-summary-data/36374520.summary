[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catalans Dragons comfortably beat Hull Kingston Rovers to keep apace with the Super League top four.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jodie Broughton and Todd Carney went over for Catalans before Lucas Albert extended their lead, but Kevin Larroyer scored against his former club.
Louis Anderson and Tony Gigot made it five first-half tries for the hosts, before Joe Wardill scored for Rovers.
Gigot scored his second Catalans try with 10 minutes to play, while Ken Sio ran in a late consolation score.
The result means Catalans move to third place in the Super League table, level on points with Wigan, Warrington and two points behind league leaders Hull FC.
Rovers, who were without Terry Campese, Thomas Minns, Ben Cockayne, Graeme Horne and the suspended Mitch Allgood, slipped to their 11th league defeat of the season and remain in 10th place.
The visitors faced an uphill battle going into the second half after a fine opening 40 minutes from Catalans gave them a 28-6 lead at the hooter.
In a quieter second period, 17-year-old Wardill went over for the visitors to make it 28-10 but they struggled to claw back the deficit.
