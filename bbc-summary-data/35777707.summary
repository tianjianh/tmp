[SN]TITLE[SN]
Air cadet gliding scrapped at St Athan and Swansea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Air cadet gliding is to be scrapped in Wales, the Minister for Reserves has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wales' two volunteer gliding squadrons (VGS) at MOD St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, and Swansea Airport are among 14 across the UK to be disbanded following a restructure.
Air cadets from Wales will now travel to England for glider activities.
Julian Brazier said the RAF remained committed to air cadet flying.
He said a reduced glider fleet would be operated by "significantly fewer but larger volunteer gliding squadrons".
In April 2014, all air cadet gliding was suspended following concerns over the airworthiness of the fleet.
Mr Brazier  announced the restructure, adding negotiations had "failed to find a value for money approach to successfully repair and recover all 146 gliders."
St Athan's 634 Volunteer Gliding Squadron, which was founded in 1955, posted on Facebook: "It is with our deepest regret that we have been made aware that as of today 634 VGS will be disbanded along with several other VGS nation wide.
"After a long association within Wales for many decades air cadet gliding will be no more."
