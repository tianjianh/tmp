[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mrs Claus job at Celtic Manor Resort less pay than Santa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A job for a Mrs Claus at Newport's Celtic Manor Resort has been advertised - for less pay than that of Father Christmas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Christmas recruitment vacancy showed Santa would earn Â£12-an-hour.
In comparison, the ad said his wife would be paid an hourly rate of just Â£6.70.
A Celtic Manor spokesman said the difference in pay was due to the fact they would perform "very different roles" at the Christmas Kingdom event.
Santa Claus would play the "lead role" as the "star attraction", the spokesman said, while Mrs Claus had "more of a supporting role".
"The difference in pay reflects only the more skilled requirements and responsibilities of the Santa role and is, in no way, indicative of a gender pay divide at Christmas Kingdom. The Celtic Manor Resort remains a committed equal opportunities employer," he added.
