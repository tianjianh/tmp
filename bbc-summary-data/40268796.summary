[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fleming, 21, has scored one try in four games for the Centurions but was ruled out of the derby win against Wigan with an ankle injury.
The former Sale Sharks rugby union product has run in seven tries in 19 appearances for his parent club.
"He has done exactly what we expected and has come in and done a good job for us," Leigh head coach Neil Jukes said.
