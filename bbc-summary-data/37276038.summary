Sickness outbreak shuts Dumfries hospital ward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sickness bug outbreak has prompted the closure of a ward at Dumfries Infirmary to new admissions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ward 10 has been shut due to a number of patients experiencing symptoms consistent with norovirus.
Dr Martin Connor, consultant microbiologist, said their priority was "patient, public and staff safety".
He said they understood the restriction might cause "some frustration" but it would allow them to prevent any further spread of the infection.
Anyone with symptoms of nausea, diarrhoea or vomiting has been urged to wait at least 48 hours before visiting patients in the hospital.
Members of the public visiting other areas of the hospital have been asked to comply with the hand hygiene and infection control measures in place.
