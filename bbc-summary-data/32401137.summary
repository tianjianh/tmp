[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sonia Pereiro-Mendez was due to sue her former employers Goldman Sachs for sex and maternity discrimination.
The mother-of-two, who was an executive director in distressed investing, alleged she was discriminated against after telling her bosses she was pregnant.
Goldman Sachs had denied the claims.
Employment judge Andrew Glennie said the claimant and the bank had informed the Central London Employment Tribunal that they had "reached terms of settlement".
Her lawyer Richard Leiper said: "The parties have resolved the issues between them and they ask that the claim be dismissed upon withdrawal."
Ms Pereiro-Mendez is understood to have left the company and no details of the settlement have been released.
A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said: "We are pleased this matter is resolved."
