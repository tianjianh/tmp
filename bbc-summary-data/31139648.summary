The American will contest the BNP Paribas Open at the Californian resort.
"It's been difficult to forget spending hours crying in the Indian Wells locker room," the world number one, 33, said.
Williams beat Maria Sharapova in the Australian Open final last month to earn her 19th Grand Slam title.
She won her second Indian Wells title as a teenager in 2001.
The American beat Belgian Kim Clijsters in a final marred by the behaviour of some fans who heckled her and her family, apparently in response to sister Venus withdrawing injured from their semi-final.
In an interview with Time magazine, Williams confirmed her entry in next month's tournament.
"I'm fortunate to be at a point in my career where I have nothing to prove. I'm still as driven as ever, but I play for the love of the game," she said.
"It is with that love in mind, and a new understanding of the true meaning of forgiveness, that I will proudly return to Indian Wells in 2015."
