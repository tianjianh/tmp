The drugs were found under the floorboards of containers from China following a tip-off, officials say.
A Malaysian and seven Australians, were charged with drug offences by the Australian Federal Police (AFP).
The bust came after a five-month operation by Australian police in partnership with Chinese authorities.
The bust was largest methamphetamine seizure in Victoria state this year, enough for 2.5 million hits.
Victoria police spokesman Stephen Fontana said: "You think of the misery in the community that that causes in terms of road trauma, family violence, violence in our street, crime, and addiction and harm to families. It's enormous."
The men aged between 24 and 32, are being charged with various drug offenses including trafficking. Five of the suspects will appear in a Melbourne court on Tuesday and the other three will appear in October.
According to an official study, methamphetamine use has doubled in Australia since 2007. Over 200,000 people used the drug in 2013.
