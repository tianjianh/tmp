The Al-Alaf family left Mosul in Iraq carrying their cat Kunkush.
They all travelled to Turkey and even crossed the Aegean sea together to the Greek island of Lesbos.
It was here that Kunkush slipped out of the basket and disappeared.
After travelling for three months the family finally made it to Norway where they had settled without their pet cat.
But thanks to a social media campaign and a German animal rights group the family have been reunited with their favourite feline.
Take a look.
