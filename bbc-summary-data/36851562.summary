Bayern Munich 1-0 Man City: Pep Guardiola loses first friendly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pep Guardiola's first game in charge of Manchester City ended in defeat at his old club Bayern Munich as a goal from Erdal Ozturk gave Carlo Ancelotti's side victory.

Both sides were missing many first-team players after Euro 2016 and the Copa America, and Guardiola had 12 academy players in his squad.
New signing Oleksandr Zinchenko played in the first half but Ilkay Gundogan and Nolito were not involved.
The only goal came when 20-year-old Ozturk hit a deflected shot past City's substitute goalkeeper Angus Gunn - son of Norwich legend Bryan.
Captain Vincent Kompany, who missed Euro 2016 with a groin injury, was an unused substitute.
City now head to China, with Guardiola's side playing rivals Manchester United on Monday.
The travelling squad will be bolstered by Sergio Aguero, David Silva, Nolito, Raheem Sterling and Joe Hart.
Manchester City first half: Caballero, Maffeo, Adarabioyo, Kolarov, Angelino, Fernando, Fernandinho, Zinchenko, Barker, Iheanacho, Navas
Second half: Gunn, Maffeo, Adarabioyo, Kolarov, Angelino, Clichy, Fernando, Fernandinho, Delph, Bony, Navas
