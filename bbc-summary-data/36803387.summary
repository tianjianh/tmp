[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leading figures from Northern Ireland have been reacting to the lorry attack in Nice.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones or have been seriously injured in this vicious attack.
"Many of our football supporters enjoyed attending the European Championship in France in recent weeks and the scene of devastation and pain this morning are in stark contrast to the carnival atmosphere and warmth people from across Europe enjoyed.
"The people who carried out this attack want to create fear and division. Their actions have resulted in the loss of many lives of people of different nationalities. Their acts are futile and will serve only to strengthen our resolve and determination that democratic means are the only way forward."
"Many local people will have experienced the beauty of Nice recently, as Northern Ireland played their first game at the European Championship there.
"The people of Nice showed the supporters the very best hospitality and we stand with them in solidarity after this horror.
"The proximity of France to us and the fact they have been an ally in good times and bad means people from here will be particularly hit by this incident."
"It's obviously devastating, I'm really shocked.
"I'm in Toulouse at the moment, I'd been watching the Bastille fireworks and was walking back when we heard the news and couldn't believe it.
"My thoughts are with everyone who has been affected, when you see the families and children caught up in it, you can see the true horror that unfolded."
"I am absolutely disgusted and repulsed at the cowardly terrorist attack on men, women and children as they celebrated Bastille Day in Nice. My thoughts and prayers are with the President and people of France.
"Those who carry out and encourage such attacks hate our way of life and the freedoms that we hold dear.
"We must re-double our efforts and work ever more closely with our European and Transatlantic Allies to enhance our security, share intelligence and remove the threat from the terrorists who want to drive us back to the dark ages."
On Friday night Belfast's City Hall was illuminated in the colours of the French flag as a mark of respect for the victims of the attacks in Nice.
