Harry Redknapp insists he is not worried about his future as QPR manager despite claiming a club "insider" has tried to destabilise his position.

Manchester United's 2-0 win at Loftus Road increased the pressure on Redknapp with QPR 19th in the Premier League.
But he said: "I have spoken to the owner Tony Fernandes five times this week and he's not mentioned anything."
On Friday's story that he could be sacked if they lost Redknapp said that "someone has made a bit of money".
He added: "I've never been at a club like it in my life.
"It's this 'insider' who is trying to cause a problem. Who do you believe - the chairman or 'the insider'?" Redknapp asked.
"What will be will be. It's their choice. It's Tony's club. We can only do our best and I think we have done ever so well this year."
Rangers, promoted back to the Premier League last season, have been beaten just three times at home all season but have lost all 10 of their away games and are one point behind 17th-placed Burnley.
Former Spurs manager Tim Sherwood has been strongly linked as a potential successor at Loftus Road, but Redknapp insists he is not feeling the heat.
"Do I look like I feel under pressure?" he said.
"When I get home I'll take my wife for a nice meal somewhere, have a nice bottle of wine, then in the morning wake up and take my dogs for a walk. My life's very good.
"I don't always speak to my chairman after a game but if he wants to talk he knows my number. I spoke to him on Friday and the day before - no problem."
Redknapp, meanwhile, is convinced QPR can stay up if he can add to his attacking options.
The Loftus Road side have been indebted to Charlie Austin's 13 goals so far this season. The former Burnley man, who was watched by England boss Roy Hodgson on Saturday, has accounted for more than half of their 23 league goals.
"It's going to be very close down there and I think we've got a real chance.
"If we can get another striker in on loan then we'll stay up no problem.
"We're just short of an option up there, someone with a bit of pace."
