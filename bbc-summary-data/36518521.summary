Orlando shootings: Gunman's father's Afghan nationalist TV programme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of Orlando gunman Omar Mateen said his son had "a grudge in his heart" when he killed 49 people at the Pulse night club in Orlando.

Attention has fallen on Seddique Mateen, who runs a Facebook page where he describes himself as the "Provincial Government of Afghanistan", and refers to some sections of the Taliban as "our brothers".
Seddique Mateen has also appeared on his own online Afghan nationalist TV programme. Last year, he declared himself a candidate for the presidency of Afghanistan -  a year after the election took place.
His video posts are something of a laughing stock in Afghanistan, where he's viewed as somewhat odd and incoherent, BBC analysts say.
Mr Mateen's video message addressed to the people of Afghanistan mourns the death of his son, saying "I do not know what caused him [to carry out the attack] last night... I was not informed that he had a grudge. I am deeply saddened about what he has done".
"The issue of homosexuality and punishment for that is up to God alone, this is not in the hands of human beings," he adds.
Changing the subject somewhat, he finishes the message by saying he supports the Afghan armed forces in their recent border clash with Pakistani troops, saying "Death to Pakistan, which supports killing and terrorism".
The video was one of several posted on his Provincial Government of Afghanistan Facebook page, where it provoked a stream of abuse from other Facebook users.
BBC analysis of Mr Mateen's online presence shows him to be a proud Afghan nationalist, whose "Durand Jirga" TV programme calls for the Afghan people to rise up and unite.
Despite being of Pashtun descent, he always addresses the Afghan people in the Dari language rather than Pashto, presumably to reach a larger audience. However, his speeches can come across as incoherent and erratic.
In May 2015, a year after the Afghan presidential election, he took to YouTube to declare himself a presidential candidate. "Given the fact that the territorial integrity of Afghanistan is in danger... I declare myself as presidential candidate and founder of the National Salvation Movement of Afghanistan," he said.
However, his videos aren't taken seriously in Afghanistan, and his claim in a recent programme to be the "revolutionary president" of the country reinforces the impression that he is something of an outsider.
Although once describing himself during a TV phone-in as a friend of Afghan president Ashraf Ghani, he appears to have changed his stance now that Mr Ghani is in power.
A video last Friday accused Mr Ghani of implementing "Britain's plan" for bringing Islamic State to Afghanistan. Just two days later he posted a video to Facebook urging a "hero" to emerge from the Afghan people to "give him a slap, the lunatic... He's a traitor. He's a traitor!"
He's highly critical of the government of Pakistan, and has strong views on the Durand Line - the British-imposed border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which has never been recognised by people living in the region whose tribal areas it divides.
"The problems of the Afghan people will not be resolved until the Durand issue is addressed. This problem will never go away. We need to unite to defend our homeland," he says in one video. His view is not popular among Pashtuns, and is seen as another example of his off-piste political views.
Controversially, he praises the Taliban for their stance on the Durand Line, referring to them as "our brothers".
He divides the Taliban group into two groups: "real" Taliban, who are against the Durand Line, and those he considers to be stooges of Pakistan, who kill Afghans.
"The Afghan brothers should not allow the mercenaries of ISI [Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence agency], who come to Afghanistan under the name of the Taliban and kill our Afghan sisters and brothers," he says.
"See the real Taliban and the Afghans who live in North and South Waziristan, they are the freedom fighters who want to liberate their land... The Pakistani government attacks them and kills their families and relatives," he continues.
In another clip, which he delivers in military fatigues and rounds off with a salute to camera, he shows little love for either Pakistan or Iran: "If we unite together we can go as far as Islamabad. We can solve all of Afghanistan's problems. If we unite, if Iran says anything we can sort it out."
It's likely that Mr Mateen's calls will fall on deaf ears.
