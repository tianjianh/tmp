About 50 employees downed tools on Thursday afternoon to raise concerns about their December payslips.
The workers were then involved in discussions with management.
A spokesman from the Ucatt union said a resolution had been reached between the workers and Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors.
Work on the project, which involves a workforce of 1,200, continued on Thursday afternoon.
The union said in a statement: "Following emergency talks it became clear that the company was currently unable to assess how much each worker was owed.
"In order to resolve the dispute it was agreed that each worker would receive Â£500 as an interim payment.
"Each worker's actual holiday entitlement will then be calculated in the new year.
"If it transpires a worker has been overpaid this will be gradually clawed back from future wages in a way to avoid the worker experiencing a major financial detriment."
Harry Frew, regional secretary for Ucatt, said : "We have brokered a sensible solution to an entirely preventable problem.
"Thankfully once the company recognised the depth of feeling amongst its workforce they worked with us to find a sensible solution."
