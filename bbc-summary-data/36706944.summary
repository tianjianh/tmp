Coventry City have made their second signing of the summer by bringing in striker Marvin Sordell following his release by relegated Colchester United.

The 25-year-old ex-Watford, Tranmere, Bolton, Charlton and Burnley forward, who played for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, has signed a one-year deal, with an option to extend it.
Sordell scored six times in 25 games for the U's after moving from Burnley.
Derby County striker Kwame Thomas signed on Friday on a two-year deal.
"Marvin is a player that the club followed closely last year and was a prime target for us in the summer window," said Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray. "He performed extremely well for Colchester in the first half of last season.
"He is still relatively young and I see plenty of potential for him to progress with us and make a positive impact."
Sordell would have completed his move on Friday, but for a club website issue preventing them being able to tell their fans about it.
At 16:50 BST on Friday, the Sky Blues announced on social media that news of a signing was 'imminent'.
But, at 17:10 BST, the wording read: "Due to an unexpected issue online, we're having to delay confirmation. Sorry everyone - enjoy the rest of your Friday evening!"
