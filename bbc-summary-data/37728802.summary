Madeley won acclaim for her role as a disabled mum in BBC Three drama Don't Take My Baby.
Kirby played Kunta Kinte in the History Channel's $50m remake of slavery mini-series Roots.
This year's crop of Bafta Breakthrough Brits were unveiled at Burberry in London on Tuesday.
A jury of industry experts including Gone Girl actress Rosamund Pike and Suffragette director Sarah Gavron selected this year's list from the worlds of film, television and gaming.
Madeley, who was nominated for best actress at this year's Bafta TV awards for her debut lead role in Jack Thorne's Don't Take My Baby, said: "I still feel I'm starting out. I think this will be a massive help to my development."
The actress, who can currently be seen in ITV crime drama The Level, is working on a documentary and hopes to move into comedy.
"It would be nice to do something quite light hearted," she told the BBC. "So it's not always about social services trying to take my baby away."
Kirby, who also appears in the current season of Black Mirror on Netflix, said he was looking forward to working with a mentor to help with the next stage of his career.
"Roots was one of many moments in my career," he told the BBC, "but it felt like I'd progressed because it was on an international scale."
Others on the 18-strong list include Oxford actress Florence Pugh, whose films include The Falling and Lady Macbeth, and actor and writer Kayode Ewumi, who created YouTube comedy  #HoodDocumentary.
"I finished uni in June and I'm sitting here now. It doesn't make sense, does it?" Ewumi said.
Tom Davis, another honouree, is best known for his surreal BBC Three comedy series Murder in Successville, in which he plays DI Sleet, and also for his work with Keith Lemon.
"I wasn't expecting to get that call," he admitted. "I'm one of the older people here so it feels a little bit like Rocky. I've had a couple of fights before - but this is a world title one!"
Among the guests at Tuesday night's reception, hosted by BBC Radio 1 presenter Greg James, were actors Rosamund Pike, Jennifer Saunders, Joanne Froggatt and Will Poulter.
