Valere Germain headed home the opener soon after the break to put the hosts, chasing their first title since 2000, into the lead.
Falcao slid home Benjamin Mendy's cross to make it 2-0 and turned home Thomas Lemar's ball to seal the win.
Paris St-Germain moved above Nice into second with a 3-1 win at Dijon.
Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani scored in the final 10 minutes for Unai Emery's side, after Dijon's Julio Tavares had equalised Lucas Moura's opening goal in the first half.
Both PSG and Nice are three points behind Monaco, who are the second team in Europe to have scored 100 goals in all competitions this season. They were narrowly beaten to the mark by Barcelona - who played earlier in the day.
Elsewhere, former Arsenal and Middlesbrough forward Jeremie Aliadiere scored his first Ligue 1 goal in almost three years as bottom club Lorient won 1-0 at Lille.
The winner from Aliadiere, who returned to the club for a second spell last summer after two years in Qatar with Umm Salal, gave Lorient a first away victory in Ligue 1 since last April.
