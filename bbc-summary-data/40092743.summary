Drivers being distracted by their mobile phones has been a "significant factor" in accidents on the A9, police have said.

A new campaign highlighting the "concerning trend" will be targeted at drivers on Scotland's longest trunk road next month.
Officers are also releasing the latest data on the impact of the A9's average speed cameras.
The information shows that casualty figures have continued to fall.
The network of cameras between Dunblane and Inverness has been operational since October 2014.
It has been credited with helping to reduce the number of fatal and serious casualties on that stretch of the road by almost 43% over the 27 months to January this year .
There have been no fatal casualties between Dunblane and Perth and a reduction of almost 40% in fatal casualties between Perth and Inverness.
Stuart Wilson, chairman of the A9 Safety Group, said: "The other performance data continues to support the positive change in driver behaviour on the route and also highlights evidence to show that the journey time for people travelling between Perth and Inverness has remained consistent."
But he added: "The group's commitment to making the A9 a safer route will also see a specific safety campaign being launched in June which will focus on driver behaviour related to distraction.
"Evidence from Police Scotland's crash investigators highlights a concerning trend of distraction being a significant factor as the cause of accidents on the route and the campaign is designed to raise awareness of this issue."
