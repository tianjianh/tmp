[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pembrokeshire's Cleddau Bridge toll review decision due

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on whether to keep road tolls on a Pembrokeshire bridge is set to be made next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cleddau Bridge - which costs 75p per car to cross between Pembroke Dock and Neyland - has a surplus of more than £11m.
On Wednesday, many councillors backed reducing the tolls but others claimed abolishing them would mean £2m less to spend on roads and transport each year.
Pembrokeshire council will make a formal decision at a meeting on 12 May.
There are four options to consider; to keep tolls as they are, abolish them, raise them or reduce them.
The way the council manages the tolls has previously been brought under review after a complaint to the Wales Audit Office.
