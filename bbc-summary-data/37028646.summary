[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Singer Katherine Jenkins and her husband Andrew Levitas are to produce a new children's animated TV show.

Symphony Street will be aimed at four to eight-year-olds and it is hoped it could be screened on Welsh channel S4C.
One of the characters will be voiced by the Neath-born mezzo soprano, who said the recent birth of her daughter Aaliyah had inspired the project.
The series will follow a group of musical friends, and will feature music from a variety of genres.
Jenkins, 36, said: "Music is the international language: it doesn't see colour, race, class or creed, and the lessons learned through it are easily translated into everyday life.
"It was with this in mind, that my husband and I set out to create a fun and exciting musical platform to teach our own young daughter."
Symphony Street will be produced in Wales by children's entertainment studio Splash Entertainment, which is run by SuperTed creator Mike Young.
He said the chance of working with "iconic talents such as Katherine and Andrew" on a  music-driven children's show produced in Wales was "too good to miss out on".
"Symphony Street is a fresh, funny and innovative series that will be designed for the media platforms they now frequent, it's a win-win," he said.
Jenkins' husband Andrew Levitas is a film producer and director, as well as a university professor.
