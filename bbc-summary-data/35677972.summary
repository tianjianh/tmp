An intermediary of promoter Barry Hearn's Matchroom Promotions won the purse bid for the fight in February.
Hearn had revealed that the fight would have taken place in Cardiff if a May date was chosen, but the fight will now be held at the O2 Arena in Greenwich.
Welshman Selby, 29, first captured the world title by beating Evgeny Gradovich in May 2015.
He was then successful in his first defence against tough Mexican Fernando Montiel in Phoenix, Arizona in October.
Hearn also hopes to secure a fresh world title bout for former WBO light-heavyweight title-holder Nathan Cleverly in 2016.
The Welshman was defeated last time out, suffering a points loss to Andrzej Fonfara in a WBC International light-heavyweight title fight.
However, Cleverly impressed in that battle and Hearn now wants to finally match him with German Juergen Braehmer after several attempts.
"I think I can get Nathan Cleverly the fight with Juergen Braehmer, he wants a rematch with Fonfara, but Fonfara looks like he is fighting Adonis Stevenson," said Hearn in February.
"So I have said to Kalle [Sauerland, Braehmer's promoter], can we set the Braehmer fight for September?
"We will get Nathan out in April and then set the title fight for September."
