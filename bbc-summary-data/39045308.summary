Davies, who was injured in last month's defeat by Southend, has scored 11 goals in 30 games this season.
And the 29-year-old believes his injury held up contract negotiations.
"It's something me and the manager have been talking about for a couple of weeks, and if it wasn't for my injury, we probably would have got the deal done sooner," he told the club website.
"I've been focusing on rehabilitating properly from that, then we got down to business to get the deal done.
"The injury came at a difficult time, so for the gaffer to still want to give me a new deal was great."
