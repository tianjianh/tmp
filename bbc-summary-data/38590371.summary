Jackie Preuss, 43, penned Simon's Saga - named after her lover Simon Cragg - based on their two-year relationship.
She also bombarded his wife with phone calls and sent scantily-clad pictures of herself in a year-long campaign.
Preuss, of Stourport-on-Severn, admitted harassment and was given 20 weeks' prison, suspended for 18 months.
Prosecutor Angela Halam told Birmingham Magistrates' Court the extracts from the book sent to Debra Michael were "quite graphic".
The court heard Preuss went to the house of Ms Michael and introduced herself as "Simon's girlfriend" and also sent papers to the victim detailing the affair.
Mrs Halam said Preuss posted messages on Facebook asking if Ms Michael noticed lipstick on Mr Cragg's shirt.
In one message to her victim, Preuss wrote: "I think I've left my knickers in the car... would you mind checking?"
Mitigating, Ian Vesey told the court: "All this started because he had an affair with her. It takes two to tango.
"She is an intelligent lady. Sometimes when people are in these situations, it's hard to see the wood for the trees."
The jail term was suspended for 18 months, and Preuss, of Anchor Drive, was ordered to pay costs of Â£775 and a victim surcharge of Â£115.  A restraining order was also imposed.
Ms Michael said in a victim impact statement: "This entire experience had made me feel victimised.
"I feel I have to bow my head in shame."
