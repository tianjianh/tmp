Tracy Gabriel, 40, and Keith Taylor, 43, were found dead following a disturbance at a block of flats in Aberdeen on Tuesday evening.
Ms Gabriel's family said she was "a much loved daughter, sister, mother, aunt and cousin".
And Mr Taylor's family described him as a "happy go lucky lad".
Police Scotland said their deaths were being treated as murder.
Witnesses described seeing another man fall to his death from the 12th floor of Donside Court in the Tillydrone area of the city shortly after police arrived.
He has been named locally as 57-year-old Hugh Gallacher.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner will investigate the circumstances surrounding his death.
Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
A statement released by Mr Taylor's family said he had a "great sense of humour and was always laughing and joking".
It continued: "His dad taught him to Scuba dive and they enjoyed many diving trips in and around the Moray coast.
"Keith met his wife when he worked in Holland in the oil and gas sector. They then moved to Aberdeen and got married in 2013. He was a loving husband and was devoted to his mum and dad plus his older brother."
A statement from Ms Gabriel's family read: "Tracy was a much loved daughter, sister, mother, aunt and cousin. Born in Aberdeen, Tracy spent most of her younger years in the Alford and Huntly areas.
"She then moved to Aberdeen whilst in her twenties and latterly lived in the Tillydrone area. She was well known in the community and well liked by her friends and family. She will be sadly missed."
Ms Gabriel's father Alex told the Daily Record: "Tracy was a very cheery, generous person who would give you the last pound in her pocket.
"Maybe she was sometimes too generous to the wrong people, who took advantage of her.
"All she ever wanted to do was make sure everyone was okay. I can't believe something like this has happened to her."
Ms Gabriel, who is originally from Huntly, is reported to have been a mother of four children.
Her daughter Samantha, 21, told the Daily Record: "I'm struggling to believe this has happened."
One woman who said she had known Ms Gabriel since they were at school together told BBC Scotland she had lost "a great friend".
The woman, who did not want to be named, said she had not been aware of any serious problems between Ms Gabriel and the man believed to have killed her.
Writing on Facebook, a friend of Mr Taylor said: "I would like to say rest in peace to one of my oldest best friends Keith Taylor.
"Man we had so much fun and crazy times too and I remember all the trouble we didn't mean get into to but it just happened.
"You will always be in my life man RIP Keith."
