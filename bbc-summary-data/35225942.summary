Merseyside detective admits contacting victims for sexual purposes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A detective has admitted contacting victims of crime for his own sexual purposes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Det Con Michael McMillan, 32, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to five counts of misconduct in public office.
The Merseyside Police officer contacted five women between June 2011 and June 2015 while working with the force's Family Crime Investigation Unit.
McMillan, who is suspended from duty, was given bail and will be sentenced on 11 March at the same court.
A psychiatric report has been ordered for that hearing.
Judge Clement Goldstone QC said the Crown Prosecution Service had been "merciful" to allow two further charges involving witnesses to lie on file.
He said it was difficult to see how McMillan's activities associated with those two charges, which the detective denied, did not also amount to misconduct in public office.
David Temkin, defending, said McMillan, from Crosby, suffered from bi-polar disorder and had expressed suicidal thoughts.
His actions have been the subject of an investigation by Merseyside Police's anti-corruption unit, which has been managed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Following his admission, he will now face a misconduct hearing.
Deputy Chief Constable Andy Cooke said McMillan's behaviour had been "despicable and unforgivable".
"He was in a position of trust and he abused that when dealing with vulnerable victims of crime.
"He manipulated women who looked to him for professional support for his own sexual gratification and his behaviour as an officer is beyond comprehension."
