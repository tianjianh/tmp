The polls suggest there was no clear winner but here is what the parties have been saying.
The Conservatives
"David Cameron was in control from beginning to end. We settled the debate on who would make the best prime minister for Britain."  Chancellor George Osborne
"I think David Cameron was composed and in control, the strong prime minister that people over the last five years have got used to being in charge.
"I think some of the other participants were quite feisty and scrappy, but the overall impression people will have got is if you want to look at that group of seven people and say 'who is the best person to lead the country over the next five years?', David will have come out clearly ahead." Chief Whip Michael Gove
Labour
"Ed Miliband set out a compelling case that Britain can be better than this and that Britain succeeds when working people succeed."  Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander
"Only 2 people could be PM after May 7 and of those two Ed Miliband beat David Cameron At least Ed knows why he wants the job. DC not on it" tweetedLabour strategist and blogger Alastair Campbell
UKIP
"It was a resounding success for Nigel Farage and UKIP because he was straight-talking, honest and set out commonsense policies for leading Britain and putting Britain's interests first."  Immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe
Liberal Democrats
"I think what Nick Clegg did, and what he did brilliantly, was lay the foundation for us to begin to make the argument. What he had to do was lay out his vision for the country, expose the failures of the Labour and Tory propositions - he did that pretty flawlessly.
"He was the only person who put David Cameron and Ed Miliband seriously on the back foot, and he took on Nigel Farage."  Campaign co-ordinator Lord Ashdown
SNP
"The fact that Nicola Sturgeon won on an average of polls conducted across the UK shows just how strong and persuasive she was." Deputy leader Stewart Hosie
The Green Party of England and Wales
"There is a divide in British politics. There is what I consider to be the right-wing stale politics of the old Westminster politics that want to continue the focus on austerity and want to demonise some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Contrast that with the parties represented by women last night who want a human economy - with people at the centre of what it does." Maggie Chapman, co-convenor of the Scottish Green Party
Plaid Cymru
"Leaders debate show Labour are right. The election is a straight choice in Wales - between Plaid Cymru and the Westminster establishment." tweeted Jonathan Edwards, Plaid Cymru spokesman
