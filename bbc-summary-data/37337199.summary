[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lightning strike: Man absent from court due to ongoing hospital treatment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Down man is in hospital three months after being struck by lightning, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Allen, 36, had been due to attend Lisburn Magistrate's Court on Monday.
However, his barrister said that he was still in hospital following the incident in June.
Mr Allen, from Rampart Street in Dromore, is accused of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on 5 June this year.
He first appeared in court the day after the alleged incident and was granted bail, but that afternoon, when attending his children's school sports day, he was struck by lightning.
Staff had to use a defibrillator on Mr Allen, who was left in a critical condition in intensive care.
He spent a month in a coma after the freak accident at Killowen Primary School in Lisburn, County Antrim.
His son and daughter were also hurt but were discharged from hospital within a few days.
In court on Monday, a prosecuting lawyer said the Public Prosecution Service had received medical evidence on the alleged victim, but they were still awaiting the summary of Mr Allen's police interviews, which would be required before any decision was taken regarding the prosecution.
The case was adjourned until 24 October.
