Riding the Team Mugen machine, the 47-year-old completed the one-lap sprint of the 37-mile (60km) course at an average speed of 118.416.
However, his time was down on Mugen team-mate John McGuinness' lap record from last year's event.
McGuinness led the race before suffering a technical issue and eventually finished fourth.
William Dunlop finished 25 seconds behind Anstey (115.84 mph), with Daley Mathison third and just below a 100mph lap.
Anstey said: "The bike still has lots of battery left and I really enjoyed that one".
