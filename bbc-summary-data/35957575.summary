Four 121m-high turbines have been built at Loughmore mountain, Monnaboy, near Eglinton, and will generate 12 megawatts of power.
Gaelectric, the Irish firm behind the facility, predicts it will power almost 7,500 homes a year.
It is the company's third wind energy project in Northern Ireland.
Patrick McClughan, Gaelectric's head of corporate affairs, said the construction phase created over 25 full and part-time jobs.
"We make a significant contribution to the local economy through supply contracts and that will continue through the operational lifetime of the facility," he said.
"We have four other wind farms under construction at the moment and that will make significant contributions to Northern Ireland's green energy targets."
In 2013, the renewable energy group opened a £20m wind farm in County Antrim.
A year later, it completed a £58m wind farm in Dunbeg, County Londonderry.
A number of wind farms in the north-west have been given approval in recent years, but some have met with objections.
Last year, locals planners rejected an application by the firm RES, which wanted to erect seven large turbines in the town land of Barr Cregg, near Claudy, County Londonderry.
It was one of Derry City and Strabane District Council's first major decisions after planning was devolved from Stormont.
