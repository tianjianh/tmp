Paula Poolton murder: BBC documentary to revisit evidence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Two is to follow the search for new evidence in a murder case, six years after the conviction of a man who has maintained his innocence.

Conviction: Murder At The Station will show the work of charity Inside Justice, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice.
The programme will show the charity examining the case of Paula Poolton, who was killed in Hampshire in 2008.
It follows the popularity of Netflix's Making A Murderer and podcast Serial.
Both series looked at the evidence behind historical convictions and gripped their audiences.
The BBC Two programme will consist of two hour-long episodes to be broadcast on 21 and 28 September.
In June 2010, Roger Kearney was jailed for 15 years for killing Mrs Poolton, 40, of Titchfield, Fareham, and hiding her body in the boot of her car.
The trial heard that the pair had an affair in the summer of 2008.
The court decided Kearney stabbed her to death when she started putting pressure on him to leave his partner, and he then fabricated an alibi to cover his tracks.
Mrs Poolton's parents said after the sentencing that "justice had been done".
Kearney has always denied murder. Inside Justice said no scientific evidence was found at the crime scene to implicate him and crucial CCTV evidence was of "extremely poor quality".
Clare Sillery, acting head of commissioning for BBC Documentaries, said: "In gaining access to the work of Inside Justice, cameras capture the painstaking work that goes into these cases.
"With the bar for such referrals [to the Court of Appeal] being set phenomenally high, viewers will get a sense of just what it takes [to] look for evidence which could potentially overturn a murder conviction."
