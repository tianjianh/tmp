Wales captain Gethin Jenkins could become rugby's most capped player if he keeps himself fit, says Robin McBryde.

Prop Jenkins will set a world record for a front-row forward when he leads Wales against Argentina in Cardiff.
The 35-year-old is making his 133rd Test appearance - still 15 behind Richie McCaw's 148 - but McBryde believes he could break the record.
"He's in a good position and I can't think of a reason why he can't," said the Wales forwards coach.
"All he has to do is keep himself fit - bearing in mind he's at the age the body is the first thing that breaks down."
Jenkins is playing his 128th game for Wales and has also made five Test appearances for the British and Irish Lions.
It takes him past former New Zealand hooker Keven Mealamu as the most-capped front-row forward and into fourth place in the all-time list which is led by All Blacks legend McCaw.
Jenkins has retained the captaincy despite the return of regular skipper Sam Warburton from injury and 14 years after making his debut for Wales.
Speaking to Welsh language broadcasters, McBryde praised Jenkins' skill and professionalism.
"His worth has been proven time after time with his defensive work and his fitness across the field," he said.
"He understands the wide game better than most of the backs and his greatest strength is what he brings to the team as an experienced voice.
"Over the years he has overcome a lot of injuries and that's a testament to how professional he has been.
"He's kept himself going through those injuries and he's dealt with the many changes there have been in the scrum and he's come through every test that's been asked of him.
"He's been one of the heroes of the national team and hopefully against Argentina we'll see a performance that proves that."
