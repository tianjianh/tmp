[SN]TITLE[SN]
Horncastle Theatre Company to stay in Lion Theatre as pub reopens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A theatre group can resume productions after a new landlord was brought in to reopen its pub-based venue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Horncastle Theatre Company was threatened with eviction from the Lion Theatre last year after the pub was boarded up and closed in 2013.
The theatre had been operating at the back of the Red Lion Hotel in Horncastle, Lincolnshire for 30 years.
It said that the whole community was happy to see the pub open again and the theatre group staying.
Company chairwoman Shirley Moffat said: "It is a real community asset and we have turned a new page now."
New landlord Andy Melling said he recognised how important it was to people in the town.
