Kisner chipped in from 95 feet for an eagle on Sunday's final hole to take the event to a play-off, which was held on Monday following bad weather.
The two teams could not be separated before Sweden's Blixt and Australian Smith birdied the fourth play-off hole.
This year's event saw a revamped team format playing foursomes and fourballs.
Blixt and Smith, the world number 252 and 112 respectively, had led by four shots going into the final round before American duo Kisner and Brown forced the play-off with a round of 12 under par.
