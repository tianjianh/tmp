[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bronze plaque was prised from the front of All Saints' Church by thieves in 2007. It was later recovered from a nearby scrap dealers.
Commemorating the lives of men from Gjers Mills ironworks, it will now be repaired thanks to Â£8,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Father Glyn Holland said he was "delighted" it was finally being fixed.
The money will also be used to fund a project exploring the impact of World War One on Middlesbrough, its industries and churches.
