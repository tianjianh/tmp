[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall recovered from two goals down to get back to winning ways with victory at 10-man Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Vaughan broke the deadlock on 61 minutes before doubling the Shakers' lead six minutes later.
But Bury's Niall Maher was dismissed for giving away a 70th-minute penalty, which Shaun Williams converted.
Callum Butcher then headed an 86th-minute equaliser before substitute Aiden O'Brien claimed a stoppage-time winner to stretch Bury's club-record losing run to 10 games.
Mid-table Millwall were actually awarded a penalty early on, only for referee Chris Sarginson to change his mind.
Vaughan then headed wide and team-mate Neil Danns had a shot deflected off target
Millwall replied with Harry Smith and Fred Onyedinma going close, while Joel Martin's free-kick was tipped over after the break.
But Mayor crossed for Vaughan to head in off the bar before the Bury striker side-footed home from a Scott Burgess lay-off.
Moments later Onyedinma's goalbound effort was blocked by Maher's arm and Williams swept the spot-kick into the corner.
Keeper Ben Williams kept out an Onyedinma header as Millwall pressed, but the Lions levelled as Butcher scored from Shane Ferguson's free-kick, before O'Brien turned in Mahlon Romeo's low cross.
