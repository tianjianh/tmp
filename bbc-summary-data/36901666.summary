West Yorkshire Police said a 32-year-old woman was arrested on Tuesday evening.
The force said: "West Yorkshire Police can confirm a 32-year-old woman has been arrested in connection to alleged threats made against MP Naz Shah."
A spokesman said the woman was in custody.
Ms Shah was suspended from the Labour Party in April over anti-Semitic posts on social media, but was readmitted earlier this month.
