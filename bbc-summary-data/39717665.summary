The winner of this year's prestigious Â£25,000 Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction will be announced at the event on Saturday 17 June.
Festival director Alistair Moffat said: "Every year we aim to bring some magic to the Borders within the walls of Harmony Garden and this year is no exception.
"John Cleese, Michael Parkinson, Judy Murray, Anne Reid, Richard Ingrams, Allan Little, Steve Backshall, Rory Bremner, Jim Naughtie, Carol Klein, Joanna Trollope, and Melvyn Bragg will all, without doubt, enthral our audiences."
Kaite Welsh, literature officer at Creative Scotland, said the event had become an "essential fixture" on the literary calendar.
"Always with a diverse programme of literary events in a beautiful setting, the talks enthral younger readers and stimulate debate in older ones," she said.
"With a brilliant roster of well-known and emerging voices, 2017's festival promises to be a highlight."
