[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tense third day is in prospect at Leicester with Glamorgan on 11-1, chasing a tricky target of 181 to win.

Leicestershire started their second innings well thanks to Angus Robson (72) but fell away to 283 all out despite Neil Dexter's 73.
Timm van der Gugten (4-81) and Michael Hogan (3-55) were the pick of Glamorgan's bowlers, as has often been the case in 2016.
Dieter Klein dismissed Nick Selman for two before bad light stopped play.
Leicestershire all-rounder Neil Dexter told BBC Radio Leicester:
"We didn't get as many as we would have liked after the platform that Robbo [Angus Robson] and Horts [Paul Horton] set us. We lost our way in the middle again and it was disappointing.
"But we're definitely in the game, maybe a bit behind but [if we get] quick wickets, they crumbled in the first innings and we can back that up in the second innings.
"You want to go in having them two or three down but we've got to turn up and hit them hard again, I think Diets [Dieter Klein] has been exceptional."
Glamorgan fast bowler Timm van der Gugten told BBC Wales Sport:
"It was a pretty hard day out there, the wicket has got a bit easier as the game's gone on, and once the ball goes soft,  it's quite a nice wicket to bat on.
"If we get through the new ball, 180 shouldn't be a problem if our batters can get in and get used to the conditions.
"It was a bit of a slow start to the season, but I've bowled a few overs and taken a few wickets [56 in the Championship] which has been handy.
"The results haven't been what we wanted but hopefully next year we can learn from these last two games, where we've played a lot better, and take that momentum into the Championship next year."
