[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 130th AGM of The IFAB will take place at St. David's Hotel in Cardiff on Saturday, 5 March and Infantino is expected to attend.
The Uefa secretary general earned 115 votes in yesterday's selection process, 27 more than closest rival Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa.
Infantino led first round voting with 88, including support from Wales.
Infantino has succeeded fellow Swiss Blatter, who had led Fifa since 1998 and stood down in 2015 and was later suspended from football for six years for breaching ethics guidelines.
The FAW was represented in Zurich by chief executive Jonathan Ford.
