Police investigating the disappearance of a 50-year-old woman who vanished 12 years ago are searching a home in Luton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalia Doherty was last seen on 15 April 2003 in Eastbourne, where she was living at the time.
She is thought to have travelled to Luton to stay with her ex-husband, Gerald Doherty, who has since died.
Police have been searching an address in Icknield Way and have arrested a 71-year-old man from Port Glasgow.
He has been held on suspicion of assisting an offender and preventing a lawful burial, and has been bailed until October.
On Tuesday, police launched a new appeal for information about Ms Doherty's disappearance.
They believe she was murdered, as inquiries had shown no sign of her being alive.
Ms Doherty, a mother-of-three who was also known by the surnames Wilkanowska and Logan, is thought to have travelled to Luton to stay at the Regents Arms in Hastings Street.
Det Sgt Graham McMillan said: "This has been a complex 20-month investigation for our officers who are committed to finding out exactly what happened to Natalia, to bring anyone involved in her disappearance to justice, and to finally bring closure to her family."
