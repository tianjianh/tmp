It is the second successive weekend that the 26-year-old Scot has won two golds, after victory in both 500m races in Shanghai.
Christie also won gold in November's season-opener in Calgary, Canada.
This weekend's races were taking place on the 2018 Winter Olympics track in Gangneung.
Christie finished in one minute 32.869 seconds on Sunday, with China's Yihan Guo taking silver.
The Briton had clocked 1:29.39 to win the 1,000m event on Saturday.
She broke the 500m world record in a quarter-final at the second World Cup in Salt Lake City, USA but fell in the final.
The fifth World Cup event of the season takes place in Dresden, Germany on 3-5 February.
