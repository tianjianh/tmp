[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millions of people in China and around the world are campaigning to end the annual dog meat festival in the Chinese city of Yulin.

Dog meat is a delicacy in some parts of the country and a tradition that dates back hundred of years in China, South Korea and other countries.
But as more and more people are keeping dogs as pets in China, the eating of dog meat is becoming unpopular in the country.
An online campaign to end the festival, which started on Sunday, has got lots of support from China and abroad.
It's been signed by more than 3 million people so far, including celebrities like British comedian Ricky Gervais.
Different cultures have different views on food. For example pork is popular in Britain but is not eaten by many Muslims and Jews in the UK and around the world.
Here are some foods that people in the UK might not eat...
In France, many butcher's shops sell horsemeat to customers.
In the Asian countries of North and South Korea, it is seen as a delicacy to eat octopus while it is still alive.
In Cambodia, a country in Asia, tarantulas are fried with garlic and salt and served to tourists in the town of Skuon.
In Japan the deadly Puffer fish is eaten - its skin and insides contain a poison which means only the most skilled chefs are allowed to cook it.
And there are foods eaten in the UK that wouldn't be on the menu in other countries too....
In the UK some people eat black pudding at breakfast. It contains animal blood, usually from pigs. But in many countries around the world animal blood would not be eaten at all.
