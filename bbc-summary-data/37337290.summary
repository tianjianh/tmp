The 28-year-old was left seriously hurt when he was kicked and punched by the youths in Armley on Friday night.
West Yorkshire Police said he and a friend were confronted on Town Street and the victim ran off but was followed by the gang to nearby Alliance Street.
The incident is being treated as racially-aggravated due to comments made at the time.
Police said the man received a cut to his to head that required stitches and had to be treated in hospital. His injuries were not considered life-threatening.
In a statement published on social media, the Polish Embassy said it had been "saddened" by the attack, which "has been the most serious of over 10 xenophobic incidents experienced by Poles in the north of England" in recent months.
"The consular section of the Polish Embassy in London offered assistance in [a] further 17 cases in the South and the Midlands," it said.
The victim had been discharged from hospital, the Polish Consulate in Manchester, added.
Ch Supt Paul Money said: "I want to reassure people, particularly the local Polish community, that we will not tolerate hate incidents of this nature and will do everything we can to ensure the people responsible are brought to justice."
