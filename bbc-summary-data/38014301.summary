Dorothea Weber hid Hedwig Bercu for 18 months during the occupation of the Channel Islands in World War Two.
Hitler's forces continued to search for Ms Bercu and the pair survived on Mrs Weber's rations and by fishing at night.
For her act of "extraordinary courage" Mrs Weber was posthumously awarded the "Righteous Among the Nations" by the World Holocaust Remembrance Centre.
