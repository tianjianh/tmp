About 2,700 competitors are taking part in the event based in Weymouth which also sees a 112-mile cycle ride through the west of the county.
Road closures and diversions are in place until 18:00.
Peter Finney, in charge of highways at Dorset County Council, said the "prestigious sporting event" was a "great boost" for Dorset.
Closures include Preston Beach Road in Weymouth, with Weymouth household recycling centre closing for the day.
Other restrictions are in place around the cycling course which begins at Lodmoor Country Park and travels through Affpuddle, Puddletown, Piddlehinton, Middlemarsh, Minterne Magna, Cerne Abbas, Charlton Down, and Dorchester.
Ironman, which takes place simultaneously at sites around the world, was previously held in Sherborne between 2003 and 2008.
