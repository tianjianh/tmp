[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds maintained pace with Super League leaders Castleford by inflicting a second straight home defeat on Hull FC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joel Moon's double helped put Leeds 30-12 up in a five-try first-half performance, with Steve Michaels and Scott Taylor going over in response.
Hull's Jamie Shaul and Mark Minichiello then went over either side of Danny McGuire's sin-binning for Leeds.
But Leeds added another three tries as Hull played much of the last 18 minutes with 12 men.
McGuire grabbed the game's opening try and put Ryan Hall over for Leeds' second four-pointer of the day after Michael's effort saw the hosts level things up at 6-6 after 11 minutes.
Matt Parcell bamboozled the Black and Whites' defence with a dummy to cross from close range and Moon showcased his power and poise either side of Taylor's try to affirm the visitors' authority in the first half.
Shaul's fine individual effort reduced the arrears after the break while Leeds managed to relieve some of the intense second-half pressure with a Liam Sutcliffe penalty.
McGuire's sin-binning after Leeds were given a team warning was immediately punished as Minichiello went over.
However, Sutcliffe added another penalty and both Kallum Watkins and Mitchell Garbutt touched down after Gareth Ellis was sin-binned for the hosts on 62 minutes after his side was also put on team warning.
And with Sika Manu finishing the game in the bin for dissent, Anthony Mullally added Leeds' eight try to make it their biggest-ever win at Hull FC, which leaves them third in the table and equal on point with second-placed Salford and two points adrift of leaders Castleford after both sides triumphed on Friday.
Leeds head coach Brian McDermott: "From the start we controlled the game. When we got down their end we scored points. That's not to say Hull didn't have a reaction, they did. It's not easy when you keep having to tackle and after a period of time that catches up with you. We used the ball well and got some good offloads.
"We were good across the board. It was a collective effort and certainly when you play at Hull it's not the easiest place to play.
"I didn't think Hull were that poor. We didn't find the game easy, it was about us being good."
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford: "Conceding 50 at home is the most frustrating thing. We don't have time to mope about it. More important now is Monday's game at Leigh. I wish we could play tomorrow.
"That was a chance for us to go second. There are a lot of issues with defence but this is our dip, our rut.
"We had the best defence four weeks ago but the confidence factor is unbelievable. It's just not happening for us and we look a shell of ourselves."
