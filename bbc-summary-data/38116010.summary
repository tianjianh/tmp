The flyers, featuring a gunman and the union jack, read: "All PSNI informers will be put out of this area."
The Alliance Party has condemned the leaflets and urged anyone with information to contact the police.
"Once again we see faceless people using the cover of darkness to make threats against the community," Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle said.
He urged people to continue to support the police.
"I would urge anyone with any information about the production and distribution of these leaflets to pass it to the police on the 101 number or anonymously to the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111," he added.
