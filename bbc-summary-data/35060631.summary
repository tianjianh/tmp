The former Great Britain rugby league star had been linked with an England role in the wake of Stuart Lancaster's post-2015 World Cup sacking.
But Edwards will remain in the role he took up under Warren Gatland in 2008.
"It is fantastic to work alongside such a dedicated and talented group of players and to be part of a strong management team," said Edwards.
He initially worked on a part-time basis with Wales, while head coach at Wasps, becoming full-time Wales defence coach in 2011.
Edwards' expertise has helped Wales win Six Nations titles in 2008, 2012 and 2013 - including two Grand Slams - and a World Cup semi-final in 2011 and a quarter-final in 2015.
He was offered the role of coach to England Saxons following the 2011 World Cup, but turned down the role in favour of his post with Wales.
"Warren has assembled a great team off the field and it's a great environment," added Edwards.
"I get to work alongside some of the best coaches and management in the world and alongside some of my best friends in the game Rhys Long (WRU head of analysis) and Paul Stridgeon (WRU consultant head of physical performance).
"For me it is great to have signed through until 2019, but as I always have done, my focus is always on the next match and the next competition, which for us is the Six Nations."
Wales attack coach Rob Howley and forwards coach Robin McBryde have deals running until after the three-Test tour to face New Zealand in June 2016.
Kicking coach Neil Jenkins is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union's staff.
