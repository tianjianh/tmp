Crystal Palace loanee Mamadou Sakho could miss the remainder of the season with strained knee ligaments.

Scott Dann and James Tomkins are also sidelined, so Martin Kelly and Damien Delaney might be paired at centre-back.
Burnley will be without Joey Barton, who has been banned for 18 months, while defender Ben Mee is a doubt with a shin injury.
Stephen Ward should be fit after a knee problem, and Sam Vokes and Scott Arfield could also be available.
Jonathan Pearce: "Nerves will be jangling for this.
"Realistically, Palace need one more win for safety. Six wins in eight games prior to Wednesday's defeat by Spurs suggests they have to form to do it against a Burnley side who have not won at Selhurst Park since 2001.
"But injuries to Dann, Sakho and Tomkins leaves their defence looking vulnerable.
"Burnley have slipped dangerously towards relegation again with just one win in 11. They've not gone a season without an away victory since 1903 but a first of the campaign will surely see them safe as well.
"The Selhurst atmosphere and in-form Wilfred Zaha may edge it for Palace."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "The lads need to motivate themselves to get to the level they have been to beat Burnley and put it to bed once and for all, get past the 40-point mark and be safe.
"It is a big effort I will be asking for the players to give.
"Everyone says 'keep your mouth shut' - you don't want it to bite you back, but I think 41 points will be enough."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "It's now about everything we've learned over the season and delivering performances in these last four games.
"We as a club, without a shadow of a doubt, are in really good shape going into this last bunch of games.
"But we aren't na√Øve enough to think it takes care of itself, because it doesn't. We have to take care of what we need to."
Crystal Palace are running out of centre-halves after losing Mamadou Sakho to injury but, at the other end, they always pose problems.
Burnley were brushed aside by Manchester United last time out and it might take a little while longer before they banish their relegation fears.
