Premier League clubs have been reminded that the security threat level in the UK remains at 'severe' following the attack on Borussia Dortmund's team bus.

Updated security advice has been given after three explosions damaged the German club's bus on Tuesday.
Security expert Will Geddes said while plans were already in place for stadiums, clubs would now be thinking about their modes of transport.
"That's where the potential risk is," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"The Stade de France attacks [in November 2015] were a reinforcement that stadiums were always going to be at risk and this goes back years.
"Many heads of security will be thinking quite carefully about the transport in the wake of this."
All Premier League clubs and other professional sports bodies in Britain were reminded on Thursday to be vigilant about their surroundings, not to advertise intended routes and means of travel, and to prepare a contingency plan if they did not already have one.
Geddes, who has run security with several Premier League clubs, said that the UK was "probably ahead" of most countries in terms of security at football stadiums.
Dortmund's bus was attacked as the team travelled to the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie at home to Monaco.
The game was then played less than 24 hours after the attack, leading Dortmund manger Thomas Tuchel to say his side felt "completely ignored" over the rescheduling.
"The most important thing - and I have no doubt they will already have started this - is to provide them and encourage some degree of counselling," Geddes added.
"Getting back on the proverbial horse is a good thing to encourage but I wouldn't force individuals to do it."
