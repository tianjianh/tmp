The UK's "first ever" national LGBT+ pride event is to be held in Hull - 50 years after homosexuality was decriminalised in Great Britain.

A week-long festival celebrating the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is set to be staged next July.
UK Pride will feature events covering "a range of subjects and artforms", its organisers said.
Andy Train described it as a "tremendous accolade for us in Hull".
A number of towns and cities, including 2017 City of Culture Hull, have hosted high-profile pride events before, but none with a national tag, Mr Train said.
"Much like how EuroPride is the focus of the European pride calendar, we're confident that the title of UK Pride will enhance the event given the honour each year by attracting additional funding and promotion," he said.
"This will bring even more people to the city during Hull's premier LGBT+ celebration."
