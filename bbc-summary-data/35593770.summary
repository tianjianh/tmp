It will house two of Flint's GP practices, as well as dental services and occupational therapists.
The centre will replace services previously provided by sites including Borough Grove Clinic and Flint Hospital, which campaigners fought to save.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said it would bring "health and social services together under one roof".
The centre is one of three being developed in north Wales, along with Llangollen, Denbighshire, and Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd.
