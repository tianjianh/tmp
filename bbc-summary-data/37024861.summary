The Penygroes-based Express Motors coach went into a ditch on the A39 motorway at Lons-le-Saunier, near the Swiss border, on 23 July.
Its two drivers have been quizzed by French police and another probe is taking place in the UK.
The Gwynedd coach was carrying students from a school in Gloucestershire.
The driver behind the wheel at the time of the crash told investigators he came off the road while looking for his sunglasses.
But prosecutors said his explanation was not very convincing and believe the driver, who is now being formally investigated, fell asleep at the wheel.
Police said no other vehicles were involved. No charges have been brought.
There were 42 students on board - aged between 14 and 18 - and six staff from Bournside School in Cheltenham for their camping trip to Italy.
