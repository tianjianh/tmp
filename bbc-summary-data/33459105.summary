The UK's largest cruise ship has arrived in Scotland as part of its maiden voyage around the British Isles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Built at a cost of Â£0.5bn, Britannia was officially named by the Queen in a ceremony in Southampton in March.
The ship, carrying about 5,000 passengers, anchored off Newhaven, near Leith in Edinburgh, on Wednesday.
It has now arrived at Invergordon in Easter Ross and some of the thousands of holidaymakers have been making day trips into Inverness.
The 141,000-tonne, Italian-built ship has a 94m (308ft) Union Jack on its bow and is operated by P&O.
Its voyage around the British Isles has been described as a "lap of honour".
While anchored off Newhaven, the ship was visited by Edinburgh's Deputy Lord Provost Steve Cardownie.
