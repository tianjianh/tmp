Oxford abduction: Rape survivor reads teen victim letter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rape survivor has waived her right to anonymity to read an open letter offering support to a 14-year-old who was raped in Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clare Dimyon wrote that she suffered a "life-threatening sexual assault" in 1984 and praised the girl for her courage in coming forward.
Police said the victim was in school uniform when she was forced into a car and raped by two men on 28 September.
No arrests have been made and images of two suspects have now been issued.
Ms Dimyon, who used to live in the Summertown area of Oxford where the attack happened, said reading about the girl's experience had motivated her to report her own rape.
She said:  "It may be foolhardy. It is certainly costing me a good deal in psychological terms, but she has to know that somebody has gone that extra mile.
"It has a very strong echo, it has a very strong resonance, and I am a teacher, she's a schoolkid, she was in uniform, and she needs to know she's going to get through this.
"No two assaults are ever the same, each has their specific narrativeâ€¦ but in so many ways what's happened to herâ€¦  was actually far worse than what happened to me."
The teenager was found at midday by a member of public after knocking on doors to get help in Cavendish Drive, Marston.
The suspects were described by the victim as white and used a silver hatchback.
The first spoke with a northern accent, was in his mid-20s, and was balding with shaved dark blond hair. He had blue eyes, a medium build and was about 6ft (1.82m) tall.
The second man had brown gelled hair, was clean-shaven with brown eyes, and was in his late teens or early 20s, with a slightly smaller build.
