A man accused of plotting a terrorist attack in London told his mother-in-law in a letter from prison her daughter had been "dragged into this with me", their trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohammed Rehman, 25, from Reading, said he was "truly and deeply sorry for everything" and expressed remorse his wife was "locked away like an animal".
Mr Rehman and his wife Sana Ahmed Khan, 24, deny preparing acts of terrorism.
The husband allegedly amassed chemicals for a large bomb, the Old Bailey heard.
Mr Rehman, of Radstock Road, also denies possessing an article for terrorist purposes.
The couple hid the fact they had married in an Islamic ceremony from Ms Khan's relatives as the family did not agree with her choice of husband, the court heard.
Mr Rehman, who took drugs and was divorced, described his wife, an aspiring teacher, as a "precious diamond".
The letter sent to Saleen Ahmed Khan in June said: "The minute I laid eyes on her, there was nothing more that I could desire from life than to be with her forever."
He told Mrs Khan her daughter had been "dragged into this with me" but was "completely innocent" and had been "undermined" by their association.
He added: "Had I wished to take your daughter away from you, I would have ran [sic] away with her, but I'm not one to take a family apart.
"I'm truly and deeply sorry for everything and I'm also really sorry if this letter only adds to your pain.
"They could give me a life sentence and I couldn't care less, but they've taken the most beloved and precious thing from me and locked her away like an animal."
Previously the jury heard a "Jihadi John-style" hunting knife and dangerous chemicals for a large bomb were found at Mr Rehman's home.
The trial continues.
