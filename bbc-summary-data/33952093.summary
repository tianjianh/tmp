The ninth instalment will conclude the third trilogy of movies that begins with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which is out in cinemas in December.
Episode IX is set for release in 2019, but initial work with production artists will begin later this year.
Trevorrow wrote and directed Jurassic World, which has taken more than $1.5bn (Â£960m) at the global box office.
Prior to that, he had only made one feature film - the 2012 indie comedy Safety Not Guaranteed.
Lucasfilm's president Kathleen Kennedy described the 38-year-old as "an incredible talent".
"Colin is someone I've been interested in working with ever since I saw Safety Not Guaranteed," she said.
"The power of that film paired with the enormous success of Jurassic World speaks volumes about his abilities both as a storyteller and skilled film-maker."
'Boundless creativity'
Trevorrow said his new role was "not a job or an assignment".
"It is a seat at a campfire, surrounded by an extraordinary group of storytellers, film-makers, artists and craftspeople," he said.
"We've been charged with telling new stories for a younger generation because they deserve what we all had - a mythology to call their own. We will do this by channelling something George Lucas instilled in all of us: boundless creativity, pure invention and hope."
Following JJ Abrams' The Force Awakens, Looper director Rian Johnson will take the helm for Star Wars: Episode VIII, due for release in 2017.
Trevorrow's appointment was made at the D23 Disney Expo in California, where a number of Star Wars-related announcements were made on Saturday.
The first image from spin-off film Rogue One was revealed - giving a glimpse of British stars Felicity Jones and Riz Ahmed - while other cast members confirmed included Forest Whitaker, Mads Mikkelsen and Donnie Yen.
Disney also announced plans to create two Star Wars-themed lands in its theme parks in Orlando and Anaheim.
Each 14-acre site will include a replica Millennium Falcon which visitors will be able to fly on a "secret mission" and will be designed as an immersive experience featuring characters, shops and other attractions from the Star Wars universe.
"We're bringing Star Wars to life in a big way," Disney chairman Bob Iger said.
"These new lands will transport guests to a whole new Star Wars planet. Nothing will be out of character, you've never seen a cantina like this before."
Disney has yet to confirm when the new experiences would be opening, but said they would be "coming soon".
The day ended with an appearance from Abrams and the cast of The Force Awakens - along with Harrison Ford, who unveiled a new poster for the film featuring himself as Han Solo.
He gave credit to Star Wars creator George Lucas, who was honoured on Friday with a Disney Legends award for his contribution to the corporation.
"I'm very happy following in the footsteps of George Lucas, the author of the early chapters of my story," he said.
"I'm delighted to be here with JJ [Abrams] and this wonderful cast. It's a great thrill to be here with you; you have made this whole thing happen. I couldn't be happier."
