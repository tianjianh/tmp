Leicester's remarkable rise to the top of the Premier League, seven points clear of Tottenham, has seen three of their best players rewarded for their fine form this term.
Vardy has scored 21 league goals and made six assists, while playmaker Mahrez has contributed 16 goals and 11 assists.
Frenchman Kante has earned widespread praise for his performances as a defensive midfielder, making more tackles (146) and interceptions (134) than any other player in the Premier League this season.
England striker Kane is the top-flight's leading scorer with 22 goals, German Ozil has provided a league-leading 18 assists and Payet has enjoyed a superb debut season, scoring nine goals.
The award was won by Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard last season.
Everton duo Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley, Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland and Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho have all been named on the Young Player of the Year shortlist.
Last year's Women's Players' Player of the Year, Chelsea's Ji So-Yun, is in the running for this year's award, alongside team-mates Hedvig Lindahl and Gemma Davison, Sunderland's Beth Mead and Izzy Christiansen of Manchester City.
