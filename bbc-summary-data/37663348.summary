Norwich City 0-1 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Baptiste's header late in the second half saw Preston upset high-flying Norwich at Carrow Road.

He headed in Daniel Johnson's free-kick as Preston inflicted a first home defeat of the season on the Canaries.
Norwich's Cameron Jerome hit the post with a volley moments after the goal and forced Chris Maxwell into a fine reflex save with the follow-up.
Bailey Wright then cleared Alex Pritchard's header off the line as Norwich tried in vain for an equaliser.
The win extended Preston's unbeaten run to seven games as they rose to ninth place in the Championship, while Norwich slipped from second place to fourth as they lost for just the third time this season.
Maxwell  made a smart save from Jerome after just 14 seconds and Michael McGovern thwarted Jordan Hugill four minutes later.
But neither side had another great chance until well into the second half as Pritchard's curling free-kick was deflected by a Preston defender and edged just past the angle of post and crossbar.
Baptiste's powerful header proved to be the difference as he met a free-kick after Martin Olsson had unnecessarily fouled Callum Robinson by the corner flag.
Norwich City boss Alex Neil:
"It was really, really sloppy. We have defended set-pieces well all game and then we allow Baptiste to have a free run from a central area and head the ball in.
"It was a very frustrating game for us because although we had a lot of the ball we didn't do enough with it. That is what can happen when five or six of your players aren't at their best.
"We had a lot of possession, but that means nothing if you don't make full use of it. We needed to do more with the ball today. It was really disappointing."
Preston manager Simon Grayson:
"We defended really well and we also posed a threat to them as well and had plenty of chances over the course of the game.
"It wasn't that long ago that we had lost six of the first seven and the some of the natives were getting a little restless. But since we lost 5-0 at Brentford the lads have knuckled down and put a good run together.
"The confidence of the players is obviously high at the moment after the good results they have had but no-one is getting carried away."
