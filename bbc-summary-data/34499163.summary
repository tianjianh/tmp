Chris Coleman's side arrived at Cardiff airport at about 14:15 BST before heading to their team hotel.
Despite losing 2-0 in their crunch match against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday, they qualified for Euro 2016 after Israel lost to Cyprus.
Gareth Bale called it the best defeat of his life.
Midfielder Aaron Ramsey added: "What a great moment for Welsh sport. What a moment for making history. We have finally made it to a major tournament."
Coleman added: "Wow. I can't explain how this feels. I'm disappointed we lost but I know what's coming."
His side went into the match in Zenica needing just a point to reach next summer's Euro 2016 in France, after drawing with Israel last month.
Wales knew they had the insurance of this Tuesday's home game against an Andorran side without an away win in their competitive history.
The final fixture of a momentous campaign, the match at the Cardiff City Stadium has now been earmarked as the opportunity for Wales fans to welcome home their heroes and celebrate their achievement.
The football success came after the Wales rugby team lost to Australia at Twickenham.
Wales had already qualified for the World Cup quarter-finals but missed out on a more favourable tie as a result of Saturday's 15-6 defeat.
They will now face South Africa in the next round.
