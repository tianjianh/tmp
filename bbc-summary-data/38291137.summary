Outplay, which is one of the UK's largest mobile developers, did not disclose how much it paid for the Derby-based firm.
Eight Pixels Square is best known for titles such as All Guns Blazing, Cartel Kings and RAID HQ.
Outplay's portfolio already includes Crafty Candy, Bubble Genius and Angry Birds POP! in partnership with Rovio.
The acquisition boosts Outplay's headcount from about 150 to more than 190 in the UK.
Outplay, which has reported 55 million downloads across its portfolio of games in the past year, said the acquisition would make the company "stronger than ever".
Co-founder and president Richard Hare said: "We've known the team behind Eight Pixels Square for more than 25 years and are delighted to bring them into the Outplay Entertainment family.
"It's great to finally work together, they are an incredibly talented and experienced team.
"The addition of their capabilities and technical expertise will further enhance Outplay's capacity to innovate and raise the bar of what's possible on mobile."
Outplay Entertainment was founded in Dundee in 2010.
