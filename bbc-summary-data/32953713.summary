The singer had been attempting to grab the drone, used to get crowd shots during his concerts.
"Something went wrong and he had an accident," a representative for the singer revealed on Instagram.
Iglesias continued to perform after the accident before flying to Los Angeles to see a specialist.
Photos posted on social media after Saturday's concert at the Plaza de Toros de Playas in Tijuana appeared to show him with a bandaged right hand and a bloodied white T-shirt.
According to his press agent Joe Bonilla, Iglesias - son of veteran Spanish performer Julio - "decided to go on and continued playing for 30 minutes while the bleeding continued throughout the show".
The 40-year-old was then "rushed to the airport where an ambulance met him [and he] was then put on a plane to LA to see a specialist."
Iglesias, one of Latin music's biggest stars, recently took home nine prizes from the Billboard Latin Music Awards.
The next date in his Sex and Love world tour is scheduled for 3 July in Mexico City.
