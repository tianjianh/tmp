Kennair-Jones said: "I'm beyond thrilled to be joining the team in Birmingham at such an exciting time in the show's history."
The long-running soap has hit the headlines recently following the climax of Helen Titchener's trial.
Kennair-Jones replaces Sean O'Connor, who continued to oversee the storyline after moving to EastEnders.
Kennair-Jones said he started listening to The Archers on Sunday mornings as a child while his mother did the ironing.
His most recent work was producing the TV show Medici: Masters of Florence for Big Light Productions, starring Richard Madden and Dustin Hoffman. He also produced BBC One's Waterloo Road.
Between 2008 and 2014, Kennair-Jones worked for Sky Entertainment as a commissioning editor at Sky Drama, where he was also executive producer on programmes including Hit and Miss, Strike Back, Mad Dogs, Thorne, Terry Pratchett's Going Postal and Moonfleet.
Gwyneth Williams, controller of Radio 4 & Radio 4 Extra said: "As ever, The Archers is part of our national conversation. And we can be sure that with our talented and experienced new editor, Huw Kennair-Jones, Ambridge will continue to be in safe hands.
"I am delighted to welcome Huw to Radio 4 and I very much look forward to working with him."
The Rob and Helen story reached a climax on Sunday night when Helen was found not guilty of attempting to murder her abusive husband.
A star cast of jurors, including Dame Eileen Atkins and Catherine Tate, were heard deliberating Helen's fate.
After a week-long trial, the jury at Borchester Crown Court also found her not guilty of wounding with intent over the incident, in which Rob was stabbed.
The much-debated storyline portrayed by actors Timothy Watson and Louiza Patikas has gripped listeners, sparked a national debate about domestic violence and a flood of donations to the women's charity Refuge.
The Archers saw a healthy increase in listeners during the second quarter of this year, with 4.95m tuning in - adding 0.25m on the quarter and its highest reach since 2013.
