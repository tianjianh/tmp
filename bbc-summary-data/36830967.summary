The new deal will keep Wilson, who joined from Bristol in the summer of 2015, at Cardiff Arms Park until 2019.
The Blues recovered from a shaky start by winning 10 out of 14 matches in the second half of the season and finishing seventh in the Pro 12.
"The progress under Danny's guidance was clear for all to see," said Blues chief executive Richard Holland.
"We're obviously delighted that Danny has agreed to extend his deal with the region.
"We are committed to the long-term vision he has to bring success back to Wales' Capital Region and look forward to the season ahead."
Wilson previously coached at Newport Gwent Dragons and Scarlets and guided Wales under-20 to the final of the 2013 Junior World Cup.
"I'm delighted to extend my stay at Cardiff Blues," said Wilson.
"And [I'm] extremely motivated by both the exciting squad we have assembled and the organisation's goals.
"There is a real collective approach from the management and senior players driving Cardiff Blues forward.
"The potential for success is not just realistic but something I am incredibly enthusiastic about."
