Carrie Fisher: Cause of death confirmed as cardiac arrest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carrie Fisher's death certificate has confirmed the Star Wars actress died of a cardiac arrest - but the underlying cause is not yet known.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The certificate states the cause of death was "cardiac arrest/deferred."
The "deferred" reference means more investigation is needed by the coroner to find out what caused the cardiac arrest.
Toxicology tests are likely to be carried out, which can take several weeks to complete.
Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd is listed as the notifying party and the certificate lists "writer" as Fisher's main occupation.
Although best known for her role as Princess Leia in the Star Wars films, Fisher wrote several novels and screenplays.
She also worked as a script doctor, revising and polishing screenplays by other writers.
Among the films she is listed as having worked on are Hook, Sister Act and Lethal Weapon 3.
Fisher had been on tour promoting her book The Princess Diarist when she was taken ill on a flight from London to Los Angeles on 23 December.
She never regained consciousness and died on 27 December at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre.
Her mother Debbie Reynolds died the following day.
Fisher, who had been open about her experience of mental health issues, was laid to rest alongside her mother at a private service on Saturday, with her ashes carried in an urn in the shape of a Prozac pill.
Family and friends of the actresses paid their respects to the mother and daughter at a private memorial service the day before the funeral.
