Kaitlyn Regehr, 30, was travelling home on the 207 bus towards Acton on 6 October when a man grabbed her.
She posted an appeal on social media asking people "to help me find this awesome dude so I can buy him a pint".
The Met Police said they were investigating an allegation of sexual assault and no arrests had been made.
Ms Regehr said: "I was heading home on the 207 and a man grabbed my bum and I moved out of the way.
"Someone saw it and he called the guy out loudly enough for the whole bus to hear and said, 'do you have women in your life? That could be your mother, that could be your sister; she is someone's sister'."
Ms Regehr, a writer and documentary filmmaker, posted her story on Facebook and Instagram. It has received more than 42,000 likes and been shared more than 22,000 times.
In the post she wrote: "I thank you not just because you stood up for me, or because you made me feel safe, but because on your transit home - in this big, potentially anonymous city - you humanised assault.
"You didn't turn away. You took a stand. You said something."
Ms Regehr reported the assault to the police, but said she initially felt reluctant to share her story.
"I just spoke to them and they are looking at CCTV, and in a way - because I didn't see the attack - I said to the police I felt silly reporting it," she said.
"But the police were adamant they want to take a stand against it, especially on public transport."
Ms Regehr said she had been on the 207 bus since the assault, but she had not seen the man who helped her.
"The post is being widely shared and people in my neighbourhood are also sharing it - but I have not found the Good Samaritan yet," she said.
In a statement, the Met Police said detectives were investigating an allegation of sexual assault on a woman on a route 207 bus at about 22:50 BST on 6 October.
No arrests have been made and enquires continue, officers said.
