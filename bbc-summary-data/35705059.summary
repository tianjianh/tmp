Champions League: Michael Mols concerned by proposed changes

Proposed changes to the Champions League could have serious consequences for Scottish and Dutch clubs, says former Rangers striker Michael Mols.

Mols played in three Champions League campaigns during his time at Ibrox.
And he is concerned that smaller leagues will suffer if leading clubs are given more leverage.
"For the likes of Rangers, Celtic, Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV that's the only way to get some big money if you get into the Champions League," said Mols.
The 45-year-old collected six trophies in his five years with Rangers and was a Dutch Cup winner in his homeland with Feyenoord.
"The TV rights in Scotland and Holland, compared with the English Premier League, is like a dime," he added.
"I see it as a big problem if it's more difficult for the Scottish clubs or the Dutch clubs to get into the Champions League.
"The gap between the top of Europe and the rest will only become bigger, especially now with the Premier League getting so much money."
Champions League changes being considered by clubs in England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France could lead to the removal of the 'champions route' in the qualifying rounds, which provides a path for all domestic title winners not automatically qualified for the group stage.
There is serious concern in Scotland and other smaller nations about the ramifications of such a move.
Alterations to European club competitions can only be made after three-year cycles, with the current one finishing after 2017-18.
