According to the Irish edition of The Sunday Times, police have identified two of the six gunmen who shot David Byrne dead and wounded two other men.
The two attackers were photographed by journalists while leaving the hotel.
It is reported one has been identified as a paramilitary from County Tyrone.
The other, who was dressed as a woman, is thought to be a Dublin criminal.
The police are said to believe the gunman from Northern Ireland is a member of the Continuity IRA.
The dissident republican organisation issued a statement to the BBC last weekend claiming that it was responsible for the shooting at the Regency Hotel on 5 February.
However, a later statement purporting to be from the Continuity IRA was issued to other media outlets saying the organisation was not involved in the attack.
On 8 February, another man was shot dead in Dublin in what police believe could be a reprisal for the murder at the boxing match weigh-in.
Eddie Hutch Snr, who was in his 50s, was killed near his flat in Poplar Row, North Strand, in the north inner city.
5 February - One man, is shot dead and two others are injured when masked gunmen open fire at a boxing weigh-in event at Dublin's Regency hotel.  The dead man is later named as 33-year-old David Byrne.
8 February - A group purporting to be the Continuity IRA, a dissident republican faction, claims responsibility for the hotel shootings. However, hours later a second statement, also claiming to be from the Continuity IRA, denies any involvement.
A second shooting takes place in inner city Dublin on Monday evening in what police believe could be a reprisal for David Byrne's murder.  The second victim is named as Eddie Hutch Snr from North Strand.
9 February - Irish police say they are to establish a permanent armed support unit for Dublin in the wake of the gangland feud.
