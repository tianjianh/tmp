Dumfriesshire soldier's unopened World War One whisky for sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An unopened bottle of whisky taken to the World War One front line by a Dumfriesshire soldier is set to be auctioned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Croft Blend Fine Old Scotch was taken to France by Cpl William Mill in 1914 but was never opened and he brought it home with him to Scotland.
The bottle was stored in a suitcase under a bed at his home. It has since been passed down through his family.
Bidding via the Scottish Whisky Auctions website will start at ??2,000.
Cpl Mill served with the 3rd Volunteer Battalion of the King's Own Scottish Borderers during World War One.
A note written by the soldier on the back of a photograph of him taken in 1908 is also part of the lot.
Bidding for the bottle is set to start on Friday and will be open for 10 days.
It is the oldest bottle ever sold on the site and auctioneer for the Glasgow-based website, Peter Burns, believes it remains in good condition despite its age.
He said: "The bottle was produced between 1889 and 1908, as the glass bottle manufacturer, Cannington, Shaw & Co, were using a particular stand format during this period which is present on the base of the bottle.
"Apart from that, nothing is known about this bottle and the whisky inside it.
"It is truly a mystery and, despite casting the net far and wide for answers, through archivists, whisky writers, historical institutions and other knowledgeable individuals, not one single person has been able to shed any light on it.
"There is a very high likelihood that this is a one of kind and, when it appears on our website later this week, it could make for some interesting bidding activity."
