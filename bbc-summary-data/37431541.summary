[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 41-year-old victim was attacked by a group in Castlebay Street, in the Milton area, at about 19:30 on Tuesday.
Police said the attackers then made off in three cars which were seen being driven erratically from the scene.
Detectives have appealed for information over the attack which they described as "completely unprovoked". They have not ruled out that the victim was targeted for some reason.
Det Con Geraldine Josey said: "It may well be that this man was targeted for some reason, however, it does seem to have been a completely unprovoked attack.
"I am keen to hear from anyone who may have been in Castlebay Street around this time and who can help us trace those involved in this attack."
It is not known how many people were involved in the attack.
