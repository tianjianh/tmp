[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Swansea restaurant could face a £40,000 fine after it was found employing two illegal immigrants.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Acting on intelligence, immigration officers arrested the Chinese men, aged 53 and 41, at The Hot Wok, in St Teilo Street, Pontarddulais on Wednesday.
The first was a failed asylum seeker while the other had stayed beyond his visit visa.
Both men have now been transferred to immigration detention pending their removal from the country.
The Hot Wok was served with a notice warning that a financial penalty of up to £20,000 per illegal worker would be imposed unless it can demonstrate appropriate right-to-work document checks were carried out.
Richard Johnston, from Immigration Enforcement in Wales, said: "These arrests are a clear warning to those abusing our immigration laws.
"There will be no slowdown in our efforts to arrest, detain and remove you from the UK."
