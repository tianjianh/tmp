Tracey Wilkinson, 50, and son Pierce, 13, were stabbed at home in Stourbridge on 30 March.
Peter Wilkinson, who had life-threatening injuries, joined daughter Lydia in a minute's applause at West Bromwich Albion's ground.
The tribute was held before the Premier League game against Liverpool.
West Brom said the father and daughter were East Stand season ticketholders and the club invited fans "to show their support for a grieving Stourbridge family of Baggies fans".
In the match programme, the club said the family had asked for a minute's applause in memory of the mother and son.
Albion said: "We are thankful that [Peter] has recovered sufficiently to join us at The Hawthorns today along with his daughter Lydia and other members of the Wilkinson family.
"The football club and all of us here this afternoon offer our support to Peter and Lydia as they look to rebuild their lives following this tragedy."
Aaron Barley, 23, of no fixed address, has been charged with the murders of Mrs Wilkinson and her son, and the attempted murder of Mr Wilkinson.
