The X Factor judges have told Newsbeat the secret of career success for the winner is simple: "Work hard."

"They've got to understand that they've become the winner and then the real work starts," says Louis Walsh.
Ben Haenow, Fleur East and Andrea Faustini are all hoping to be crowned the X Factor winner.
They'll sing their favourite song of the series on Saturday's show and perform their celebrity duets.
"The competition's one thing. You have themes, you have all the different obstacles and they grow during that process," Cheryl Fernandez-Versini told Newsbeat.
"But, afterwards it's about being who you are as an artist in this current market which is extremely hard right now," she added.
Ed Sheeran and Meghan Trainor will also perform on the show tonight and will no doubt reveal some more pearl's of wisdom for the contestants.
After the excitement of releasing their debut single and possibly making the Christmas number one spot what happens to the winner's career is not by any means for certain.
Whether they fade into pop oblivion or become a star with long-term staying power is all down to hard work and a little bit of luck says Dermot O'Leary.
"The stars have got to align. I always tell the contestants 'When you leave here the hard work starts and that's the rest of your career,'" he says.
Past winners have gone on to varying degrees of success.
Remember series two winner, Shayne Ward? Or series four winner, Leon Jackson? What about series seven's Matt Cardle?
Arguably the winner who has had the most success is Leona Lewis. She made it big both sides of the Atlantic.
Is their success or lack of it down to hard work or hard luck? Who knows, but Dermot's biggest bit of advice for the winner is: "Enjoy it. Enjoy the next nine months."
"Get your head down, work hard and make sure that the album you want to make is the album you make and work with the people you want to make it with," he says.
Louis also believes a great record deal and great songs help. Naturally.
But he also agrees: "You need a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck."
