[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 2-1 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham climbed into the top half of the Championship after hanging on to beat Blackburn, who had a late goal not given when the ball was over the line.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross McCormack stroked the hosts ahead before Moussa Dembele fired into the roof of the net from six yards.
Jordan Rhodes pulled one back from the spot after James Husband pushed him.
And Blackburn were only denied a late equaliser when Grant Hanley's effort was cleared by Jamie O'Hara, with replays showing the ball was in.
Fulham's victory was their first in five games against Rovers and lifts them up to 11th in the Championship table, while winless Blackburn remain in the bottom three.
They were made to work hard for the points by Gary Bowyer's side, who fought back valiantly after falling two goals behind and had more than than enough chances to earn a point.

But ultimately they left themselves with too much to do after Fulham raced into a two-goal lead.
McCormack fired the Cottagers ahead from 12 yards after being played in by Dembele, who then doubled their lead after Jason Steele  had saved from Ryan Tunnicliffe and Tom Cairney.
Home keeper Andy Lonergan saved brilliantly to keep out Ben Marshall's header and Rhodes hit the post at full stretch as Blackburn sought a way back into the game.
They were finally rewarded when Rhodes sent Lonergan the wrong way from the spot and should have levelled when Hanley's effort was not given.
Even then Bengaly-Fode Koita wasted another chance to equalise when he struck the post from close range as Fulham clung on for all three points.
