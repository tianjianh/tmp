[SN]TITLE[SN]
East Hull Pools replacement consultation begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A consultation has been launched into plans for a new six lane swimming pool in Hull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed Â£6m facility at Woodford Leisure Centre would see the closure of East Hull Pools on Holderness Road, which has been open since 1898.
The Hull City Council consultation is running until 5 January.
The local authority has said the new 25 metre pool would be more modern, energy efficient and less expensive to maintain and run.
