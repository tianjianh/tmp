Reece Wabara opened the scoring for the visitors in superb fashion, firing his 25-yard volley past Ben Garratt.
The Alex levelled just before the break through Brad Inman's first-time effort, before Ryan Colclough struck the Wigan bar from the edge of the box.
Crewe withstood constant pressure in the second period, as Garratt kept out multiple efforts from Yanic Wildschut.
The Alex picked up only their second point in six League One matches since 28 November - but Steve Davis's side are still only eight points adrift of safety.
Crewe manager Steve Davis told BBC Radio Stoke:
"It was a hard earned point. "A fair result and a good game. I was surprised we fell behind when we did because we had started better than we have in recent weeks.
"But the lads didn't let going a goal behind affect them. And we got a terrific goal. Ryan Colclough hit a great pass, Brad took it on his chest and it was a great finish.
"We have worked on Brad Inman making those type of runs in behind the centre-halves, so we were pleased when it came off for our equaliser.
Wigan Athletic manager Gary Caldwell told BBC Radio Manchester:

"We were the dominant team right throughout the game. We created numerous opportunities.
"We've played worse than that and won games this season.
"I'm very happy with the result but obviously disappointed because we came here to win."
