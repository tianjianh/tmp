Ms English, from Whitstable, Kent is one of eight winners since the show launched in 2005.
What happened to the others?
Transport manager Tim Campbell, from East London beat Saira Khan to become Lord Sugar's first Apprentice.
Two years later he left, making what he describes as a "brave decision" to leave the Amstrad "comfort zone", and founded a social enterprise Bright Ideas Trust to help young entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds.
He became a social enterprise ambassador for the government and London's ambassador for training and enterprise and was made an MBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for his services to enterprise culture.
Ms Khan is now a corporate speaker and TV presenter and reporter on ITV's the Martin Lewis Money Show.
Lord Sugar told the tribunal series two winner Michelle Dewberry was the only contestant other than Ms English to leave the £100,000 job before the end of her 12-month contract.
She has since become a motivational speaker, Sky News breakfast TV pundit and magazine columnist. She runs a business consultancy and founded bargain deals website DailyChic.
"Winning the show is something Michelle is very proud of," said her spokeswoman. "The profile she gained is something she uses to raise awareness of the causes that are close to her heart, such as Women's Aid."
On Friday she Tweeted she was lunching with Dragon's Den entrepreneur Duncan Bannatyne, a fellow Women's Aid supporter.
Her rival in The Apprentice final, no-nonsense Ruth Badger, runs her own business consultancy in Manchester.
Cambridge graduate Simon Ambrose worked for Lord Sugar's property company Amsprop for three years, during which he studied as a chartered surveyor.
Since then he has invested in a London restaurant, members club and art gallery and owns and runs an event production company and become a property developer.
"I enjoyed my three years with Lord Sugar and saw him regularly, my desk being only yards from his office," he said.
"It was a unique experience."
Among Mr Ambrose's fellow contestants was Katie Hopkins, the mother-of-two who walked off the show after Sir Alan questioned her about childcare. She turned up on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here nine months later.
Lee McQueen was the winner who rang in sick on his first day in the new £100,000 job.
Lord Sugar, then still Sir Alan, told BBC Radio 4 he caught a virus when he was in Spain. "He's phoning me every 10 minutes giving me chapter and verse on how many times he has visited the loo," he said.
Mr McQueen went on to set up a digital media business with Lord Sugar's son Simon.
"The Apprentice tests you in every way, stamina, business acumen, team work, confidence it was a great experience," he says on his website.
He later founded the recruitment company Raw Talent Academy, helping young people - not necessarily just graduates - start careers in sales and recruitment.
Restaurant owner Yasmina Siadatan worked her one-year £100,000 contract at Lord Sugar's Amscreen Healthcare company, which  supplies advertising and information screens to hospitals and GPs.
After taking time off to have two children she was headhunted earlier this year by former Dragon's Den star James Caan.
She now works for his private equity firm Hamilton Bradshaw.
The runner-up in 2009, Kate Walsh, became a TV presenter, fronting early evening shows Channel 5 Live and OK! TV.
Awaiting judgement on her constructive dismissal claim from Lord Sugar's IT firm Viglen after she claimed she had no real role at the company.
She told an employment tribunal her boss Bordan Tkachuk informed her, "there is no job", on her first day.
But Lord Sugar said she was a "headline grabber" who was "desperate for money".
One of her rivals, Stuart "The Brand" Baggs, who made the final three, became known for outrageous statements including: "I'm not a one-trick pony, I'm not a 10-trick pony - I've got a field of ponies waiting to literally run towards this job."
Inventor Tom Pellereau was the first contestant to win the chance to set up his own company with a £250,000 investment and help and advice from Lord Sugar.
His scheme to redesign office chairs failed to impress his business partner in the final of the show, but one invention, a curved nail file has gone into production and is now stocked by Sainsbury's, Tesco and Amazon.
He says he "cannot help" but come up with new inventions almost every day - which he says could been seen by some as "an affliction".
He has worked on other products including a range of baby feeding accessories.
Biochemist, recruitment manager and wrestler Ricky Martin won Lord Sugar's £250,000 investment after pitching the idea for a specialist recruitment company for science and technology jobs.
He launched Essex-based Hyper Recruitment Solutions in October
Lord Sugar decided against backing finalist Nick Holzherr's food website and smartphone app idea.
But Mr Holzherr has since been backed by private and institutional investors and set the business up with another partner.
