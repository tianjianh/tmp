Tyler Perkins, 18, attacked the hedgehog, which later died, in his garden in Croft Street, Ipswich, on 9 September.
Magistrates in the town found Perkins, who did not attend the hearing, guilty of inflicting "unnecessary suffering" to the animal.
He is due to be sentenced on 3 January.
The court heard a statement from RSPCA investigating officer Jason Finch, who said Perkins told him he "wasn't really thinking" during the attack.
He said Perkins had a drink problem, felt remorse and wished the incident never happened.
The attack was in a town which has been identified as a hot spot for hedgehogs and where work is ongoing by Suffolk Wildlife Trust to protect the species.
Speaking outside the court, RSPCA inspector Natalie Bartle said: "It was an act of senseless cruelty towards this hedgehog.
"We all know that the hedgehog population is currently on the decline, seriously on the decline in fact.
"Hedgehogs need to be looked after, not treated with cruelty."
