Wherever you are in the world, you can get the key updates as they happen with alerts for team line-ups, goals and half-time and full-time scores.
It's not just the Euros either - our alerts will let you know the moment the chequered flag is waved, when a key wicket has fallen in a big cricket international, when a vital try has been scored and much more. And with our new breaking news alerts you can get the latest headlines and biggest event coverage sent directly to your device.
We will continue to expand our range of alerts for these sports, including event alerts for this summer's Olympic Games in Rio de Janerio. From athletics to weightlifting, we'll make sure you don't miss a single second, no matter where you are.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Alerts are notifications that pop up on your phone's homescreen with key information. For example, if you set alerts for a football or rugby team, you can receive an alert every time a goal or point is scored in one of their matches, as well as alerts with the line-ups, half-time and full-time score.
Similarly, cricket fans might like to add England cricket alerts - these will provide notifications every time a wicket falls (with the batsman's score and team score), as well as alerts for end-of-innings scores and results.
The level of detail can be set for each type of alert - for example, you might not want to know every time a wicket falls, you might just want the result. Similarly you might want Formula 1 alerts for qualifying but not the race itself if you're planning to watch the highlights later.
To add the alerts follow these steps.
Visit the MyAlerts section of the app from within the menu
Select Euro 2016, or if you want to add other alerts pick from a sport - cricket, football, Formula 1, rugby league or rugby union - or sport news.
For sport news, simply tick the box. To set alerts for the Formula 1 season, simply set the sessions you want to receive updates for. For all other sports, select the teams you want to follow - there's a full list below. You can add alerts for as many teams and sessions as you want.
Wait for the alerts to arrive - hopefully they're good news!
