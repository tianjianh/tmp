She joins a star-studded cast which also includes Dame Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman and Keira Knightley.
The actress and comedian will play Dew Drop, a comedic fairy, in the new film of the classic ballet, directed by Lasse Hallstrom.
Hart tweeted: "I won't lie, I am very excited to be playing a fairy. (Natural casting)."
Top ballerina Misty Copeland will also feature in the film, as will Interstellar and Twilight Saga actress Mackenzie Foy.
Hallstrom's movie is based on ETA Hoffmann's 1816 story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, which was turned into a Tchaikovsky ballet.
It tells the story of Clara, who is given a Nutcracker doll which comes to life on Christmas Eve and takes her into a magical world of living toys.
Foy will star as Clara while Knightley will play the Sugar Plum Fairy in the film. It is not yet known if Knightley will be required to dance.
The Dew Drop role will be Hart's second big Hollywood role after she starred alongside comedy actress Melissa McCarthy in Spy in 2015.
Hart is best known in the UK for her eponymous and self-created hit comedy series Miranda.
She also won praise for her role as nurse Camilla "Chummy" Noakes in BBC drama series Call the Midwife, which follows the lives of a group of midwives living in East London in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Earlier this year Hart said she had to pull out completely of the show with a "heavy heart".
"Having shared Chummy's return to CTM, I've not been able to birth (pun) the schedule to make it work," she tweeted.
She left during its fourth series due to work commitments.
It had been hoped that "Chummy" would return for the 2016 Christmas special and the sixth series, expected to air in 2017.
Filming on The Nutcracker and the Four Realms will start later this year.
Hallstrom is best known for Chocolat, What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Cider House Rules.
