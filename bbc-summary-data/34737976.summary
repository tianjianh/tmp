The 25-year-old Durham seamer, who made his Test debut against New Zealand in May, missed the final Test in the UAE.
He had a cortisone injection during last summer's Ashes, when he missed the third Test and admitted in August that the injury may eventually need surgery.
Liam Plunkett will replace Wood in both the ODI and T20 squads in the UAE.
National selector James Whitaker said: "Mark Wood's ankle condition is well known.
"While we have managed his workloads over the summer and during the Test series against Pakistan, it has been decided that the sensible course of action is to seek further advice from a specialist.
"We will then be able to consider how to ensure Mark is able to perform at his very best in an England shirt going forward."
Having lost the Test series 2-0, England begin the limited overs leg of the tour on Sunday with a 50-over match against Hong Kong in Abu Dhabi.
The four-match one-day international series against Pakistan starts on Wednesday.
Three Twenty20 matches take place from 26-30 November before a four-match Test series in South Africa commences on Boxing Day.
