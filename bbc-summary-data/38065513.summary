Public views on third Don crossing in Aberdeen sought

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Public views on the third Don crossing in Aberdeen are being sought as part of a review of the major transport project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£22.3m Diamond Bridge linking Danestone and Tillydrone - aimed at easing congestion - opened in June.
It was supposed to be completed late last year but issues with re-routing underground utilities caused a series of delays.
The review topics include traffic flow and safety.
People living at either end of the crossing are being asked to contact their local community councils if they want issues raised.
A worker died in an accident on the site in January.
