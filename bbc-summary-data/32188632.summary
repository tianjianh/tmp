John Joseph Shannon, 31, was found dead, along with his Spanish partner Anarda De La Caridad Perez Friman, 37, and her two children.
They were Amanda Kristoffersen Perez, 4, and six-week-old Eve Shannon Perez, who was Mr Shannon's daughter.
The victims' bodies were found in the Boschetti's Steps area, last Monday.
Royal Gibraltar Police (RGP) said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with their deaths.
Post-mortem examinations are being carried out by Home Office forensic pathologists.
Police were called at about 11:30 local time (10:30 BST) on 30 March, after a member of staff from a letting agency called at the property where the family was staying.
The victims had only been in Gibraltar for a few days.
