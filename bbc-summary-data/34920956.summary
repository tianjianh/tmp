Spending Review: Arlene Foster warns of more 'significant budgetary pressures'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Finance Minister Arlene Foster has warned Stormont will face "further significant budgetary pressures" as a result of the chancellor George Osborne's spending review.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The review means money for day to day spending by Stormont departments will fall by 5.3% in real terms by 2020.
The departmental budget will remain broadly flat in cash terms from £9.7bn in 2016-17 to £9.9bn in 2019-20.
That equates to a real term fall when inflation is factored in.
Executive now knows how much it can spend
Mrs Foster said that if the executive is to protect health and education services it will "face hard decisions", as that protection will hit other departmental budgets.
The capital budget, which covers infrastructure spending, will rise from £1.1bn this year to £1.2bn in 2018 and the following three years.
The finance minister said that will amount to a cumulative 12.4% rise in real terms by 2020-21.
She added that this will "generate long term economic returns and will assist the Executive in delivering key infrastructure projects".
The Construction Employers Federation said that while the increase is welcome it "does not appear to be as significant as earlier projections had suggested".
The federation added that "the £1.2bn forecast for 2018/19 falls well below the 2007/08 peak of £1.55bn for instance".
At-a-glance: Spending Review key points
Meanwhile, the chancellor has said that his previously announced cuts to tax credits will not go ahead.
The changes would have meant 121,000 Northern Ireland households losing an average of £918 a year.
Mr Osborne said tax credits were being phased out anyway when the new Universal Credit benefit comes in.
The precise impact of Universal Credit in NI is not yet clear, though previous research indicated it would create equal numbers of winners and losers.
In last week's Fresh Start deal, Stormont had set aside £240m for tax credit mitigation over the next four years.
That money may now be used to mitigate the impact of other looming benefit cuts.
Mr Osborne said he still intends to cut a total of £12bn from the UK's benefit bill by the end of this parliament.
