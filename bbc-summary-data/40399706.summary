The 28-year-old is a former Australian NRL Rookie of the Year award winner.
Sydney-born Mortimer, who has also played for Sydney Roosters, Gold Coast Titans and Cronulla Sharks, began his career at Parramatta Eels in 2009.
"My friend, Salford's Marwan Koukash, tipped me on Daniel and the possibility of getting him over early," Leigh owner Derek Beaumont told the club website.
Mortimer added: "I have been following Leigh closely now for the past six weeks and I hope I can play a significant role for the club between now and season's end.
"Playing overseas has always been an attraction and I am lucky that a great club like Leigh took the initiative to recruit me."
In addition, Wales international forward Sam Hopkins, 27, has agreed a new three-year contract with Leigh.
