Ruan Pienaar: Departing Ulster scrum-half aims to return as coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ruan Pienaar is leaving Ulster at the end of the season but the scrum-half is already planning to return as a coach when his playing career ends.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old South African was not offered a new contract because of the IRFU's succession policy, which seeks to develop homegrown talent.
"I would like to come back to Ulster in a coaching capacity," said Pienaar, who joined the Pro12 side in 2010.
"I would see my starting point as an underage or youth coach."
Pienaar has been a key player for Ulster since his arrival on a two-year contract from Natal Sharks.
The Springbok, who has won 88 international caps, has scored an impressive 877 points in 137 appearances for Ulster.
