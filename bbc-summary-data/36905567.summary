The 53-year-old will replace David McNally, who resigned in May when the Canaries were on the verge of relegation to the Championship.
Moxey will formally take up the position when he has helped oversee the transition of ownership at Wolves.
"He has the attributes and skills to embrace the immediate challenge of getting back to the Premier League," Norwich chairman Ed Balls said.
Moxey had general manager roles at Rangers and Partick Thistle before taking over as chief executive of Stoke in 1995.
He joined Wolves in 2000 and in 16 years has twice overseen spells in the Premier League in 2003-04 and from 2009 to 2012.
Balls added: "Jez, with his wealth of football experience and business acumen, was the standout candidate from an extremely strong shortlist.
"Meanwhile, until Jez formally takes up his duties with us, Steve Stone will continue as interim chief executive.
"The board would like to place on record our sincere gratitude for the excellent job Steve has done leading the club through this period of transition."
