[SN]TITLE[SN]
May gets on with the job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Whenever she happens to be near a microphone, Theresa May tends to say - absolutely truthfully it appears - that she just wants to "get on with the job".

Well tonight she certainly has done that, wasting no time in announcing the most senior jobs in her cabinet, the first appointment only an hour or so after she walked in.
No surprise on appointment one - Philip Hammond, the former foreign secretary, becomes the money man. He's the embodiment of the phrase, "a safe pair of hands", and takes on the biggest role as Theresa May's supporter.
The biggest surprise is the appointment of Boris Johnson, the Tory members' darling, as the foreign secretary - one of the greatest offices of state, with a hugely different role as the UK contemplates life outside the EU.
There will be arguments in the coming days of course about how that role will compare and possibly pull against the newly created "minister for Brexit", a role that's been filled by arch Eurosceptic David Davis, a serial campaigner for civil liberties who is difficult to placate. The Eurosceptic Liam Fox is in charge of drumming up trade.
But the decision that marks the clearest break with the past is the sacking of George Osborne, David Cameron's fixer, and political friend for so long.
The chancellor for six years was told today his services were no longer required. A sign, if one was really required, that Theresa May is determined to use the opportunity to lead in the way that she desires. Her hallmark may be safety and caution - but she is clearly not afraid of being bold.
The rest of the cabinet will be appointed through the day tomorrow, with big roles like education and health still to be settled.
If we've learnt anything so far, it's that Theresa May fully intends for things to run smoothly, but is perfectly willing to surprise.
