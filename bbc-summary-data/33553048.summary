Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 'good spirits' in South Africa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu is in "good spirits" after his admission to hospital on Tuesday for an unspecified infection, his family says.

His daughter Reverend Mpho Tutu said the infection was "below the belt" but was not in his prostrate, where his cancer lies dormant and was being well cared for.
It is going to take a few days before he returns home, she said in Cape Town.
He retired from public life in 2011 but continues to travel widely.
The 83-year-old Nobel peace laureate cancelled a planned trip to Rome in December following another infection.
His hospitalization comes a few days after he renewed his wedding vows to his wife Leah Tutu to mark their 60th wedding anniversary.
She has remained by his bedside in a Cape Town hospital, says the BBC's Nomsa Maseko in South Africa.
