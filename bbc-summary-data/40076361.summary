Matt Salmon, 25, had worked for the club for three-and-a-half years, mainly as the academy physio.
He was originally diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 but only announced his retirement on Wednesday following a consultation with doctors.
Speaking on Wednesday, he said he had loved "every single moment" of his job.
"It has been an incredibly difficult decision to resign from my dream job at the age of 25 but unfortunately I have reached a stage where I am not able to give our players the level of care they deserve," he said.
He thanked his colleagues for their support during his illness.
"The fact that people who achieved so much in the game offer their time and support shows what sort of club Mansfield Town is and mirrors the principles that the town was built on," he said.
"I will finish by wishing the club, players, staff and fans all the best for next season and I look forward to the club playing League One football, which everyone at the club deserves."
The club said Mr Salmon was surrounded by his family and friends when he died peacefully during the early hours of Friday.
Chairman John Radford said he was a "thoroughly decent person" and everyone at Mansfield Town would miss him.
In a statement, youth directors Mark Hawkins and Steve Hymas said: "Matt was an inspirational person, taken far too young."
