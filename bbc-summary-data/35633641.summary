The 45-year-old will continue to be assisted by Andy Dawson, 37.
The duo were placed in temporary charge of the Iron in January following the sacking of Mark Robins and have led the side to four wins in five games.
"We've seen what they've done over the period they've been in charge and we have been impressed," chairman Peter Swann told the club website.
"They've worked very hard and the players are responding to them and we thought it was really important we kept that intact and it gives us a chance to still reach the play-offs.
"We've seen a natural course of events, with Nick leading the way with plenty of support from Andy and I think as a duo they work very well together."
The pair were placed in charge of the League One side after a 5-0 defeat by struggling Blackpool.
Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Fleetwood followed four successive victories, leaving them 13th in the table, but only eight points outside the play-off places.
The Glanford Park side face Oldham Athletic on Saturday.
