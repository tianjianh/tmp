Total revenues for the period stood at £2bn against £1.4bn a year earlier.
Combined broadcast and online revenues for the nine months to the end of September were 7% higher at £1.5bn.
ITV added the outlook for 2016 was "encouraging" after net advertising revenue grew in line with expectations in its third quarter.
The broadcaster said advertising revenue from its family of channels was up 6% in the nine months to the end of September.
It forecast revenue would be up by at least 5% in the full year, outperforming the overall market.
Adam Crozier, chief executive of ITV said: "We're on track for another year of double digit profit growth as we continue to strengthen ITV in the UK and internationally.
"As we expected, share of viewing has improved in the second half driven by strong performances in daytime, the soaps and the Rugby World Cup, and continuing this trend remains a key focus for the business."
The earnings statement comes less than a month after ITV bought the televisions business of UTV Media for £100m.
It means that ITV now owns 13 of the 15 regional television brands that once made up the network of independent television stations on the UK's third terrestrial television channel.
