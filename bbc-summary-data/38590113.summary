[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An MP has told how his father "died in my arms" after being sent home due to a shortage of hospital beds.

Toby Perkins told a Commons debate on the NHS his father went to Coventry and Warwickshire Hospital in July 2015 suffering from "extreme pain".
He had symptoms of an aneurysm but was sent home after five hours in A&E, the Chesterfield MP said. His father died four days later.
The BBC has contacted the hospital for a response.
Mr Perkins' father had suffered a near-fatal aneurysm three years earlier while on holiday in Germany.
He added he was "ashamed to say that I'm grateful" his father had the first aneurysm abroad, as "the quality of the emergency care he received in Munich saved his life".
"I regret the same could not be said of our NHS," he added.
Mr Perkins told ministers the registrar who saw his father commented it had been a "non-stop afternoon" and asked his father whether he minded going home.
"He said he had sent home five people who should have been in hospital because they were not enough beds.
"These pressures and these life and death decisions are not unique to that registrar, or to that hospital."
The NHS and social care is in the midst of a crisis that leaves the elderly and disabled isolated and struggling to cope, and "means people being sent home from A&E to die", Mr Perkins said.
"We must do better," he added.
