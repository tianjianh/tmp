The 20-year-old made his debut for Shrewsbury in their League Two match against York on Saturday.
Grimmer made 14 appearances for Port Vale during a loan spell last season, scoring once.
"I spoke to the coach and he is under the impression that I will fit in nicely to the way he wants to play," said Grimmer.
"I know a few of the players from previous clubs and I played against Shrewsbury last season when I was on loan at Port Vale.
"They all said good things and give it plenty of compliments, so that really was a factor in making it an easy choice to come."
