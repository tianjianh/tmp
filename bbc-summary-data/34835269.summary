A footballer who covered the cost of damage caused by a fan celebrating his goal has said he might take up the offer of a drink in return.

Ipswich fan Ross Morgan punched a hole in the ceiling of his flat while celebrating Paul Anderson's equaliser against rivals Norwich, in May.
Anderson paid the Â£80 bill after Mr Morgan posted a photograph on Twitter.
"He said he'd buy me a drink and I might take him up on the offer," said Anderson, now with Bradford City.
"I'm glad we got it sorted out," the footballer said. "It took a bit of time though."
The delay in getting the ceiling repaired was partly because Anderson moved to the League One side in the summer, and has since broken his leg.
Salesman Mr Morgan, from Wetherby, near Leeds, said: "Ando offered to sort somebody to do it, the Ipswich kit man, but he obviously isn't with the club anymore.
"So I said I'd sort it myself and was let down by a few different people.
"It's now been repaired after a long time trying to get it sorted. He's a top bloke."
Recalling his goal in the 1-1 play-off first leg, Anderson said: "It was one of the best feelings you can ever have - it was amazing for me. The noise was unbelievable.
"There was such a buzz at the time. Ross sent me a picture of the ceiling and I said I'd pay for the damage.
"I didn't really mean for any of it to go public."
Mr Morgan said he was now trying to remain calmer during televised matches.
"I've tried to learn my lesson - especially now that Ando's left, I've got no-one to pay for any damage," he said.
