[SN]TITLE[SN]
Decisions due on 1,500 student housing units in Belfast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Decisions on whether to allow more than 1,500 student housing units in Belfast will be made by the council's planning committee next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The committee is considering five separate applications made by different developers.
Planners have recommended that the two largest schemes should be approved but said the others should be refused.
The planning committee is due to meet on Tuesday.
There have been a significant number of student housing applications ahead of the expansion of the Ulster University's Belfast campus.
One of the schemes recommended for approval next week is a 14-storey, 590 unit development on York Street.
The other is for 475 units in a 11-storey development on Great Patrick Street.
The three schemes which have been recommended for refusal concern developments planned for Royal Avenue, Stephen Street and Clifton Street.
Some student housing schemes have already been approved.
A 45-bedroom development on Donegall Street is already operating and a major scheme at John Bell House is due to open in September.
