[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yang Gang was party secretary in the autonomous region's capital, Urumqi, from 1999 to 2006.
The Beijing court heard he took 13.79m yuan ($2.10m; Â£1.5m) in bribes to help others to win promotions and contracts.
Yang was formally accused of corruption last year, after an investigation that began in 2013.
The court said his sentence was lighter than it could have been because he confessed his crimes and helped with the investigation, said the Xinhua news agency.
China has been conducting a widespread crackdown on corruption, across the public and private sectors.
Dozens of high level officials have been jailed in recent years, a drive seen by some as having a political motive.
