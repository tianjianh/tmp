Officers expect to stop thousands of motorists in Wales as part of the campaign which runs until 10 July.
Meanwhile, Welsh castles and landmarks are being illuminated red from Friday to mark Wales playing in their first major tournament for 58 years.
Wales' first game is on Saturday against Slovakia in Bordeaux.
About 24,000 Welsh fans have tickets for the game.
A Cardiff fanzone with a giant screen for supporters to watch Wales compete will be set up in the city's Bute Park for 6,000 fans.
Swansea council announced last week fans would be able to watch matches on the big screen in Castle Square.
And people across Wales are expected to host their own parties to watch the games which include a match between Wales and England next Thursday.
Dyfed Powys Police Assistant Chief Constable Pam Kelly advised people to plan ahead, saying there was "no excuse" to drive under the influence.
She said: "We absolutely want people to have a great time and to support Wales.
"But there's a really important message that we want people to remember and that is that during the next two months, all four Welsh forces are going to be committed to the summer anti drink and drug campaign.
"What am I asking people to do is make a choice; they should either drink or drive, they should never do both."
During a similar safety campaign in Wales in 2015, more than 12,000 breath tests were carried out with almost 8,000 people arrested for drug driving in England and Wales last year.
Supt Andrew Morgan, Wales commander for the British Transport Police, told BBC Wales that his force was "not going to over-egg the pudding" but added they would crack down on anti-social behaviour.
"We have a very low tolerance threshold for people that overstep the mark. Passengers and staff deserve that."
The Welsh Government has announced it is lighting up landmarks across Wales, including Cardiff's Millennium Centre and the Senedd.
Welsh castles being lit up include Beaumaris, Caernarfon, Caerphilly, Conwy, Criccieth, Denbigh, Harlech, Kidwelly and Llansteffan.
The lights will stay on throughout the group stages and for as long as Wales remains in the tournament.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: "This is a fantastic time to be a Welsh football fan.
"The European Championships is one of the world's highest profile sporting events, attracting almost two billion global viewers and we are so proud that Wales is finally part of it."
