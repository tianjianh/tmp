[SN]TITLE[SN]
US swimmers were not robbed, says Rio police chief

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four US Olympic gold medal swimmers who said they had been robbed in Rio de Janeiro were not victims of crime, the head of the city's civil police says.

Fernando Veloso told reporters that one or more of the men had instead vandalised part of a petrol station and then offered to pay for the damage.
The Americans paid and left after armed security guards intervened, he said.
One guard had justifiably drawn his gun after one of the swimmers began behaving erratically, Mr Veloso added.
Three of the swimmers remain in Brazil. The fourth, Ryan Lochte, returned to the US on Monday.
Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were prevented from leaving Brazil at Rio de Janeiro airport on Wednesday night and have since been questioned by police. Team-mate James Feigen has also remained in Brazil and says he is co-operating with the authorities.
Five times Lochte made a splash
The swimmers, who have repeatedly changed their accounts of what happened, could "in theory" face charges of giving false testimony and vandalism, Mr Veloso told reporters during a news conference at Rio police headquarters.
Mr Lochte was "very angry because he was intoxicated" during the incident, he said.
The people of Rio were unhappy to see the reputation of their city damaged, Mr Veloso said, adding: "We are dealing with important public figures who influence others and should know how to comport themselves... An apology would be welcomed."
Earlier, a Rio 2016 spokesman had tried to make light of the case.
"These kids tried to have fun, they tried to represent their country to the best of their abilities," Mario Andrada told reporters.
"They competed under gigantic pressure. Let's give these kids a break. Sometime you take actions that you later regret.
"They had fun, they made a mistake, life goes on."

Lochte is one of the most successful swimmers in history, with 12 Olympic medals, and he once had his own reality television show in the US. In Rio, he swam in two events, winning gold in the 4x200m freestyle relay along with Conger.
Feigen won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay.
Bentz competed in the 4x200m preliminaries, but not the final. He still received a gold medal after the US team's win.
