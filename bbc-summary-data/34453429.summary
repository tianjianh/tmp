[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rabbit whose teeth were so overgrown that it was unable to eat, has been found abandoned.

The RSPCA said the teeth on the female domestic rabbit, spotted by a member of the public in Peterborough, were "some of the worst" it had seen.
Inspector Justin Stubbs said: "Had she not been found when she was, she would have likely starved to death."
The rabbit, which has been renamed Holly after the vet who attended to her, has now had the teeth removed.
The RSPCA said she should make a "good recovery" and will hopefully be rehomed.
Her bottom teeth were about 4cm (1.5in) long and protruded from her mouth, with the top teeth a similar length.
Mr Stubbs said: "Who knows how long she had been living stray like this but it could be that someone let her go or dumped her as a result of not wanting to get treatment for her."
The rabbit was found by the side of the road in Sunningdale, Orton Brimbles, on Wednesday.
Dr Jane Tyson, rabbit behaviour and welfare expert at the RSPCA, said: "A lot of people don't realise that a rabbit's teeth grow continuously.
"We recommend rabbit teeth are checked at least once a week to ensure they stay healthy."
