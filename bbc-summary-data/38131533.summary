Kajsa Tylen, 40, from Nottingham, broke Billie Fleming's 1938 record of 29,604 miles (47,642 km) on 24 November, but continued cycling until the end of the year.
She has cycled every day since 1 January riding across England and parts of mainland Europe.
She says she took on the challenge to inspire people to do more exercise.
Ms Tylen has built up the miles by riding from her home in Nottingham as well as taking part in events across the country.
For the last day, she left home and finished at Leisure Lakes Bikes in Breaston, Derbyshire.
The business analyst, originally from Sweden, battled through illness, bad weather and muscular pain to surpass Ms Fleming's record.

Ms Tylen, who took a year off work, said: "It's not sunk in yet and I don't think it ever will it's a such a ridiculously big number to have ridden.
"I always knew I'd finish it unless I got injured or ill, but sometimes I wanted to pack it all in.
"I had to write event logs and I've got notes on the back on them and on some I've just written "why am I doing this?".
She cycled across Europe, battling through strong headwinds and heavy rain.
In Scandinavia, in the summer, she rode through the night while the sun was still visible, an experience she described as "spectacular".
Her achievement is expected to be verified with Guinness World Records at a later date.
US cyclist Amanda Coker also claims to have broken Billie Fleming's record, but has been riding to a different set of rules.
She is allowed to slipstream other riders and use a different bicycle if she wishes, while Ms Tylen cannot.
