As the clean-up continues in Cumbria after the county was battered by Storm Desmond, a digital campaign to capture the solidarity of those offering help has reached more than 13 million people on Twitter, its organisers say.

The deluge brought by Friday's storm left thousands of homes flooded and caused widespread damage.
As was the case in 2005 and 2009, the community has rallied together to offer help, places to stay and provide donations to those affected.
And the county's newspapers are no exception - coming together to help in the efforts by starting the online campaign #SpiritofCumbria.
Helen Statham, social media specialist at the CN newspaper group, said: "After the floods lots of different people were tweeting about offers of help, messages of support and businesses saying they were open.
"The messages were all really positive so we decided to get together to reflect that mood.
"We decided to create a website as a sort of online hub to capture that vibe and it's really caught on."
Set up by the CN newspaper group, the website has four sections to connect residents together. People can find out which businesses are open, see who is offering and in need of help, and leave messages of thanks to those who have helped them.
Offers of furniture, clothing and assistance have not only come in from those in the county - but from all over the UK.
CN Group said it used the Hashtracking.com website to find the #spiritofcumbria hashtag had reached 13 million people via tweets and retweets.
Ms Statham added: "It's very inspiring - I think the hashtag speaks for itself and it's a testament to the effort that has been put in from all over the region."
An online appeal set up to help those affected by flooding in Cumbria has raised more than Â£560,000.
