[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers to challenge Sainsbury's stadium ruling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol Rovers are to appeal against a decision that allowed Sainsbury's to walk away from a ??30m stadium deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sainsbury's agreed to buy Memorial Stadium in 2011 and lease it to the club, which planned to build a new 21,700-seat stadium north of the city.
A High Court judge previously ruled Sainsbury's was within its rights to pull out as conditions had not been met.
The club has confirmed it will apply for leave to appeal on 31 July.
The club described the ruling as a "kick in the teeth", and Bristol's elected mayor, George Ferguson, said it was "deeply disappointing".
The cash from the sale of 12,000-capacity Memorial Stadium in Horfield, described in court as "old fashioned and rather dilapidated", was going to pay for a new ??40m ground in Stoke Gifford.
A Rovers spokesman said the League Two side was still "committed to building a new stadium to secure the club's future".
The contract to buy the club's current stadium for ??30m was signed in December 2011, but planning permission for a new supermarket on the site was not granted until January 2013 and was further delayed by judicial review.
At a six-day High Court hearing in May, Sainsbury's argued it had "lawfully terminated" the contract when planning conditions were not met before the "cut-off date" in the agreement.
But the club said there had been a "misunderstanding" about the significance of the cut-off date and argued the contract was still valid, or had been terminated in breach of its terms.
Mrs Justice Proudman ruled that "Sainsbury's must succeed" because the construction of a schedule to the agreement "seems like an insuperable barrier" to the football club winning the case.
A spokesman for the supermarket said: "We understand that this is a sensitive issue locally and that there will also be disappointment as a result of the court's decision today."
