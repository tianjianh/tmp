Leicestershire v Sussex: Mark Cosgrove ton builds Leicestershire innings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Cosgrove's 35th first-class century helped hosts Leicestershire build a decent first-innings score against Sussex on day one.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After signing a new deal earlier on Friday, Cosgrove hit an unbeaten 122 as Leicestershire closed on 322-7.
Having been put into bat, opener Paul Horton made 71 before being bowled by Sussex's in-form Jofra Archer (5-61).
Number nine batsman Zak Chappell provided good support for captain Cosgrove, reaching stumps on 40.
