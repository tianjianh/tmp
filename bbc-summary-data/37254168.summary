An exhibition of ceramic poppies at Lincoln Castle marking the centenary of World War One has attracted over 500,000 visitors.

The Wave, by artist Paul Cummins, was installed at the castle three months ago as part of a national tour.
His full installation, named Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, drew more than five million visitors to the Tower of London in 2014.
Each poppy represented one death in the British forces, a total of 888,246.
Jon Hogan, public engagement manager at the castle, said numbers had exceeded his wildest expectations.
He said as well as people of all ages coming to appreciated the artwork in its own right, the poppies were a fitting tribute to Lincolnshire's part in the conflict.

Officials said the free exhibition in Lincoln, which attracted nearly 30,000 visitors in its first weekend, had led to a significant rise in visitors to the castle, which reopened last year after a multimillion-pound refurbishment.
The exhibition closes on Sunday.
Another section of the poppy display - known as the cascade, or Weeping Window - is on display at Black Watch Castle and Museum, in Perth, from 30 June to 25 September, and at Caernarfon Castle from 12 October to 20 November 2016.
