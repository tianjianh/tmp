A Danish court has upheld an extradition order for the 20-year-old daughter of the woman at the centre of South Korea's presidential scandal.

Dressage rider Chung Yoo-ra is the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, a close friend of former President Park Geun-hye who is on trial in Seoul for abuse of power and attempted fraud.
She is alleged to have used that friendship to benefit her daughter.
Ms Chung was arrested in Denmark in January.
She initially appeared in court charged with overstaying her visa.
Last month the public prosecutor ordered her extradition "for the purpose of prosecution in her home country". She is accused by the South Korean authorities of offences including involvement in economic crimes and exam fraud, which she denies, Danish TV reported.
Ms Chung - who has a son aged almost two years old - has been in custody since her arrest in January. Her son is being looked after by social services, Nyheder TV said.
She can now appeal to Denmark's high court following the Aalborg district court's decision.
South Korean authorities had asked for Interpol's help in tracing Ms Chung, a former member of the national equestrian team, after she failed to return to answer questions about her role in the scandal.
Part of the investigation into her mother's activities relates to a gift horse from South Korean conglomerate Samsung to Ms Choi, allegedly for Ms Chung's training.
The prestigious Ewha Women's University in Seoul is also accused of giving Ms Chung a place - she has since left - because of her mother's connections.

In March Ms Park became the country's first democratically-elected leader to be forced from office after judges upheld parliament's decision to impeach her.
She and Ms Choi are now both on trial in cases that centre on allegations that Ms Park gave Ms Choi unauthorised access to government decisions and allowed her to exploit their close relationship to solicit money from corporations for foundations from which she benefitted.
On Monday Ms Park was formally charged with bribery, coercion, abuse of power and leaking state secrets. She is currently in custody.
Both women have apologised but deny committing criminal offences.
