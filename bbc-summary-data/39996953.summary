[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care home resident was left in a bed without being given a bath or shower for five months, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found.

Inspectors made an unannounced visit to Carson House Care Centre in Stalybridge on 16 January after concerns were raised about safety.
Their report, which rated the home inadequate, said it was unclean, smelly and placed it in special measures.
The home's receivers said it has been under new management since January.
Most staff were caring, the report found though, and many relatives had no complaints.
"Everyone is so nice. I give them 10 out of 10. I've never found anything wrong," said one visitor.
However, not all family members were happy with the service and a complaint was made to the CQC about the lack of a hoist on the ground floor.
Inspectors found one person who had not been hoisted out of bed since their admission in August 2016.
The care plan specified they should sit out of bed for two hours a day.
A second case was also highlighted where a resident had been nursed in bed for three months.
Inadequate equipment and "challenging behaviour" were blamed but inspectors said they did not find any rationale for this.
"This placed the person at risk of social isolation, pressure sores, muscle wastage and other health complications," the report said.
The commission's findings, published on 12 May, said another person was "visibly suffering from an eye infection" but no GP had been called.
Another had long and overgrown toenails which required attention to prevent harm.
People mostly received support by caring staff, the report said, however, people were not always treated with dignity nor had their privacy respected.
The CQC report also found:
Many of the bedrooms had a "strong malodour" and one was so smelly inspectors asked for it be deep cleaned.
One staff member said: "Cleanliness is not good. Some days there's a cleaner on the unit and some days there is not."
Stained carpets, broken sinks and cracked window panes were also noted.
At the time of the inspection, a receivership company had been appointed to sell the home and an external care management organisation had been appointed to oversee the day-to-day management, the report said.
The home's receivers FRP Advisory said that since January Carson House Care Centre had been under new independent management brought in by the receivers.
A FRP Advisory spokesman said the new management team was brought in to "help start the transformation of the home and address any legacy issues to ensure that the provision of services for residents... was at the core of operational decision making".
