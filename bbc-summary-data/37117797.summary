County Championship: Warwickshire's Jeetan Patel helps to bowl out Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire off-spinner Jeetan Patel claimed the 23rd five-wicket haul of his first-class career to help bowl out Durham for 207 at Chester-le-Street.

Patel cleaned up the Durham tail, taking 5-32 to become the first bowler to pass 50 Championship wickets for the season - the fifth successive summer he has reached that mark for the Bears.
Michael Richardson made 55, his first Championship half-century since May.
Warwickshire then reached the close on 25-1 for the loss of Varun Chopra.
He was given out to a leg-side catch off Chris Rushworth in the penultimate over, forcing nightwatchman Chris Wright to come in and face 10 balls before the close.
Wright ended two not out, while Ian Westwood (12) will also still be there on the second morning.
Warwickshire, who have dropped to sixth in Division One, began the game just a point above seventh-placed Durham,  who currently have a 16-point cushion to the relegation zone, currently occupied by Hampshire and Nottinghamshire.
Keith Barker was the Bears' other star performer with the ball, taking three of the first five wickets to fall- the first of which was his 50th Championship dismissal of a Durham batsman since 2012.
Warwickshire off spinner Jeetan Patel told BBC WM:
"Milestones are nice, but doing the right things and getting over the line is the important part.
"We thought the pitch was a bit tacky and it might turn, and Scott Borthwick could be threat with his wrist spin.
"We've had a good day, but Durham have a very good seam attack and it won't be easy against them."
