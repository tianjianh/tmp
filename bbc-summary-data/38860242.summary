Moore and Mica McNeill won the junior Bobsleigh World Championship pair in Winterberg despite only beginning to compete together this winter.
The 24-year-old is hoping to compete in the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February 2018.
She also aims to represent Wales in the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.
"Bobsleigh is taking priority at the moment but it will interesting to see where my athletics is," said Moore.
Prior to taking up bobsleigh, Moore competed for Wales as a sprinter at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and had a 100m personal best of 11.65 seconds.
Moore has turned to bobsleigh this winter and after two silvers and a bronze on the North American circuit, the Newport sprinter struck gold in Germany with McNeil.
"It was my first World Junior Championships, so to win gold was very satisfying," Moore told BBC Wales Sport.
"It was especially nice to have my Dad out there watching me live for the first time.
"He drove all the way out there which took about 12 hours but he said it was the most thrilling thing he had ever seen.
"Things haven't always gone to plan so far. In Altenberg in a World Cup race we came off the last corner and we crashed.
"It's not a nice experience but not as scary as you might thing. You just have to get back on the sled and I have complete trust in Mica as a driver.
"It's very hard work which I really enjoy, although it's so different to athletics."
Moore will now have to wait and see whether she is chosen for the World Championships in Konigssee which takes place between 17 and 26 February.
The Welsh woman has been alternating with fellow Great Britain sprinter Montell Douglas to partner McNeill during this season.
Douglas and McNeill won gold in the Europa Cup event staged at Winterberg two days before the junior competition. The pair are in action at the World Cup event in Austria this weekend.
