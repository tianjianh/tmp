[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge scored his first ever hat-trick as the Reds consigned Fulham to a fifth league defeat in a row.

Dimitar Berbatov headed Fulham into the lead from Sascha Riether's cross, only for Sturridge to lash in an equaliser.
The home side were denied a penalty for a Lucas Leiva handball before Sturridge slotted in his side's second.

Liverpool were creating chances at will and Sturridge grabbed his third when he chipped over keeper Mark Schwarzer.
Fulham boss Martin Jol had a suitably concerned expression on his face at the final whistle after his side's capitulation left them with just one point from their last seven games.
It is a run of results that means the Cottagers are still not mathematically safe from relegation, although it would take an unlikely set of scores for them to go down.
They were easily undone here by a Liverpool side without two of their pivotal players, with midfielder Steven Gerrard injured and striker Luis Suarez suspended.
The visitors began in enterprising fashion but Fulham gradually worked their way back into the match before taking the lead.
"Liverpool are now unbeaten in their last seven games and on this sort of form might be contenders for a Champions League spot next season. Fulham, who started the season brightly, have fallen away badly and have relied too much on their player of the year Dimitar Berbatov."
Damien Duff fed Riether and the German full-back crossed for the previously anonymous Berbatov to head in at the far post.
Liverpool's response was almost immediate, as they took just three minutes to equalise. A long Andre Wisdom ball was gathered by Sturridge, who twisted and turned Aaron Hughes before bursting past the defender to lash a shot past keeper Schwarzer.
The visitors made no further progress before half-time, however, and after the break the home side were furious that referee Mark Halsey failed to award them a penalty when a Bryan Ruiz cross struck the outstretched arm of Lucas Leiva.
The decision rocked Fulham and Liverpool capitalised by immediately going up the other end and scoring. Philippe Coutinho slipped as he attempted a shot but his effort fell to Sturridge, who controlled and slotted past Schwarzer.
Sturridge's hat-trick bid was initially thwarted by two superb Schwarzer saves, while Reds keeper Pepe Reina pulled off equally impressive saves to keep out a Berbatov shot and Aaron Hughes header.

But Liverpool were in rampant form, regularly opening up Fulham's defence, with Reds substitute Fabio Borini cutting inside and rattling the post with a well-struck shot.
Schwarzer was doing his best to limit the damage but Sturridge's third finally arrived when he latched on to an incisive Coutinho pass before chipping the ball over the on-rushing keeper.
Fulham boss Martin Jol:
"It should have been a penalty [for the Lucas Leiva handball].
"[The game] was frustrating. Normally if we score we win games. We never seem to win games after being down."
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers:
"Daniel was outstanding. He scored three goals and he could have had maybe six.
"If he keeps improving, keeps training well, then I think he will have an outstanding couple of years for us.
"He's not perfect. He should have squared one when he was through. But he was looking for his hat-trick, he's a goalscorer, and to be greedy you've got to be good. He's an outstanding player."
