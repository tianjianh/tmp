Two light aircraft that came within 200m of colliding avoided a crash when one pilot spotted the danger at the last minute, a report said.

The Pilatus PC12 and Cessna C152 were on a collision course over Denham Airfield, Buckinghamshire last May, the UK Airprox Board (UKAB) report showed.
The Pilatus pilot saw the Cessna "very close" on his right and turned left.
The C152 pilot said he saw the gold aircraft 150-200m away but did not have time to take avoiding action.
UKAB said "chance" had played a large part in the two planes coming so close at an altitude of about 1,000 ft, just after 09:00 BST on 23 May, but the PC12 pilot "flew into conflict" with the C152.
The board said it was "unfortunate" the PC12 pilot had not seen the C152 earlier, but it was "fortunate" he did eventually see it, albeit at close range.
UKAB said both pilots shared equal responsibility for avoiding the collision, but the C152 pilot, who was instructing a student at the time, had right of way. He had recorded a "high risk" of collision.
"With a combination of a late sighting, relatively high overtake speed, and reported hard turn away, it was also agreed that separation had been reduced to the minimum, and that chance had played a major part in events," the report said.
