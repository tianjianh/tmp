The 31-year-old scored 47 goals in 125 appearances for Palace after joining from Brighton in May 2011.
The Cherries have also signed Aston Villa left-back Joe Bennett, 25, on a loan deal until January.
And Argentine midfielder Tomas Andrade, 19, has joined from River Plate until the end of the season.
Murray scored eight goals in 18 league games for Reading before returning to Selhurst Park and netting seven goals in their final 13 games of the Premier League season.
"I've come across the club a lot in my career and it's been great to see it progress," said Murray.
"The way the boys play football is very exciting. It's front-footed and it will be nice to try and get some goals from it."
Murray played for Carlisle and Rochdale before joining Brighton in January 2008 and moving to Palace in 2011 on a free transfer.
Bennett, who spent last season on loan at Brighton, is Bournemouth's 11th signing of the summer. He has also signed a one-year contract extension with Villa.
"They've already made a positive start to the new season and, like everyone else, I've been really impressed with the fantastic job Eddie Howe has performed," he said.
"It's a good opportunity for me to add to the Premier League experience I've already amassed from my time at Aston Villa."
Andrade, who had a pre-season trial with Everton, will be part of the club's under-21s squad.
The Cherries have taken four points from their first four games in the top flight, where they are playing for the first time in their history after winning the Championship last season.
