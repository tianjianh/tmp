The 24-year-old finished his 36 holes of qualifying on nine under and then emerged from a seven-man play-off to grab one of the final four spots.
In all, there were 15 places available at the qualifying tournament.
Three-time major champion Padraig Harrington missed out on qualification after finishing on one over.
Gryestones golfer Dunne joins Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Shane Lowry in the field at Erin Hills in Wisconsin on 15-18 June.
2011 winner Rory McIlroy's participation in the tournament is in doubt as he continues to recover from a rib injury.
