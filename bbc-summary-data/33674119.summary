A man whose home was partially destroyed when a tractor's trailer crashed into it has described the devastation as "like a war zone".

The accident happened on Sunday in Wilburton, Cambridgeshire.
Dave McCarthy, who rents the house, said "about 20 tonnes of maize" on the trailer ended up in his living room. No-one was in at the time of the crash.
No action would be taken against the driver, a 26-year-old man from Ely, who was uninjured, police said.
The crash, at about 09:00 BST, "blew both front doors out but thankfully nobody was here and nobody got hurt", said Mr McCarthy, who was at work at the time of the crash.
"I'd even decided at the last minute to take the dog to work with me, otherwise she would have no doubt been buried in maize, as it was knee-deep."
He said it was "an accident waiting to happen".
"We'd like to see traffic calming measures, having seen how the lorries and tractors come through this village, but unless the road is reclassified as an 'A' road, that can't happen," he added.
In January 2011, before Mr McCarthy moved in, a tractor carrying carrots crashed into the front of the house, which then had to be partially rebuilt
