The 27-year-old, who has played 164 times for Southend, helped the Shrimpers win promotion to League One via the play-offs last season.
But Prosser has only featured once since 24 November and his contract is due to expire in the summer.
"The boys are doing fantastically well, if I can help it will be brilliant," he told BBC Radio Northampton.
"There was interest in the summer but I was contracted to Southend and they weren't willing to let me go, but as of late I've been limited to games so there was an opportunity for me to come here."
