Piepa Cleary, 19, who plays for Perth Scorchers in the women's T20 Big Bash League, was guilty of breaching Cricket Australia's (CA) anti-corruption code.
"Bets totalling £7.60 might seem small but it doesn't matter," said CA Integrity Unit boss Iain Roy.
Cleary is the second female Australian cricketer to receive a ban for betting.
In December, Angela Reakes, who plays for ACT Meteors in the Women's National Cricket League, was given a two-year suspended sentence for bets totalling Aus $9 (£4.36) during the 2015 Cricket World Cup.
Cleary also received a further 18-month suspended sentence after CA said she had received face-to-face anti-corruption training two months before she placed the bets.
Roy added: "We take a zero tolerance approach to any form of gambling on cricket by players in order to protect the integrity of the game."
