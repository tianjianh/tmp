Call for swift Jim Clark Rally return after accident inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A call has been made for the Jim Clark Rally to return "as quickly as possible" after an inquiry into three deaths at the event in 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A motion has been tabled to Scottish Borders Council seeking the move.
A joint fatal accident inquiry into the deaths and one at the Snowman Rally in Inverness is to be held in July.
Councillor Frances Renton has asked the authority to work for a swift return of the event as long as the inquiry's findings do not inhibit it.
The inquiry, which will be held in Edinburgh, is due to begin on 17 July.
It will consider the deaths of Joy Robson at the Snowman Rally in 2013 and Iain Provan, Elizabeth Allan and Len Stern at the Jim Clark Rally near Coldstream in 2014.
A motion tabled by Ms Renton to be discussed by Scottish Borders Council this week asks the authority's chief executive Tracey Logan to take action after "carefully considering the findings" of the inquiry.
She has been asked to "work positively with all relevant parties" to restore the rally as quickly as possible.
The event has not been held on its traditional route since the deaths in 2014 and there are concerns over its long-term future.
