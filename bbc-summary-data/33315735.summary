Greece: How to survive the country's cash crisis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland does very little business with Greece - just £8.5m of manufacturing exports went there last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
That is a fraction of 1% of total manufacturing exports which were around £18bn.
However, the Greek islands are a tourist destination - Jet2, Falcon and Thomas Cook all fly to Greece from Belfast.
For tourists, the concern is paying for goods and services once they get there.
ATMs are currently limited to 60 euro (£42.50) a day withdrawals, but the Greek government has emphasised that applies only to Greek-issued bank cards.
But, in practice, visitors may struggle to withdraw much more than that, given then high demand at cash machines.
The official advice from the Foreign Office is that people have enough euros in cash to cover emergencies, unforeseen circumstances and any unexpected delays.
It has also warned that banking services throughout Greece, including credit card processing and servicing of ATMs, could potentially become limited at short notice.
In practice, travellers should probably bring enough cash to cover any likely payments on a trip.
Euros are cheap at the moment.
This time last year it cost about 80p to buy one euro - today it is closer to 70p.
