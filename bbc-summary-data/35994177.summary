[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Robert Snodgrass' injury-time free-kick bounced in off unfortunate goalkeeper Carl Ikeme to give promotion-chasing Hull City victory over Wolves.

The hosts went ahead in the fifth minute when Adama Diomande tapped home after Ikeme spilled a loose ball.
Dave Edwards, unmarked in the penalty area, headed past Allan McGregor to draw mid-table Wanderers level.
At the end of a dreary second half, Snodgrass' set-piece hit the bar before ricocheting off Ikeme into the net.
Hull, who had won only one of their previous eight league matches, remain fourth in the table.
They are eight points behind Brighton, who beat Fulham 5-0 on Friday to move into second, with five games left to play - one more than the Seagulls.
The game began perfectly for the Tigers when a youthful Wolves defence, missing captain Danny Batth because of illness, failed to clear a through ball and Diomande scored on his first league start for Hull.
Edwards, leading Wolves in Batth's absence, was afforded time and space to meet Jeremy Helan's cross and score from six yards out to equalise.
As both sides struggled to find a cutting edge in the final third, it took until the 87th minute for the next effort on target, substitute Sone Aluko's low shot forcing Ikeme into a smart save.
With the match looking destined to end in a draw, Snodgrass stepped up to help give Hull a precious three points.

Hull City boss Steve Bruce told BBC Radio Humberside: "It wasn't good enough.
"I've been around the block many, many times and it is amazing that when you are in a bad place in terms of results you lose that bit of confidence and you get edgy. That tumbles into the supporters.
"Let's hope that is the spark that re-ignites us again.
"Nobody has to tell me we are under-performing at this moment in time but we have not got a divine right to romp this league."

Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett told BBC WM: "It was an excellent free-kick. Carl had no chance.
"We played well in the first half, despite the early goal and a couple of mistakes. We offered a threat going forward and we played some good football.
"In the second half, although we were solid and competitive, I didn't think we had enough of a threat. Overall, we were unlucky not to get anything out of the game."
