Northern Ireland Water pre-tax profits fall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland Water has said its pre-tax profits fell by £7m this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It reported profits of £131.5m, down from £138.5m for the same period in 2014.
NI Water was formed in 2007 and is owned by the Department for Regional Development.
Its latest accounts showed that it takes around £435m each year to run its water and wastewater businesses in Northern Ireland.
Its annual report says average bills for customers fell by about 12% over the last two years, with bills for business customers down 4%.
However, bills in Northern Ireland still remain much higher than in England and Wales, on average £411 per year against £385 per year.
Its report sets out a range of targets to measure the company's performance, many of which it met, including the number of complaints.
However, it missed its targets in relation to reducing the length of time to reconnect customers who have their water supply disrupted, as well as the number of houses affected by overflowing sewers.
Its report says weak economic conditions in Northern Ireland in recent years have had an impact on NI Water's financial performance, mainly in relation to lower levels of consumption.
