A fresh funding package worth more than £30m has opened for victims and survivors of the Troubles.

The Victims Support Programme, worth £18.7m and European Union's PEACE IV programme worth a further €17.6m (£14.9m), have opened together.
The Victims and Survivors Service (VSS) has invited organisations which work with or represent victims and survivors to apply for the funding.
The aim is to make the process simpler for organisations applying to them.
First Minister Arlene Foster said the executive was "committed" to improving services for victims and survivors.
"I am confident that the opening of these two key funding streams will enhance the services already provided by the Victims and Survivors Service," she said.
"As an executive we will continue to do everything possible to provide the best services available to victims and survivors to improve their quality of life and ensure their needs are being fully met," she added.
The Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness said "victims and survivors are some of the most vulnerable people in society and it is imperative to provide services which are sensitive yet responsive to their needs".
"Meeting the needs in a way that is outcome focused and victim centred is crucial," he added.
"This funding in excess of £30m will go some way to helping us achieve this."
