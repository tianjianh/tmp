A memorial to 42 victims of the Great Flood in 1953 is being installed in the Lincolnshire resort of Mablethorpe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tribute will be unveiled on 31 January to mark the 60th anniversary of the flood.
Former Mayor of Mablethorpe and Sutton on Sea Helen Parkhurst helped raised the funds for the memorial as part of her civic engagements in 2010.
The 6ft tall, six tonne Norwegian granite stone will be placed on the seafront.
The flood victims died on 31 January when sea water breached the coastal defences causing widespread damage along England's east coast.
A total of 307 people drowned in England and 24,000 homes were damaged.
Mrs Parkhurst said: "The memorial rock, which is the same type as those used in sea defences, will provide a lasting memorial to those who lost their lives."
Leader of East Lindsey District Council, Councillor Doreen Stephenson, said: "Although 60 years have passed it is important we remember that flood risk is still an issue we face.
"We must ensure we're all prepared should sea waters breach our defences again in such a way."
The memorial will be located by the skate park on North Promenade.
