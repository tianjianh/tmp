Heseltine: Teesside can become 'bustling powerhouse'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Tees Valley, where thousands of jobs were lost when Redcar's steelworks closed, can become a "bustling powerhouse of economic activity", a report has said.

About 3,000 direct and indirect jobs were lost after the SSI plant closed.
The 90-page document by Lord Heseltine proposes a new development corporation as well as plans to increase tourism.
Redcar and Cleveland Council leader, Sue Jeffrey, said the area still had "huge potential".
The Labour council leader has been put on the new South Tees Development Corporation's board of local business people and local authority leaders charged with drawing up proposals for the use of the former steelworks site.
They had to "come up with a vision for that whole site about how it could be regenerated, how it can be refreshed, how we can bring inward investment and jobs and actually make the most of what is a key industrial site for the whole of the Tees Valley", she said.
The former Conservative deputy prime minister, Lord Heseltine, said he had been "slightly surprised" by the area's "can-do attitude".
"Wherever you go, you find bright, intelligent and hard working people who are determined to make a success of this place and know how to do it," he said.
Lord Heseltine wants to see more apprenticeships created, more starter homes built and a change in the industrial identity of Teesside to try to attract more tourists.
The steel works have been in the hands of receivers since the site's owner Sahaviriya Steel Industries UK (SSI) was wound up on 2 October.
The closure of the coke ovens and blast furnace saw the end of steel production at the 98-year-old Redcar works.
Lord Heseltine was asked by Business Secretary Sajid Javid to look at ways of bringing investment to Teesside after the site closed.
SSI blamed a global slump in the value of steel for its original decision to mothball the Redcar works.
