Celtic's Tom Rogic says they must play Ajax with the conviction they can reach the Europa League knockout stages.

Back-to-back defeats by Molde have left Ronny Deila's team bottom of Group A going into Thursday's game against Ajax in Glasgow.
"We have to have the belief that we can win and still go through in the group," said Australian midfielder Rogic, 22.
"We go into every game thinking we are going to get a positive result, especially at home."
After opening the group with draws away at Ajax and at home to Fenerbahce, Celtic's challenge has stalled with two losses to the Norwegians.
But victory this week combined with a win in Turkey in the final round of group games would be enough to send Celtic into the last 32 of the competition.
"It's a big opportunity," Rogic said of Thursday's meeting with the Dutch side.
"Obviously we're disappointed about the last couple of results but we've been working hard to make sure we are best prepared as we can be to get the result we need.
"We know the importance of the match. We're all in this together and are a united squad.
"We work closely and extremely hard with the coaches and the manager, so we're working together to get the result we need."
The Scottish champions' preparations for the match have been disrupted by injuries and suspensions. Nir Bitton and Stefan Johansen are both banned, while forward Kris Commons is an injury doubt.
"They are important players for us so any team that loses key players could possibly feel it," added Rogic.
"But, at the same time, we have a good squad and there is competition for places, so I'm sure whoever plays will be ready."
