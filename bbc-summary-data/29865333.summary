Steven Gerrard: Brendan Rodgers wants Liverpool captain to stay on

Brendan Rodgers wants Steven Gerrard to remain at Liverpool after his captain revealed he could leave in the summer having not been offered a new deal.

The 34-year-old, who is a one-club man, said this week that he would not be retiring just yet and could continue his playing career away from Anfield.
"I explained to Steven's representative that I want him to be part of what we're doing here," the Reds boss said.
"He's been a brilliant captain for me. I want to keep him here."
Rodgers added: "I relayed that information to the owners.
"I'm sure they'll go away with that and with Steven's representatives, hopefully organise a deal. He's a unique player and a unique person."
Meanwhile, Rodgers said Liverpool were short of confidence in attack after Saturday's 1-0 defeat in the early kick-off at Newcastle left them nine points behind leaders Chelsea - who stretched that margin to 12 points when they beat QPR 2-1 later that afternoon.
The Reds were third in the Premier League at this stage last season and had scored 17 goals, but with Luis Suarez sold and fellow striker Daniel Sturridge injured they have been less of a threat.
"It's not working for us at the moment," said Rodgers.
"We will continue to hope we get that wee bit of luck and the confidence in final third can return."
His side have managed 13 league goals so far, but have conceded an equal amount as opposed to the +7 goal difference they had established by the 10th game last campaign.
At St James' Park, they rarely threatened, with headers from Martin Skrtel and Philippe Coutinho, the closest they got to beating Newcastle keeper Tim Krul.
Striker Mario Balotelli, who has yet to score in the Premier League on his return to England, had a free-kick and shot comfortably saved by the Dutchman.
Their opponents scored what proved to be the winner in the second half, when Spaniard Ayoze Perez pounced after Liverpool's defence failed to clear Paul Dummett's cross.
"We made a mistake and that cost us the game," added Rodgers, who led Liverpool to second place last season.
"That's the biggest disappointment. If you can't score the goals to win the game, you have to make sure you don't concede. Up until the first goal, we were solid defensively."
When asked whether Newcastle were the hungrier of the two sides at St James' Park, Rodgers said: "One thing I won't question is their hunger, commitment and desire to one, play for Liverpool, and two, in the game.
"In terms of commitment, my players showed 100% commitment."
