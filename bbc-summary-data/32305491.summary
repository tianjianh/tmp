[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The force will have 128 camera kits, which will be worn on officers' chests, and follows a six-month trial in 2014.
It is being jointly funded by the Ministry of Justice and the force's police and crime commissioner's office.
The announcement was made in Colwyn Bay, Conwy, on Wednesday and the force hopes they will also reduce complaints and confrontations with officers.
