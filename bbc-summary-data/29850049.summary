Southend United's Lee Barnard makes Stevenage loan move

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage have signed striker Lee Barnard on a one-month loan deal, according to his club Southend United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old returned to Roots Hall, initially on loan, for a second spell in January.
But he has made just two League Two starts this season and his only goal of the campaign came on the opening day in a 1-0 win at Accrington.
Boro travel to Tranmere on Saturday looking for only their second away victory of the season.
