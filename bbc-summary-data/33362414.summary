[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Acting Insp Marlene MacDonald said residents of the town had complained of reckless driving, including racing, noisy exhausts and horns being blared.
Officers will monitor for speeding and use a decibel meter to check car exhausts do not breach noise levels.
Police said Operation Route would involve officers going out on patrol and setting up inspection check points.
Acting Insp MacDonald said: "It is recognised that the vast majority of road users in Thurso are considerate and respectful of others.
"However, there are a small minority who repeatedly and continually drive in an anti-social manner."
She added: "This culture of constant cruising around the Thurso town centre, whilst creating excessive noise through loud exhausts or the unnecessary revving of engines and general poor driver behaviour, will no longer be tolerated."
