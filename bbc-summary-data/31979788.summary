Homeless teens left to 'fend for themselves' by councils

Thousands of homeless teenagers are let down by councils and left to "fend for themselves" a children's charity warns.

Four out of five of the 12,000 16 and 17-year-olds who asked English councils for help with accommodation did not get housing, says The Children's Society.
They also say that when they do get a home, it is often unsafe.
"They put me in a cramped, cold room in a B&B that had no hot water, then in a hostel where people tried to sell me drugs all the time," says Liam Hill.

Now 22 and a youth mentor, he became homeless at the age of 16 and says he was "passed from pillar to post and given no support from the council".
A spokeswoman for the Local Government Association said that councils had faced budget cuts, which had made it more difficult to offer help.
"It is a tragedy when anyone becomes homeless, and councils are facing real difficulties in finding emergency care for all homeless people due to a shortage of housing, welfare reforms and 40% cuts to council budgets over the lifetime of this parliament.
"Councils are keen to play their part in this and could go further and faster to support the development of badly needed new homes if government gave councils greater financial flexibility."
Liam, who is from Staffordshire, says he was chucked out of his hostel with nowhere to go after an argument with another resident.
"It was the middle of the night and pouring with rain and I ended up sleeping in an outside toilet," he says.
"The council then put me back in a hostel. I felt like a piece of rubbish that had been dumped in the first place the council could find, not a teenager in desperate need of support and a safe place to live."
The Children's Society says homeless teenagers are more at risk of sexual exploitation and crime.
"It is a national disgrace that thousands of vulnerable teenagers, who may have escaped physical or sexual abuse at home, have gone to their council to get help in finding a safe home, only to be turned away," says Matthew Reed, chief executive of the charity.
"These teenagers are being hung out to dry. They are facing huge dangers from predators who seek to abuse or exploit them.
"Councils need to do much more to protect these vulnerable teenagers. Every teenager deserves a safe place to live."
The Children's Society thinks councils are "breaking the law" by not following statutory guidelines.
In its report, Getting the House in Order, it says nearly half of homeless teenagers were not properly assessed by local authorities.
They are also much less likely to get the kind of help children in care need, such as financial support or someone to act as an advocate.
The figures are based on Freedom of Information requests to 353 councils in England, of which 259 replied.
Councils also placed one in 12 (8%) of homeless 16 and 17-year-olds in B&Bs, despite government guidance stating that form of accommodation is "unsuitable", the Children's Society says.
It wants councils to give proper assessments and support and ban the use of B&Bs to house homeless teenagers.
It is also calling for regulation when it comes to hostels and other forms of suitable accommodation and is wants the same help to be given to homeless 16 and 17-year-olds that care leavers get.
Homelessness minister Kris Hopkins said: "There is nothing more important than keeping children safe and the law is clear - any lone, homeless child in need aged 16 and 17 should not be abandoned by town halls and must be given appropriate support.
"It is rare for under-18s to become homeless but where they do they must be referred to children's services for an assessment.
"The government is working hard to prevent young people from becoming homeless and is taking action to ensure that all homeless people have access to the help they need to get back on their feet."
