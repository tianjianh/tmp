Lurgan Celtic may have to field an outfield player in goals in Saturday's Irish Cup semi-final against Linfield.

First choice Conor McCorry is suspended after being sent off against Annagh last weekend while back-up keeper Jamie McAtavey has a broken wrist.
Celtic's attempts to arrange a Championship game against Larne to clear McCorry's ban were blocked by the Northern Ireland Football League.
Outfield players Raymond Fitzpatrick and Dale Malone could take the gloves.
Larne agreed to face Lurgan Celtic either on Thursday or Wednesday night and the cup semi-finalists' manager Colin Malone is unhappy that the NIFL blocked the fixture.
"We were told late on Monday the game wouldn't go ahead due to 'sporting integrity' after we then said we'd play on Wednesday," Malone told The Sun.
"The only options I have are to play an outfield player in goal or a 16-year-old who has never played for the club.
"The competition deserves better as do the sponsors."
Fitzpatrick's injury-time penalty sealed the club's shock 3-2 quarter-final win Portadown.
