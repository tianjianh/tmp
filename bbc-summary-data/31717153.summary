Radio 1 Stories: You Me At Six fans interview the band

"People say you should never meet your idols, but You Me At Six are great and definitely not drama queens. Well, unless they need the toilet."

Imagine getting to meet your favourite band.
Hardcore YMAS fan Joe and his mate Ben managed to take that dream a step further, by interviewing the band on several occasions for a Radio 1 documentary celebrating their 10 years together.
"We felt like we were on a mission and had a job to do," the 23-year-old told Newsbeat.
"When I was younger I was a proper fanboy. I would stand in the freezing cold to see YMAS. What's great is they've grown up with us and stayed relevant through their four albums.
"If we had been younger we would probably have asked silly questions that they get asked all the time, but we did grill them a bit."
We will get to that "grilling" in a moment, but first the big meet.
Before their five-date UK arena tour, YMAS played a special home-coming gig at Guildford's Boileroom in Surrey in January, near to where it all started for Josh Franceschi (singer), Max Helyer (rhythm guitar) and Chris Miller (lead guitar), Matt Barnes (bass). Dan Flint (drums) joined the band in 2007.
Outside the venue the enormity of the situation started to dawn on Joe and Ben.
"We were probably a bit naive because we were feeling reasonably confident," said Joe. "Then we got a text saying we were going to meet YMAS in 10 minutes and this big batch of nerves arrived in both of our stomachs.
"I said to Ben, 'what would you do if this was all a huge gag and it was Peter Andre in there?' and Ben, who has lyrics from the YMAS track Crash tattooed on his arm, joked, 'I'd shake your hand'.
"Before we met YMAS, my favourite was obviously the frontman Josh, but afterwards I loved them all but for different reasons. Matt was the attentive one and Dan was a Manchester United fan, like us."
One of the first things Joe and Ben wanted to know was how the band chose what songs they were going to include in their set.
"That's a difficult one," said Dan. "Some of them were written when Josh was 15 and we were all 16 or 17. Now we're 25 or 26, they're old songs for us, we've changed and our music capabilities have improved so much - so it hard to slot them in.
"But we also know that we've had a 10-year career and we've built up a fan base since then. All four of our albums have gone gold, so why wouldn't we play some of the older tunes."
Two weeks after an intimate gig in front of 300 people, on Valentine's Day YMAS faced an entirely different challenge.
After performing at large venues in Cardiff, Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester, the band were performing for thousands at London's O2 Arena.
It was also a big night for Joe and Ben, who were going to interview YMAS for a second time. Their main concern was would the band remember them?
Of course they did.
"There were times where we were just chilling in a little room backstage," said Joe. "We were all just having a bit of banter and chatting about the football. It wasn't until we left the room that we realised, 'hold on that wasn't the lads, it was YMAS!'"
Was there anything Joe and Ben were too scared to ask their heroes?
"We did push them a bit about the third album," said Joe. "Any serious YMAS fan will have heard rumours that the band apparently struggled while recording it, so seeing as it created some of their biggest hits like Reckless, we tried to find out more.
"The first time they answered, not bluntly, but tried to end the conversation, but I decided to push it and ask again.
"Dan told us that they were living in central Hollywood, and in the beginning they loved going out all the time, but after a while they got tired of it and just wanted some peace and quiet.
"They admitted there were some 'high and low points', but they certainly didn't want to chat about what went on in-depth."
"There are no drama queens in YMASâ€¦ Well, apart from one time," said Joe, who got to witness a "little moment" backstage.
"They were already late for their O2 performance and suddenly Josh was like, 'I need a piss'. Everyone was like, 'you can't', but Josh was having none of it.
"He swore and said, 'if I wanna piss, I will have a piss,'"
Joe could understand why Josh might have been a bit nervous though - he was performing with a broken leg.
After a huddle the band took to the stage, while Joe and Ben watched from the side.
Sixteen songs, a Mexican wave and a selfie later, the experience of a lifetime for two You Me At Six superfans came to an end.
So, what happens after you meet your idols?
Joe said: "It's really cool listening to YMAS now, knowing that we've met them.
"Every time Room To Breathe comes on I know that we were standing at the side of the stage watching them perform in front of thousands of fans."
Radio 1 Stories: You Me At Six starts at 21:00 GMT on Tuesday 3 March.
