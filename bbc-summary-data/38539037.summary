[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Callum Connolly scored twice on his debut as Wigan narrowed the gap to fellow relegation rivals Burton Albion.

Burton began the brighter with their best chance falling to Chris O'Grady, but his shot was blocked on the line.
For the second game running, the home side switched off in first-half stoppage time and an unmarked Connolly headed home to put Wigan ahead.
The 19-year-old defender, who joined on loan from Everton before the game, nodded in his second after the break.
England Under-19 international Connolly's move - which is for the remainder of the season - was confirmed by Wigan in time for him to make the trip to the Pirelli Stadium.
The Liverpool-born teenager, who spent a month on loan at Barnsley last season, came through Everton's academy.
And he helped his new club to their first victory over Burton Albion and back-to-back wins following victory in the FA Cup against Nottingham Forest.
The Brewers have now lost their past four home games in the Championship and sit just one point above the relegation zone.
Wigan remain 23rd, but are now just three points behind them.
Burton manager Nigel Clough:
"It's a frustrated dressing room because we have given away two of the softest goals we have given away all season.
"The timing as well is difficult. I think that is three in recent games just before half-time, in added time, and that is something that has to be addressed.
"Both penalty areas, which is where it really counts, they were better than us today."
Wigan manager Warren Joyce:
"It's a great win but it's just three points and there is still a long way to go in the season.
"Today, Burton could have scored a couple of goals but the way the defenders put their bodies on the line consistently you sometimes earn a little bit of luck when you are that brave."
On new signing Callum Connolly: "He's a player I've known about for a long time.
"Obviously when you are looking at the make-up of players and looking at their attributes and qualities, we are not a big side and its important in this league that you have got full-backs that can head the ball as well.
"Every credit to the kid today, enthusiasm and bravery gets us the points."
