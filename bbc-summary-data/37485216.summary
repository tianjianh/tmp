World heavyweight champion Tyson Fury will not fight again until next year, says his trainer and uncle Peter Fury.

It comes after promoter Eddie Hearn said Fury would not return to the ring after he withdrew from a rematch against Wladimir Klitschko because of reported mental health issues.
The trainer told Bayloric TV Boxing that the 28-year-old Briton "is dealing with some issues" but "will be back".
Fury was due to fight Klitschko on 29 October but withdrew for a second time.
He postponed the original rematch against the Ukrainian, which was scheduled for July and has been given 10 days by the World Boxing Organisation to provide detailed reasons for his withdrawal.
"I don't want to see him set foot in that ring until I see 100% Tyson Fury back mentally and physically - until that, the best place is at home," Peter Fury said.
Hearn, the promoter of rival British world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, said Fury will quit after being stripped of his titles due to his withdrawal from the Klitschko rematch.
But Peter Fury said: "It is a long way from happening. I think Tyson will be fine and will be back.
"Eddie is now a promoter, a doctor, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, all rolled into one - and now a Team Fury member as well because he knows Tyson so well.
"You have got to be all of those things rolled into one to make comments like that and for them to be remotely true.
Asked when the boxer would return, he said: "It certainly won't be this year, it will probably be early next year. He will be back."
The trainer also said:
In November, Fury beat Klitschko on points in Germany - the 40-year-old's first loss since 2004 - to gain the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO titles, American Deontay Wilder holding the WBC belt.
Within two weeks Fury was stripped of the IBF title because he was unable to fight mandatory challenger Vyacheslav Glazkov - and that belt is now held by Joshua.
