Local elections: Build opposition to cuts, say TUSC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A left-wing coalition group launches its manifesto for the Welsh local elections later, demanding councillors fight cuts to budgets for key services.

The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) is contesting wards in five council areas, including 14 seats in Cardiff and five in Swansea.
TUSC spokesman Ross Saunders said it was vital to "build a real opposition to the cuts everywhere in Wales".
Councillors on local health boards should also oppose NHS cuts, he said.
Mr Saunders, a local election candidate and the party's public services spokesman, accused some councillors of failing to even turn up to health board meetings.
No other parties had "stood up and defended public services and jobs from the cuts that the Tory government is aiming at them," he said.
"When you elect a representative you expect them to fight for you, to stand up for you, and unfortunately not a single cut demanded by the government at Westminster has been resisted.
"Instead there's been a carnival of collaboration with councils run by all difference parties obediently cutting back services and outsourcing them and privatising them."
Other TUSC priorities include doing everything possible to control rent levels, protect tenants and end letting fees.
Polling day for local elections across Wales is on Thursday, 4 May.
