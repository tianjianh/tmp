Four birdies and an eagle saw the defending champion move to five under but bogeys on the final two holes left him two under at the halfway stage.
Loupe leads on eight under, one clear of fellow American Roberto Castro after a 71 at Quail Hollow Golf Club.
Justin Rose (70) is four under; fellow Englishman Paul Casey (71) is one back.
Northern Ireland's McIlroy, who triumphed in Charlotte 12 months ago after scoring 14 under for the final two rounds, is confident he can regain his title on the course where he claimed his maiden PGA Tour title in 2010.
"If I get off to a fast start, then I'll be right there back in the tournament," he said.
England's Ian Poulter slipped out of contention with a 74 which left him tied for 45th on level par, while his compatriot Luke Donald moved up to one over after a 69.
American Zac Blair was disqualified for using a non-conforming club after he bent his putter when he hit himself on the head with it following a missed putt.
