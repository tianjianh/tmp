The UK off-shoot of the US independent film festival will take place at the new Picturehouse Central cinema, from 2016.
Sundance London was launched by Robert Redford in 2012 as an experimental, four-day festival at the O2 and was hailed as a "qualified success".
It returned in 2013 and 2014, but this year's festival was cancelled in January with no reason given.
At the time, a spokesperson for Sundance said, in a statement to trade paper Screen Daily, that they would continue to "explore options" for Sundance London.
On Thursday, John Cooper, director of the Sundance Film Festival, said they looked forward to returning next year and reconnecting with London film enthusiasts "after three hugely enjoyable years in London".
"The Sundance Film Festival: London, like our other events in Los Angeles and Hong Kong, allows us to extend the tremendous energy and excitement of our festival. "
"We are excited to build a 2016 program for London that is fuelled by a spirit of discovery and creativity."
The new venue, Picturehouse Central, is the redeveloped former Cineworld cinema in Shaftesbury Avenue.
Actor Robert Redford, president and founder of Sundance Institute, said the institute was "committed" to developing festivals outside the US.
"We've nurtured filmmakers around the globe for many years now and these experiences have brought a rich perspective to all we do.
"Exploring international opportunities for the diverse landscape of American independent storytelling is an exciting proposition, and something to which we are equally committed."
The original Sundance Film Festival takes place annually in Park City, Utah in January.
