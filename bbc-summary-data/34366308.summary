"I have been very disappointed not just today but over the last season of touchline technical etiquette.
"I've been very disappointed that the technical area teams are trying to win it from the technical area.
"I don't think we lost the game today because the players of the technical area were getting at the referee and fourth official, we've lost the the game today because we made mistakes."
