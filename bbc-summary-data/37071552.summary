[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elgin City and Forfar Athletic both made it six points out of six to top League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forfar won a seven-goal thriller against Cowdenbeath, while Elgin defeated new boys Edinburgh City 3-0.
Berwick Rangers moved into third with a 2-0 win over Annan Athletic.
Clyde had to settle for a 1-1 draw away to Stirling Albion, who picked up their first point of the season, while derby rivals Montrose and Arbroath also drew 1-1 at Links Park.
Ryan McCord endured a mixed day for Arbroath; scoring his first goal for the club before being sent off early in the second half.
Chris Templeman equalised for the hosts with his third goal in as many games.
Ross Forsyth atoned for an earlier error to earn Stirling a draw against Clyde.
His short back header allowed Sean Higgins to steal in and low over the goalkeeper, but six minutes later he fired a rocket of a shot into the back of the net, before his team-mate Ross Smith was dismissed near for a second bookable offence.
Shane Sutherland claimed a first-half double to add to Craig Gunn's earlier effort as Elgin netted three times in eight minutes to beat Edinburgh.
Gavin Swankie scored a late winner as Forfar beat Cowdenbeath 4-3 in an entertaining game at Station Park.
Craig Sives opened the scoring for the Fifers before the hosts levelled within three minutes when James Lister headed in Danny Denholm's floated corner.
Denholm then put Forfar ahead with a free-kick before Josh Peters added the home side's third early in the second half.
Goals from Nikolay Todorov and Lewis Moore saw the visitors level with 10 minutes remaining, but Swankie had the last word with his 87th-minute strike.
Berwick claimed a 2-0 win over Annan despite being reduced to 10 men early in the second half.
Steven Thomson struck in the fourth minute after Allan Walker's mis-hit volley was worked into the six-yard box.
The hosts took the slender lead into the half-time break but suffered a blow early in the second half when Johnny Fairbairn was shown a straight red card.
However, despite being a man down, Berwick added their second in the 65th minute thanks to Michael McKenna, who scored with a low shot from close range.
