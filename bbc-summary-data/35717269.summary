Madsen has hit 21 centuries since first joining the county in 2009.
And the 32-year-old batsman has scored more than 1,500 runs in all formats in each of the past three seasons.
"Wayne continues to perform as a model professional on and off the field," elite performance director Graeme Welch told the club website.
"He has made massive contributions in both the first-class and one-day formats, scoring heavily in all three competitions and leading from the front."
