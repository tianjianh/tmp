McGowan was a free agent after the Buddies decided not to offer him a new deal.
And the club have beaten off competition to secure McGinn, who was voted into the Championship team of the year last term.
"I'm delighted both have agreed to join," said Dundee boss Paul Hartley.
The Dens Park men are gearing up for their return to Scotland's top flight, after winning the Championship last term.
McGowan, who spent four years at St Mirren, started his career at Celtic where he played alongside his new boss Hartley.
"He was always good with me so it was a big factor in me joining," said the 26-year-old.
"I was shocked to be released by St. Mirren. My mobile kept ringing from the next day but I didn't answer as I didn't know the number.
"It turned out to be Paul [Hartley] and I met him and Scot Gardiner [chief executive] on the West Coast and they sold me on the club and team, I was convinced from then and it was just a matter of getting the deal done."
And the manager was also a key factor in the capture of McGinn.
"I was flattered by a lot of clubs showing interest in me but speaking to Paul Hartley made my mind up," said the 23-year-old right back.
