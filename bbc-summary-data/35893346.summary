The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, attacked Gwen Louden in the court's foyer in January.
The girl had been told to leave the court by PC Louden but returned and assaulted her.
The court was told that the police officer was still off work.
Depute fiscal Stewart Duncan previously told Dundee Sheriff Court: "The accused was informed she was under arrest for another matter no longer before the court.
"PC Louden took the girl's hand and she pulled away, before PC Louden took her by the wrist.
"A struggle ensued and she then punched PC Louden in the face with her right fist then headbutted the officer to the left side of her face and repeatedly punched her on the head several more times."
PC Louden and a colleague struggled with the girl and pulled her into the main reception area.
Mr Duncan said: "She continued to repeatedly punch and headbutt the officer to the head and face.
"The accused was eventually forced face down on the ground and handcuffed to the rear."
The court was told PC Louden attended Ninewells Hospital with swelling and pain to her forehead and severe swelling to her left cheekbone.
The 16-year-old, of Dundee, admitted a charge of assault to injury on 28 January.
She also admitted breaching a community payback order previously imposed for another offence.
Sheriff Tom Hughes sentenced the girl to eight months detention for the assault and a further four months, to be served consecutively, for the breach of the community payback order.
He said: "This is an appalling offence to a police officer while she was on duty.
"Police officers have a very difficult job and are on the front line of protecting us.
"They should be able to go to work and carry out their duty without injury.
"Both officers are to be commended for how they dealt with this. A custodial sentence is inevitable."
