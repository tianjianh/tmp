The attacker is believed to have left the bus in Rookery Road after the altercation at about 22:30 GMT on Monday, police said.
A post-mortem examination will be carried out on the victim, who police said was from Smethwick, later.
Passengers who were on the top deck during the stabbing, including four who immediately got off the bus, have been urged to get in touch with officers.
Police said the suspect pictured was last seen wearing a puffa jacket and headphones over a baseball cap and was carrying a duffle type bag.
Detectives said the attacker was only on the bus for five minutes before stabbing the victim "several times" in the stomach and back.
Forensic searches were carried out on Tuesday, to find the weapon used, which is believed to be a folding pocket knife.
