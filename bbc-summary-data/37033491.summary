[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sale Sharks have signed England Under-20 hooker Curtis Langdon for the upcoming Premiership season.

The 19-year-old was at London Irish last season where he progressed through their academy, but he failed to make a first team appearance for the club.
He had agreed to join National League One side Darlington Mowden Park this summer but has now agreed a long-term deal with the Sharks.
"I definitely see this as a chance to play first-team rugby," he said.
"There aren't too many hookers here so I hope there will be opportunities to play for the first team and then I hope to kick on."
