James Rudolf ran the 159 miles back to Wales after last Sunday's marathon.
He was welcomed back by family, members of the Cardiff Blues rugby team and hundreds of supporters as he arrived at Cardiff Arms Park.
Mr Rudolf is raising money for the charity that helped his son, Oscar, who has a rare form of cancer.
The 41-year-old father-of four, from Lisvane, in Cardiff, said his six-year-old was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcome, a rare soft tissue cancer, in 2014.
Oscar needed chemotherapy as well as proton radiotherapy treatment in Florida.
Mr Rudolf said: "It's hard to put into words how I'm feeling now. It's been a great week, I've really enjoyed it.
"It's been really hard work, but to see everyone out here today is amazing. It's great to be back with Sarah, my wife, Oscar and our other three boys, I'm very happy."
The original fundraising target set by James was Â£10,000. He has now raised more than Â£65,000 for Latch.
Oscar was admitted to hospital on Thursday evening because his temperature went up, but doctors agreed to let him leave hospital with his mother to see his father complete his run on Friday evening.
He later returned to the oncology ward where he was being treated with antibiotics before being released on Saturday morning.
Mrs Rudolf said: "I'm very proud of James and the friends who ran back with him from London, it's been a very emotional week."
