Wales saw the highest level of rainfall across the UK in December, although it was parts of northern England which bore the brunt of the floods.
NFU Mutual said its Welsh claims of up to £2.5m would form part of an estimated £40m across the UK.
Flooding closed the A55 on Boxing Day, homes were evacuated and Beaumaris Castle's moat overflowed.
North, mid and west Wales had flood warnings in place.
At the weekend, part of the M4 closed after lanes in the Brynglas tunnels in Newport flooded, and fire crews across south, west and mid Wales were called to flooded homes and roads following persistent heavy rain.
NFU Mutual's chief claims manager Matthew Scott said: "The flooding across many parts of Scotland, northern England and north west Wales could be the worst for several years."
On Tuesday, First Minister Carwyn Jones made a second visit to flood-hit parts of north Wales and announced an extra £2.3m for communities affected.
