[SN]TITLE[SN]
NI unemployment rate at its lowest since 2008

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unemployment in Northern Ireland is continuing to fall, the latest government figures suggest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The number of people claiming unemployment related benefits fell by 700 in October to 34,000 -  the seventh consecutive monthly decrease.
Northern Ireland's unemployment rate is 5.6% against the UK average of 4.8%.
Economy minister Simon Hamilton said it was "positive news" adding:  "Our unemployment rate is now the lowest it has been since October-December 2008."
ANALYSIS
The headline official figures show an ever greater proportion of people in work in Northern Ireland.
The employment rate is touching 70% - its highest since 1995.
But year-on-year, there has been a swing away from full-time jobs.
7,000 fewer people are in full-time employment.
But the number of part-time workers is up by 30,000 and temporary workers up by 10,000.
Two in every three of the additional part-time jobs were filled by women.
One economist believed the headline figures "conceal" a rise in the unemployment rate among men.
Richard Ramsey, chief economist of Ulster Bank, pointed out on Twitter it has risen from 6.2% to 7.3% within the past year.
He said it may mean that manufacturing job losses - predominantly male - were being offset by a growth in  female workers in other sectors.
