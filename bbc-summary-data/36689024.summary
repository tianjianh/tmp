The 42-year-old won 44 international caps for England, but has decided to retire to concentrate on studying.
Meanwhile, Belles have signed midfielder Marta Bakowska-Mathews, 23, after a successful trial period.
Details of the length of the former Florida State University player's contract have not been disclosed.
Doncaster have failed to pick up a point from their first four WSL games and are bottom of the table.
