The Richard III Society said the 7ft (2.1m) long limestone monument would blend modern and medieval style decorations to reflect the king's life.
The group was closely involved in the project to find the lost king's remains, which was confirmed last week.
Leicester Cathedral, where Richard is expected to be reinterred in 2014, said it would consider ideas but no decision had yet been made.

Conflict, rebellion and murder - discover more about Richard III's life
Richard III died at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 while fighting a rebellion by the future Henry VII.
He was buried in the church of the Greyfriars in Leicester but the precise location was lost when the building was demolished.
Working with Philippa Langley, of the Richard III Society, a University of Leicester team uncovered a skeleton in September 2012 and its identity was confirmed earlier this month.
Despite a number of rival claims, Leicester Cathedral is preparing to take possession of the remains by summer 2014 at the latest.
A spokesman for the Richard III Society said: "The tomb design was commissioned by Philippa Langley in September 2010 at the very beginning of the Looking For Richard project.
"It is based on Richard's life, and what was important and meaningful to him, and the design was undertaken by a team of specialists with over 40 years of research into Richard III.
"The society is looking forward to working with the cathedral and Leicester City Council to honour the return of the king."
The society said it expected to meet the estimated Â£30,000 cost through donations.
Liz Hudson, from Leicester Cathedral, said officials would brief architects about its requirements for the tomb on 12 March, with final proposals expected in the summer.
She said: "There is an agreed process to make this decision and it will ensure all views are heard and considered. No proposals will be considered outside of this process.
"This process will give us a design that will be appropriate for a working, public, worshipping cathedral and for all those who come in future generations to visit King Richard's final resting place."
A temporary exhibition in Leicester about the project has seen more than 3,000 visitors since it opened on Friday with many people queuing for up to an hour.
