Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning says new Hearts head coach Ian Cathro is a welcome addition to Scottish football.

The 30-year-old became the youngest-ever top-flight boss in Scotland when he joined the Jambos on a three-and-a-half-year deal this week.
"I think that's the way football is going just now", said Canning.
"It seems to be the thing that young managers are the way ahead. They maybe bring different ideas, fresh ideas."
Canning, 35, admits he doesn't know Cathro "overly well", but insists it's good to see another young coach getting a chance.
"Obviously for him it's a big opportunity and at a huge club and a good club as well," Canning told BBC Scotland. "I don't know much about the way he works or what he does but we'll see how he gets on."
Accies sit eighth in the Scottish Premiership table, having drawn nine of their 15 league matches this season, but Canning says spirits in the squad remain high.
"We're putting ourselves in good positions," he said. "Maybe from there we're trying not to lose a game, or lose a goal, rather than score a second or third and try and win the game.
"That's something we've discussed - if we can maybe be a little bit more positive when we go ahead, it might change the mentality.
"I think the mood's good, because I think the boys know they're performing well and with a little break here or there, we could have had two or three wins from those draws.
"It's a strange league and it's so tight, but our consistency's been pretty good - albeit, picking up single points, but performances have been generally good."
Canning is confident he won't have to supplement his squad during the January transfer window, unless he loses players.
"At the minute squad-wise there's not a lot that I would look to do differently; I think we're reasonably well set," he said. "We've got a lot of good young kids coming through as well.
"If something comes up that we think is interesting or we feel could improve us then we're always looking at that, but they would have to be better than what we have already."
