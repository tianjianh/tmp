Londonderry rape accused a 'polite and compassionate' person

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 30-year-old man accused of raping a woman after a party at her home has been described as a "polite and compassionate" person.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean O'Halloran, from Northland Road in Derry, denies raping the woman in May 2014.
The BBC Radio Foyle journalist also denies two additional charges of sexual assault on the same date.
On Wednesday, Londonderry Crown Court heard from two character witnesses for Mr O'Halloran.
Freya McClements, who used to work at BBC Radio Foyle and is a former colleague of the defendant, described Mr O'Halloran as an "ethical journalist" who was "respectful towards women".
The court also heard from Donna Deeney, a reporter with the Belfast Telegraph, who said that Mr O'Halloran was "a very polite and compassionate person, drunk or sober".
The trial continues.
