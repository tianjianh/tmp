[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Centre Jared Payne has been ruled out of the rest of Ireland's World Cup campaign after a scan revealed he has fractured a foot.

Ireland initially believed the 29-year-old was suffering from bruising and would fully recover after sitting out Sunday's Pool D decider against France.
However, he was in discomfort after training on Wednesday and was sent for further tests which revealed the break.
Ireland will decide on a replacement after Sunday's match in Cardiff.

Andrew Trimble and Noel Reid will be in the frame to replace Ulster centre Payne.
Payne's injury is a blow to the Irish as he had formed an effective partnership with Robbie Henshaw at centre, replacing the legendary duo of Brian O'Driscoll and Gordon D'Arcy.
The new pairing played a leading role in Ireland retaining the Six Nations Championship this year.
Keith Earls will stand in at centre alongside Henshaw for the match against France.
Darren Cave and Luke Fitzgerald are other midfield options for coach Joe Schmidt.
