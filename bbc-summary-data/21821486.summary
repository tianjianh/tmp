And to prove it winger George North had rather illustrious company at breakfast the morning after the team secured back-to-back Six Nations titles with a 30-3 record win over England.
He tweeted a picture of himself at the team hotel with the trophy gleaming on the breakfast table.
Prime Minister David Cameron and First Minister Carwyn Jones were among those who sent messages of congratulations.
Mr Cameron took to Twitter to say: "Congratulations to the Welsh on winning the #6nations. A fantastic effort."
Mr Jones thanked the team and coaching staff for the "marvellous achievement" of the 30-3 win, which destroyed English hopes of a Grand Slam.
"We have seen them fight back from a disappointing opening match to reach this triumph," said Mr Jones.
"I'm sure I speak for Welsh people everywhere when I say - well done boys, you've done the whole country proud yet again!"
Following the game, messages of pride, excitement and sheer delight flooded social media, with the #Wales, #Six Nations and #Champions hashtags continuing to trend on Twitter on Sunday.
One picture in particular that got a huge number of retweets seemed to sum up the occasion for many fans.
Taken following the game in the Millennium Stadium, it showed a trio of serious Englishmen on BBC TV - presenter John Inverdale with pundits Clive Woodward and Jeremy Guscott. In sharp contrast was the broad grin of delighted Welsh pundit and former international Jonathan Davies - his smile reflecting the triumphant mood of the nation.
Players Mike Phillips, Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies were among those tweeting following the win, sharing pictures of themselves with their winners' medals in the dressing room.
Phillips also tweeted black and white shots of himself and his teammates in smart black tie dress, ready to celebrate their achievements in style on Saturday night.
The following day, Wales' double try scorer Alex Cuthbert tweeted fans to say: "Thanks for all the messages was an awesome day!!..."
Sam Warburton, who took the captain's armband from Gethin Jenkins after he went off towards the end of the game, tweeted: "Stadium was unbelievable yesterday, thanks to all fans!! Feel so privileged to be a part of it, surreal. Best moment of my career!"
Elsewhere, sports presenter and former England football star Gary Lineker tweeted that his wife Danielle Bux, who is from Cardiff, would be "insufferable" following the result.
He wrote: "Wales have given England a real spanking in the rugby. The wife and her Taff tribe will be insufferable for a while i suspect."
Cardiff-born singer Charlotte Church, who has been performing at the South by Southwest music festival in Texas, USA, tweeted about her more unusual way of watching the match.
"I watched the game whilst on a plane from Houston to Los Angeles, couldn't believe my luck, and it was beautiful Wales! Well done boys!WOOO!" she wrote.
Welsh band Manic Street Preachers tweeted: "10 out of ten for every welsh player- coach+fan--total domination-MONUMENTAL-STUNNING-BEAUTIFULx"
All-American star David Hasselhoff also got into the mood, thanks to his Welsh girlfriend Hayley Roberts.
He tweeted: "Congrats Wales CYMRU Am Byth !! Wow what a game I am so proud that I have @hhayleyroberts welsh girlfriend !! Cardiff is rockin tonight !!"
