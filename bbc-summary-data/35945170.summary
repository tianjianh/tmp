Celtic is best place for Kieran Tierney, says Ronny Deila

Ronny Deila is sure Kieran Tierney will attract attention from clubs in England, but the Celtic manager insists the teenager is going nowhere.

The 18-year-old left-back is a first-team regular with the champions and made his Scotland debut in this week's 1-0 win over Denmark at Hampden.
Southampton have been linked with the defender and Deila is not surprised.
"I can tell you they won't be the last club coming up here to see him," said Deila.
"When you have an 18-year-old playing for Scotland and regularly for Celtic then, of course, clubs are going to be after him.
"But he's going to stay here because it's the best thing for his development.
"I've had a long chat with him about what's best for his development and now he just has to concentrate on being consistent for us."
Tierney signed a four-year contract in August after breaking into the first team at the tail end of last season.
He has featured in 25 matches for Celtic this term and his impressive form was rewarded with a Scotland bow on Tuesday, when he turned in an assured 45 minutes.
Following the win against the Danes, Celtic and Scotland captain Scott Brown enthused: "His attitude is unbelievable.
"He just seems to join in with top-quality players. He doesn't look out of place.
"Nobody gets the better of him, and I mean nobody, and he proves that week in, week out."
