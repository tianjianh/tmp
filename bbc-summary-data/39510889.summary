[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 0-1 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rochdale moved to within three points of the League One play-off places with victory at local rivals Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A tense affair saw Dale midfielder Callum Camps break the deadlock with a free-kick in first-half stoppage time.
And although Bury rallied after the break, they never looked like avoiding a third consecutive defeat.
The Shakers have played more matches than all their fellow strugglers and are just a point above the drop zone with three games left.
Bury went closest during a quiet start as James Vaughan poked a shot straight at keeper Conrad Logan, while Tom Pope's header was cleared off the line by Nathaniel Mendez-Laing.
Rochdale replied with Ian Henderson and Joe Bunney going close before Mendez-Laing's shot was turned over by Joe Murphy.
But the Bury keeper was at fault moments later as Camps let fly with a free-kick from over 30 yards, which slipped through Murphy's hands.
Cameron Burgess had a header blocked and Pope headed over as Bury started the second half on top.
But the hosts failed to keep the pressure on and Henderson went closest to scoring late on.
