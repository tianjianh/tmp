Man jailed for murder bid on friend in Greenock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted brutally attacking his former friend over suspicions of breaking into his house has been jailed for six years for attempted murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Francis Kelly, 35, repeatedly hit 30-year-old Kenneth Heron with a wooden pole, a golf club and a knife in Nimmo Street, Greenock, on 21 May 2015.
The victim was unable to flee as he had become attached to a gate in the street by belt loops on his jeans.
Both men were drunk at the time and had little recollection of the attack.
Jailing Kelly at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Boyd told him that a custodial disposal was "inevitable".
The court heard how the two men, from Greenock, had been friends from September 2014 but fell out in January last year.
On the day of the attack, Mr Heron went to Kelly's house to drink after the pair resumed contact.
Following the attack, Kelly shouted at Mr Heron: "That's what you get for tanning my house. That's what you deserve."
The court heard that Mr Heron could "vaguely recall" being stuck to a front gate while he was assaulted by "someone". His next recollection was waking up in hospital.
Neighbours of Kelly saw Mr Heron tied to the gate by the belt loops of his jeans but detectives were unable to establish how he came to be there.
Eye witnesses saw Kelly bare-chested and covered in blood repeatedly attacking the victim.
He struck Mr Heron several times with a wooden pole before walking back into his house for a golf club which he then used to repeatedly strike the victim.
Neighbours then phoned 999 when they saw Kelly attacking him with a knife.
Police arrived shortly afterwards and arrested Kelly but he was not immediately interviewed as he was too drunk.
The victim was rushed to Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock for emergency treatment.
After admitting a charge of attempted murder, Kelly's defence advocate Niall McCluskey told the court that his client "profoundly" regretted his actions.
