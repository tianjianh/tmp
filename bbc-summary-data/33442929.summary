[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
ScotRail has struck a deal with train drivers in a dispute over pay and conditions.

The rail operator said the deal with train drivers' union Aslef would ensure that it could run existing Sunday services.
The dispute centred around plans by ScotRail franchise holder Abellio to introduce a seven-day rota for drivers.
About a third of ScotRail's trains were cancelled on Sunday after drivers refused to work overtime.
The talks followed an announcement by Aslef that it would ballot its members for industrial action from next month.
Under the new deal, which has been welcomed by the Scottish government, drivers will receive a pay rise of 2.5% and be paid for each Sunday that they volunteer to work.
The original proposal involved a one-off bonus payment for working Sundays.
ScotRail added that a joint working party would be established with its drivers "to discuss how we ensure that Sunday becomes part of the working week".
ScotRail Alliance managing director Phil Verster said: "I am pleased to confirm we have agreed a deal that will ensure we can run our existing services on a Sunday and help us develop plans to make Sunday part of the working week.
"We run a seven-day railway, so it is hugely important that we have staff rosters that can cover this.
"The commitment from the unions to work with us to change the way we roster Sundays will allow us to recruit new drivers and will, ultimately, deliver a much-improved service for our customers."
Mr Verster said ScotRail was now contacting drivers to seek to their cooperation to reinstate services from Sunday 12 July.
He added: "I am hopeful that, with their support, we will be able to run a near-normal service.
"We will know more later today and would urge customers to check our website for updates."
Aslef officials said they would recommend that the union's executive committee accept the deal.
Responding to the deal, a Transport Scotland spokeswoman said: "Today's agreement between ScotRail and Aslef is very welcome and we look forward to them building on this to deliver the seven-day rail service that the franchise makes it clear we expect."
