Kendrick Lamar put his album out on Sunday and the internet got very excited.

Mainly because To Pimp A Butterfly was released a week earlier than was originally advertised.
But now Spotify says that buzz helped the 27-year-old rapper break their global records.
The album was streamed more than 9.6 million times on its first full day of release.
The previous record-holder was Michael Buble's Christmas, with 9.5 million streams on Christmas Eve 2014.
Kendrick has a huge fan following, with Kanye West calling him "an inspiration" on Twitter.
Kanye's praise was backed by producer Paul Epworth - who's worked with the likes of Adele. He called To Pimp A Butterfly "an incredible album".
Grime artist JME wrote: "mad ting @kendricklamar thank you."
Busta Rhymes tweeted "incredible" and called Lamar a "king", saying he was "flawless".
