An anonymous donor paid Â£11,00 for Ben Baddeley to have an operation to help him walk earlier this year after it was cancelled by the NHS.
But as his initial treatment was private the family are now having to pay for his follow-up care and need to find about Â£16,000 for his treatment which physiotherapists say he currently needs three times a week.
BBC Midlands Today Health Correspondent Michele Paduano reports.
