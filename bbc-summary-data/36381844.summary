The factory Quay Fresh and Frozen Foods is hoping to renew its marine licence to deposit clean, crushed whelk shells off New Quay.
A public meeting on Thursday invited residents to have their say, which Natural Resources Wales said was a "vital part" of the application.
The company said it would not comment while the application was under review.
Valerie Bowen, an 88-year-old retired doctor, said: "I used to play on the beach when I was a child. I wouldn't even walk on it now barefoot in case the washed-up shells cut my feet.
"I won't even allow my own grandchildren to play on the beach after they complained their feet were hurting. It's such a beautiful beach, it's very frustrating."
