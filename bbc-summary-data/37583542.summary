[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottingham dead baby suffered 'deliberate abuse'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A two-month-old boy had suffered broken bones, bruises and bleeding in the eyes before he died, his father's murder trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eden Robinson was found unconscious at his father's house in St Ann's, Nottingham, on 8 November 2014.
Eden died three days later, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Doctors discovered multiple injuries.
Easton Robinson, 39, who shared parenting with Eden's mother, has denied murder.
Scans showed Eden had been subjected to what the prosecution described as a "wider pattern of abuse" going back to two earlier separate visits to his father's house.
Jurors heard details of at least 23 separate areas of injury dating back as long as six weeks prior to Eden's collapse.
These included widespread bleeding within the membranes that cover the brain, extensive brain damage, bleeding inside both eyes, bruising to the face, chest and leg, along with fractures to his right leg and two ribs.
On the day Eden was taken ill, a neighbour living on the floor above reported hearing a "bang" from the flat and "a sound of anguish and frustration" just minutes before an ambulance was phoned.
Crown barrister Jonas Hankin QC said: "It's unclear what this witness actually heard.
"Whatever it was, the defendant made no reference to anything like that or anything untoward happening, during police interview."
The trial - which is expected to last five weeks - continues.
