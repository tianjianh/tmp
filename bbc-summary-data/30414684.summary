The 29-year-old former Manchester United star was named world player of the year 11 months ago.
"Thank you BBC for choosing me and to my old fans in England. Thank you very much," said Ronaldo, who has scored 281 goals in 267 matches for Real.
He won the award ahead of tennis player Serena Williams, boxer Floyd Mayweather and MotoGP rider Marc Marquez.
Ronaldo, who has scored 27 hat-tricks for Real, netted 17 goals in last season's Champions League, breaking the previous record of 14 held by Jose Altafini and Lionel Messi.
He is only the second footballer to win the award since this century, after Brazil striker Ronaldo in 2002.
