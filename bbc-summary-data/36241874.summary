Former boxer Floyd Mayweather says he "started the rumour" about a potential bout with a mixed martial arts fighter - thought to be Conor McGregor.

McGregor fuelled speculation with a tweet showing him head to head with Mayweather, who retired last year.
Five-weight world champion Mayweather, 39, said he would want $100m (Â£69.3m) to fight the 27-year-old Irishman.
"Keep your fingers crossed, it may be a boxer versus an MMA fighter," Mayweather told fighthype.com.
"It was a name that was shot at me. It may not be a rumour."
Mayweather's father recently said his son had told him he would face "some kind of MMA fighter", while McGregor told BT Sport he wants a "billion-dollar fight" against the American.
McGregor, who lost to Nate Diaz in his most recent fight, was pulled from the UFC 200 card last month after refusing to fulfil promotional duties.
Mayweather's 49th and last fight was a unanimous decision over Andre Berto in September, after which he said: "My career is over, that's official."
