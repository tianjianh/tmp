[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man charged with murdering his grandson confessed to the killing to a doctor, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stewart Greene, 65, of Grimoldby, Lincolnshire admitted drowning nine-year-old Alex Robinson in a bath at his home but denies murder.
The boy had been left alone with Mr Greene for less than an hour while his mother went shopping in December 2014.
GP John Sharrock told Lincoln Crown Court the confession happened at a police station.
Mr Sharrock told the jury that Mr Greene had told him his depression had worsened in the previous six months.
"He had not been sleeping and not been able to think straight.
"He further told me that on the day of 23 December he was left at home in Lincoln with his grandson. He told me he got angry with his grandson and he snapped. He put him in the bath and drowned him.
"I asked him why he snapped. He said he couldn't remember."
Mr Sharrock told the jury at Lincoln Crown Court that Mr Greene said to him:" I'm guilty. I did it."
He added: "He said since his discharge from hospital he had not taken any medication because he thought it was making him worse."
The court also heard that Mr Greene, who complained of hearing voices and of experiencing pains in his head, was discharged from hospital on 11 December without a care package.
Psychiatrist Nicola Thomas told the jury she reviewed Mr Greene's case 36 hours before he was released from a Lincoln-based psychiatric unit, but said that he was not suitable for early discharge.
Dr Thomas said she was unaware until later that no care package was put in place for Greene before he returned to living in the community.
The trial continues.
