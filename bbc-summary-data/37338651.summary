[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old man was hurt in the Denmark Street area of the Aberdeenshire town on Sunday at about 02:50.
He was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary where his condition was described as critical but stable.
A 23-year-old man was expected to appear at Peterhead Sheriff Court on Monday.
Det Insp Norman Stevenson said: "I would still urge anyone with additional information to come forward as every witness viewpoint is extremely important in assisting us with the investigation.
"Around the time in question large numbers of people would have been leaving nearby licensed premises and I would ask that anyone who saw anything and has information that could assist to contact us as soon as possible."
