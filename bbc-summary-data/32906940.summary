Rosalind Jones, 54, of Norwich, was driving a Ford Ka at 07:45 GMT near Diss on 9 January when it drifted into the wrong lane on the A140.
Norfolk Coroner's Court heard she had been at her mother's bedside at Ipswich Hospital until about 06:30 GMT.
Coroner Jacqueline Lake ruled Ms Jones died due to a traffic collision.
Ms Jones' younger sister Lillian Flowers described how they had both been at their mother's bedside the previous night.
Ms Flowers said: "In the morning we were both yawning. She looked drained. She was going to go home and have a sleep."
James Fairclough, who was driving behind Ms Jones, described seeing the Ford Ka, on the A140 at Pulham Market, "drift" into the wrong lane, without indicating, into the path of a Dennis refuse vehicle.
Accident investigator Graeme Brookes said there was nothing to suggest the lorry was being driven in "anything other than a sensible way", but evidence showed Ms Jones may have fallen asleep at the wheel.
Giving her verdict, Ms Lake said she was satisfied Ms Jones was tired and either fell asleep at the wheel or was not paying attention when the vehicle crashed.
Following the inquest Ms Flowers paid tribute to her older sister: "I loved her to bits. She had a heart of gold. She would have doe anything for anyone," she said.
