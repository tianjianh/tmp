Murray, 30, can earn up to £350,000 in prize money by winning the tournament.
He starts his campaign for a sixth Queen's title on Tuesday when he faces fellow Briton Aljaz Bedene.
Seventy nine people died or are missing presumed dead after the blaze at Grenfell Tower in Kensington last week.
The government has pledged to give £5,500 to all of those who lost their homes, with more than £200,000 of a £5m emergency fund so far given to families affected.
In 2013, Murray donated his £73,000 winnings from Queen's to the Royal Marsden Centre, which had been treating his friend and Davis Cup doubles player Ross Hutchins for Hodgkin's lymphoma.
