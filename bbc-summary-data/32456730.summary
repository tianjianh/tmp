Alex Bernard, 21, and Casey Jones, 19, were found guilty of the "swift, frenzied" and "utterly brutal" double murder in Leytonstone on 1 March 2014.
Aaron Carriere, 21, was stabbed 11 times, and Josiah Manful, 20, sustained 13 wounds, the Old Bailey heard.
Jones must serve at least 34 years while Bernard was jailed for 31 years.
Judge John Bevan told the court: "It was a frenzied, adrenaline and probably drug-fuelled attack and inevitably results in very long sentences."
During the trial, the court heard the victims were "boxed in" by the cars of their killers and set upon in their black Ford Fiesta in Montague Road, a quiet, residential street in Leytonstone.
The Metropolitan Police said Mr Carriere answered his phone mid-attack, so the caller was able to hear his screams for help, while Mr Manful managed to get out of the vehicle and stagger a short distance before collapsing.
Despite the fact there were drugs and cash in the car, only Mr Carriere's mobile phone was stolen, which contained his drug dealing "client list", Scotland Yard said.
In the days after the double murder, Jones flew to Somalia and Bernard left for Grenada. Both were arrested on their return, weeks later.
Det Ch Insp Jamie Piscopo said: "The level of violence displayed is one of the worse I have seen in my time as a homicide detective.
"The murders were witnessed by a number of residents, most of whom have been left traumatised by the events of that evening."
Devonte Campbell and Omar Hassan, who were also found guilty of the double murder, are due to be sentenced on 5 June.
