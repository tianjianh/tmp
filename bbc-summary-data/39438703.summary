[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who took innocent pictures from the social media accounts of women he knew and placed them on a porn site has admitted a series of crimes.

On one picture posted on the x-rated site, unemployed Oliver Whiting, 36, of Eastbourne, described one victim as a "slag" and a "whore".
Hastings magistrates heard the picture featured the woman's young child.
Whiting admitted 11 offences of making offensive posts and will be sentenced next month.
The court heard the woman asked the US-based website to remove the image but received no reply.
She said in an impact statement: "I felt alone and that no-one would help me."
A second unnamed woman was left "speechless and shocked" after she found her picture next to offensive comments written by Whiting, of Langdale Close.
Prosecutor Rebecca Green said the woman was left "physically sick and violated" after he described her as a "true slut" and invited users to leave humiliating comments.
Whiting had been charged after previously being cautioned for similar offences involving different victims, the court heard.
Defending, Noelle Magennis said the offences took place during a "dark period" in Whiting's life when he struggled to cope at work.
She said: "He is disgusted with himself. He doesn't leave the house and his friends have disowned him. The only explanation is that he was drinking excessively.
"He never in a million years thought the girls would see these comments."
Outside court, one of his previous victims described how an image of her was posted with the message "100 to rape her, 50 to get her pregnant and 20 to make her miscarry".
She said: "He makes me feel sick, particularly as I considered him as a family friend."
Det Ch Supt Nick May, from Sussex Police, said the case highlighted the need for police to understand the impact of such crimes.
He said this had been "a very distressing period" for the victims and he said while such an injury was not physical it had an extreme impact.
