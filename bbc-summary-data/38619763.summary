Saturday's League Two match between Crawley and Portsmouth has been postponed because of a frozen pitch.

Pitch protection covers had been in place and hot-air blowers used, but following an inspection by referee Kevin Johnson at 09:00 GMT the decision was taken to call the game off.
"We're absolutely devastated to lose our first game since 2014," Crawley operations director Kelly Derham said.
"The pitch is well grassed but the frost has got into the ground."
