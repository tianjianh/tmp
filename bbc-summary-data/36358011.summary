Reality Check: How would Brexit affect British students?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Any British student can, in principle, study at a university in any EU member state, provided the student fulfils the entry requirements of that institution.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The question: Candida asks BBC Radio 4's PM programme: "If we exit, what will happen to British students preparing to, or already studying at European universities?"
Reality Check verdict:  Nothing would change until a new deal is agreed between the UK and EU member states.
We haven't been able to find concrete figures on how many UK students complete their higher education in another EU country.
However, in 2013-14 more than 15,000 students from the UK took part in the EU-sponsored Erasmus exchange programme.
This allows EU students to study at a university in another EU member state for a period of between three and 12 months.
If the UK voted to leave the EU, nothing should change immediately as all the current arrangements would be valid until a new deal is reached.
The rights of UK students in the EU and the EU students in the UK would be part of that negotiation.
