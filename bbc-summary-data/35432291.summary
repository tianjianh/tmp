Six political parties should take part in television debates before May's assembly election, the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has said.

It said Labour, the Tories, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, UKIP and the Green Party should all "have their voices heard".
ERS Cymru director Steve Brooks said UKIP and the Greens were both "serious contenders" for seats in Cardiff Bay.
He called the Senedd "multi-party", as a third of AMs were elected using a system of proportional representation.
"With the assembly getting more powers, we need as open a debate as possible, and voters should be given a true representation of the options available in May," Mr Brooks said.
"We call on the broadcasters to look at the success of last year's Westminster TV debates, which drew in millions of viewers because there was a real debate with clear differences of opinion," he added.
