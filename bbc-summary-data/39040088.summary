The 23-year-old Scot has already broken the European 3,000m indoor record, and British 5,000m and 1,000m indoor records this year.
She will be part of a Great Britain team that also includes defending 60m champion Richard Kilty.
Also competing are Andrew Pozzi, fastest in the world this year over 60m hurdles, and Katarina Johnson-Thompson.
Johnson-Thompson will be looking to claim Britain's first European indoor medal for 33 years in the women's long jump, but will face competition from world indoor medallist and British champion Lorraine Ugen as well as European medallist Jazmin Sawyers.
British Athletics performance director Neil Black said: "I'm pleased with the blend of this team.
"With a home World Championships in London, 2017 is an even bigger year for us than 2016, so starting it off in a positive manner is essential and I am expecting to see a number of medal-winning performances in Belgrade."
