Denmark Women 1-2 England Women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England Women's final warm-up match before this summer's European Championship ended in a battling win against Denmark in Copenhagen.

Ellen White, who captained the side for the first time, lifted the ball over the head of goalkeeper Stina Lykke to score the opener just before half-time.
Denmark skipper Pernille Harder levelled in the second half with an impressive free-kick from just outside the area.
White then claimed her second of the night, poking home from inside the area after Simone Sorensen's bizarre backpass hit her own bar.
With a much-changed line-up, the Lionesses spent long periods of the first half defending, and Denmark had an early goal disallowed.
However, the second half brought an improved performance as England posed a constant threat to the side ranked 15th in the world.
The result sees England head into the Euros having gained four wins and a draw from their past six games.
Boss Mark Sampson made 10 changes to the side that beat Switzerland, with left-back Demi Stokes the only player to keep her place in the starting 11.
And several players used their last opportunity to impress with hard-working performances to give Sampson plenty to consider before the tournament.
White's two goals were indicative of a gritty performance, which saw the forward tirelessly chase down the Danish defence.
Midfielder Fara Williams, earning her 163rd cap, controlled the midfield impressively and produced set-pieces that handed England some of their more threatening moments in the game.
Stokes showed once again why she has been a permanent fixture in Sampson's squad since missing out on the World Cup in 2015.
Of the squad of 23 players, only left-back Alex Greenwood has not featured in the past two games as she returns from a long-term injury.
After their victory against Denmark, the Lionesses travel to Valencia on Sunday for a week of warm-weather training.
Following that, the players will be given two days off before travelling out to the Netherlands for the European Championships on 13 July, with the tournament set to begin three days later.
England open their campaign in Utrecht against Scotland on 19 July, before facing Spain on 23 July in Breda and finishing the group stage in Tilburg against Portugal.
There will be commentary on all of England's matches on BBC Radio 5 live.
England boss Mark Sampson: "I'm proud of the team and our supporters.
"It was a performance full of hard-work, resilience and grit - key qualities for us this summer."
