An animal rescue centre said it had to go undercover to save 15 pigs headed for slaughter.

They were advertised by a farmer who was selling up in Cambridgeshire.
Fenland Animal Rescue's Joshua Flanagan posed as a farmer to get the asking price down from £1,400 to £800, raised by crowdfunding.
Farm owner Emma Wallis said there was no need for the centre to go undercover and that they just needed a quick sale ahead of moving home.
Danielle Page, a pig lover, spotted the advert and when she was told the price began a Go Fund Me page calling on Fenland Animal Rescue to help her out.
"I had to do something to save them," she said.
Mr Flanagan agreed to try to find homes for them if funds were raised.
Posting the news in online vegan forums Mrs Page raised £500 within 24 hours.
Mr Flanagan then managed to negotiate a lower price by posing as a farmer.
"The farmer just wanted to sell, he wasn't bothered if they went to slaughter and this was probably less hassle," he said.
Miss Wallis, who has run the farm at Soham with her partner Carl Tiley for 11 years, said they needed them to be sold quickly as they could no longer afford to keep the farm and are moving to a house.
She said: "I don't know why they felt the need to be so underhand and dishonest.
"It wasn't about the money, it was about who could collect them the quickest.
"I would love them to have a forever home."
The pigs have gone to an animal sanctuary in Essex.
