Bought by TV stations in scores of countries including Canada, Scandinavian nations and Australia as well as by Netflix, Hinterland has become a poster-child for EU funding with grants covering 15% of the cost of making it.
Richard Harrington, who plays DCI Tom Mathias, said: "It fits really well here and there are faces here you can't replicate anywhere else because of the weather systems."
But as the third series is screened actress Mali Harries, who plays DI Mared Rhys, explores just what it is about the mid Wales countryside which has helped Hinterland appeal to 100 countries.
