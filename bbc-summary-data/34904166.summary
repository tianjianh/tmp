Thieves who targeted a jewellery shop in an early-hours raid escaped with £650,000 of items, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"Extensive damage" was caused in and around Fraser Hart in the Silbury Arcade, Milton Keynes during the break-in at about 03:30 GMT on Saturday.
The burglars tried to cover their escape by starting a fire nearby and padlocking a chain across the road to prevent a police pursuit.
Det Ch Insp Kelly Glister said it was fortunate that nobody was hurt.
