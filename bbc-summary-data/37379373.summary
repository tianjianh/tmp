[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 100 people marched from Telford Town Park to Malinsgate Police Station earlier in response to the death of the former Aston Villa star.
Mr Atkinson, 48, died after being shot with a police Taser at his father's house in Telford last month.
He went into cardiac arrest on his way to hospital and was later pronounced dead.
Community activist Desmond Jaddoo, who took part in the march, said: "We want a clear, transparent, well-resourced and thorough police investigation into the circumstances surrounding the untimely death of Dalian Atkinson following police contact."
West Mercia Police said it liaised with organisers to make sure the march remained peaceful.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the circumstances of the death, in the early hours of 15 August.
Two West Mercia officers were suspended pending the outcome.
Mr Atkinson was a top-flight striker in the 1990s, starting his career at Ipswich Town then playing for Sheffield Wednesday and Spanish side Real Sociedad before moving to Aston Villa, scoring 23 goals in 85 appearances for the Birmingham side between 1991 and 1995.
He is best remembered for scoring the Match of the Day goal of the season in 1992-93 when he dribbled the ball from inside his own half before chipping the Wimbledon keeper from the edge of the penalty  area.
