Bangladesh v England: Hosts win by 108 runs - maiden Test win over England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bangladesh claimed their first Test win over England as the tourists lost 10 wickets for 64 runs after tea on day three of the second Test in Dhaka.

Chasing 273, England collapsed from 100-0 to 164 all out, with Mehedi Hasan taking 6-77 and Shakib Al Hasan 4-49.
They earlier dismissed the hosts for 296 after dropping four catches.
Bangladesh had only beaten Zimbabwe and a weakened West Indies team in 95 previous Tests, but the 108-run win means the series finished 1-1.
England needed their highest successful run chase in Asia and looked well set after a century opening partnership between Alastair Cook and Ben Duckett.
But they lost all 10 wickets in 22.5 overs in the final session as Bangladesh secured the biggest win in their history.
Bangladesh had lost 72 of their previous Tests and last played in August 2015 because of security concerns in the country.
Duckett (56) scored his first Test half-century but was bowled by 19-year-old off-spinner Mehedi with the first ball after tea, prompting the stunning collapse - the third worst in history by a team who had been 100 without loss.
Joe Root was lbw in the following over to Shakib, before Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali were dismissed in the same Mehedi over shortly afterwards.
Cook made 59 but, despite successfully overturning one dismissal, the England captain was caught off Mehedi by Mominul Haque at silly point.
Shakib then dismissed Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid and Zafar Ansari in quick succession.
Fittingly, Mehedi took the final wicket of Steven Finn to finish with six in the innings, 12 in the match and 19 in the series.
Openers Cook and Duckett, who batted together for the first time in the first Test in Chittagong, had only managed a best partnership of 26 in their previous three innings.
Duckett, 22, impressed with an aggressive 56, hitting seven fours and a six, and played a number of reverse sweeps and pull shots.
Bangladesh bowled all four spinners in the session leading up to tea but they took no wickets in helpful conditions.
Cook had scored four, 12 and 14 in the series but also batted fluently in a period that seemed to swing the game in England's favour.
England will rue their failure to take early wickets as Bangladesh added 116 runs in the morning session and Cook's side dropped four catches.
Imrul Kayes scored 78 but was dropped at leg slip by Cook off Ansari, and then by Root off Moeen in the first 10 overs of the day.
Both were difficult catches but Duckett dropped a simple chance at deep mid-wicket later in the session with Shakib the batsman to benefit.
Finn also put down a difficult diving chance, while England chose not to review the umpire's decision on two occasions when replays showed the batsman would have been given out had they done so.
Kayes' innings and 41 from Shakib helped Bangladesh to 268-7 at lunch, but Stokes (3-52) and Rashid (4-52) helped England knock over the tail in 26 balls after lunch.

Former England spinner Vic Marks on BBC Test Match Special
That was extraordinary. I don't think I've seen a series where it's been impossible to know who's winning.
At tea time we were praising Duckett and Cook, but less than two hours later the match was over. I've not seen the mood change between sessions like that before.
Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent
I feel emotional for Bangladesh. There were all these issues about security and there were doubts about the series taking place. The people here were all so happy that England came. This is unbelievable.
Former Bangladesh all-rounder Athar Ali Khan
That was a very special win for Bangladesh. I think 160 million people in Bangladesh will have been glued to the TVs, radios and phones. I feel privileged to be here to have seen it.
