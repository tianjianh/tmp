Jedburgh whisky distilleries seek go-ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are being advised to give approval in principle to two whisky distilleries near Jedburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mossburn Distillers want to build the facilities around the former Jedforest Hotel at Camptown.
The first phase of the development between 2017 and 2018 would see a small distillery built to educate visitors in the "craft of making spirit".
A larger-scale distillery, capable of producing millions of bottles per year, would be completed by 2021.
A kitchen and cafe as well as new office buildings are all part of the phase one development, along with bottling and storage facilities.
The second stage would be "significantly bigger and significantly more productive".
It would include cafe and restaurant areas capable of catering for more than 200 people.
Scottish Borders Council planning officials are recommending approval in principle, subject to more than 20 conditions.
It will also need approval from the Scottish government on flooding matters.
