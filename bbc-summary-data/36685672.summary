Bury: League One side punished for Callum Styles registration error

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Bury have been deducted three points from last season's total for playing teenager Callum Styles when he was not properly registered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 16-year-old came on for the last 15 minutes of their final game of the season against Southend on 8 May, which they won 3-2.
Styles therefore became the first player born in the 21st century to play in the Football League.
The Shakers now drop from 14th to 16th in last season's table.
Responding to the points deduction, a club statement said: "Callum Styles arrived at Bury FC at the beginning of March and signed trialist papers with the club,
"Following a successful trial spell with the club, Callum signed as an academy player.
"However, the transfer deadline to register players with the Football League for the run into the end of the season was 24 March.
"Bury went into the game with Southend United on 8 May believing that Callum was a registered Bury player and admit all charges set down on the club and accept the punishment of a thee points deduction, as Callum completed his registration forms with the club after the deadline date of 24 March."
