Police investigating allegations of abuse after a Panorama investigation at a young offenders centre in Kent have made an 11th arrest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 26-year-old man from Canterbury is being held on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Kent Police arrested five people on 8 June over the allegations involving the G4S-run Medway Secure Training Centre (STC) in Rochester.
Five other men were arrested in January. All 10 have been bailed.
The arrests followed a BBC Panorama investigation into the Medway Centre, broadcast in January.
In May, an inquiry found complaints about three G4S-run youth offender centres had been ignored by the Youth Justice Board.
Details emerged in a report into the centre, where the BBC's Panorama secretly filmed staff assaulting children.
The Panorama programme included footage apparently showing staff mistreating and abusing inmates.
Allegations relating to 10 boys, aged 14 to 17, included use of unnecessary force, foul language and a cover-up at the centre.
Five members of staff were sacked and three more suspended, while the unit's director Ralph Marchant stood down.
In July the government is to take over the unit which takes youths aged 12 to 17 both on remand and after conviction.
Justice Secretary Michael Gove said a new governing body would scrutinise and support all three secure training centres at Medway, Oakhill in Milton Keynes and Rainsbrook near Rugby.
