O'Sullivan led 5-3 at the end of the first session, but Trump won the next three frames, including consecutive centuries, to take a 6-5 lead.
Five-time world champion O'Sullivan looked on the brink of success when he won the next three to go 8-6 up.
But Trump turned it around again by winning the final three frames.
It is the sixth ranking title of the 27-year-old's career.
Trump said: "It was a very tough game. Ronnie wasn't playing well and he still should probably have beaten me in the end so it shows how good he is. He puts you under pressure just by sitting there - nobody else does that."
