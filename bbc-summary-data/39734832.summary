Aylesbury Estate: Southwark Council promise improved compulsory purchase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council has promised an improved offer to residents of a London housing estate being forced to sell their flats in a regeneration scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Minister Sajid Javid blocked Southwark Council's previous Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPO), claiming Aylesbury Estate residents were not being protected.
The new offers will face a public inquiry and take account of increased property values, the council say.
Campaigners say current offers are not enough for owners to stay in the area.
New offers to seven remaining leaseholders in the regeneration project's first phase will "take into account the increases in values in the local property market" Southwark Council said.
Availability of local properties "considered affordable and suitable for residents' needs" will also be taken into account, according to the council.
But Jerry Flynn of the 35% Campaign, which contested Southwark Council's previous CPO, said: "no offers of compensation have been made that would allow leaseholders to remain in the area and maintain their community.
"If there is a fresh CPO, we look forward to the opportunity to examine thoroughly Southwark's case," he added.
The previous CPOs had offered sums below market rates, leaseholders told the BBC.
Resident Beverley Robinson claimed the council valued her property at Â£117,000, while two independent valuers priced it at about Â£300,000.
Peter John, leader of Southwark Council, said: "We remain committed to regenerating the Aylesbury Estate for the benefit of local residents."
The Aylesbury Estate in Elephant and Castle was the largest social housing estate in Europe, but it is to be demolished to make way for a Â£1.5bn regeneration scheme.
