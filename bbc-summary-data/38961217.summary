[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder denies wounding with intent outside Atik nightclub in Windsor in the early hours of 25 December in 2015.
Reading Crown Court heard doorman Gregor Jurcic, 27, suffered a "nasty" head injury and was left with scarring.
Mr Ince denies being the person who used a bottle to attack Mr Jurcic, who was helping police control crowds.
Up to 500 people had gathered outside the nightclub, on Victoria Street, between 03:30 and 04:00 GMT that Christmas morning.
Prosecuting, Nigel Daly said: "There was trouble brewing. The police were in attendance but they were grossly outnumbered."
Security staff from the nightclub, including Mr Jurcic, were helping officers control the crowds.
Michael Zgorzalek, another member of the security team, saw a black man run towards Mr Jurcic and attack him, the court heard.
"He saw this man jump up into the air and bring the bottle down on to his head. Having done that, Mr Ince began to run from the scene," Mr Daly said.
Mr Jurcic's blood was found on Mr Ince's jacket and CCTV footage showed a bottle coming away from the footballer as he was tackled to the ground, the jury heard.
In a police interview, Mr Ince said he had punched a man who had attacked his brother, then started to run away.
"He said he had never had a bottle in his hand,"  Mr Daly told the court.
Mr Ince, who is currently on loan at Swindon Town, denies a single charge of wounding with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm.
The trial continues.
