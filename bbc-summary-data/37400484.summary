Part of the city centre was closed off while top-of-the range sports cars raced through the streets.
Military-style vehicles and helicopters could also be seen.
Directed by Michael Bay, Transformers: The Last Knight - the fifth instalment of the franchise - stars Sir Anthony Hopkins and Mark Wahlberg and is due to be released in cinemas in June.
Northumberland has also been used for shooting parts of the movie, with the castles at Alnwick and Bamburgh taken over earlier in the week.
Streets in Newcastle city centre were closed off with much of the action, including a chase sequence, taking place around Grey's Monument.
One family travelled from Edinburgh to watch the action.
Richard, Avril and Noah Riddell set off at 03:00 BST to arrive in time.
Superfan Noah, nine, said: "My dad made me this Optimus Prime costume. I've won prizes with it.
"I managed to get someone to sign my helmet."
His father said: "We spoke to the cast, it was brilliant. You see them on TV but you never expect to see them in real life."
