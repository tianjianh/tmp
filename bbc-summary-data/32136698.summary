[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The women, aged 33 and 54, were charged under the Children and Young Persons Act after the girl was found on the corner of Abbotsford Drive on Sunday.
They had been due to appear at Falkirk Sheriff Court, but were released after the Procurator Fiscal decided there was insufficient evidence.
The case has been referred to the Children's Reporter.
A Crown Office spokesman said: "After full and careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the report, the Procurator Fiscal decided that there was insufficient evidence of criminality to take proceedings against them."
