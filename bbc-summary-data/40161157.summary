[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Strong winds and standing water have led to the TT races on the Isle of Man being postponed, organisers have said.

Clerk of the Course Gary Thompson said his decision was made following a consultation with the Manx Met office.
The rescheduled programme will see the Supersport (10:45 BST), lightweight for Supertwins (13:45) and TT Zero (16:25) races taking place on Wednesday.
The Met Office said strong winds would continued throughout Tuesday and motorists were urged to take care.
Strong winds and heavy rain caused travel disruption on roads with trees being brought down and ferries being delayed.
Forecaster David Hulse said winds could reach speeds of 45mph (72 km/h) or even higher on the Mountain Road but that rain could ease off this afternoon.
The Mountain Road was closed after a hut used by TT marshals blew into the road and cones used for a one-way system were displaced. It has since reopened.
The weather has also led to some delays with the Ben-my-Chree travelling to Birkenhead instead of Heysham.
Organisers of the Ramsey sprint said the annual drag race will still go ahead in the north of the island.
The sprint, open to anyone who has a motorbike, sees bikers from all over the world compete in a drag race over a strip of promenade almost a mile long.
