[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andy Murray is "probably in the best position he has ever been going into the French Open", according to his former coach Miles Maclagan.

Britain's world number two beat top-ranked Novak Djokovic in Sunday's Italian Open final, having lost to the Serb in last week's Madrid Open final.
Maclagan said: "This (Italian Open) was his first win over Novak on clay, so he has a deep reservoir of confidence.
"The other players will look at him as a challenger and that counts as well."
The French Open begins on 22 May and Murray reached the semi-finals last year, when the Scot was beaten by Djokovic over five sets.
Maclagan was speaking to BBC Radio 5 live.
