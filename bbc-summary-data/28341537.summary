Programmes like BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing will not be filmed at London's Television Centre (TVC) again until 2017 - two years later than planned.

BBC Studios and Post Production (S&PP) has delayed the start of its 15-year lease of the revamped Studios 1, 2 and 3, which were to re-open next year.
S&PP will remain at Elstree, its home since moving out of TVC in 2013.
Anna Mallett, CEO of the BBC subsidiary, said it was "in everyone's interests" to wait for two years.
"We are a 24/7 operation and it's absolutely vital to us that our customers have an excellent experience in our studios," she told Ariel, the BBC's in-house newspaper.
The delay, she said, would avoid possible noise or access issues affecting programmes at TVC, affectionately known as "the doughnut", while construction work is completed.
Although studio refurbishment work is on track, the developer's broader plans for the Wood Lane site have evolved and its construction programme has been extended as a result.
Former studios 4 to 8 will not be part of the redevelopment by property developers Stanhope, which bought Television Centre from the BBC in 2012.
Last month S&PP extended its deal with Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, from which it hires two large stages and the George Lucas production gallery space.
The Voice, Children in Need and Sky's A League of Their Own are among other programmes to have made use of the recently upgraded facilities.
