Chelsea Ladies: WSL side to share Kingsmeadow ground with Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea Ladies will share League One side Wimbledon's Kingsmeadow ground from the start of the next Women's Super League One season in September.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Blues will remain at Staines Town's Wheatsheaf Park ground until the WSL Spring Series finishes on 3 June, before the switch to a winter league.
In June 2016, Chelsea FC exchanged contracts with Wimbledon to buy Kingsmeadow for a reported Â£2m fee.
Wimbledon are planning to build a new 20,000-seater stadium at Plough Lane.
"This move represents a huge opportunity for Chelsea Ladies to create new memories in an area where the club already has a lot of support," manager Emma Hayes said.
"We are fully focused on the Spring Series but are already looking ahead to the 2017-18 season and a fresh start at Kingsmeadow.
"We have had a wonderful five years at Staines, they have been excellent hosts, and now we are immensely excited about what we can achieve in the coming years."
