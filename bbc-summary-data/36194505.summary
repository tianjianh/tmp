The men's and women's champions will each take home $45,000 (Â£30,675).
The tournaments will both take place in Manchester from 9-17 December - just the second time they have been held side-by-side.
Professional Squash Association chief Alex Gough says the parity in prize money is "a huge step forward that everyone in the sport can be proud of".
