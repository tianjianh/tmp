SAIS begins daily avalanche information reports

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Daily avalanche information reports for some of Scotland's most popular areas for hillwalkers and climbers have begun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) has been providing the service for several years.
It assesses avalanche hazard in six areas - Lochaber, Glen Coe, Creag Meagaidh, Southern Cairngorms , Northern Cairngorms and Torridon.
The reports are usually issued until mid-April.
Members of the service also regularly blog on conditions in the hills and mountains in these areas.
