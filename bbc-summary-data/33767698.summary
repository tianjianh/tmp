Police were called to the Muzik nightclub on Tuesday morning after shots were fired inside the bar and fighting spilled out into the street.
It was unclear whether, Drake who performed at OVO Fest on Monday, was at the club at the time of the shooting.
Last year, a man was shot near the same nightclub after the same festival.
"We are very lucky that this is not a larger body count, quite frankly," Toronto Deputy Police Chief Peter Sloly said at a new conference on Tuesday.
Police said the victims were a man and a woman in their 20s and 30s.
Officials believe there may be more injured victims who have not yet contacted the police.
It was not immediately clear what started the violence, or if police are seeking more than one suspect.
No arrests have yet been made.
