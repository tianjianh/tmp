No pylon plans for Llanberis hydro power plant

Developers behind a Â£100m hydro power plant on the edge of Snowdonia National Park have applied to lay underground cables to connect the scheme.

Snowdonia Pumped Hydro (SPH) has applied to Gwynedd council for its Glyn Rhonwy pumped hydro storage project.
One concern opponents of the scheme had was the possibility of pylons or overhead wires spoiling the landscape.
SPH said there would be neither between the plant and the grid connection at Pentir, 4.9 miles (8km) away.
The company said the trench would be built primarily on the verges of roads and would take about 12 months to dig and lay the cable.
SPH managing director Dave Holmes said he believed "economic rejuvenation and high value jobs can co-exist alongside a commitment to conserve the natural beauty of the Llanberis area".
The project sparked controversy earlier this year when opponents disputed claims the site may have been contaminated by chemicals used in World War Two bombs which were stored nearby.
Developers have said, when operational, the plant would support up to 30 full-time jobs and operate for at least 125 years.
