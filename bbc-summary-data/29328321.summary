The 26-year-old completed the 29.5km course in 38 minutes 48 seconds to beat Ukraine's Hanna Solovey by 18 seconds, with Evelyn Stevens of the United States three seconds further back.
"I'm overwhelmed and I need some time to know this is reality," Brennauer told BBC Sport.
"It was good for me that it was a long race because I am stronger at the end."
Ellen van Dijk of the Netherlands, who set off last as defending champion, trailed at the two intermediate checkpoints and was hampered by heavy rain in the closing stages as she finished more than one minute adrift in seventh.
The men's time trial takes place on Wednesday, with the women's road race on Saturday and the men's on Sunday.
Result:
1. Lisa Brennauer (Ger) 38mins 48.16secs
2. Hanna Solovey (Ukr) +18.68secs
3. Evelyn Stevens (USA)+21.25secs
4. Mieke Kroeger (Ger)+38.29secs
5. Ann-Sophie Duyck (Bel) +45.31secs
