Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights is a six-part series described as "no-holds-barred stand up with pre-filmed sketches".
Peep Show also returns for a seventh series, making it the longest running comedy in Channel 4 history.
One of its stars Robert Webb will also front a show offering an alternative take on the week's online news.
Comedian Boyle, a former panellist on BBC 2's Mock The Week, was criticised for several controversial jokes he told on the comedy news quiz.
Unknown comic Morgana Robinson has also been handed a five-part sketch show on the back of a taster tape of her material.
Channel 4's head of comedy Shane Allen described Robinson as "warm, daft and infectious" with a style of performance "reminiscent of Kenny Everett in his prime, but without the beard".
The season also features docu-soap Seven Days in Notting Hill, in which viewers will be able to follow the lives of people as they actually happen, and Wedding House, where a team of experts take over a country manor house to host wedding ceremonies for 50 couples.
New drama includes William Boyd's adaptation of his novel, Any Human Heart, starring Jim Broadbent and Matthew Macfadyen, and Shane Meadows' TV debut This Is England '86.
The channel has also bought the rights to screen new US conspiracy thriller drama The Event.
Chef Gordon Ramsay returns with a new food series hunting for the UK finest restaurants and Jamie Oliver will front a new series, Jamie's Thirty Minute Meals.
Channel 4 documentaries is promising "unprecedented access" to four police forces, a Peter Tatchell profile of the Pope and a four-part Katie Piper series on disfigurement.
Julian Bellamy, acting chief creative officer said: "This is an exciting time for Channel 4 as we enter a period of creativity and innovation with more freedom to try new things."
