A statement on their website says they are bowing out of all appearances in August because of his injury.
"The band apologise to fans but under the circumstances feel they can not perform without Gem and want to focus on supporting him," they said.
There are no more details of the accident, which took place on 1 August.
The statement continued: "Gem was released from hospital yesterday evening (Wednesday 7 August) and is recovering at home though remains under observation."
Shows in Belgium and Japan have already been cancelled.
They were originally going to play V Festival on Saturday 17 and Sunday 18 August.
Beyonce, Kings of Leon and Emeli Sande are still set to appear at the event which takes place in Essex and Staffordshire.
Along with Gem, Beady Eye features lead singer Liam Gallagher and guitarist Andy Bell, who all found fame in Oasis.
Former Kasabian guitarist Jay Mehler joined the group earlier this year.
Beady Eye's second album, BE, was released on 10 June.
They worked with Yeah Yeah Yeahs producer Dave Sitek, who Liam described as "without a doubt the best producer I've ever worked with, a real outlaw".
He added: "When we were writing it, we really got our heads down - clear heads."
The band has featured on a number of festival line-ups this year, including T in the Park and Glastonbury.
