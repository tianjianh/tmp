Wales blow as Bath's Taulupe Faletau set to miss autumn internationals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Taulupe Faletau is set to miss Wales' autumn internationals through injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The number eight suffered a knee injury on his Aviva Premiership debut for Bath on 3 September, but it was hoped he might be fit for Wales next month.
Bath do not expect the 25-year-old British and Irish Lion to start training until the middle of November.
Wales play Australia in Cardiff on 5 November, followed by Argentina and Japan before  South Africa at the Principality Stadium on 26 November.
Faletau joined Bath from Newport Gwent Dragons in the summer, and made his debut in a friendly against Scarlets in August.
He has played 61 times for Wales, and one Test for the Lions in Australia in 2013.
Wales coach Rob Howley will also be without Gloucester's Ross Moriarty for the game against Australia because it falls outside World Rugby's international window.
Howley - in charge of the team while Warren Gatland coaches the British and Irish Lions - announces his squad for the autumn series on Tuesday.
