[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh speaking rule faces challenge by two councils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for members of the public to be allowed to speak to council officials in Welsh without translation look set to be challenged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carmarthenshire and Flintshire councils are not opposed to the Welsh Language Commissioner's proposals but there is a feeling they are not practical.
It is among a host of standards they need to deliver in Welsh from 2016.
Nine councils are still considering the rules, six are happy but Pembrokeshire said it would cost them Â£500,000.
