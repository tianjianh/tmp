[SN]TITLE[SN]
Zlatan Ibrahimovic named Swedish footballer of year for 10th time

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He may not have the Ballon d'Ors of Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, but at least Zlatan Ibrahimovic can console himself with being, beyond doubt, the best player in Sweden.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Paris St-Germain striker has won a record 10th Guldbollen (Golden Ball), the award given to the best male footballer in his home country.
It is the ninth year in a row that Ibrahimovic has lifted the award.
He won it for the first time in 2005, and has won it every year since former Arsenal midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg triumphed in 2006.
No other player has won the award more than twice.
This year Ibrahimovic won a historic French domestic treble, reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League and became PSG's all-time record scorer.
Since his first Guldbollen win, Ibrahimovic has played for Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and PSG, commanding transfer fees of Â£150m.
