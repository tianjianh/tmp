This year is the 158th "best of British farming" extravaganza at Harrogate's Great Yorkshire Showground.
An Â£11.5m exhibition hall the size of three and a half Olympic swimming pools, to house the Food Hall, is new this year.
There will be more than 1,200 stands, with competitions ranging from horse-shoeing to sheep-shearing.
Get live updates and highlights from the BBC throughout the three-day show.
The forecast on the first day is bright with warm sunny spells, light winds and a low risk of very isolated showers.
The 2012 event was cancelled after one day for the first time in its history due to heavy rain, at a cost of Â£2m.
