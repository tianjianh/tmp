The 25-year-old has scored 44 goals in 88 appearances for Leeds since joining from Leicester City on a four-year deal for an undisclosed fee in July 2015.
The New Zealand international will have a medical with the Premier League club on Sunday, with the deal expected to be completed early next week.
Wood ruled himself out of Leeds' match against Sunderland on Saturday.
"Due to strong interest from a Premier League team, the ongoing discussions with the club, and given it has always been my ambition to play at the highest level, I don't feel it is right that I play today," he posted on Twitter.
Wood has turned out three times for Leeds this term, scoring one goal.
