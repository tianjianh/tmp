Johnny Depp has thanked fans for standing by him through "good times or bad" after they voted him their favourite movie icon - despite recent domestic troubles and film flops.

Depp accepted the award at the People's Choice Awards, days after his divorce from Amber Heard was finalised.
Ellen DeGeneres became the most successful star in the awards' history, with a total of 20 awards.
Her awards included best daytime TV host and best animated movie voice.
She recently made headlines when US President Barack Obama got choked up giving her the prestigious Medal of Freedom.
Depp beat Hollywood stars including Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington to be voted favourite movie icon.
Depp has denied Heard's claims he had been physically abusive to her, and police officers attending the scene said they had found no evidence of a crime.
In December, Depp was named the most overpaid actor in Hollywood for the second consecutive year.
Accepting the trophy at the Los Angeles ceremony, Depp said: "I came here for one reason tonight and one reason only.
"I came here for you, the people who, through whatever good times or bad, have stood by me, trusted me.
"You've very graciously invited me here once again tonight. You have no idea how much I appreciate it."
Blake Lively, who beat Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep to win best dramatic movie actress, said: "Thank you for sending a message to Hollywood that people want to hear stories about women, and we want to hear your stories, whether it's social media, your iPhone, whatever, tell your storiesâ€”now more than ever."
Joking with the women in the audience who whooped when she mentioned her husband, Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds, she added: "So thank you guys, and thank you to my husband who's everything to me. You can't have him, he's mine! Thank you!"
Other winners included Reynolds, Passengers star Jennifer Lawrence, Iron Man Robert Downey Jr and Suicide Squad's Margot Robbie.
The full list of winners is on the People's Choice website.
