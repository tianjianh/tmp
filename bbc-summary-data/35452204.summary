Both lifted 210kg but Godley's lighter bodyweight meant she took the gold medal.
"I've only been back in training for four weeks after Christmas, so to come away with a personal best total, I'm really happy," Godley told BBC Sport.
Godley usually competes at -63kg - as does British record holder Zoe Smith, who skipped the event.
Farnborough lifter Goldey will be among those hoping to secure an Olympic place for Great Britain at the European Championships in Norway in April.
Britain have not yet qualified any weightlifters for this summer's Games in Rio de Janeiro.
"All my training is now focused on doing well there. I really would like a top-five finish and we can qualify a spot for Rio as well," said Godley.
Great Britain are likely to send a team of seven women to the European Championships, with a maximum two in each class.
Smith, Godley, Tiler and Sarah Davies could all be vying for places in the -63kg category.
