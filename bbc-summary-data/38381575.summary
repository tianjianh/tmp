The 22-year-old, who will cost an undisclosed fee, has agreed a two-and-half-year contract.
She netted twice in 20 games for Birmingham in 2016, helping them finish fourth and reach the Continental Cup final, which they lost to her new club.
Lawley is Nick Cushing's side's first new signing of the winter.
"I'm excited for the opportunity to show my potential and what I can do," she told the Manchester City website.
"I sat down with Nick and spoke about how I can improve as a player - under his leadership and alongside the quality players that are already here.
"I want to become a better player and I hope it will help my international career as well. These facilities and the standard of football will push me on."
She will officially join Manchester City when the WSL transfer window re-opens in January.
