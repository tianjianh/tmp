Anthony Green, 38, of Huddersfield, was caught trying to arrange a bout involving his dog, Crumb, during an RSPCA investigation in May last year.
The charity said it had found messages on his mobile phone from another convicted dog fight organiser.
At Kirklees Magistrates' Court, he was banned from keeping all animals for life, except pigeons.
Green, of Riddings Rise, kept pigeons as part of his occupation and there were no issues with their welfare, the RSPCA said.
The charity carried out a series of warrants as part of an intelligence led inquiry with the police into organised dog fighting activity. At the time, Green was already serving a 12-year ban.
He was sentenced on Monday after pleading guilty to five charges including two of breaching an animal banning order, attempting to cause an animal fight to take place and two animal welfare offences.
Green was also ordered to pay £920 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
His older brother Jonathan Green, 42, of Keldregate, was also sentenced after admitting an animal welfare offence.
He was banned from keeping all animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £350 costs, £150 fine and £20 victim surcharge.
Ch Insp Ian Briggs, of the RSPCA's special operations unit, said: "Not only did Anthony Green disregard his ban on keeping dogs, he admitted trying to use his dog to fight another in what would have been a despicable act of premeditated cruelty.
"Dog fighting is an extreme form of deliberate animal cruelty and cases like this are amongst some of the most serious offences we investigate."
