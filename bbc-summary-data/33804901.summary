County Championship: Yorkshire strike back after batting collapse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire and Durham proved that Championship cricket can be just as action-packed as an Ashes Test as 20 wickets fell on day one at Scarborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side only made 162 despite a last-wicket stand of 67 between Tim Bresnan (47) and Ryan Sidebottom.
Prolific Chris Rushworth (4-37) and Graham Onions (3-41) proved too much to handle for the Championship leaders.
But Sidebottom (4-44) led the way as Durham were dismissed for 156 in reply, with Yorkshire 10-0 at the close.
Yorkshire went into the game with a 34-point lead over Warwickshire, but soon found themselves in dire straits on 54-5.
Gary Ballance's hopes of finding form after being omitted from England's Test squad came to nothing as he made six from 27 balls before being caught at slip off Onions.
Glenn Maxwell's 36 was the only score of any note before Bresnan and Sidebottom came together at 95-9.
Bresnan was eventually bowled by Paul Harrison, but then struck the first blow in Durham's reply when Graham Clark gave a catch to point.
With Paul Collingwood absent because of a back problem, acting skipper Mark Stoneman was caught hooking at long leg and 18-year-old debutant Jack Burnham was bowled by Liam Plunkett for a four-ball duck.
Durham's decline continued, with Sidebottom taking three of the last four wickets, including Ryan Pringle for 40, as their innings lasted just two balls longer than Yorkshire's.
Umpires Nick Cook and Jeremy Lloyds confirmed after the match that they were happy with the way the pitch had played and would not call in a pitch liaison officer.
Yorkshire bowler Ryan Sidebottom:
"It was certainly a bizarre day's cricket and I don't think I have played in one on day one like that before.
"I thought we batted pretty poorly in the morning with some poor shot selection but they also bowled well. What a fightback it was by our boys who needed to get us back into the game and now the momentum is in our favour but Durham are still a good side.
"It was a good wicket with carry and bounce but if you put the ball in the right areas at Scarborough you are always in the game although this was still a bizarre day."
