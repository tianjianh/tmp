The undergarments for women feature "truth" and "justice" mottos used by campaigners after the 1989 disaster in which 96 fans were unlawfully killed.
Charlotte Hennessy, whose father died, said it was "distasteful" and Walton MP Steve Rotheram said "commercialising" the disaster was a "reprehensible act".
Online retailer Amazon said the products were "no longer available".
One listing had a price of Â£18.29 plus delivery from the United States but is no longer active.
Sellers face having their accounts removed and other similar branded clothing such as crop tops and hats are being taken off sale, Amazon said.
Pictures of the products remain on the website.
In a statement, the retailer said: "All marketplace sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who don't will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.
"The products in question are no longer available."
Ms Hennessy, who was six years old when her father James Hennessy died, said: "I'm glad that it's been removed, it's absolutely shocking.
"There are a lot of people out there who have lost focus on what our fight and what our battle is about.
"Little things like this... are distasteful and it is losing sight of what Hillsborough is. It's insulting."
Football fans died following a crush at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final at the stadium in Sheffield on 15 April 1989.
A 27-year campaign by victims' families followed and resulted in new inquests being ordered after the verdict at the original hearing was quashed.
The inquest jury last month found fans were unlawfully killed as a result of failures by the police and flaws in the design of the stadium.
Mr Rotheram said: "The mind boggles... It is pretty desperate and a reprehensible act by someone trying to cash in on what is the biggest sporting disaster in British history.
"Who would want to buy women's underwear which has a Hillsborough tragedy logo on it?
"They are trying to commercialise a tragedy."
