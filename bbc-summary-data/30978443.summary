Giles Stothert, 61, did not return to Glasson Dock on the River Lune near Lancaster at about 16:30 GMT on Sunday.
RNLI lifeboats and a police helicopter searched the area until 03:30 GMT on Monday. The operation resumed earlier.
Mr Stothert, of Saltcote, Glasson Dock, was found on Middleton Sands in Morecambe.
An RNLI spokeswoman said: "A group of windsurfers called the coastguard to report that one of their group had failed to return to shore and had disappeared in foggy conditions at the mouth of the River Lune.
"Due to the state of the tide and the local weather conditions...the search area was expanded to include the Blackpool coastline."
The RNLI resumed the search and were helped by the Coastguard and Mountain Rescue Team throughout the operation.
