Preston Mommsen's side failed to recover from slipping to 20-4 in the first 19 balls of their pursuit of 148.
Spinner Wellington Masakadza, who opened the bowling, took a career-best 4-28 which included three stumpings.
Josh Davey hit two late sixes but Scotland remain without a win in a major global event.
That run takes in 20 matches in total, across three previous World T20s and three World Cups, and it rarely looked like ending in Nagpur.
Defeat means Scotland, who lost by 14 runs against Afghanistan on Tuesday, will fly home following their final Group B match against Hong Kong on Saturday, and miss out on facing the likes of England, South Africa and defending champions Sri Lanka.
There were some encouraging performances though, with 19-year-old slow left-armer Mark Watt again economical on his way to picking up two wickets.
However, none of their top four reached double figures in a disastrous start to a run-chase which should not have been out of reach on a decent wicket.
Richie Berrington joined skipper Mommsen in a mid-innings rescue act - the pair putting on 51 in an intelligent and calm partnership - and an unlikely victory seemed possible when Davey smoked two big sixes.
However, the Scots ran out of time and wickets to leave Zimbabwe and Afghanistan - who beat Hong Kong by six wickets in the later game - to scrap it out for the solitary place in the next phase.
Zimbabwe's innings was underpinned by another classy knock on the world stage by left-hander Sean Williams.
The 29-year-old, who averaged 68 in last year's 50-over World Cup, was in control throughout his innings as he swept his way to his third international T20 half-century.
Just 12 of his runs came through the off side and, without him, Zimbabwe would have struggled to have posted a competitive total.
Their next top scorer was number seven Elton Chigumbura, who hit a belligerent 20 at the back end of the innings.
Watt, Alasdair Evans and Safyaan Sharif took two wickets apiece for the Scots, who performed admirably in the field.
The most eye-catching of all their fielding came when Michael Leask pulled off a stunning boundary catch. After fumbling Richmond Mutumbami at long-off, Leask somehow managed to catch the ball one-handed behind his back.
Scotland captain Preston Mommsen: "It was a difficult start for us, they bowled well up front and we had the chance to have a crack at the end. We knew we had to be positive, and had that partnership with Richie Berrington gone on another two or three overs, we might have made it."
Zimbabwe captain Hamilton Masakadza: "We played really well, the guys are starting to gel and it's looking positive for us. The boys are believing in themselves more and going out and impressing themselves."
Scotland will play Hong Kong on Saturday, the last game in the tournament for both sides, while Zimbabwe face Afghanistan in a winner-takes-all match to determine the group winners who will qualify for the Super 10 phase.
