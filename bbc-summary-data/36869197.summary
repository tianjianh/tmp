The former West Ham United man, 22, joined Wigan for an undisclosed fee in January but was immediately loaned back to National League Macclesfield Town.
He previously played for Accrington, having started his career at Stockport, before a 2013 switch to the Hammers.
"He's definitely ready for League Two. His game will fit our game perfectly," said manager Gary Johnson.
"It's a good move for him, because it will get him some much-need experience, and it gives me good competition in my squad," he told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
Whitehead's switch from non-league to West Ham in 2013 came after a recommendation from former Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann to then Hammers boss Sam Allardyce.
