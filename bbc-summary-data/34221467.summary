Aisling Brady McCarthy had been accused of killing Rehma Sabir in 2013.
The case was dropped after a state medical examiner reversed a finding that the death was caused by shaken-baby syndrome.
Her sister, Sharon Grehan, told RTÃ‰ that Mrs Brady McCarthy had "been through hell".
"Aisling is doing amazingly well despite what she's been through," she said.
"What happened [to] her was terrible. It should never have happened. But she's enjoying her freedom, enjoying the time with her husband."
She added: "We had wonderful people help out with the visits. Going into that prison and seeing your sister in there was just terrible.
"The fact that you had to leave her there after a visit, knowing that she did nothing wrong.
"It was heartbreaking, absolutely heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking to think she had to stay in there a day, a night, let alone two and a half years."
Mrs Brady McCarthy was charged with the death of Rehma Sabir, a child she had been minding in Boston.
Prosecution lawyers alleged that Rehma had suffered fatal injuries after being shaken.
After the charges were dropped, the 37-year-old, who is originally from County Cavan, was deported as she had been living illegally in the US for 13 years.
Ms Grehan said that bringing her sister back to Ireland was an emotional journey.
"There were a lot of tears, a lot of joy, a lot of calls. So much support, people have been just wonderful," she said.
"Landing in Shannon was just surreal, the people at Shannon were great, they just got us out, at that point you were just so overwhelmed."
