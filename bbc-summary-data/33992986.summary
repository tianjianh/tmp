[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sgt Stephen Chilton cleared of excessive force misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A custody sergeant accused of using excessive force on a vulnerable teenager has been cleared of misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Stephen Chilton, of Nottinghamshire Police, put the 17-year-old in an unapproved neck lock to restrain him.
Assistant Chief Constable Simon Torr said the allegations were unproven, adding the panel did not find the use of force disproportionate.
Sgt Chilton will be given further training before resuming full duties.
The misconduct hearing, the first the force has held in public, was shown video footage of Sgt Chilton holding the youth around his neck for 56 seconds and punching him in the stomach.
The teenager had been considered at risk of self harm and had attempted to barricade himself in his cell at Bridewell custody suite in Nottingham.
When Sgt Chilton entered the room, the youth allegedly lunged at him and he was cuffed and put in the neck lock.
Parvin Fernando, representing the force, said: "There was an opportunity for that neck restraint to be loosened or removed.
"Sgt Chilton persisted with the neck restraint applied to [the prisoner] despite it being obvious that it was unsafe to do so in the circumstances."
Earlier in the hearing, the panel was told by the force's trainer in officer safety that although the hold was not taught, it appeared to be a "dangerous and comparatively unusual situation".
Judging the allegations of misconduct to be unproven, ACC Tor said: "We do not find the force used was disproportionate to the perceived threat."
