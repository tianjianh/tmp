A display of thousands of ceramic poppies has been installed in Orkney as part of war commemorations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 'Poppies: Weeping Window' installation is at St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall until June to remember 100 years since the Battle of Jutland.
More than 6,000 British personnel and 2,500 Germans died in the battle in the North Sea in 1916. Most of the British ships were stationed at Scapa Flow.
The sculpture was created by artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper.
It was originally installed at the Tower of London in 2014, where 888,246 poppies were displayed, one to honour every death in the British and colonial forces between 1914 and 1918.
The battle, which was fought near the coast of Denmark's Jutland Peninsula, involved about 250 ships.
The war at sea: 1914-18
