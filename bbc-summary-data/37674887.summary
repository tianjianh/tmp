[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 0-2 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Zach Clough penalties gave Bolton a 2-0 win over Bury, their first league victory at Gigg Lane since 1929.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The spot-kicks, which came either side of half-time, were both won and scored by Clough in the north-west neighbours' first league meeting in 17 years.
A fifth straight victory without conceding moved the team that finished bottom of the Championship last term into League One's top two.
In contrast, the Shakers slipped to a fifth consecutive league defeat.
They fell behind just 13 minutes in. A route one counter saw Clough enter the box behind the Bury backline and he went down under pressure from ex-Wanderers defender Niall Maher, who spent more than a decade alongside Clough in the club's academy system.
It appeared a soft decision from referee Geoff Eltringham and Clough rolled the penalty down the middle to give the visitors an early advantage.
It could have been 2-0 moments later as Clough rounded goalkeeper Ben Williams when he flew out from his goal, but this time Maher was able to divert the ball behind with his head.
Aside from a couple of Sammy Ameobi attempts, there was little between the two sides but another Clough penalty increased Bolton's advantage 11 minutes after the restart.
He looked to move beyond Leon Barnett with some tricky footwork and was shoved to the ground by the physical centre-back, with Eltringham again deciding in favour of Clough, who tucked this one away into the corner.
Williams twice denied him a hat-trick with a sharp, low stop and another save which he pushed around the post, and Clough was substituted 13 minutes from time to curtail any hopes of a treble.
