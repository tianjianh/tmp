Community councils object to Aberdeen waste to energy plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four community councils in Aberdeen have called for energy from waste plans to be called in for scrutiny by Scottish ministers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The city council gave the go-ahead for the Â£150m project at East Tullos last week.
The incinerator would be used by Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray councils for non-recyclable waste, to reduce the amount sent to landfill.
The Scottish government said the application would be considered.
The project is designed to generate heat that would be used in thousands of nearby homes.
It was given the go-ahead by the full city council  - by 23 votes to 14 - despite opposition from campaigners who said it could cause problems with pollution and increase traffic congestion on the already busy Wellington Road.
The plant is due to open in 2021.
Now four community councils in the south of the city have written to the Scottish government urging it to call in the application for further scrutiny.
A Scottish government spokesperson said: "We have received a request to call in the application and we are giving it due consideration."
