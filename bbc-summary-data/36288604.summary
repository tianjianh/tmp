McGinn, 25, is out of contract this summer and has been linked with Hibs, where his brother John, 21, plays.
"I thought when I first came in that Paul was a decent player," said Republic of Ireland cap O'Dea, 29.
"But the more I've seen of him, I now realise he is a very, very good player. I really hope he is here next year, but that's down to the club and him."
Having started his career at Queen's Park, McGinn joined Dundee from Dumbarton after impressing for the Sons.
He has made more than 70 appearances for Paul Hartley's side.
"His contract is running out," said former Celtic player O'Dea. "I couldn't tell you where the club are at with their talks with him.
"But I'd like to think they are doing their best to keep him because, not only is he a fantastic player now, he's a player who will only get better.
"We don't know what position he is in. There's speculation linking him to Hibs and he's maybe considering that because he doesn't have a contract offer here.
"Maybe he has to consider it because he has to look after himself. You'd need to ask him why he's not signed.
"The reason I've stayed is because this club is certainly moving in the right direction.
"They are ambitious and have tied down a number of lads, so I hope Paul remains here at the club."
