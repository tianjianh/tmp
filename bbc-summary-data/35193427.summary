[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
If found guilty, the couple may face lengthy jail terms. They are currently on bail and deny charges of employing and assaulting a minor.
The police charge sheet submitted to the court in Dhaka accuses the couple of physically torturing the child.
Bangladesh's Cricket Board has already suspended the medium-fast bowler.
The case is to be heard on 12 January.
The girl, Mahfuza Akhter Happy, was found in a Dhaka street in September with multiple injuries, including a broken leg and a black eye.
She told police that she had been working for the couple for a year and that they had beaten and tortured her.
The charges have been brought under legislation designed to protect women and children from domestic abuse.
If convicted, the cricketer and his wife, Jasmine Jahan Nritto Shahadat, could face jail terms of between seven and 14 years, plus a fine.
Hossain handed himself in on 5 October.
He initially went to police on 6 September claiming that his maid had gone missing.
