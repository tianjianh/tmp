[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A collection of photographs of Diana, Princess of Wales has gone on show in Denbighshire to mark the 20th anniversary of her death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amateur photographer Colin Edwards, 75, from Ruthin, took more than 200 pictures of the princess at public events.
She died, aged 36, on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in Paris.
The exhibition of 124 photographs is being held at St Peter's Church, Ruthin, until 29 July.
Mr Edwards - a retired civil servant who spent much of his spare time capturing pictures of the Royal Family - said: "'I met Diana at many of her walkabouts and became a familiar face.
"I would talk to her about her boys, her charities and her foreign visits; conversation was always very easy with Diana.
"In 1998, the year after her death, I held exhibitions of my photographs of her in several towns and cities and was deeply moved by the reactions of visitors."
