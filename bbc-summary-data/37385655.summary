Jalal Uddin: Jury retires in imam murder trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The jury in the trial of a man accused of murdering an imam has retired to consider its verdict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jalal Uddin, 71, died after suffering head injuries in an attack in a children's play area in Rochdale.
Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 21, of Ramsay Street, Rochdale, denies murder and being the getaway driver for Mohammed Kadir, 24, who is alleged to have killed Mr Uddin, in February.
Manchester Crown Court has heard claims they hated the imam's form of Islam.
The prosecution alleged they believed Mr Uddin was performing "black magic" because of his practising of Ruqya healing, which involves the use of amulets known as taweez.
It was also claimed they supported the so-called Islamic State (IS) and sought to punish the imam with death for this practice, in line with the group's beliefs.
Mr Syeedy, a former Manchester United steward, admitted he disagreed with Mr Uddin's beliefs but denied any link to IS.
He also told the court he did not suspect Mr Kadir of planning or being involved in the imam's murder.
Mr Kadir, of Chamber Road, Oldham, boarded a flight to Denmark three days after Mr Uddin's death on 18 February, followed by a connecting flight to Istanbul.
His whereabouts are unknown, although it is thought he may have travelled to Syria.
