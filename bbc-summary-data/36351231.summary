[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antrim fought back from six points down at half-time to beat Down 1-24 to 0-23 in the Christy Ring Cup semi-final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Down led 0-13 to 0-7 at half-time but Conor Carson's goal helped the Saffrons snatch a four-point win at Loughgiel.
The sides were still level with four minutes of normal time left but Antrim hit five of the last six scores to edge the verdict.
Derry, meanwhile, were relegated to the Nicky Rackard Cup as they were beaten 2-22 to 0-15 by Roscommon at Newry.
Wicklow led by 0-12 to 0-5 at half-time, and kicked on with a brace of goals in the second half.
Antrim were forced to dig deep against a determined Down side and the Saffrons needed a late save from keeper Chrissy O'Connell to remain on course for a return to the top flight.
Down led by 0-13 to 0-7 at half-time, with Danny Toner, Donal Hughes and Conor Woods among those performing strongly for the visitors.
The Mourne County were never headed in the first half and with Ciaran Clarke, Conor Johnston and John Dillon having to battle hard to keep Antrim in the game.
But the Antrim struck a crucial blow a minute after the restart as captain Carson netted from a free.
Scores from Eddie McCloskey and Clarke tied the game nine minutes after the restart, and although Down regained the lead, Antrim now had the momentum.
The sides were tied on eight occasions in the second half before Antrim delivered a strong finish to see them into the final where they will face either Kildare or Meath, who meet in Newbridge on Sunday.
Armagh qualified for a Nicky Rackard Cup final meeting with Mayo after they defeated Fingal 3-19 to 1-11 in Dublin.
