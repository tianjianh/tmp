Former bouncer Levi Bellfield, 43, has been convicted of murdering three young women and trying to kill another in south-west London and Surrey.

Here are profiles of the women he targeted during his campaign of violence.
Amanda Dowler, known as Milly, was a "pretty, popular and intelligent" 13-year-old girl.
"To all intents and purposes she was an ordinary girl who was developing into a fine young woman," prosecutor Brian Altman told the Old Bailey.
Milly lived in Walton with her parents Bob and Sally and older sister Gemma, who the court heard she was close to.
Gemma told the court: "We would go to bed at the same time and lie in the room chatting about our day. Milly and I didn't have any secrets and she would tell me about boys at school she fancied."
Milly liked Gareth Gates and had seen him at a Pop Idol concert a few days before she died. She had been looking forward to an upcoming school gig, where she was due to see a boy she liked.
But the court also heard there was another side to her, as poems and a "goodbye" letter were found after her death, suggesting she was unhappy.
Milly was in Year 9 at Heathside School in Weybridge, where her mother Sally taught maths.
It was only by chance that she took the route home which saw her cross Bellfield's path - she would normally have got off at another station but had gone to a cafe with friends.
"She was one of the funniest people I had ever met. She was always trying to make people laugh and smile," her friend Danielle Sykes said.
Marsha McDonnell, 19, had completed her A-levels and was taking a gap year before starting university when she died.
Described in court as an "attractive blonde", she was attacked by Bellfield just yards from the Hampton home she shared with her parents, Phil and Ute, her two sisters and younger brother.
Ms McDonnell, who was working in a gift shop in Kingston, had visited the cinema with friends on the night she was attacked.
Her sister Nathalie said: "She always thought of other people. She was a free spirit."
Speaking after the verdict, her uncle, Shane McDonnell, said: "Five years have passed since the night our beloved Marsha was so cruelly taken from this world, a girl that only had love in her heart, brutally slain by a man who only has hate in his."
Her uncle described the family's loss as devastating.
"Marsha we miss you. Our world now is incomplete, like a rainbow with a colour missing. We thank you for the joy that you brought us in your short life. Your goodness, sense of fun, spirit and passion for life remain with us", he said.
Ms McDonnell was passionate about music and a music room at the local children's hospice is dedicated to her memory.
Her uncle said: "For her family, life will never quite be the same ever again. The pain and hurt that we carry will always be there. It is a sentence with no remission."
Amelie Delagrange, 22, had a "passion for the English language" and had moved to Britain to further her studies.
Ms Delagrange, from Amiens in France, had passed her baccalaureate exams "with ease", and spent six weeks living in Manchester as part of a language course.
She enjoyed and wanted to return to the UK. She had been living in Twickenham for just three months when she was killed.
Ms Delagrange was working at a patisserie in Richmond, had a close circle of both English and French friends and was happy, the court heard.
Her parents Jean Francois and Dominique Delagrange travelled from France to the Old Bailey to hear details of their daughter's death.
"She was a good student, sensible, and never gave her parents any problems," her mother told the court.
Her boyfriend, Olivier Lenfant, also described her as a sensible girl who thought she lived in a safe area.
In a statement Ms Delgrange's parents Dominique and Jean-Francoise said: "It is nearly four years since our lives and our family's lives were so seriously disrupted, descending into a horror - a living nightmare."
They added: "We would like to have heard from Bellfield a confession of sorts, some evidence of remorse. In this we were disappointed."
A memorial tree and a bench dedicated to her memory were placed on Twickenham Green by the local community and her family,
Kate Sheedy, was 18 and the head girl at her convent school in Isleworth when she was attacked in 2004.
She had spent the evening saying goodbye to friends after her last day at Gumley House School and was walking home when she was mown down by a car.
She missed her A-levels because of the attack but was granted her predicted grades by the exam board and went on to study history and drama at York University.
The trial heard she remains mentally and physically scarred by the attack.
In a statement, Ms Sheedy said: "On the day I was attacked I was celebrating about moving onto a new and exciting time in my life.
"All that hope and excitement was taken from me and I thought my life had changed for ever."
The attack meant she attended university a year later than she had hoped.
"I will never be able to forget what happened to me, the scars on my body and the memories I have, are something I will never be rid of, but hopefully I can move on." she said.
On top of the physical and mental ordeal, Ms Sheedy said she had also suffered additional trauma and stress from the police investigation.
