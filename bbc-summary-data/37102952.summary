Grabarz, 28, cleared 2.33m but an earlier failure on his first attempt at 2.25m meant he finished joint fourth.
Drouin, 26, won with a jump of 2.38m.
Mutaz Essa Barshim of Qatar, joint bronze medallist with Grabarz and Drouin in London, cleared 2.36m to win silver, and Bohdan Bondarenko of Ukraine took bronze with 2.33m.
In clearing 2.33m, Grabarz rattled the bar, which initially stayed in place. The Briton started celebrating and the white flag was raised before the bar fell down after four seconds.
Initially it was ruled as a failure before being given as a clearance on appeal.
Grabarz told BBC Sport: "I made one fatal error at 2.25m and it cost me a medal but I'm proud of finishing fourth at an Olympic Games, even though it is the cruellest place to finish.
"It is a pretty frustrating and upsetting place to be, but Olympic fourth is still something to be pretty damn proud of."
