Neil Warnock: Cardiff City boss vows to make changes after Barnsley defeat

Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock has vowed to make changes to his side after growing tired of individual errors.

The Bluebirds lost 4-3 at home to Barnsley in a remarkable Championship encounter on Saturday.
Warnock praised his side for fighting back from 3-1 down to 3-3, but says that he is now losing patience with some of his players.
"I've persevered for a few weeks now but I've got to make changes now, I've had enough," he said.
"When I look at the goals, I have to be critical. It was exciting for the neutral, wasn't it? How not to defend.
"I was pleased with the way they came back but I'm disappointed with every goal, our own fault, elementary errors."
Cardiff's loss leaves them 20th in the Championship table, three points above the relegation zone.
Warnock would not name the players whose mistakes had angered him, but goalkeeper Ben Amos' place in the team could be under threat after an error of his led to an opposition goal for a second game in succession.
He was at fault for Wolves' goal in Cardiff's 2-1 win on Tuesday, weakly palming Matt Doherty's long-range shot into his own net.
Amos was also found wanting for Barnsley's third goal on Saturday, rushing out but stranded in no-man's land, allowing Josh Scowen to tap into an empty net.
The 25-year-old was not helped by his outfield team-mates, whose slack marking allowed Barnsley to cause havoc when counter-attacking.
"We made them look like Real Madrid for 15 minutes in the first half," Warnock added.
"We were caught twice because people who were told where they should be stood, an elementary thing, decided to do what they wanted to do. It shouldn't happen, it's disappointing.
"There were other errors along the way. I don't want to name individuals other than to say that I'll change it for the next game and January can't come soon enough."
When the January transfer window opens, Warnock hopes to make "two or three" signings - including a striker - but he also admits he may have to sell players in order to recruit more.
Cardiff's next fixture is away against Brentford on Boxing Day.
