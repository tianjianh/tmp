Fifth and final through the sliding doors was Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP. She said she has never been trouble with the police and she would fight in a war if she "had to".
Asking the questions were Sarah (18); Jamie-Lee (16); Louis (16); Erin (18) and Megan (18).
They are all members of the BBC's Generation 2016 election panel.
Ms Sturgeon, who is hoping her party will win majority government for a second time on 5 May, said she would fight in a war but she hoped "the next generation of people here don't have to".
On whether she would give a home to a refugee, the politician said: "Yes, if we had to ask people to open their own homes to refugees then I wouldn't ask other people to do that if I wasn't prepared to do it myself.
"So, as I've said before, if that was ever necessary then I would be willing to do it."
Ms Sturgeon was also asked about the minimum wage for young people and who she would most like to be stuck in a lift with.
