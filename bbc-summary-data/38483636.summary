Newport sign Peterborough United's Aaron Williams and Jaanai Gordon from West Ham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County have signed striker Aaron Williams from Peterborough United on an 18-month deal and forward Jaanai Gordon from West Ham on loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Williams, 23, joined Peterborough from Nuneaton Town last term when Exiles boss Graham Westley managed Posh.
21-year-old Gordon signed for West Ham in 2014 from Peterborough but is yet to make a senior appearance for the club.
Gordon, who joins on loan until the end of the season, also had spells with Chelmsford, Nuneaton and Sligo Rovers.
"My main priority in this window is to strengthen our back four and defensive midfield options. It is obvious that we need to be better at both ends of the pitch," Westley told the club's website.
"Bringing in Aaron will increase our work ethic and thrust as a team. This is a good start to building a momentum and winning team in the second half of the season.
"Jaanai is a player with the potential to change games."
