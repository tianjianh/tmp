The isolation experiment, which will last a year starting on Friday, will be the longest of its type attempted.
The experiment is intended to help Nasa prepare for a possible human mission to the Red Planet.
The six-strong team will live in close quarters under the dome, without fresh air, fresh food or privacy.
