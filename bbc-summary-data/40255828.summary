Van der Merwe is scheduled to join the Irish province on a two-year deal after the conclusion of his season with the Super Rugby Southern Kings side.
However, the Kings said on Monday evening that Van der Merwe would undergo shoulder surgery on Tuesday.
"Van der Merwe will be ruled out for the remainder of the Vodacom Super Rugby season," said a Kings statement.
Last month, Ulster revealed that their planned acquisition of South African flanker Arno Botha had fallen through following a medical assessment.
Botha signed a two-year deal in January and was due to move to Belfast at the end of the Bulls' Super Rugby campaign.
However, the 25-year-old flanker has suffered a series of injury setbacks and Ulster were informed there was an increased risk in the deal.
