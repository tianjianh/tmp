[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brian Conroy jailed for knife attack on David Mair at party

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who attacked a fellow party-goer with a knife at a flat in Glasgow has been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian Conroy, 30, claimed he was not responsible for stabbing 26-year-old David Mair at the flat in Dennistoun on 18 November 2012.
But a jury at the High Court in Edinburgh convicted him of attempted murder after hearing how he apparently admitted the attack in a text message.
The court heard that the attack had left Mr Mair permanently scarred.
The jury heard about an exchange of text messages in which Conroy was asked: "Why did you do it?" His reply had apparently agreed he was responsible.
During the trial Conroy claimed he had only taken part in banter and had only agreed he was the one who had spilled beer on a carpet.
He denied going into the kitchen of the flat in Findlay Drive and arming himself with a knife after arguing with Mr Mair.
Conroy, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, was found guilty of attacking Mr Mair, brandishing a knife and striking him repeatedly on the body.
