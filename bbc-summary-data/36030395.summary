Anderson's Inner Circle and Dean Holdsworth's Sports Shield completed a takeover from Eddie Davies last month.
The Wanderers, Â£179.2m in debt, have already been relegated this season.
"Our initial job is to make sure we perform on the pitch and then make sure we get our finances in order and give the best opportunity to go forward," he told North West Tonight.
"As I sit now I'm the current custodian, along with Dean, at this club and we've got to try and change things and not repeat the mistakes of the past.
"Fans are happy if things perform well on the pitch, if they don't they're very unhappy."
Saturday's 4-1 loss at Derby confirmed Bolton's drop into the third tier of English football for the first time since 1992-93.
They were in the Premier League as recently as 2012, having competed in the Uefa Cup in 2008, and Anderson aims to return the club to that level as soon as possible.
"Short-term [the ambition is] to get promoted again next year," he said.
"And then like everybody else's dream to get back in the Premier League. That's a very tough call nowadays.
"If we could emulate what Bournemouth have done, I'd be very happy."
Anderson confirmed that they have a shortlist of three candidates as they search for a new manager and an appointment could be close.
Neil Lennon left shortly after the takeover, but interim boss Jimmy Phillips could not prevent relegation to League One.
"I think with the three candidates we'll have a second interview with all three of them," said Anderson.
"Hopefully we'll be able to reach a decision as to which manager we would like to appoint.
"It's probably likely to be next week, as a couple of them are still in jobs."
Asked if ex-Bolton captain Kevin Nolan, who was demoted from his position as player-manager at Leyton Orient on Tuesday, was one of the three, Anderson responded: "As far as I know, he hasn't applied."
