Nico Rosberg: I can laugh with Lewis Hamilton now

Rosberg, 31, who retired five days after his triumph, said a "base respect" from their teenage karting days prevented a fatal falling-out.
"We had a few nice conversations since my retirement. There were some kind words from him," he told BBC Sport.
"Who knows, in the future, we might get on well again."
In an interview with BBC Sport, the German revealed:
Rosberg and Hamilton were friends and team-mates as young teenagers on the karting circuit, sharing hotel rooms as well as garages.
However their relationship has been strained as they have contested the title over the past three seasons.
The tension between the pair - evident in Rosberg's testy reaction when Hamilton tossed him a 'second place' cap after sealing the 2015 title in Austin - has been increased by collisions at the Spanish and Austrian Grand Prix during this campaign.
In this year's Abu Dhabi decider, Hamilton disobeyed team orders by deliberating driving slowly at the front of the race in an attempt bring other drivers into contention and force Rosberg out of the top-three finish he needed for the title.
However Hamilton congratulated Rosberg on the podium and on Twitter after the race.
"Beating Lewis makes it all the more special because he is one of the best out there, a great rival and a very, very tough competitor," added Rosberg.
Rosberg and Hamilton's battles recalled the great rivalry shared between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna when team-mates at McLaren in the late eighties.
After finishing second to Hamilton by 67 and 59 points respectively in the previous two seasons, Rosberg changed his mental and technical approach.
"I just went all out this year," he said.
"I had a mental trainer and looked into meditation - actually meditation is a big word, it was more mindfulness training... awareness.
"The other one was go-karting. We only drive every two weeks and you can imagine a tennis player who only practises every two weeks - that is not going to be good for his skill.
"I did a lot of go-karting in between. For sure that really helped."
Rosberg has suggested that he might turn to acting after finishing his racing career and is certain that he would not be tempted back to the sport like other world champions such as Michael Schumacher and Kimi Raikkonen.
"For sure, it is definite," he said when asked about his retirement.

"It is not an easy step. It is a big change, but it feels right."
Mercedes have identified Williams' Valtteri Bottas as their preferred replacement after Rosberg unexpectedly quit with two years left on his contract. Williams have rejected an initial approach for the Finn.
Hamilton has said that he "doesn't care" who is brought in to replace Rosberg.
Rosberg, whose father Keke won the world title in 1982, says that the joy of finally reaching motorsport's pinnacle is still sinking in.
"I couldn't sleep at one o'clock in the morning," he said.
"I was going back in my thoughts and suddenly I just punched the air because it has happened.
"It is very special."
