Did all the players do enough to keep their place for Thursday's match against Wales in Lens? Or is anyone in danger of dropping to the bench?
Chief football writer Phil McNulty rates the England players in Marseille's Stade Velodrome...
Had little to do but some uncertain moments on the ball. No chance with the goal.
Vibrant attacking performance in the first half justified his selection. May be put under more pressure against Wales but did well here.
Booked, but a solid, determined performance and made a couple of crucial blocks.
Steady. Strong in some physical exchanges and largely untroubled.
Some good crossing, especially in the first half, but found himself in an aerial mismatch with Vasili Berezutski for Russia's equaliser.
Impressive on the ball, solid in the tackle and a thunderous free kick for his goal.
Showed some good touches and confidence at this level. More to come.
England's man of the match. Great range of passing and controlled the game until he was taken off. Outstanding.
Another who vindicated Hodgson's faith. Strong running and only marks off for a couple of chances missed in the first half.
Got worse as the game went on, betraying a lack of confidence. His place may be under threat for the game against Wales.
Quiet night for the Spurs striker, who got little service and support and mysteriously still takes England's corners. Will improve as he has real class.
Couple of runs but did not make much impact.
