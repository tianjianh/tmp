Sarah Smith's charity walk before leg amputation op

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who is having her lower leg amputated is attempting to walk three miles to raise money for charity ahead of the operation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sarah Smith, from Somerset, was born with a bone disorder and has had 14 operations throughout her life on her left foot and ankle.
She said she had "exceeded her pain tolerance" in the past three years and decided on amputation in August.
The walk started in Vivary Park in Taunton on Sunday morning.
'Worse and worse'
Ms Smith said she had "short-term terror in anticipation of the surgery", which is due to take place later this year at the Bristol Royal Infirmary.
"After surgery I don't have any worries. My pain changed and increased about three years ago and it has got worse and worse.
"In August, I sat there and I just thought 'I can't do this pain anymore'.
"I can't carry on going to work, I can't look after my horse, I can't cook tea and I can't even clean my teeth in the morning," she said.
The money raised by the walk will go towards two charities - Above and Beyond, which raises money for Bristol's hospitals, and the Conquest Centre in Norton Fitzwarren, which helps people with disabilities learn how to ride.
