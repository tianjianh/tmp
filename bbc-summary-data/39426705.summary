St Johnstone v Heart of Midlothian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Johnstone pair Richard Foster and Danny Swanson are suspended for Hearts' visit after being sent off following their spat against Hamilton Accies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Steven MacLean is available after being rested because of the artificial surface, while captain Steven Anderson is battling to recover from a hamstring injury.
Hearts midfielder Arnaud Djoum is likely to miss out again.
And defender Aaron Hughes faces another 10 days on the sidelines.
Fellow defenders John Souttar and Callum Paterson are long-term absentees, while Saints' Keith Watson, Ally Gilchrist and Chris Kane remain on the sidelines.
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "It was very disappointing on Saturday because of how we lost the game in almost the last minute and we put in an incredible effort with nine men.
"We have moved on from it as best we can. We'll draw a line totally under it.
"We've done extremely well against Hearts this season - we've beaten them twice - but we know it will be a difficult game.
"I thought they were excellent for 25-30 minutes against Celtic and they have a lot of quality in their squad.
"They've had a bit of a bad run at the minute and we're coming off a defeat.
"So we are looking to bounce back and Ian Cathro will be looking for his team to bounce back.
"At home, we have got to make sure we take the game to them."
Hearts head coach Ian Cathro: "It's a very important game.
"The opportunity for this club to be playing in Europe is a very important thing.
"The first step is for us to recover the position in the league, which has probably been the minimum normal for this club historically.
"It was more or less the position the club was in after the first game I had arrived.
"It's important we maintain that and we address that quickly. Where we set our objectives and targets, that can still be a little bit further down the line."
