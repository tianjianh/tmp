Woking 0-0 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Woking dropped into the relegation zone following a goalless draw against mid-table Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a disappointing opening half of few chances, Wood nearly broke the deadlock two minutes before the break when Kenny Davis rose highest to meet a cross but his header cleared Michael Poke's bar.
The visitors made a bright start to the second half as Femi Ilesanmi's shot was deflected over, although seconds later Wood goalkeeper Grant Smith parried a shot from Fabio Saraiva, who also just cleared the bar with a free-kick on the edge of the area.
The visitors nearly stole the points with a couple of goalmouth scrambles in the final five minutes but the Cards cleared their lines on both occasions.
