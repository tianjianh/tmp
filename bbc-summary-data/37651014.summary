Welshman Lee Selby could fight Carl Frampton in a world featherweight unification bout in 2017, says Frampton's trainer.

WBA champion Frampton is first set for a rematch with Leo Santa Cruz, while Selby will defend his IBF title against challenger Jonathan Victor Barros.
Frampton's trainer Shane McGuigan hopes the contests will share a bill in the United States in December.
"They are both managed by Al Heymon," said McGuigan.
"So I think there is a chance we could put them together on the bill."
"We will potentially have an announcement about Carl Frampton's next fight before the week is out, or early next week.
"It is looking like the Leo Santa Cruz rematch and that's a great fight for us."
McGuigan says talks have started over a potential fight with Selby, who is promoted in the UK by Matchroom.

Selby has already made clear he would like to face Frampton.
"I would like that fight in the summer and Carl would as well," said McGuigan.
"Lee sees the big money sign over Carl's head - he's an elite fighter, has been recognised in the United States as one of the top dogs.
"Lee is a warrior and wants to prove himself against Carl Frampton and I know he would take the fight straight away."
