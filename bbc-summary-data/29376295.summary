Callum Greenwood was playing in a relative's garden in Elswick Road in the West End of the city on Thursday.
He was reported missing at about 18:45 BST and found in the water a few minutes later. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Northumbria Police said there was no third party involvement and a report was being prepared for the coroner.
Neighbour Melissa Hill said it was "pretty awful" to see all the police activity outside the house.
She said: "It's beyond words, you can't imagine how the family are feeling, it's such a tragic awful thing."
