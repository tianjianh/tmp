[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 110-year-old rugby jersey belonging to a legendary New Zealand captain is being auctioned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dave Gallaher wore the shirt during the 1905 tour of the British Isles and swapped it with Wales captain Gwyn Nicholls after a match.
He subsequently gave it to a van boy at his laundry business, Thomas Mahoney, whose family have kept it ever since.
It is expected to fetch Â£20,000 - Â£40,000 when it is auctioned on 9 October in Cardiff.
Ben Rogers Jones of auctioneers Rogers Jones & Co said: "The jersey is undoubtedly the most significant sport-related lot we have ever offered."
A bronze statue of Gallaher, who died in 1917 in Belgium while serving in World War One, was unveiled outside the home of New Zealand rugby, Eden Park, in 2011.
