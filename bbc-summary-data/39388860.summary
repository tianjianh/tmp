[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 0-1 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham became the first side in the top six tiers of English football to be relegated this season as a home Championship defeat by Fulham condemned them to the drop.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sone Aluko poked home the only goal of the game to lift the Cottagers into the play-off places.
The scrambled finish ended Rotherham's three-season stay in the second-tier.
Fulham keeper David Button had earlier denied Lee Frecklington and Jon Taylor, while Danny Ward also went close.
Ward wasted the best chance of the first half, sending a free header wide, while Taylor was foiled moments after Chris Martin wasted Fulham's first real chance.
The goal which inflicted an eighth straight defeat on Rotherham, and sent them down, was an untidy one, with defender Darnell Fisher and goalkeeper Lewis Price initially blocking efforts before Aluko finished from close range.
Fulham's first win in three games was enough to move them above Sheffield Wednesday after the Owls were held to a 1-1 draw against Barnsley earlier in the day.
Since a 2-1 defeat by Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield on 27 September, Rotherham have been bottom of the Championship.
In total, the Millers have spent just 26 days of the 239 this season outside the relegation places.
Caretaker boss Paul Warne was the man to oversee relegation, having taken charge of the club in November after Kenny Jackett -  who succeeded Alan Stubbs - resigned after just 39 days at the helm.
Rotherham interim boss Paul Warne: "There's a little bit of embarrassment. I took the reins a few months ago and I haven't been good enough to get the results to keep us up and that is on my head.
"The performances have been okay at times but we haven't got that strength in depth. But that's my fault, it's not anyone else's.
"I don't think anyone thought before today that we would stay up, we weren't going to win eight on the spin. So to have relegated next to our name isn't too much of a shock."
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic: "It is a great step for us towards where we want to be.
"It was a very tough game. I am pleased because I have missed some 1-0 wins, so to get the goal and then finish with a clean sheet is pleasing and it is important news for us.
"We tried to be focused on our job and thinking about what we can do.
"We weren't thinking about Sheffield Wednesday or about other teams. Our focus is on us in this crucial part of the competition and getting as many points as is possible for us."
