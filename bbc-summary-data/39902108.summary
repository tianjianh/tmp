Could Trump be guilty of obstruction of justice?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Trump administration's story of why FBI director James Comey was fired, which began to twist almost as soon as it was told, took another turn on Thursday when the president said this to NBC News:

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story'."
To some, that statement was evidence of what many already believed - the president decided to fire Mr Comey to impede the FBI's investigation into the Russia scandal.
That has led to speculation that the president may have obstructed justice - a criminal offence. But experts say that suspecting obstruction of justice and proving it are two very different things.
Broadly speaking, obstruction of justice is any interference with a judicial or congressional proceeding. It might commonly be applied in cases where someone has tampered with evidence, intimidated a witness, or failed to report a crime.
The key legal statute in this case is 18 US Code Section 1512, which contains a broad definition allowing charges to be brought against someone who "obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so".
"The statutes are quite broadly written," said Alex Whiting, a former prosecutor and law professor at Harvard Law School, "but the key factor, certainly in this case, is intent."
Mr Trump was well within his legal rights in sacking Mr Comey. "The president can fire an FBI director for turning up in the wrong tie or socks, if he wants to," said Stanford Law School professor Pamela Karlan.
"The real question is whether in doing so he was attempting to impede the FBI's investigation."
Section 1512 requires a person not only to attempt to obstruct justice but to do it with "corrupt" intent.
"That's the key word here," said Mr Whiting. "The government would have to prove that it was done corruptly, defined as having a bad intent or wrongful purpose."
Proving corrupt intent on Mr Trump's part would be difficult, Mr Whiting said, given that the president had also accused Mr Comey of poor management of the FBI and of mishandling the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.
"He has provided all these other explanations for why he fired him, so trying to prove beyond reasonable doubt that those were all false would be very tough."
Mr Trump's remarks could, however, go on to form part of a body of evidence, said Christopher Slobogin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University.
"You would need more of a smoking gun," he said. "But it depends what we hear about what happened in the Oval Office, and what Trump himself says. He seems to have no compunction about saying whatever's on his mind so, who knows?
Under the constitution, impeachment proceedings require a president to have committed "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours". Ruling out the first two, in this case, the terms "high crimes and misdemeanours" are loosely defined but obstruction of justice, if proved, would "clearly count", Ms Karlan said.
The charge was levelled against former presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon during their impeachment proceedings. Clinton was impeached by the House but not the Senate, Nixon resigned first.
More importantly in this case, impeachment has a political dimension. It would require the support of a majority of members of Congress, and with a Republican majority in both houses that is highly unlikely, as things stand.
"We are far from that point," said Mr Whiting. "Even if it smells like obstruction of justice, unless there was clear evidence of criminality. It won't rise to the level of impeachment.
"And there would be great resistance in Congress. It would tear the country apart, there would be paralysis for months."
Not yet, said Ms Karlan. "Right now this is a president behaving extraordinarily badly. The question is what will the various institutions of government do about this.
"If it becomes clear that the president is trying to obstruct justice and Congress does nothing, that moves us towards a constitutional crisis. If Congress doesn't fulfil its role as a check on the president, that's a real problem."
