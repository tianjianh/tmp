Kris Commons insists he is not looking beyond his emergency loan move to Hibernian after making his first appearance in 10 months.

The 33-year-old Celtic playmaker lasted the full game as the Championship leaders drew 1-1 at Morton.
Commons' deal at Easter Road expires on 15 January and he would not be drawn on the possibility of extending his stay.
"I've got no plans for January or the end of the season. I'm not looking that far," he told BBC Scotland.
"It's four weeks here, then we'll see what happens. I'm contracted to Celtic until the end of June.
"I know they are heading in a different direction and I'll be knocking on the door of 34 next year.
"For me, it's about playing on for as long as I can.
"I'm very comfortable in Glasgow. My kids are in school and it's been our home for the last six years now so it is difficult to leave."
Commons has not featured at all for Celtic since Brendan Rodgers took over as manager in the summer and enjoyed playing on a smaller stage than he has been used to with the Scottish champions.
"It was nice just to get back out there," he said. "I felt like I was fit enough to get through the game but certainly cramping up towards the end.
"There's a different feel to it, Championship football.
"But the boys have been magic, I got a tremendous welcome from the fans and the manager knows what I'm capable of."
Hibs head coach Neil Lennon signed Commons for Celtic in 2011, with the player going on to win five titles, two Scottish Cups and a League Cup.
"He got better as the game went on," Lennon said of the new arrival's debut in front of 2,156 fans at Cappielow. "He started finding more space.
"It's a tight pitch and it was congested in the midfield area.
"It took a while to get going but he'll feel the benefit of the 90 minutes."
Midfielder John McGinn, currently recovering from ankle surgery, hopes Hibs can persuade Commons to prolong his loan next month.
"It is a tremendous signing for us," he told BBC Scotland. "He has been a top player in this country for a few years and someone who I feel could still play for the Celtic first team.
"Hopefully we can make him feel as welcome as possible and, if he enjoys it, he can stay until the end of the season."
