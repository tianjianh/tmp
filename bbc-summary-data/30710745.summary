[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Capt Eustace Jotham won the medal in the Tochi Valley, in what is now Pakistan, on 7 January 1915.
He was killed while trying to rescue a comrade when the small unit he was commanding was surrounded by 1,500 tribesmen.
The paving stone is outside St Mary's and All Saints Church in Kidderminster.
Capt Jotham was born in the town in 1883 and joined the Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire) Regiment in 1903.
He transferred to the Indian Army two years later and was promoted to Captain with the 51st Sikhs in 1912.
On 7 January 1915, Capt Jotham was commanding about a dozen men who were surrounded by about 1,500 tribesmen.
He gave the order to retire, and could have escaped, but was killed trying to rescue one of his men who had lost his horse.
The memorial has been provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government as part of a Government initiative to commemorate all the First World War recipients of Britain's highest gallantry award for bravery in the face of the enemy.
