[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saracens thrashed four-time champions Toulouse in their opening European Champions Cup game.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was agreed on Saturday morning that the match would go ahead after Friday's deadly attacks in Paris.
England's Owen Farrell starred for the Premiership champions, landing six kicks in a dominant first half.
Mako Vunipola crossed first as Chris Wyles added two for Sarries, while Toulouse earned a second-half consolation from Christopher Tolofua.
France captain Thierry Dusautoir led out Toulouse at Allianz Park and his players were visibly moved by the minute's silence and rendition of the French national anthem before the game.
England back Farrell, who has scored 35 points in three league games this season, quickly kicked two penalties to give the hosts a 6-0 lead.
Last season's semi-finalists Sarries led by 13 points after Vunipola muscled his way over the line and the television match official awarded the try, which Farrell converted.
The fly-half added three more penalties, as Toulouse prop Census Johnston was yellow carded, and Wyles then crossed in the corner after some precise build-up play from England trio Alex Goode, Farrell and Brad Barritt.
Saracens went in 27-0 ahead at the break and they pounced again after the restart as Wyles stretched backwards to touch down, although Farrell looked to get the final hand.
Toulouse, fourth in the Top 14, eventually scored after 49 minutes thanks to hooker Tolofua, and Sebastien Bezy was able to convert.
That was the final score of the game, as the French side pegged back Sarries to deny them the bonus point.
Saracens head coach Mark McCall: "We have got to be delighted with how we played in that first half. I thought it was outstanding.
"Sometimes, the frustration of the last 25 or 30 minutes can make you disregard some of the really good things you did.
"Our energy was brilliant, our defence was brilliant and our attack was really good."
