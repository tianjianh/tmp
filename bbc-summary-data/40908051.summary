[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Omar Bugiel scored a late winner as Forest Green Rovers came from two goals down to beat Yeovil Town 4-3 at the New Lawn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors took the lead after nine minutes when Olufela Olomola tapped home from close range before Otis Khan doubled their advantage from the penalty spot after the midfielder was tripped in the area.
Rovers responded in the 23rd minute after Dale Bennett got to the byeline and found the towering head of Christian Doidge, but the Glovers restored their two-goal lead when a defensive header by Emmanuel Monthe kindly fell to striker Francois Zoko to tap in.
Reece Brown hit back for the hosts to make it 3-2 with a well-struck free-kick from the edge of the box on the stroke of half-time.
Charlie Cooper restored parity after 49 minutes with an effort from range which flew through the hands of goalkeeper Artur  Krysiak.
Substitute Bugiel then completed the remarkable turnaround, latching onto a deflection and out-jumped the advancing goalkeeper to head into an empty net with 11 minutes remaining.
