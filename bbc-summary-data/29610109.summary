If you leave your mobile phone somewhere do you worry you will not be able to check it?
If any of this sounds familiar, there is a chance you could be spending too much time on social networks.
An exclusive online Newsbeat poll suggests that a quarter of 15 to 18-year-olds in the UK feel happier online than they do in real life.
Dr Radha from The Surgery on Radio 1 has dealt with patients who have displayed "a lot of social anxiety" because they are using social networks too much.
"Being online can provoke a sense of 'I'm not good enough, everyone else is having an amazing life'," she explained.
"It doesn't give us a sense of reality and actually what you will find is most people are probably doing the same thing as you are."
The survey, carried out last month, also suggests a third of 15 to 18-year-olds have met someone in person they originally met through social media.
Dr Radha has said it is important people carefully consider what information they share with the online community.
"What this survey showed is a lot of people go online alone," she said.
"In terms of our personal details and how we respond to messages from other people, we need to make sure we are looking after all of that safely."
Dr Radha was concerned that some people feel safer dealing with people online, rather than in person.
"The more time we spend online, the less we are able to develop our social skills," she explained.
"When you are online you're not getting eye contact with people or perceiving how body language is changing, so as a result what people are saying can be misinterpreted.
"Physical contact, like a hug and a kiss, is really important. You don't get that kind of emotional confidence from being online."
If your online activity is leaving you feeling anxious, Dr Radha has advised that you should "slowly try to wean yourself off it".
She said: "If you are worrying, 'what's going on? What am I missing?' It's a sign that being online too much is quite bad for you.
"Give yourself some rules by saying, 'I'm only going to check things three times a day for this amount of time'."
BBC Radio 1's The Surgery with Aled and Dr Radha is on Wednesday's at 9pm.
