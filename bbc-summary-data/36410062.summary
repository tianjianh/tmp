County Championship: Notts on top despite Scott Borthwick's 188 not out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Borthwick hit an unbeaten 188 for Durham but Nottinghamshire ended day three at Trent Bridge on top.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Borthwick's innings included 28 fours and a six but the visitors were all out for 447, still trailing by 87 runs as no other Durham player passed 50 runs.
Harry Gurney shone with the ball, with his three wickets including Graham Onions and Paul Collingwood.
Notts closed on 104-1, after Borthwick dismissed Steven Mullaney lbw for 43, to forge a lead of 191 runs.
With the away side managing to add just five runs in the morning before losing Collingwood to be left 198-5, Durham looked to be struggling to avoid the follow-on.
However, Borthwick remained unfazed and reached his century off 158 balls - sharing half-century partnerships with Ryan Pringle (34) and Brydon Carse (47) before eventually running out of partners as he searched for a double century.
The hosts rarely looked troubled during their second innings, but with rain expected on Tuesday, Borthwick's sublime innings may have rescued a draw for Durham.
