Patients and their carers are being asked to share their experiences in an attempt to improve care.
Alzheimer's Society figures show dementia affects 45,000 people in Wales and experts fear this number could rise by 40% in the next 10 years.
Mr Gething said Wales needs an "ambitious" plan to improve care for sufferers.
