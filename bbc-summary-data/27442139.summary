The Northampton woman, who was the only female rider at the meeting, crashed at a chicane near the start/finish area.
"I'm totally gutted to tell you that due to a little broken bone from my off on Thursday, I won't be competing in the NW 200," Costello said on Facebook.
The 40-year-old was competing at the event for a 10th year.
Costello also missed Thursday night's opening races because of her injury.
She walked away from the incident and the practice session was resumed after a short delay to clear the track.
