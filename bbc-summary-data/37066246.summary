Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark says the club were powerless to prevent striker Josh Magennis leaving to join Charlton Athletic.

The Northern Ireland international signed a two-year deal with the English League One side.
''I know Kilmarnock fans will be gutted Josh has left," said Clark.
''It's a terrific move for Josh, financially he'll get a much bigger offer than we could ever offer him.''
Kilmarnock rejected three bids from Charlton for Magennis but finally accepted an offer reported to be around Â£250,000 on Thursday.
''The club didn't just take the first offer that came in for Josh, we did everything we could to keep him," Clark explained.
"But when it becomes apparent that the player's heart is set on the move then it's about getting the best possible deal.''
The Killie boss would like to use all the money from Magennis' sale to strengthen his playing squad, but accepts that is unlikely to happen.
''Of course I want every single penny. The club have already banked the cash so I want the interest as well.
"I'll always be greedy as a manager, but as a club we have to be run on a firm financial footing.
''I'll have to sit down with the board of directors and see what I can use, not just in terms of the transfer fee but also in terms of Josh's salary. He was one of the club's highest earners so we'll need to see what we can use.''
''Fans are entitled to want all the money used and that would be my ideal scenario but reality steps in and we have to act accordingly.
"There are some targets we believe we can get and from now until the end of the transfer window that's what we're looking to do."
