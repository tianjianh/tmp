Claudio Bravo: Manchester City and Barcelona in 'agreement' over goalkeeper

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barcelona say they "have the beginning of an agreement" over keeper Claudio Bravo's transfer to Manchester City.

The Spanish club's technical secretary Robert Fernandez said: "We are awaiting events this week. When Claudio leaves, we hope to have a new keeper."
The arrival of Chile international Bravo, 33, would likely leave England keeper Joe Hart as third choice at City under new manager Pep Guardiola.
Hart, 29, is considering a move after being dropped for Willy Caballero.
Guardiola said on Friday that Hart can leave the club if he wants, with Everton and Spanish side Sevilla interested in signing him.
BBC Sport understands the player does not want to move to Sevilla - or German side Borussia Dortmund, with whom he has also been linked.
Hart has been a substitute in City's three games this season, with former Barca boss Guardiola saying he prefers a goalkeeper "able to play with the ball".
He added: "I spoke with Joe from the first moment we met. I try to be clear with my players and I was clear with him.
"The first thing I am looking for from the goalkeeper is to save. After that he has to be able to help us to create a good build-up. That is why I am here."
Hart has made 347 appearances in all competitions for City since joining from Shrewsbury in 2006.
He has won 63 caps for England, but had a disappointing Euro 2016, making mistakes against Wales and Iceland as Roy Hodgson's side were knocked out in the last 16.
Bravo, who has played 75 games for Barca following a move from Real Sociedad in 2014, is Chile's most capped player with 106 appearances.
Ajax goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen is expected to replace Bravo at Spanish champions Barcelona, who also have German 24-year-old Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
