Former Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has started a second spell as Molde coach, one day before facing Celtic in the Europa League.

The Norwegians sit seventh in the Tippeligaen and Erling Moe has been in caretaker charge since Tor Ole Skullerud was sacked in August.
Solskjaer, 42, who had an 11-year spell at Old Trafford, has signed a three-and-a-half year contract.
He was Molde boss for three years before joining Cardiff City in 2014.
But he was sacked after only nine months in the job, with the Welsh club having been relegated from the Premier League and suffering a poor start to their season back in the Championship.
Solskjaer, capped 67 times for his country, had most recently been coaching youths at Clausenengen, the Norwegian club where he began his playing career.
He had a season as a player with Molde before his transfer to Manchester United in 1996, and returned to the club after a spell coaching the reserves at Old Trafford.
Now he will lead the reigning Norwegian champions against Celtic as compatriot Ronny Deila brings his side to Aker Stadion on Thursday for their first meeting in Europa League Group A.
Despite their indifferent domestic form, Molde are surprise leaders of the group, two points ahead of the Scottish champions, after a win over Fenerbahce and a draw with Ajax.
