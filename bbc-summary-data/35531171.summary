Chelsea must reach the final of the Champions League or the FA Cup to save their season, says goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Chelsea face Paris St-Germain on 16 February before their fifth-round FA Cup tie with Manchester City.
"We play against two great sides and we have to try to win those games," said the Blues number one.
"The only way to save our season is to reach the final in one or both of them."
Following their 1-1 Premier League draw with Manchester United, Chelsea still sit low down the Premier League table in 13th position, 17 points from a Champions League spot.
"Obviously every time we don't win in the league, and there is one game less, there is less chance to get into the top four," the 23-year-old told Chelseafc.com
Chelsea have gone nine matches without defeat under interim manager Guus Hiddink and they have not given up on reaching a top-four spot.
"We will see where we are with five-six games in a row and see whether we can get there or not."
The Blues next league game is against relegation-threatened Newcastle on Saturday.
