Burnley 2-0 Watford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley's record signing Jeff Hendrick scored his first goal for the club to help his side beat a lacklustre Watford in the Premier League.

The hosts had carried the greater threat and Hendrick headed in from a Steven Defour cross for the opener.
Troy Deeney had a rare Hornets shot saved before Defour crossed for Michael Keane to nod in a second for Burnley.
Isaac Success went close late on for Watford but the Clarets easily held on for a second league win of the season.
The victory moved Burnley level on seven points with Watford.
Burnley went into the game as this season's lowest scorers in the Premier League with three goals and without striker Andre Gray, who was starting a four-match ban for comments on social media.
However, with Sam Vokes as a lone target man up front they looked dangerous with their crosses into the striker before taking the lead when Defour sent in a corner for Hendrick's opener.
Midfielder Defour, who moved to Turf Moor for £8m in the summer, has already become an influential presence for the side and also provided the cross for Keane to score.
Defour has been involved in four of his side's five goals this season, scoring one and assisting three.
"I'm very pleased," said the Belgium international. "The work of the whole team means that I can bring this sort of game, which is what I was bought to do."
Defour will be key for Sean Dyche's side along with their home form, with 13 of Burnley's total of 17 Premier League wins coming at Turf Moor.
Watford beat Manchester United last time out but they were a different side on Monday as they managed just one effort on target in the first half, an Odion Ighalo header easily saved by keeper Tom Heaton.
The visitors might have thought Dean Marney was offside in the build-up to opener - and also thought Defour's delivery went out of play - but their defending still left plenty to be desired.
Right-back Juan Zuniga, who scored against United, replaced centre-back Craig Cathcart for the second half as Watford went from 3-5-2 to four at the back.

However, it did not result in a change of fortune as the home side extended their lead with a goal that meant the last seven Watford have conceded in the league have all come from from crosses.
Success added some much-needed energy for the visitors and they did mount some pressure late on - but by then the game had gone.
"It wasn't good enough," said Deeney. "We got bullied to a man all over the pitch. They won the first ball and the second ball."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "I thought we played very well in the first half and the early stages of the second and then we got a little bit nervous, but we never really looked like they were going to open us up."
On Andre Gray's four-match ban: "We are all a little disappointed, we think it is a tough one. I have always made it clear it is unacceptable and the player apologised straight away and made it clear he is in a different place now.
"We think the suspension will have an effect, but we believe in the group and what we do and the players we have got."

Watford boss Walter Mazzarri: "It was not good enough. I was hoping the players would come to the pitch with the same hunger and determination [as against Manchester United] - but they didn't. We will reflect.
"In English football it is difficult. Burnley were very aggressive - they also beat Liverpool."
Watford are at home to Bournemouth on Saturday at 15:00 BST, while Burnley are in action a day later when they host Arsenal at 16:30 BST.
