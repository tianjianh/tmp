Australian police and animal charity, the Australian RSPCA, are investigating the discovery of at least 55 greyhound carcasses found dumped in bushland.

The decomposing carcasses were discovered near Bundaberg, Queensland, by a member of the public.
Queensland's Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller said the discovery was "totally sickening".
It comes weeks after a scandal erupted over the illegal use of live bait to train Australian greyhounds for racing.
The investigation, broadcast by ABC Four Corners in February, showed live possums, pigs and rabbits being tied to lures to be chased and killed by dogs at one facility.
A number of trainers have been suspended in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, while six Queensland trainers were issued with lifetime bans from the sport.
The chairman of Greyhound Racing Victoria and the entire board of NSW Greyhound Racing also resigned.
A spokesman for the RSPCA said the dogs found in Bundaberg were believed to have been killed before the Four Corners report was broadcast.
Michael Beatty told Fairfax media there had "always been a lot of wastage in the greyhound industry".
"The indications are that these may just be young dogs that didn't have the speed, basically. But that's really all we know," he said.
Ms Miller told ABC News that such "sickening" cruelty would not be tolerated in Queensland.
The head of Racing Queensland, Darren Condon, said he had not had any indication of "a mass dumping of dogs", Fairfax reports.
He said the organisation would assist the police and take "the appropriate response."
