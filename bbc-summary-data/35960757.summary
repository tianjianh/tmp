County Championship: Gareth Roderick's unbeaten 88 helps Gloucs to 262

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gareth Roderick hit an unbeaten 88 as Gloucestershire and Essex shared an even first day at the County Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old hit 11 fours as he shared a 73-run fourth-wicket partnership with Hamish Marshall (51).
Marshall departed after being caught well by Jesse Ryder attempting to drive Jamie Porter, whose four wickets restricted the away side to just 262.
In reply, Liam Nowell trapped Nick Browne for one but England captain Alistair Cook helped Essex reach 39-1.
