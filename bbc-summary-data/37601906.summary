The Dutch-based team won the 40km race in 48 minutes 41.62 seconds, 48.24secs ahead of a Canyon-Sram squad which contained Briton Hannah Barnes.
Fellow Briton Ciara Horne claimed bronze with Cervelo Bigla.
In the men's race Etixx-Quick Step denied BMC a third consecutive win.
The winning team included Germany's Tony Martin and Marcel Kittel in its ranks and won by 11.69 seconds. Team Sky, featuring Geraint Thomas and Ben Swift, finished fourth, 54 seconds down on the winners.
A number of riders were affected by the 40C heat and cross winds with Rabo-Liv's Anouska Koster crashing into the barriers.
Afterwards team-mate Roxanne Knetmann said: "I cannot explain how excruciating it feels to be riding 40km through the desert.  It's horrible. It's like riding in a sauna."
From Monday, competitors will switch from their pro teams to their national teams.
Deignan will be defending her road world title on Saturday, while Mark Cavendish is among the favourites to win a second world title on 16 October.
Meanwhile, the doctor at the centre of a UK Anti-Doping investigation into allegations of wrongdoing in cycling, Richard Freeman, will not now be with the Great Britain team at the Championships this week.
In a statement, British Cycling said: "This was a decision jointly reached by the team management and Richard. The riders in Doha will instead be supported by UCI medical team at the worlds, alongside the usual Great Britain cycling team support staff.
Programmes director Andy Harrison said: "This was a decision taken with the best interests of Richard and the riders at heart. We have every confidence that the team will get all the support they need."
Freeman, who was part of Team GB's support staff at the Rio Olympics, has declined to comment.
