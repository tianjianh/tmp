[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are looking for two men who launched a racist attack as part of a "crime spree" in Stirling city centre.

The duo approached three Nigerian students in Cowane Street on Saturday and shouted racial abuse at them, goaded them to fight, threw a pint glass and assaulted one of them.
Both men were between 20 and 22. One was 6ft tall and was wearing a red top, while the other was 5ft 8in tall and was wearing a white shirt and hoodie.
Officers have appealed for information.
The attack, which occurred at about 21:10, ended when a member of the public stopped his vehicle to check on the victims on nearby Wallace Street, and police are also keen to trace this person.
The two attackers then moved on to Bruce Street, where they assaulted two students, one of whom was a 19-year-old woman, in another unprovoked attack.
Insp Jim Young said: "The behaviour of these two males is very concerning. They were first noticed in Viewfield Street and they then entered Cowane Street where they started their crime spree.
"Due to one having a pint glass in his hand, it is likely they have been in a local pub before this and we are currently checking licensed premises and CCTV to identify them.
"They have targeted everyone they have come across which includes a female.
"Due to the time of night and city centre location, someone will have seen them and know who they are. I am appealing for witnesses to come forward and help identify them."
In a separate inquiry, Forth Valley police are investigating another racial incident where two Zimbabwean men were abused outside the Masterchef Takeaway on Strathmore Drive in Cornton.
The man involved in the incident at 21:45 on Sunday was white, about 30 years old, of stocky build and had short hair. He was wearing a tracksuit, appeared to be drunk, and walked into a nearby block of flats after the incident.
