Police believe the 18-year-old was attacked by men who got out of the Ford Focus that hit him shortly before 18:15 GMT on Tuesday in south London.
He was found by officers with serious stab wounds in Rushcroft Road, where it meets Windrush Square, in Brixton.
He received medical attention at the scene before he was taken to a south London hospital.
Scotland Yard believes he was riding his bicycle in Rushcroft Road when he was struck by the grey car, which was abandoned.
Det Sgt Ewan Robertson said: "This was a violent attack, carried out close to a funfair being enjoyed by families and children, which has left the young victim with serious injuries.
"If you have any information that can help assist our investigation, please contact us."
