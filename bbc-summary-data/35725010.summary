[SN]TITLE[SN]
Midwife struck off over misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A midwife who provided substandard care to pregnant woman and left some in distress after rupturing membranes without consent has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anne Facchini, 61, retired from NHS Ayrshire and Arran in 2013 after complaints had been made against her.
Following a series of hearings, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) found her guilty of misconduct.
The striking off order means that Facchini will not be able to re-apply for approval for five years.
The NMC found charges against Facchini proven in relation to two patients.
One, referred to as patient B, was under Facchini's care from 9-10 May 2011.
The NMC found that Facchini "did not respond to the patient's care needs", "ruptured membranes without consent...causing the patient pain and discomfort" and "did not adjust the temperature of the patient's birthing pool".
Another incident, involving a woman referred to as patient C, related to care from 6-7 October 2012.
The NMC found that Facchini "failed to discuss the birth plan", "did not keep the patient informed", "ruptured membranes without consent...causing the patient pain and discomfort" and "spoke to the patient in an inappropriate and uncaring manner", calling her "'stupid' or words to that effect".
Another charge against Facchini, over her failure to keep proper clinical records between 3 December 2012 and 2 March 2013, was also found proven.
The NMC concluded: "Given the seriousness of facts found proved in relation to misconduct, and the impact that Mrs Facchini's behaviour had on vulnerable patients, the panel considers that Mrs Facchini's conduct was a serious departure from the standards expected of a registered midwife and as such Mrs Facchini did not uphold the reputation of the profession at the relevant time.
"Therefore for all of the above reasons the panel determined that the facts found proved do amount to misconduct."
The panel also noted: "The lack of evidence of remorse, remediation or insight meant that it could not be satisfied that there was no risk of Mrs Facchini's conduct being repeated in the future."
It decided that the appropriate course of action was for Facchini to be struck off.
