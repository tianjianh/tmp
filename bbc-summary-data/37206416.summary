Blackburn left-back Stephen Hendrie has also been added to the squad for the matches against Macedonia and Ukraine on 2 and 6 September.
Brentford's Lewis Macleod and Kilmarnock's Callum McFadzean drop out.
Well boss Mark McGhee had said this week he had been "disappointed" that Ricky Sbragia had not chosen Cadden for the European Championship qualifiers.
The 19-year-old has scored three goals so far this season and McGhee, who is also an assistant coach to Scotland boss Gordon Strachan, said the player had often been man of the match in the "30 or so" games for the Steelmen.
Cadden's impressive runs from midfield earned him the sponsor's man-of-the-match award in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Dundee at Fir Park.
Sbragia also has Ryan Gauld of Vitoria de Setubal, Celtic's Liam Henderson, Craig Slater of Colchester and Aberdeen's Craig Storie as his options in midfield.
