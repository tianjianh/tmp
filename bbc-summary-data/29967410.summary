He was targeted by a man who'd walked into a burger joint and fired at him several times from close range with a handgun.
The 38-year-old rapper was affiliated with former G-Unit artist Spider Loc, who was discovered by Suge Knight.
His 2011 track Gangsta Luv was based on LA's gang culture and has been watched more than 250,000 times since it was released.
The shooting in Palmdale, about 35 miles (56km) north of Los Angeles, happened with about 15 people inside the restaurant, where the rapper was eating lunch.
"It appears to detectives... that this was not a random shooting," said the LA County Sheriff's Department.
It identified the person shot inside the fast-food restaurant as 38-year-old Habeeb Ameer Zekajj, who is also known as Big Paybacc.
His YouTube videos include Gangsta Luv and I'm Frum Gangstaz.
Comments posted on social media after Zekajj's death paid tribute to him.
"Rest in peace", the hip-hop website Global Grind said on its Twitter page.
Sheriff's deputies found Zekajj with multiple gunshot wounds and detectives say they are still looking for the gunman.
Jessica Jefferson, a woman who identified herself as the rapper's girlfriend, told local television station CBS2 that he had three children.
"He's a good rapper, and he has so many followers and people who stand behind him. He really is a good, solid person," Jefferson told the station.
