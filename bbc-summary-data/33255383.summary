Europe's media hold breath amid last-ditch Greece deal efforts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is caution and scepticism, but also hope and a sense of urgency, in European editorials and commentaries on Greece's last-ditch bid to reach a debt deal.

"The dream is over," proclaims the German mass-circulation Bild.
The tabloid, a fierce critic of the Greek bailout, says more and more German media outlets are advocating Athens' exit from the eurozone.
"For Europe and for Greece, a Grexit is the best option. This has clearly been Bild's opinion since the start of the Greek crisis five years ago," says the daily.
The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung agrees.
"Even if a 'solution' for Greece looks probable again after all, and even small promises of reform are celebrated, this does not mean that the crisis has gone away. The Grexit question continues to smoulder," says the paper.
Berlin-based daily Die Welt highlights the pro-European rallies in Athens.
In a commentary entitled "The Other Greece", the paper says: "During the Greek-European rescue psychodrama of recent months one could almost forget that Greece is not solely populated by left-wing dreamers"
"This could be the beginning of a long journey back to their senses. But we are not quite there yet," adds the paper.
In Greece itself, the pro-government "I Avgi" daily says lenders have to address issues of "growth and debt" in order for a deal to materialise.
"Otherwise, there can be no viable agreement," says the paper's editorial.
It also highlights that any possible agreement is subject to a parliamentary majority approval.
Centrist Kathimerini says possible pressure by the IMF and Germany for more fiscal streamlining than was proposed by the Greeks would be a "huge mistake".
Its editorial, headlined "The Persistence and the Mistake", also criticises the tax measures entailed in the Greek proposals.
"The government's persistence in continuing to protect the state sector and its refusal to face the critical social security issue lead to deadly taxes. This is good for the political clientele, but catastrophic for the economy".
　
In France, papers are adopting a cautious tone.
"Greece in the final stretch", says a headline in Le Figaro.
"In Paris, do we really fear the Grexit scenario?" According to the Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, there is a real risk," says Le Monde.
La Tribune talks about an "economically costly deal".
"The 'blame game' of finding a culprit for the deterioration of the Greek economy has begun... If the government survives the agreement politically, it is already preparing for the next step: referring to a failed policy that has been imposed on it." 　
The Irish Times calls for an urgent deal on Greece, while criticising the negotiation process over the past five years.
"It should never have come to this. The handling of the Greek debt crisis does not reflect well on either side of the negotiating table," says the paper.
"The Greek crisis raises more fundamental issues about the eurozone and its future…A deal is now urgently required."
Italy's centre-right Corriere della Sera warns against pushing Greece towards Russia.
"A Greek default would give the Kremlin's leader a new opportunity to sow further seeds of discord and division between the United States and its European allies," says a commentary in the paper.
Berlin's Tagesspiegel concurs.
"Euro or drachma - that's only what's being played out in front of the stage curtain. In reality, the Tsipras government is gambling on the price for Athens staying in the Western alliance. A Grexit would be a triumph for Vladimir Putin."
