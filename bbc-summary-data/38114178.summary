[SN]TITLE[SN]
Braintree Town 1-0 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Braintree bounced back from successive National League defeats to see off Sutton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Cheek scored the only goal of the game nine minutes before half-time with what was one of Braintree's few efforts in the first half.
Sutton, who had won just one of their previous 12 away matches in the league this season, tried to fight back in the second half but found Braintree goalkeeper Sam Beasant in inspired form.
He did well to deny Roarie Deacon immediately after the break and also prevented Dan Fitchett equalising soon after from a great opportunity.
Beasant continued to perform heroics, Craig McAllister unable to beat the 28-year-old when clean through and Adam May seeing another effort saved.
Visiting striker Matt Tubbs saw a late shot come back off the post as Braintree held on to move five points clear of the relegation zone.
