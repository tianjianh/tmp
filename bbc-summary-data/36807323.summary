The 29-year-old joined the English Premiership club on a three-year deal in 2013 but only made five appearances for Sale last season.
Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons said: "He is a big, powerful ball carrier with international experience.
"I have no doubt that he will add huge value to the team and look forward to working with him."
Fihaki, who joined Sale after four years with New Zealand provincial side North Harbour, made his international debut for Tonga against Japan in May 2013 and now has eight caps for his country, with two tries to his credit.
Through his involvement with previous clubs and his country, Fihaki is familiar with a number of his new team-mates.
"I've played against a few of the squad - Nasi Manu back in New Zealand and Will Helu in the Premiership - though I've also played with him in the Tongan team," he said.
"Of course I've played alongside Fowlesy [Nathan Fowles] at Sale and also with Phil Burleigh in a Chiefs development side.
"The move will be a great adventure for me and my family.
"I'm mainly a number eight, but I can play on the blindside too.
"I think my physicality will help the club, especially carrying the ball into contact."
