Five men have been bailed following arrests over a BBC Panorama investigation into abuse at young offenders centre in Kent.

Police said they were detained by officers investigating allegations staff mistreated youngsters at Medway Secure Training Centre, in Rochester.
Four of the men were arrested on suspicion of child neglect. The force has not confirmed the arrest details for the fifth person.
They have all been bailed until April.
The allegations uncovered by Panorama relate to 10 boys, aged 14 to 17, and involve unnecessary force, foul language and a cover-up.
Three of the five men arrested on Wednesday were among four team leaders at the centre who were sacked on Tuesday, the BBC understands.
Paul Cook, who is managing director for children's services at G4S, said there was "no place in our business for the conduct shown on the BBC's Panorama programme" and the firm fully supported the police action.
A female duty operations manager has also been placed on restricted duties, while a male healthcare worker employed by Central and North West London NHS Trust (CNWL) has been suspended.
