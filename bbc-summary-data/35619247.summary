"I felt we had to put in a performance today with character because it was always going to be a tough game to win.
"Apart from conceding a late goal again - which is obviously a problem that we have and it's a disappointing one - the reality of the three points is really pleasing.
"Today's about winning. We've played well in the past and not won. The win lifts the whole mood of the place and it's important that I'm the one to do that.
"I was brought in to do a job, I'm 32 games in to that; the more we stay together and stay strong the stronger we'll get and the further we'll go."
