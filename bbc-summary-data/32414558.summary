[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 73-year-old man has admitted conspiring to supply cannabis from his guest house in Denbighshire.

Owen McKay, from Llandyrnog, near Denbigh, changed his plea to guilty ahead of a trial at Mold Crown Court on Wednesday.
At a previous hearing, his wife and her son pleaded guilty to the same charge. The case centres on allegations they ran a cannabis factory at home.
They are all due to be sentenced in three weeks' time.
McKay's plea was on the basis that he had turned a blind eye to what was going on at the guest house between December 2013 and April 2014, the court heard.
Prosecutor Richard Edwards said there had been a strong smell of cannabis in the house but there was no forensic evidence to link the defendant with the drugs, as had been the case with teacher Susan McKay, 57, from Llandyrnog, and Michael McKay, 27, from Huntington, Cheshire.
