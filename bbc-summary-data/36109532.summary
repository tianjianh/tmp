Andy King: Leicester City 'excited, not pressured' says Wales midfielder

Wales midfielder Andy King insists Leicester City are not feeling the pressure as they close in on a first Premier League title.

Leicester are five points clear of second-placed Tottenham with four games to go, starting with Sunday's home game against Swansea City.
Spurs increased the pressure on the Foxes by thrashing Stoke City 4-0.
"It's a different type of pressure and it's more excitement than pressure," King told BBC Sport Wales.
"Pressure is when you are facing getting relegated or there's people at the club who might be losing their jobs.
"Everyone around here's buzzing and we can't wait for the games to come now. We know we've got four massive games to go."
Leicester avoided relegation last season but, under manager Claudio Ranieri, they have mounted a title challenge.
The Foxes have already secured Champions League football for next season and King is hoping to become only the fourth Welshman to win the Premier League title.
Ryan Giggs won a record 13 Premier League medals with Manchester United, while Mark Hughes and Clayton Blackmore also picked up winners' medals with the Red Devils.
King, 27, joined Leicester in 2004 after being released as a youngster by Chelsea and has won League One and Championship titles with the Foxes.
Leicester are unbeaten in their last eight games, although Leonardo Ulloa's injury-time penalty rescued a point for Leicester in a controversial encounter with West Ham last Sunday.
The Foxes face Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea after Sunday's game against Swansea and King says winning the title would be "unbelievable."
"We're confident we can keep our good run going and hopefully finish the job," King added.
"We've got a really good dressing room and everyone works hard for each other.
"There's a good team spirit and I think you can see that in the way we play for each other and the way everyone throws their body on the line.
"We've got a focused group and we're very conscious to finish the job."
