Brian Scrine was airlifted to hospital on 2 April after chasing a gang of "toe rags" on bikes who were "carving up" the pitch at Trowbridge Cricket Club.
According to the club, Mr Scrine suffered a heart attack about an hour after the confrontation and was taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol.
The news was announced on the club's Facebook page over the weekend.
A spokesman for the club, said: "Brian was chasing a few ignorant teenage toe rags and an hour later he ended up having a bad heart attack.
"The said mindless idiots were riding and carving up the cricket square on their bikes.
"Confrontation then ensued and we think this is what resulted in the current situation. I'm sure we all wish him well and all our thoughts and prayers are with him."
As well as playing host to Trowbridge, the ground often serves as Wiltshire's home ground and is a favourite spot traditionally for touring international sides to play the Minor Counties at the start of a summer tour.
Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara played at Trowbridge at the start of their international careers.
