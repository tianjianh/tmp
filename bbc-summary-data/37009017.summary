Spinner Stephen O'Keefe has been fined by Cricket Australia for "offensive behaviour" while intoxicated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
O'Keefe, who returned early from Australia's tour of Sri Lanka because of a hamstring injury, was ejected from a Sydney hotel on Saturday.
"I failed to uphold the high standards expected of a New South Wales and Australian cricketer and apologise to all concerned," said the 31-year-old.
"I take full responsibility for my actions and accept the sanction."
As well as being fined A$10,000 (Â£5,850), O'Keefe must attend counselling.
Australia are 2-0 behind in the Test series against Sri Lanka with only one match remaining.
There is also a five-match one-day series and a two-match Twenty20 series.
