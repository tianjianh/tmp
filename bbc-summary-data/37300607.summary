Clarke, 27, did not line out for Kieran McGeeney's Armagh team in 2016 and moved to New York several months ago.
He says he is "very happy" to play for the Shamrocks in their Cosmopolitan Soccer League Division One campaign.
"I have enjoyed moving to New York and I was keen to find a soccer club that plays at a competitive level," he told the club's website.
Last year Clarke returned from New York to play for Crossmaglen in their Ulster club final win over Scotstown and also played in the All-Ireland club semi-final defeat to Castlebar Mitchels in February.
After returning to New York he was introduced to former Manchester United youth and League of Ireland player Kevin Grogan, who is the technical director and first team coach of the Queens-based club.
"It's been a good experience training under Kevin and he offers great advice and coaching experience," added Clarke.
"We're all focused on the first game now and ensuring we can start off with a win."
The club begin their league campaign on Sunday away to Zum Schneider of Randalls Island.
