Khan beat fellow Briton Kell Brook, Australia's Jeff Horn and American Terence Crawford, with 48% of the vote.
Pacquaio said his next fight will be in the United Arab Emirates and asked followers to pick his opponent.
The 38-year-old Filipino retired in April, but returned to claim the belt by beating Jessie Vargas in November.
"See you in UAE for my next fight," wrote the six-weight world champion.
In December, Brook's promoter Eddie Hearn told the BBC that he was in talks to fight Khan.
Both men lost their last fights, Brook to Gennady Golovkin and Khan to Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez.
In 2015, Khan claimed he was being lined up as an opponent for Pacquiao, but that the veteran did not want to face him.
