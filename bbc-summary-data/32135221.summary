Reality check: Have 1,000 jobs a day been created?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron says the coalition has created 1,000 jobs a day since it took office in 2010, a total of 1.9 million jobs. Is this correct?

The first thing to note is that that the best available figures relate to the number of people in employment, not the number of jobs. That's important. Some people may have more than one job, for example. And some statisticians say that you shouldn't use employment as a measure of job-creation.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest that there were around 30.9 million people in employment in the UK for the period from November 2014 to January 2015. There were around 29 million people in work between February and April 2010, just before the coalition government came into office.  That is a difference of around 1.9 million.
The coalition government was formed on 12 May 2010. Parliament was formally dissolved on 30 March 2015. That is a period of 1,783 days. If you divide the increase in the number of people in work by the number of days this government has been in office, then you get an answer of 1,066.
This is, of course, just an illustration of how employment has increased. It is not an accurate reflection of when jobs have been created over the course of this Parliament. Nor does it take into account unemployment figures or the growing population.
It also doesn't help us with questions about the type of work being created and whether there are people who are self-employed or working part-time and would prefer a full-time job with an employer.
