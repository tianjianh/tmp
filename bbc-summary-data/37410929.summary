A rare blue marlin which washed up on a Pembrokeshire beach has a new home at London's Natural History Museum.

The 13ft-long (4m) fish discovered at Freshwater East caused a stir among locals, as it was originally thought to have been a swordfish.
It has since been identified as only the third blue marlin to be found in the UK, and the first full one to be recovered.
The museum said it hoped it would now be studied by its research department.
After it was discovered, the fish was inspected by Milford Haven Coastguard and Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, before it was reported to the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme.
A day later experts from the Natural History Museum's department of life sciences came to collect it.
Senior fish curator Oliver Crimmen said staff were delighted by the find.
"The flies had started to take an interest in it but we were amazed it was in such good condition," he said.
"I'm hopeful it will go to our research department and provide us with a valuable subject for science," he added, saying he hoped it might eventually go on display at the museum.
Blue marlin spend most of their life in the open sea, far from land, and are more often associated with warmer waters.
Two of the three which have washed up in the UK were found in Pembrokeshire - the first in Saundersfoot in 2008, but it was not good enough to be preserved.
