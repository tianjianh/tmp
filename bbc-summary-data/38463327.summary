The New Saints: Craig Harrison hopes they can beat world record wins total

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The New Saints boss Craig Harrison hopes his side can beat Cefn Druids on Friday and claim the world record for the most consecutive wins.

Harrison's side could beat the 44-year old record, set by a legendary Ajax side which included Johan Cruyff.
If the Saints win, they will make it 27 victories on the bounce and they will become the new record holders.
"Every Christmas I get the Guinness Book of Records and I love it," Harrison told BBC Radio Shropshire.
Saints were last defeated in July when they lost 3-0 to Apoel Nicosia of Cyprus in a Champions League qualifier but then their winning run began and they equalled the record by beating Cefn Druids 4-0 at home 4-0 on Boxing Day.
They now go into the away return fixture looking to make history and Harrison says it will be a boyhood dream come if the Welsh club do take their place in the Guinness Book of Records.
"I love reading the stats and having a look at it. I have done it since I was a little boy," he said.
"It's not something when you go into football that comes into your head in any way shape or form. You want to be a professional footballer, you want to play in the Premier League, you want to play for your country.
"As a manager I want to manage as high as I can. I have managed in the Champions League, I have won trophies and I want to keep going as a young manager.
"There are little milestones, but being in the Guinness Book of Records is not one I would have ever thought of."

The current world record was set by Dutch giants Ajax in 1972. The Amsterdam club won 26 games in a row in all competitions, including 19 league wins in the Eredivisie, four European Cup victories and three Dutch Cup wins.
Brazilian side Cortiba won 24 straight games in 2011 and Real Madrid - including Wales forward Gareth Bale - won 22 consecutive games during the 2014-15 season.
Scottish side East Kilbride actually went on a longer winning run earlier this season, with 30 consecutive wins, and received a crate of beer from Ajax in recognition.
But their feat has not been recognised by Guinness World Records as they play in the fifth-tier Lowland League and not in their nation's top-tier.
Saints may be on course to win the domestic Welsh treble for a third successive year thanks to their fantastic run, but Harrison does admit that comparisons between his team and the Ajax are hard to swallow.
"You would be silly if you were comparing Ajax to TNS because that Ajax team with Johan Cruyff and so on were the best team in Europe at the time," Harrison added.
"So it's almost tongue in cheek, but on a serious note it's a very proud achievement for the club, players, management and fans to where we have got to
"26 games winning on the bounce at any level is good , take away being compared to Ajax which is flattering and very nice, but a bit unrealistic.
"We always worry about ourselves and we want to break records and be better and it has proved so this year."
