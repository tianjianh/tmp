World Para-athletics Championships: Who to watch and when

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Stadium has come alive as the World Para-athletics Championships takes place at the home of the 2012 Paralympic Games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been billed as the biggest edition of the event ever, with more tickets sold than in all of the eight previous championships combined.
But who are the big names, when are the big races and how can you keep across the action? Here is everything you need to know.

The championships opened on Friday evening and run until Sunday, 23 July. There are evening sessions every day, as well as morning sessions from Saturday 15 to Tuesday 18 July and on the final Saturday and Sunday.
They do, but they have to share. The recent Anniversary Games, the World Para-athletics Championships and the World Athletics Championships, which run from 4 to 13 August, are all being held at the venue this summer.
West Ham's first three Premier League games of the 2017-18 season will be played away from home to accommodate the athletics.
As of 6 July there had been 230,000 tickets sold, making it the most well attended World Para-athletics Championships in history. There are still tickets remaining should you decide to go.
BBC Radio 5 live will be bringing you commentary throughout the 10 days, as will BBC World Service, and there will be live updates on the BBC Sport website and app. You can also watch the action on Channel 4.
A total of 1,074 athletes are competing from 91 nations, with 213 medal events. Great Britain have a 49-strong team.
Jonnie Peacock, the 100m sprint star who won gold at the 2012 and 2016 Paralympics, came to London in search of a second world title, and got it on Sunday.
Hannah Cockroft won three gold medals at Rio 2016 and arrived at the championships with 12 Paralympic and World titles to her name - a total she has added to with 100m and 800m golds, with the 400m still to come
Aled Davies and Jo Butterfield dominated the shot put and club throw respectively in Rio and were expected to do the same again. Davies defended his F42 discus world title on Sunday.
Kadeena Cox made a name for herself in Brazil by winning gold on the cycling track and athletics track. She began in London with a bronze in the T38 200m, and was hoping to add a 400m world title to her accomplishments.
Richard Whitehead, Hollie Arnold and Sophie Hahn all replicated the gold-winning success in Rio as early as day two at these championships, while Georgie Hermitage and Paul Blake had hopes of following suit.
Ten-time Paralympic medallist David Weir was never considered for selection after he withdrew from British Athletics earlier this year because of a fallout with coach Jenni Banks.
He has subsequently retired from track racing to focus on long-distance road racing and made his last competitive appearance last week at the London Anniversary Games.
The absence of Libby Clegg should also be mentioned. Clegg won two sprint golds at Rio 2016 but had to pull out of this summer's event through injury.

The British team finished fourth in the medal table at the last World Championships in Doha two years ago. GB had 31 medals, 13 gold, and came behind China, Russia and the US.
GB will match that tally of golds if all of their victorious athletes from Rio 2016 repeat their success.
Russia will not be competing because they remain banned by the International Paralympic Committee following evidence of widespread doping, so GB will expect to move up the table by at least one place.
Each athletics event is given a code, made up of one letter and two numbers, which is called a classification. It tells you more about the type of disability the athletes in that event have.
