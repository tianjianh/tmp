Rates: NI households and businesses face 1.7% rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Household and business regional rates will rise by 1.7% in April, Finance Minister Mervyn Storey has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rates are property taxes - they are made up of the regional rate and the district rate which is set by councils.
Mr Storey said the 1.7% increase is a real term freeze, when inflation is considered.
Although CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation is 0.3%, a different measure based on UK GDP is used in public finance accounting.
Mr Storey said: "By freezing the regional rate in real terms for the sixth year in a row, the Executive has aimed to strike a balance between the needs of ratepayers during challenging economic times and ensuring that public finances are sufficient to cover the priorities we have set ourselves."
