The Leicester City frontman enhanced his growing reputation with a 30-yard shot that flew past Reds keeper Simon Mignolet on Tuesday.
It was the first of two goals for the England international in a 2-0 win.
Speaking ahead of Saturday's match with Manchester City, Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri said the goal was "amazing - you can put him with Van Basten".
Dutch great Van Basten scored some brilliant goals in his career, including a memorable volley against the USSR in the final of the 1988 European Championship.
Running away from goal and towards the byeline on the right-hand side of the penalty area, he showed amazing technique and awareness to fire his volley over goalkeeper Rinat Dasayev from a tight angle.
The strike helped give the Netherlands a 2-0 win in the final.

Meanwhile, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino says Vardy is as good as his own Harry Kane and Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero.
Vardy is the Premier League's top scorer this season with 18, three above fellow England striker Kane in joint second.
Argentine Aguero, who cost City a reported Â£38m in 2011, won last season's Golden Boot with 26 goals.
"Today Vardy and Kane show big quality and the same quality as Aguero," Pochettino said.
"They are all different and come from different circumstances but today Vardy and Kane are at the same level as Aguero."
