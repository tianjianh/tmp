Fellow midfielder Danny Drinkwater, who was left out of Roy Hodgson's 23-man squad on Tuesday, is the eighth highest-rated Englishman.
Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo tops the Uefa 'barometer', with Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic second.
The list is based on form for club and country from 1 January, 2016, including Euro 2016 qualifying.
"The barometer runs official player statistics through a specially designed algorithm to create rankings based on player performances," said Uefa.
Players are classed as goalkeepers, full-backs, central defenders, defensive midfielders, central midfielders, attacking midfielders, wingers and forwards.
Striker Marcus Rashford, 18, is 93rd on the list, four places above Manchester United team-mate and England captain Wayne Rooney.
Uefa added: "The data considered for each player is specific to the position type.
"For example, tackles and interceptions are considered to be key statistics for defensive midfielders, while successful dribbles and crosses are core stats for wingers."
Euro 2016 in France starts on 10 June.
