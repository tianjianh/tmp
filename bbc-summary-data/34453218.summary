Cinema reopening could threaten Port Talbot's theatre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The future of a town centre theatre could be thrown into doubt if a nearby derelict cinema building is brought back to life, it has been warned.

Port Talbot's Plaza cinema, where Richard Burton and Sir Anthony Hopkins used to visit, has been earmarked to reopen as a form of arts centre.
But Neath Port Talbot council chief executive Steve Phillips said it would not be sustainable to run the Plaza and Princess Royal Theatre.
No decisions have yet been made.
"We do want to bring the Plaza cinema back into productive use," Mr Phillips said.
"Not least because it is opposite Port Talbot Parkway train station which is being refurbished, but we've got big plans for the regeneration of Station Road which it is at the end of."
The Plaza shut in 1999 and there has been a long-term intention to reopen it, while the theatre building, which is part of the town's civic centre, is in need of repair.
Mr Phillips said the council had to look at how it subsidises arts and culture facilities as it faced budget cuts.
Housing a theatre in part of the revamped cinema building has not been ruled out.
He also accepted the possibility that community groups or not-for-profit organisations could take over the theatre but pointed out that in many cases, such groups need subsidies.
Mr Phillips added: "Councillors across Wales face difficult decisions on the future of heavily subsidised arts and cultural facilities.
"Neath Port Talbot is no different and the budget proposals currently out for consultation include scrutiny of the funding of existing facilities in the county borough.
"Whilst councillors have taken no decisions, it is clear that the authority cannot sustain a new facility within a couple of hundred yards of an existing one.
"Options going forward will be put to elected members in due course."
