[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 133 in Somerset's overnight total of 349-5, Hildreth remained unbeaten on 220, backed by a colourful 130 by Trego, who hit three sixes.
Having declared on 565-5 at Taunton, Somerset broke through with the ball.
Lewis Gregory got two of the wickets as the visitors closed on 44-4.
Worcestershire failed to take a wicket on a second day shortened by one session, having failed to get back on after tea due to rain and bad light.
Steve Rhodes' side must now resume on Sunday against their County Championship Division One relegation rivals needing a further 372 to avoid being asked to follow on.
