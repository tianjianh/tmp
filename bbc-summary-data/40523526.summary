After two sell-out concerts at Wembley Stadium, Adele announced she was cancelling her final two shows at the London venue. "To say I'm heartbroken would be a complete understatement," she wrote in the early hours of Saturday morning.
David and Victoria Beckham celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary on 4 July, so we looked back at their time together.
Tributes were paid to film critic Barry Norman following the announcement of his death at the age of 83. Jonathan Ross, who took over the Film... programme which Norman presented for 26 years, remembered him as "a great critic and a lovely, lovely man".
Another TV favourite who left us this week was actress Carol Lee Scott, known to millions as Grotbags the witch. Her family revealed on social media she had "lost her brave fight against cancer" at the age of 74.
Tony Hadley announced he was "required to state" he was no longer a member of Spandau Ballet. The remaining members of the band later confirmed they were "moving on" without him.
Justin Bieber battled through a cold to perform before 50,000 "Beliebers" in London's Hyde Park. The 23-year-old turned up on time to perform stripped-back versions of Love Yourself and Cold Water alongside other hits.
Vogue hit headlines a number of times after more senior figures left the fashion magazine - with one writing a scathing blog saying she "hadn't read Vogue in years". And then Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss were hired.
Ed Sheeran revealed he had "come off Twitter completely" because of all the people "saying mean things". He later clarified he would still keep his account open, but only to share updates from his Instagram page.
And a Swedish comedian announced plans for a "man-free" music festival in her home country in response to rape and sexual assault claims at festivals. The move followed the announcement that the 2018 edition of Bravella, Sweden's largest musical festival, was being cancelled due to concerns about women's safety.
