The six-man British crew, steered by Ben Ainslie, won by 30 seconds to end a run of four straight defeats.
Ainslie's Land Rover BAR team now have two wins from their six races - both against Sweden.
The result means Britain stay in third place on four points, two clear of Sweden, France and Japan.
New Zealand are in second, while the United States top the standings.
"We made some big changes to the boat and we had a great race," said Ainslie, whose crew take on New Zealand and France on Wednesday.
"It's a big win for us but we need to keep looking forward."
Sweden led for the majority of their race against New Zealand but the Kiwis took advantage of a late slip-up for victory.
In Tuesday's other race on the Great Sound, the United States comfortably beat France, who were almost two minutes adrift.
