Wikileaks's Julian Assange mounts extradition appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lawyers for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange have lodged papers at the High Court for an appeal against a ruling that he should be extradited to Sweden to face sexual assault allegations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A court official confirmed that the papers were lodged, although no date has yet been set for a hearing.
Mr Assange, 39, denies three allegations of sexual assault and one of rape last August in Stockholm.
The extradition ruling was made last month at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court.
Following the extradition ruling at the south London court, Mr Assange criticised the European arrest warrant system and said he had "always known" he would have to appeal against the decision.
The ruling against the Australian came as a result of "a European arrest warrant system run amok", he claimed.
"There was no consideration during this entire process as to the merit of the allegations made against me, no consideration or examination of even the complaints made in Sweden and of course we have always known we would appeal," said Mr Assange.
It is not yet known whether a hearing will take place at the High Court before the Easter break.
