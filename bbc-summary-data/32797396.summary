The Heritage Lottery Fund said it hopes some of the projects will inspire young people to take a greater interest in science and technology.
One of the biggest awards - worth £12.1m - is for Jodrell Bank in Cheshire, home to the Lovell Telescope.
Physicist and TV presenter Brian Cox welcomed the support for it.
"When I was young, visiting Jodrell Bank was one of the things that inspired me to become a scientist," he said.
"The rich scientific history of the UK is a key part of our culture and Jodrell Bank is the stand-out icon of UK science and engineering," he said.
Jodrell Bank is the only remaining site in the world that showcases the entire story of the development of radio astronomy.
The funding will create an exhibition pavilion to explain the role the site played in international scientific development.
There will also be a new volunteer and skills programme and a schools programme that will reach an additional 6,000 school visitors a year.
London's Science Museum will receive £8m for a major redevelopment of its medicine galleries, which is due to be completed in 2019.
It will showcase 3,000 objects from the world's largest medical collection and reveal personal stories of how lives have been transformed by changes to medicine and health over the last 500 years.
Derby Silk Mill, formerly known as Derby Industrial Museum, will receive £9.4m.
The money will be used to restore the museum, which is housed in what was the world's first fully mechanised factory.
The Great Central Railway, which runs through Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, is being given £10m to create a new heritage railway museum in Leicester.
Some exhibits will come from the National Railway Museum in York, which has been part of the project.
The British Library will receive £9.6m for its project to digitise the nation's "rare, unique and most vulnerable" sound recordings and open them up online for people to hear.
It will ensure the survival of more than half a million recordings, ranging from interviews with Kindertransport child refugees from Nazi Germany to extinct birdsong, accents and dialects from around Britain.
Dorset County Museum is being given £10.4m to help fund a planned expansion which was revealed last July.
The collection spans 170 years of Dorset's natural, geological and social history, with many of the items coming from the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.
Lincoln Cathedral, which is the only cathedral on Historic England's buildings at risk register, is being given £12.4m to pay for urgent repairs.
The funding will also pay for the creation of a new interpretation centre and a programme of activities to double school numbers and widen the range of visitors to the cathedral.
The Burrell Collection, which houses more than 8,000 objects gifted to Glasgow by Sir William Burrell in 1944, is being given £15m.
The money will be used for a major refurbishment project which will increase the number of objects on display from 20% of the collection to 90%.
The Geffrye Museum in London, which specialises in the history of the English domestic interior, is being given £11m.
The funding will allow the development of a new entrance from Hoxton station, accessible spaces for the collections, library and archive, new learning facilities and a new cafe.
