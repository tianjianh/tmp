Officers had been searching for the 36-year-old, from Petworth in West Sussex, since 22:00 BST on Thursday.
Ms Weeks, who plays Samantha Stewart in ITV drama Foyle's War, had last been seen 14 miles away in Chichester.
Sussex police said she had been "found safe and well, and is with police". Her actress sister Perdita Weeks had earlier tweeted: "Safe and sound thank you all xxxx".
Officers had said they were concerned for Honeysuckle Weeks' welfare and it was unlike her not to get in touch. She had recently told family and friends she was feeling anxious.
Her agency, the Artists Partnership, said it had been "unable to get hold of Honeysuckle".
Earlier this year the Cardiff-born star was reportedly ordered to wear an electronic tag after she was caught speeding on the A3 in south-west London in August 2015.
A child in the back seat had not been wearing a proper seat belt and it emerged Ms Weeks had already been banned from driving.
Ms Weeks recently finished work on shooting Lewis for ITV and a Sky mystery The Five.
She has also appeared in The Bill, The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Death In Paradise.
