The assault took place at Balloch on Sunday night but the 16-year-old did not report it until Thursday.
Police Scotland said the teenager and a friend had met the man earlier on Sunday evening and they lit a camp fire on the riverbank.
When they were leaving at about 23:00, the man grabbed her and sexually assaulted her, police said.
The suspect is described as white, 5ft 7ins, of slim build with a small head/face, freshly shaven with black hair.
He was wearing cycling clothes - a black short sleeved top with silver logo, grey long sleeved base layer, black Lycra cycling shorts, black Sondico socks and grey Nike Air Max trainers.
He had a on a black rucksack and was riding a red mountain bike with either "Firefox" or "Fox" on the frame.
Det Insp Grant Macleod, who is leading the investigation, said: "The girl has been out with her friend earlier in the evening, when around 20:00 hours they met the man who at that time was wearing a black jacket and a Celtic 'bumble bee' style football top.
"They stayed in each other's company and headed to a small beach on the banks of the River Leven not too far from the Duncan Mills slipway where they lit a small camp fire.
"On leaving around 23:00 hours, the girl's friend went on ahead and as the 16-year-old and the man, who said he was 26-years-old but looked younger, walked a bit behind, he grabbed her and seriously sexually assaulted her.
"He then made off on his bike and the girl managed to get herself home."
Officers are checking CCTV in the area and are appealing to anyone who may have seen the man on the bike, cycling around the Balloch Bridge or Balloch Train Station and cycle path area earlier in the evening, to contact them.
At that time he would have had on the black jacket and football top.
After the attack he just had the cycling gear on, riding his red bike and was carrying a rucksack.
Det Insp Macleod added: "Obviously this was a shocking attack on the young girl who thankfully, even although it was a few days afterwards, had the courage to report the incident to police.
"The area down to the boatyard is quite a popular wee spot.  It's a footpath along the banks of River Leven up towards Loch Lomond and is well used by dog walkers, cyclists and local residents.
"I am sure at that someone will have seen the girls and the man either when they were at the beach or when they left.
"We are keen to hear from anyone who recognises the description of the man or who may have seen him earlier that night wearing the football top."
