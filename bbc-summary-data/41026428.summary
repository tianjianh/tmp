Hill was Wales' vice-captain on their summer tour victory against Tonga in June before being chosen as a replacement for the British and Irish Lions' trip to New Zealand.
The 25-year-old did not play for the Lions, but will succeed back-rower Lewis Evans as Dragons skipper.
"He [Hill] is the outstanding leader in the group," Dragons head coach Bernard Jackman told BBC Wales Sport.
"He has a similar mindset to me - he is honest, wants to get better quickly and is willing to put the hard work in.
"His experiences with high performance teams like Wales and the Lions have just reinforced the habits he has naturally.
"He is just no-nonsense and if you look at Valleys rugby it has always been based around that.
"The abrasiveness style of play and character and we have gone away from that. We need to get that back."
Hill won his first international cap against Australia in November 2016.
"It was a really proud moment when Bernard (Jackman) asked me to take over the captaincy," said Hill.
"I thought that Lewis (Evans) did a fantastic job, despite the difficult season that we had previously and having spoken to him I know that he is backing me, and with his experience he will be great to have around.
"I am looking forward to working with Bernard and the rest of the coaching team and I can't wait for the new season to begin."
