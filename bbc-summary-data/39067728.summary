Six Nations 2017: England 36-15 Italy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England were given a huge scare by Italy before five second-half tries saw them extend their winning run to 17 matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Italy had led 10-5 at half-time, a combination of an extraordinary tactic at the breakdown and the hosts' ineptitude threatening a huge upset.
But two quick tries after the break from Danny Care and Elliot Daly calmed nerves, and although Michele Campagnaro's bullocking try made it 17-15 with 20 minutes remaining, another from Ben Te'o and two from replacement Jack Nowell saved England's blushes.
Those tries meant Eddie Jones' men also picked up their bonus point, which may prove critical in the final championship standings.
But this 10th successive Six Nations win felt anything but a celebration, Owen Farrell off form on the occasion of his 50th cap and Jones' replacements once again required to come to their coach's rescue.
Italy left points aplenty out on the field through missed kicks, and while a second consecutive Grand Slam remains a possibility for England, the visit of in-form Scotland in a fortnight's time now represents a serious threat.
England had been completely thrown by Italy's novel tactic of not committing any men to the breakdown beyond the initial tackler, meaning no ruck was formed and so the offside became irrelevant.
It meant Italian defenders could stand between England's half-backs, creating initial confusion both in white-shirted ranks and in the stands.
Captain Dylan Hartley and James Haskell were both left asking referee Romain Poite to explain the laws of the game to them, the Frenchman testily telling them to ask their own coach.
And only when England began to solve that problem by putting runners up the middle did they begin to get any sort of grip on a contest they had been expected to run away with.
By the end, Jones's men were also utilising the same ploy, a strange sight on the strangest of afternoons at Twickenham.
England were not so much slow out of the blocks as asleep, repeatedly giving away penalties at the scrum and breakdown, while Farrell, Care and Ford all kicked poorly from hand.
Had Italy kicked all their penalties - Allan missed two, and the others were sent into the corner - they could have led 12-0 after the opening quarter.
Cole's try from a rolling maul came as a relief to a somnolent crowd, but Italy continued to dominate possession and territory, even as they spurned further shots at the posts and failed to capitalise from their attacking line-outs.
But when Allan's penalty from bang in front on the stroke of half-time came back off the upright, wing Giovanbattista Venditti grabbed the loose ball and dived over, Allan's conversion making it 10-5.
Jones had every reason to tear into his men at the interval, and within moments Care's quick tap penalty sent him slicing through the blue wall and into the corner.
Daly then ran on to Te'o's well-timed pass to go over in the left-hand corner, and the danger seemed over.
Yet with England spluttering again, Campagnaro ran through Ford and Mike Brown down the right to bring it back to 17-15.
A brilliant clearing kick by Carlo Canna denied Daly another, but from the subsequent line-out a driving maul sucked in the Italian defence and Nowell exploited vast open spaces on the right to dive into the corner.
Nowell then added another, punching through a weary defence, and relief mixed with the roars from the packed stands.
More to follow.
