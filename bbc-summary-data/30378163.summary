Duke of Edinburgh collects Balmoral wildlife award

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duke of Edinburgh has collected an award on behalf of Balmoral Estate for its wildlife practice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wildlife Estates Scotland (WES) accreditation is given to farms and estates that demonstrate a standard of excellence in land management.
To receive the award, estates have to encourage wildlife conservation and biodiversity through careful species and habitat management.
Over 20 farms and estates have achieved accreditation in Scotland.
Red deer stalking, grouse shooting and salmon fishing are all managed at Balmoral.
Richard Gledson, Balmoral's resident factor, said the royal family were "thrilled" by the award.
He added: "We are delighted that the estate has been awarded WES accreditation.
"It marks the culmination of a long process to ensure Balmoral meets the high standards of the scheme."
