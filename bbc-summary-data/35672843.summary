Hibernian have paid an undisclosed fee to sign teenage full-back Sean Mackie from Raith Rovers.

The 17-year-old has agreed a four-and-a-half year deal at Easter Road.
"When an opportunity like this comes along it is wise to take it," said Mackie, who has featured once as a late substitute for Rovers this season.
"Hibernian have a good reputation for bringing through young players and it is a good environment for me to continue my development."
Mackie signed a two-year contract at Stark's Park in the summer and the Fife club say they have received a "very fair, initial transfer fee" which will rise based on the player's progress.
Rovers have also negotiated a sell-on clause with their Championship rivals.
