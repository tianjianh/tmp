Stuart Howatson used his fake position to agree to buy high-value security systems and get hotel accommodation.
Howatson, of Warwickshire, was jailed in 2010 for claiming to be a protection officer to the Queen, has admitted 12 counts of fraud and theft.
He is in a "troubled and anxious" state, Warwick Crown Court heard.
More on this story and others from Warwickshire.
Howatson, 37, of Fisher Road, Bishops Itchington, claimed he was the chief operations officer of the Mercedes F1 team to agree to buy security systems worth $1.1m, Â£224,000 and 23,904 Euros, the court heard.
He also got food and accommodation worth almost Â£2,800 at hotels in Kidderminster, Worcestershire and Leamington Spa, between January and September 2014, prosecutors said.
Judge Alan Parker was told Howatson was admitted to hospital after being bailed by the court on Thursday because there was insufficient time to deal with his case.
His sentencing is now due to take place next Friday.
Howatson, then living in Bewdley, Worcestershire, was jailed in 2010 for 20 months, after claiming he was a member of the Metropolitan Police and had served as an armed officer, dog handler and protection officer to the Queen. He had even misled his wife about his job.
Sentencing him over those offences, the judge at Hereford Crown Court described him as "a common trickster and conman".
