[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Hedges tapped in for the only goal of the game on 36 minutes to leave the Chairboys still in search of their first league victory on the road this season.
Yeovil came close early on when Nathan Smith drilled a low shot from the edge of the area and drew a good save out of Jamal Blackman, before Garry Thompson spurned a good chance by shooting wide when put through on goal.
The hosts were looking the more dangerous of the two sides and got their reward when Alex Lawless' fierce 25-yard drive cannoned into the post and rebounded to Hedges, who was left with an easy finish.
Yeovil nearly doubled their lead before the break after Otis Khan found space to shoot from a narrow angle in the area, but Blackman was equal to his effort.
Wycombe began to grow into the game as the second half wore on but were unable to threaten until Nick Freeman blasted an injury-time shot into the side netting as Yeovil held on for a deserved win.
