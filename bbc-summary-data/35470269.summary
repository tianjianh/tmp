Driver gets lift to hospital after crash in Skye

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry came off the A87 in the Isle of Skye after an accident and tipped down a hillside.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The driver managed to get out of the lorry's cab but instead of phoning emergency services he got a lift to hospital in Broadford.
The accident happened at Druim nan CleÃ²c, near Sconser, about 10 miles (16km) north of Broadford.
Police were alerted to the incident at about 08:30 but it was thought to have happened about an hour before that.
The driver was not thought to be seriously injured.
It was not known at this stage if bad weather, which has included gale-force winds and heavy rain, was the cause of the accident.
