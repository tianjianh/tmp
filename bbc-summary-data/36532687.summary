Royal Navy pilot Lt Nick Grimmer heard the kitten meowing a day after travelling from Birmingham to the Royal Naval Air Station in Culdrose.
He dismantled the car with colleagues and found the kitten hiding inside the bumper of his BMW.
The kitten has been named Tigger by the pilot's colleagues in the 814 Naval Air Squadron, known as the Flying Tigers.
Lt Grimmer, 32, said: "The place he has felt most comfortable is in my flying helmet, which is the only place he is able to sleep."
The pilot picked up his car at Birmingham Airport on Monday and drove to the air base via Bristol and Bath.
He thought it most likely the kitten had climbed inside the car while it was parked for several days at Birmingham Airport.
He said the kitten was unharmed by the journey and he and colleagues are now trying to find his owners.
