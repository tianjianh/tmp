The Hunter Foundation is donating a table of 10 to a secondary school.
To enter, pupils must write an essay on how they would change Scotland.
In return, they could win a table at the former president's lecture at Edinburgh International Conference Centre on 26 May.
In the invitation, businessman Sir Tom said: "If you ruled the world...Oh okay then, Scotland... what would you change? All you have to do is write an essay that summarises what your school would do if you ran Scotland.
"What would you change, why would you change it and how?
"Think you could run the country? Tell us how you'd do it and your school could win a table at a dinner with Barack Obama."
The 44th president of the United States will address philanthropy and business leaders at the dinner.
"This is your school's chance to be there at the event," Sir Tom said.
One table of 10 is being offered to the winning pupil, who must also say how they would select the nine others on their table.
At least one member of the winning group must be a teacher or adult and permission must be given from pupils' schools to enter.
The essays should be a maximum of two pages with pupils being encouraged to be as creative as they like.
The prize is only for President Obama's lecture and does not include post-lecture entertainment. Oscar-winning musician Annie Lennox, comedian Kevin Bridges and Glasgow band Texas are to perform at the event.
The competition has been set-up by the Hunter Foundation, in partnership with Skills Development Scotland and Founders4Schools.
Danny Logue, director of operations at Skills Development Scotland, said: "SDS careers advisers across Scotland work with pupils to support them to make the most of their strengths, potential and future career ambitions.
"This is a great opportunity for schools and for young people to show their creativity and innovation."
