Part of Brighton's West Pier collapses after storm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of Brighton's ruined West Pier has collapsed in the aftermath of Storm Imogen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pier, which is not maintained and was shut in 1975 after being deemed unsafe, burnt down in 2003.
In storms in February 2014 a major part of the derelict Grade I listed pier collapsed, splitting the former pavilion into two sections.
The West Pier Trust said a small section collapsed earlier after high winds hit the south coast on Monday.
The trust has said more collapses could follow.
Part of the derelict Grade I listed pier's eastern side crumbled into the sea in January 2013, following cold weather conditions.
