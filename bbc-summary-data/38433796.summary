[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 3-0 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nelson Oliveira's superb hat-trick emphatically ended Derby's 10-match unbeaten Championship run and relieved the pressure on Norwich boss Alex Neil.

Oliveira struck a fine first-half opener into the bottom corner.
City wasted numerous chances before the Portuguese striker headed number two in the second half, soon after the Rams had Jacob Butterfield sent off for a lunge on Wes Hoolahan.
Oliveira then struck a third to seal City's third win in 13 league games.
The visitors started well enough, with Matej Vydra sending a free-kick just wide.
But the Canaries dominated from the moment Oliveira surged through to hit the first goal on 14 minutes after Derby's Bradley Johnson was guilty of a sloppy pass against his former club.
Alexander Tettey hit the post with a 20-yard shot and Steven Naismith wasted three great chances to extend the lead, notably when he blazed a shot over from six yards - and Rams keeper Scott Carson made several fine saves.
With Hoolahan dictating play in midfield, opportunities continued to come for the home side, and they ensured a precious win which takes them up to ninth place after Butterfield's dismissal.
A deserved second arrived when former Nottingham Forest frontman Oliveira was left unmarked to head in, and he grabbed his 11th goal of the season two minutes later.
The Rams remain seventh, but would have climbed into the play-off spots with a victory.
Norwich City manager Alex Neil:
"It was an excellent performance, but it was in keeping with his general play for us in recent games.
"He (Oliveira) took time to settle after we brought him in, but he has been doing really well for the team since he got a run in the side.
"They were three really well-taken goals. And he could have scored four or five more, he really could.
"It's not a surprise to me. I knew what a good player I was getting when I bought him from Benfica. He has played 25-odd games for Portugal alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and people like that, so everyone here knows what he is capable of."
Derby county manager Steve McClaren:
"I think the referee got it wrong and we will be looking at an appeal. Butterfield's feet were not off the ground and he got a little bit of the ball. He also caught the player as well and because of that he falls down.
"I think the reaction of the player (Wes Hoolahan) and the crowd, which I can understand, played a part in it.
"That was a big turning point, for me it was all about the sending off. We were up against a very good Norwich side, who have got one of the best squads in this division, and it was always going to be very difficult for us when we went down to 10.
"It was a disappointing afternoon for us, but we were unbeaten in 10 and that run was always going to come to an end at some stage.
"What we have got to do now is dust ourselves down and go another run like that. We have got some big games coming up, West Brom in the FA Cup and Leeds in the league and we have got to make sure we are ready for those."
