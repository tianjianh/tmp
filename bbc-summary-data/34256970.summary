First Minister Carwyn Jones has told AMs that "in principle" he supports a quota system for each nation of the UK to resettle refugees.

During First Minister Questions, Mr Jones called David Cameron's response to the situation "laggardly".
The comments followed opposition party calls for a full refugee crisis debate.
Earlier, Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said migrants needed a "substantial package of integration" rather than "tokenism".
Deputy Plaid leader Elin Jones said the party was "disappointed and surprised" at the lack of a Welsh government response to an urgent question on the crisis.
Assembly members gathered in the Senedd chamber on Tuesday for the first time after the summer recess.
Although no statement was scheduled on the refugee crisis, several AMs raised the issue during First Minister's Questions.
Answering a question from Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, Mr Jones said: "In principle I support the idea of a quota system for each nation."
On the UK government's handing of the refugee crisis, he added: "I regret that fact that the prime minister was laggardly in in his response.
"You cannot bury your head in the sand when people are risking their lives on unseaworthy craft in order to cross to a place that they see as a place of safety."
Mr Jones has called a summit on the crisis for Thursday.
Charities and local councils have been invited to send representatives to the meeting, aimed at co-ordinating the Welsh response.
Responding to opposition criticism of the fact that the first minister was not making a statement in the assembly on the issue, a Welsh government spokeswoman said Mr Jones had "been clear that Wales stands ready to play our part and that the Welsh government has an important role in responding to the refugee crisis".
The spokeswoman said Thursday's summit was "bringing together key agencies and service providers to develop a co-ordinated Wales-wide response to the crisis" as "the start of a government-led action, which will continue throughout the autumn".
David Cameron has said the UK would accept up to 20,000 refugees from camps surrounding Syria, with priority given to vulnerable children.
The Welsh Refugee Council has said Wales could give sanctuary to around 1,600 Syrians, but local councils have said they will need help to meet the cost.
