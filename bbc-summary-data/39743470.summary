Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers hopes to find a compromise with England Under-20 bosses to ensure Patrick Roberts can play in the Scottish Cup final.

The Under-20 World Cup finals, where the winger could be part of England's squad, clashes with Celtic's 27 May match against Aberdeen at Hampden Park.
"England will announce their squad in May and I am sure there will be a discussion," said Rodgers.
"We want him to be here, so we will see how that goes over the coming weeks."
Roberts is near the end of an 18-month loan spell at Celtic Park from Manchester City and has made 41 appearances this season, scoring seven goals.
World governing body Fifa states that England do not have the final say over the 20-year-old's participation in the tournament that starts in South Korea on 20 May.
Celtic are looking to complete a domestic treble having already won the Scottish Premiership and League Cup.
And Rodgers seems likely to be without star striker Moussa Dembele after the Frenchman picked up a hamstring injury in Sunday's semi-final win over Rangers.
"Pat knows there is a World Cup opportunity there for him," said the Celtic manager. "He has worked hard to be there.
"He is here on loan, but we respect the people at England, I know them well and we will have a conversation about it and hopefully it will fulfil the needs of both parties."
Roberts had already expressed his desire to end his spell with Celtic with a win in the cup final.
"It is unfair to put the boy in that situation really. He has played a big part in what we have been doing," added Rodgers.
"We will come together and hopefully he will be here.
"I am sure between Manchester City, England and ourselves we will come up with the best solution and that is ultimately what it is about, the best interests of Pat."
