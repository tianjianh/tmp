[SN]TITLE[SN]
Health service patient satisfaction continues to rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Patient satisfaction with Scotland's health service continues to rise according to this year's inpatient experience survey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Quality of Healthcare Experience National Indicator has risen to 82.8, the highest it has been since the survey began in 2010.
This represents a rise of 1.1 from the previous survey in 2014.
The 2016 survey, published today, found that 90% of patients rated their care as good or excellent.
Good or excellent care in A&E has also increased to 88% and the number of people who thought their ward was clean has increased from 95% to 96% since the last survey in 2014.
Overall satisfaction with the hospital environment increased from 88% to 89% since the last survey, and overall satisfaction with hospital staff has remained at 91%.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "It is encouraging to see that satisfaction in Scotland's hospitals continues to rise against a backdrop of increasing patient numbers. It's especially pleasing to see even more people rating their overall care as good or excellent, including in areas like accident and emergency.
"We are determined to continue to push up standards.
"This is why we are providing financial support to all health and social care partnerships in the form of Â£90 million over three years, specifically to reduce delays in patients leaving hospital, plus an additional Â£250 million for investment in social care in 2016/17."
