[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry ring road bridge fitted with last beams

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The last two large steel beams have been winched into place to support a new Â£13m bridge across Coventry's ring road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge, at junction 6 of the ring road, is intended to make the city centre more accessible for pedestrians walking from the railway station.
Sixteen beams have been put in place to form the bridge, which should be completed by April next year.
A 40-year-old bridge at the junction was demolished in March.
The huge new bridge is so large that it has effectively created a tunnel where part of the ring road goes, BBC Midlands Today's transport correspondent Peter Plisner said.
The last two beams were winched into place on Monday evening, when the ring road in the area was closed to traffic.
