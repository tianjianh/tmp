Britain's Andy Murray continued his fine form in China as he beat David Goffin in straight sets to reach the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters.

The second seed maintained his 100% record against the Belgian with a 6-2 6-2 win in one hour 35 minutes.
The Scot will play Frenchman Gilles Simon, a 4-6 6-4 7-6 (7/5) winner over American Jack Sock, next.
"It was a tough match. I struck the ball really well and created a lot of chances on my return game," he said.
The 29-year-old Wimbledon champion squandered six break points in the second game of the second set, a battle that lasted over 15 minutes, and with the score at 2-2 had to save two break points on his own serve.
But Goffin failed to convert any of his opportunities in that crucial period and Murray went on to break his opponent in the fifth game.
World number one Novak Djokovic suffered a major scare against world number 110 Mischa Zverev before fighting back to reach the semi-finals.
The top seed came back from a set and a break down to win 3-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 in two hours 20 minutes, setting up a last-four tie against Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut.
Djokovic, 29, made a number of uncharacteristic errors against Germany's Zverev - including two double faults and 14 unforced errors in a nervy 62-minute second set - but was far more comfortable in the decider, breaking early as the qualifier ran out of steam.
The Serb said he hummed a tune while waiting to return Zverev's serve in the latter stages of the match.
"You're trying to reach that balance between being concentrated but at the same time being kind of calm and relaxed and enjoying the moment," he said.
"I was always trying to keep that optimal state of mind. Instead of the occasional tantrum that I used to have, I (switched) that vibration and transformed it in a tune."
