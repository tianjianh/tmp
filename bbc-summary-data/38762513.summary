Rhondda Cynon Taf council spent £80,000 on new shelters and raised kerbs for people to get on and off buses easily in Tonypandy.
But nothing was done on the Mitchell Court side of the station to help those with mobility issues.
The council is to to add drop kerbs.
Buses stop at the station to carry people to places such as Cardiff, Porth, Bridgend, Aberdare and Porth.
Resident Wendy Allsop said: "They've refurbished and said we've got these nice raised kerbs here but unfortunately they haven't thought outside the box and how do they get disabled people at the bus station in the first place.
"I know people have been affected because they have problems and issues with their mobility so therefore they can't use this bus station because they can't alight on to the pavement even if they park in the local car park."
Tonypandy councillor Craig Middle said he was taking the issue up with the council.
He said: "We are also looking at the shelters because sometimes the rain and wind comes and it is exposed."
An Rhondda Cynon Taf council spokeswoman, said funding is in place to  ensure step-free access:
She added: "Following the recent announcement that £180,000 has been awarded to the council from the Welsh Government to undertake further bus corridor works throughout the Rhondda Fawr area, the council can now confirm that dropped kerbs will shortly be installed at Tonypandy bus station to further enhance disabled access."
