Judge George O'Toole granted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers' request for more time but refused their pleas to move the trial from Boston to Washington.
Mr Tsarnaev, 21, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges and could face the death penalty if convicted.
Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured by two explosions near the finish line in April 2013.
The defence team had asked for the trial to be delayed until at least September 2015, saying a November trial would not have given them enough time to prepare.
They also asked that the trial be moved due to the media coverage in Boston and the local public mood.
But the judge said there was no reason to assume in advance that a fair jury could not be selected in Massachusetts.
Tsarnaev is accused - along with his older brother Tamerlan - of placing two pressure cooker bombs near the marathon's finish line.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died in an exchange of fire with police officers several days later.
