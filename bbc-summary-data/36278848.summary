[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Glasgow School of Art campus for Forres

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow School of Art (GSA) is to establish a new campus which will allow staff and students to do their work and research in the Highlands and Islands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Creative Campus, Highlands and Islands will be created at Blair Steading on the Altyre Estate near Forres in Moray.
The campus is being developed by the school of art in partnership with Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE).
GSA already has a base in Forres, but the campus will be on a larger scale.
Researchers, staff and students from the GSA's Institute of Design Innovation (InDI) at the base will move to Altyre later this year.
GSA director Prof Tom Inns said: "The development of our presence in Forres, and more broadly in the Highlands and Islands, is integral to helping us achieve our aspiration to be a global leader in studio-based learning and research, building on our position as a Global Top 20 art school.
"It will also support collaboration across the disciplines within the GSA as well as with other academic, third-sector and industry partners."
