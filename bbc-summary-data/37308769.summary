Jason Dockrill is serving a life sentence for raping and killing 23-year-old Suvi Aronen near Wanstead Common, east London, in March 2003.
In May, the 46 year old admitted rape and two counts of indecent assault against another woman in November 2001.
He was sentenced to nine years for rape and five years for each assault.
Prosecutor Anita Arora said the victim, who was in her 30s, was grabbed by Dockrill outside a club near Tower Bridge.
The unemployed fitter, who has a personality disorder, led the woman to a secluded area near bins where he raped and repeatedly sexually assaulted her.
The court heard that during the attack, Dockrill repeatedly told his victim "I know you want it" and threatened he "could do some serious damage" if she screamed.
When she broke free he warned he would "come and find where you live" and "kill you and your husband".
In sentencing, Judge Rebecca Poulet said it was "a terrifying experience" for the woman which "had a very severe and long-term impact on her".
Dockrill, who will become eligible to be considered for parole in 2028, was charged with the rape after his DNA was matched with evidence given at the time.
On 20 March 2003, Dockrill randomly assaulted three women in the Wanstead Common area, one of his victims was 80 years old.
That same day, Ms Aronen was on the phone to her mother when she was grabbed in an underpass as she walked home. The phone line stayed lived as Dockrill subjected the student to what the judge described as an "appalling and depraved" attack.
The judge said her remarks and details of the 2001 case should be put before the parole board for any application in the future for his release.
The sentences will all run concurrently with his life sentence.
