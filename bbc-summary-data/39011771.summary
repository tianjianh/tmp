Preston North End 2-1 Queens Park Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Preston North End edged closer to the Championship play-off places as they came from behind to beat 10-man QPR.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors started the stronger and Kazenga Lua Lua had two efforts saved by Chris Maxwell before back-heeling his side ahead late in the first half.
But the lead was short-lived as Aiden McGeady's long-range strike levelled the score right before the break.
And Jordan Hugill slotted the home side ahead before QPR's Luke Freeman was sent off for a second yellow card.
The Lilywhites are now eighth in the Championship table, six points behind Sheffield Wednesday in sixth.
Preston went into the match having lost just once in their last 10 games but they were forced onto the back foot early on, with keeper Maxwell forced to deny both Pawel Wszolek and Lua Lua twice in the opening half hour.
But Lua Lua's persistence paid off when he finally beat Maxwell with a brilliant back-heel from close range.
QPR's lead lasted less than 10 minutes, however, as McGeady equalised with a long-range strike with virtually the last kick of the first half.
Preston began to assert themselves after the break and deservedly took the lead when Hugill scored with a right-footed shot from close range following a corner.
Rangers remain 16th in the table, nine points clear of the relegation places.
