Lifting the Scottish Cup with Rangers would turn a good season into a great one, according to captain Lee Wallace.

The Glasgow side go into Saturday's final against Hibernian at Hampden Park having already won the Championship title and the Petrofac Training Cup.
"If we can go on and win our version of a treble, it would make a good season into a great one," said Wallace.
"But we also know it could go from good to not so good if we don't do the business on Saturday."
It will be the first Scottish Cup final not to involve a club from the top flight.
Rangers defeated Hibs on their way to win the Petrofac Training Cup and then finished 11 points clear of the side expected to challenge them most closely for the title and promotion.
"I don't think many people would have expected us to go on and win the Scottish Cup," said left-back Wallace.
"We were expected to win the Petrofac Cup and the Championship and do it in an eye-catching way and we've been dominant on that front."
Wallace joined Rangers from Hearts in 2011 before they started their journey up the Scottish leagues following liquidation.
He now has three league winners' medals, but this is his chance for a first major trophy.
"When I came here, I thought I was coming to a place where I could win a lot of medals," admitted Wallace.
"I remember saying in my first press conference that I was joining a dressing room full of winners, top internationals and top pros.
"I felt really fortunate at that point, but who could have seen what was coming our way a few months later?
"But now finally I've got the opportunity with a unique group of players at a unique club to bring our first Rangers-type piece of silverware back to the club."
Wallace recognises that Hibs will be hurting from missing out on promotion after losing their play-off semi-final to Falkirk.
The Edinburgh club will also be motivated by the desire to end a much-publicised 114-year wait to again win the Scottish Cup.
"We're not focusing on the hoodoo or any of their statistics," Rangers' captain added.
"We just need to focus on what we do and never deviate from the mentality and mindset we've had from day one.
"We're aware of their issues, but we know, if we do what we do, prepare well and deliver our normal performance then we should be fine."
