Train delays after line fault near Glasgow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Travellers using train services to and from Glasgow Central are facing major disruption due to damaged overhead lines near Cardonald.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ayrshire coast services have been cancelled, delayed or are starting and terminating at Paisley Gilmour Street.
Commuters faced long queues for replacement bus services from Paisley into the city.
Buses were running between Glasgow Central and Paisley, and from Glasgow Central to Prestwick Airport and Ayr.
ScotRail said disruption was expected until the end of the day. It was understood the fault was not related to adverse weather conditions.
The firm said anyone with a valid train ticket or smart card could use First Glasgow Bus services in both directions between Glasgow Central and Paisley Gilmour Street, and Glasgow Central and Paisley Canal.
Tickets could also be used on McGills buses on the direct route between Inverclyde and Glasgow.
Extra McGill buses are running between Paisley and Glasgow. However, customers were advised to pay for these bus journeys and claim back on their rail ticket.
