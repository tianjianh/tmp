The Sports Minister Carál Ní Chuilín has said there is a "culture of fear" within Sport NI.

She also confirmed there had been allegations of "bullying and harassment" within the 140-strong workforce.
The minister was appearing at the DCAL committee.
Defending her decision to send in three civil servants to take charge of Sport NI, she said she was prepared to send in four more if the need arose.
She insisted the problems at Sport NI were not her fault.
The minister dismissed calls by the MLA Basil McCrea for her to stand down.
She said she did not know why nine members of the Sport NI board quit earlier this week.
Ms Ní Chuilín said: "It's a complete mystery to me."
She will also be asked at the Culture, Arts and Leisure committee about her handling of the Casement Park GAA stadium project in west Belfast.
On Wednesday, Ms Ní Chuilín announced she had decided to send three civil servants to take control of Sport NI.
The minister also decided to appoint a number of civil servants to the board of the organisation.
How the changes will impact on Sport NI
Sport NI is now being led and run by three senior servants on a day-to-day basis.
Civil servants are also being drafted onto the board. They will not be running the board.
The chair and vice-chair remain in place.
However, the three civil servants in the organisation (not the ones drafted onto the board) will be in charge.
The top man will be Arthur Scott, currently the director of culture at the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
He has been appointed the "interim CEO".
The existing CEO, Antoinette McKeown, was suspended in March.
She insists she did nothing wrong.
The move, in effect, means the arms-length body is now under hands-on control by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) after a troubled few months.
Nine of the organisation's 14 board members resigned on Monday, but they have yet to explain why they stood down.
Concerns have been raised about working practices within Sport NI, and at least 10 employees have made complaints.
