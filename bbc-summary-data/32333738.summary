[SN]TITLE[SN]
Police officer seen with gun in Inverness breached policy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer in Inverness has been photographed carrying a firearm despite assurances that sidearms would only be deployed under special circumstances.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The officer was carrying a handgun in the railway station in Inverness on Tuesday as he walked through the main concourse.
Police Scotland said the officer had breached new force policy.
A spokesman said he had been reminded of the strict criteria about the issue.
It was a sight more common in 2013 when a policy was introduced allowing firearms officers to carry handguns with them at all times while on duty.
However, after concerns from politicians, the chief constable of Police Scotland, Sir Stephen House, stated last October that specialist armed police officers in Scotland would only be deployed to firearms incidents or where there was a threat to life.
