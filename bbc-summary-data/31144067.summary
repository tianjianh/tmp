[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murder is to remain on remand in prison, a judge has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohsin Bhatti, 29, was stabbed a number of times in the attack on 29 January. His body was found on Botanic Avenue in south Belfast.
Ahmed Noor, 32, was released from secure medical accommodation on Wednesday to be charged with murder.
He was initially detained under a Mental Health Order. The judge ruled he should remain at Maghaberry prison under the care of medical staff.
Mr Noor, who has an address at Agincourt Avenue but is originally from Somalia, first appeared at Belfast Magistrates Court on Wednesday.
He was then held overnight in an observation cell at Maghaberry Prison while a psychiatrist's report was prepared.
At a further hearing on Thursday, the court was told his mental health assessment has been completed and his state had improved within 36 hours of being admitted.
The judge was told he was classed as fit to be charged and could continue to be assessed by prison staff.
A defence lawyer raised concerns based on other medical opinion, but applied to have Mr Noor kept within the same area of the prison.
"It needs to be put on the record that he was charged only, and has not been interviewed in relation to these matters," he added.
The judge said the accused, who did not appear in court, should remain at Maghaberry under the care of its medical staff.
"Should there be any deterioration, I would expect they will take whatever steps they consider appropriate to ensure his wellbeing," she added.
Mr Noor was remanded in custody to appear again by videolink on 5 March.
