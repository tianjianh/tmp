Irish banking inquiry: ECB snubs request to give evidence over crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The European Central Bank has refused a request to appear before a parliamentary probe into the Republic of Ireland's banking crisis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The inquiry, set up after the country suffered a catastrophic financial crash in 2008, had asked the ECB to give evidence on its role in the crisis.
But it has written to the inquiry to say it will not be participating.
The inquiry's chairman Ciar√°n Lynch said the ECB's decision it was "unfortunate and unsatisfactory".
The inquiry is examining the factors that contributed to the crash in an attempt to give a definitive analysis of it.
With the ECB being based outside the Irish jurisdiction it cannot be compelled to come before the banking inquiry committee.
But Mr Lynch said there was still an expectation that it would assist the inquiry in its work.
He added: "The committee made every effort to accommodate the ECB and to facilitate it in reviewing and responding to statements and evidence given at our public hearings which referenced the role and influence of the ECB."
The inquiry is expected to hold the last of its public hearings this week before going into private session to start preparing a report on the evidence it has heard.
That report, expected by the end of the year, will then be submitted to the Irish parliament.
