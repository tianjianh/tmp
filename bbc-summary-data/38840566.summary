Striker Lewis Grabban says the chance to work with Jaap Stam and help Reading push for Championship promotion prompted him to join them on loan.

Grabban, 29, joined on transfer deadline day on loan from Bournemouth until the end of the season.
"I wanted to join somewhere that was competitive in the Championship," he told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"Fans will be expecting us to win most games, so hopefully I can add to the quality and try and gain us promotion."
Grabban has had two spells at Bournemouth either side of 18 months at Norwich City, who he helped guide to promotion via the Championship play-offs in 2015.
But since his return to the Cherries in January 2016, his chances have been limited, with just six appearances in all competitions this season.
"I've been welcomed to the club by everyone and happy to be here (at Reading)," Grabban said.
"To be able to work with someone like Jaap Stam, who was so successful in his playing career, you hope to gain from that and get some of their advice."
Grabban will also reunite with former Bournemouth team-mate Yann Kermorgant and could form a strike partnership with the Frenchman.
"Hopefully Yann and I can do well like we have in the past and do well for the team," he added.
