Plans for a tourist attraction at a once-notorious stretch of winding Highland Perthshire road have been formally approved.

The Cairnwell Pass was nicknamed The Devil's Elbow due to its double hairpin bend and was tackled by the Queen and Prince Philip in an iconic photograph.
Cairngorms National Park Authority (CPNA) plans to add seating, walkways and information boards.
The A93 pass was straightened in the 1960s, but the original tracks remain.
The route forms the highest public road in Britain and is regularly used by classic car and motor bike enthusiasts.
The proposal is part of the authority's Scottish Scenic Routes Initiative, which involves the creation of a tourist trail from Blairgowrie to Grantown-on-Spey.
Designers Daniel Smith and Philip Zoechbauer won a competition to create the Glenshee viewpoint.
CPNA planning committee convener Eleanor Mackintosh said: "This road is as famous as the amount of snow it gets, as it has stunning landscapes.
"We hope by promoting it through the Scenic Routes Initiative, creating attractive and interesting stop-off points, we can encourage more visitors to this area of the Cairngorms National Park."
