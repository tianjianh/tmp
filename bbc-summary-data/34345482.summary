The 22-year-old felt discomfort in the fifth one-day international against England in September and scans have revealed the early stages of an injury.
No date has been scheduled for his return, but he hopes to be fit for the World T20 in India in March.
All-rounder James Faulkner, 25, replaces Cummins in the tour party.
The first Test in Chittagong starts on 9 October.
"This is really unfortunate for Pat and I know how disappointed he will be," said chairman of selectors Rod Marsh.
"He is a young bowler with a bright future and we were really pleased with how he bowled in the UK."
Cummins played his solitary Test in 2011 but impressed in the ODIs against England, bowling at speeds of up to 96mph and taking 12 wickets in five games.
His career has been badly disrupted by injury and he was sidelined by a back injury between 2012 and 2014.
Dominic Thornely, a member of Cummins's management team, told the Sydney Morning Herald: "He was disappointed but said, 'It's part of the game. I bowl 150km per hour; it's going to happen.'
"As I said to him, I saw Brett Lee in a full-blown body cast when he was only 18 and he ended up taking 310 wickets and he was rattled by injuries. I told Pat, 'You're only young. Brett retired when he was 38.'"
Australia squad: Steven Smith (capt), Adam Voges (vice-capt), Cameron Bancroft, Joe Burns, James Faulkner, Andrew Fekete, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Peter Nevill (wk), Stephen O'Keefe, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Starc.
