The Olympic gymnast crashed into a barrier after successfully completing her jump.
After just two weeks, several stars have already ended up in hospital after competing on the Channel 4 show.
Some fans have even taken to social media to ask for the show to be cancelled because they say too many people are getting hurt.
A Channel 4 spokesperson told Newsround:
"The Jump is now in its third series and since launch 46 celebrities have taken part successfully. Though it is a new course the events have been designed to be no more difficult than in previous years and all contributors have undertaken a rigorous training programme to prepare them for the show.  All winter sports carry some element of risk but  in light of the number of injuries this year,  Channel 4 has asked the producers to review safety procedures again to further reduce the prospect of accident."
