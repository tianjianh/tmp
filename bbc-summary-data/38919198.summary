Six Nations 2017: George North - I'll be fit to face Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales wing George North says he will be fit to face Scotland in round three of the Six Nations after being "gutted" to miss out their defeat by England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Cuthbert's return for North was confirmed an hour before kick-off. North had a dead leg suffered in Wales' win against Italy six days earlier.
"A six-day turnaround with a pretty decent dead leg was always going to be tough," said North.
"Two weeks time, Scotland in mind. I'll be fit to go again."
North had been named on the team sheet handed out to the media before kick-off, but told the Welsh Rugby Union's television service he had been ruled out on the morning of the game.
However, Dan Biggar was passed fit to start the match after picking up a rib injury in Rome.
North's replacement Cuthbert trained on Friday.
Props Rob Evans and Tomas Francis were the other two changes from the 33-7 win over Italy in Rome.
Bath number eight Taulupe Faletau, who had not played since Christmas Eve, was on Wales' bench for Wales, taking the place of Ospreys forward James King.
It meant a vote of confidence for the starting back-row of Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric and Ross Moriarty.
The roof at the Principality Stadium was open for the match at the request of England coach Eddie Jones, who said he was ready for Welsh 'shenanigans' after he named his team to face Wales.
Howley wanted the roof closed on the other hand and said he thought that would be the case on Thursday lunchtime, before England confirmed it would remain open.
Both teams have to agree for the roof to be closed.
Match-day 23 for game against England:
Wales: Leigh Halfpenny (Toulon); Alex Cuthbert (Blues), Jonathan Davies (Scarlets), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Liam Williams (Scarlets); Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Webb (Ospreys); Rob Evans (Scarlets), Ken Owens (Scarlets), Tomas Francis (Exeter), Jake Ball (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys, capt), Sam Warburton (Cardiff Blues), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Ross Moriarty (Gloucester).
Replacements: Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Nicky Smith (Ospreys), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Cory Hill (Newport Gwent Dragons), Taulupe Faletau (Bath), Gareth Davies (Scarlets), Sam Davies (Ospreys), Jamie Roberts (Harlequins).
