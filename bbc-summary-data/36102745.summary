The 51-year-old, who wrote the Electra Brown series for teenagers, was last seen walking her dog near her home in Royston, Hertfordshire over a week ago.
Hertfordshire Police said they are now extending their searches for the writer to less used walking routes.
One possible sighting, reported by a truck driver on 12 April, was in the Warren Lane area of Baldock.
Two other potential sightings on 11 April in the Heathfield area of Royston have also been reported and investigated. Officers are also looking at available CCTV footage.
Ch Insp Julie Wheatley said: "We are still very much keeping an open mind around the circumstances of Helen's disappearance, bearing in mind she had stated that she needed some time to herself before she was last seen.
"However, as time goes on, the concerns for her welfare are growing and we are continuing to support her family at this extremely difficult time.
"Whilst we cannot be sure the reported sightings are of Helen, we will of course follow up any potential leads which may assist us in finding her."
She was last seen on Monday 11 April at around 14:45 BST and was thought to be walking her dog, a miniature Dachshund.
