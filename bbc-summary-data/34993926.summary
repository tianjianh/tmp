Driver fatigue probed in Reading rail signal incidents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two separate incidents of trains going through red signals near Reading could have been caused by driver fatigue, accident investigators have said.

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) is investigating DB Schenker (DBS) cargo trains passing signals at danger in March and November.
In both cases the driver applied the brakes and the trains stopped shortly after the signals.
DB Schenker is yet to comment. The RAIB said it would investigate.
It said it would look into the reporting and managing of fatigue.
The incidents happened seven miles (11km) apart and involved the same Acton Yard to Merehead Quarry freight service.
The first occurred shortly after 08:20 GMT on at Reading West Junction on 28 March. The second was on 3 November at Ruscombe, shortly after 06:20 GMT, when the train stopped 60m (200ft) past the red signal.
The RAIB said initial evidence suggested that "driver fatigue may have been a factor".
In both cases the drivers had started work around midnight and were on their return journey from Acton.
It said its investigation would take in other other recent incidents involving freight trains in which fatigue may have been a factor, including a derailing at Santon New Junction near Scunthorpe on 7 August.
