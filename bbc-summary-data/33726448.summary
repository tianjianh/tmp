[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US tycoon Donald Trump has said a second referendum on Scottish independence would be "ridiculous".

His comments came as he held an international media conference at the Turnberry golf resort in South Ayrshire, which he bought last year.
Mr Trump, who has announced his wish to be US president, said the referendum campaign in Scotland had been "turmoil and bedlam for so long".
"It was a very bad period for Scotland, it was very divisive," he said.
The businessman flew into Turnberry, which is hosting the Women's British Open, wearing a red cap with the message "make America great again".
Mr Trump said his campaign to win the Republican nomination for US president is "doing really well" and that he "expects" to become president.
Asked what relationships he would have with the UK and Scottish governments as leader of the US, he said: "I would say, if anything, it would get better. My mother was born in Scotland.
"I think we would be very close, I think I would be very close with Britain."
Mr Trump said he had only met David Cameron briefly but believes they could get on well.
The tycoon has previously clashed with the Scottish government over plans for an offshore wind farm in view of his Aberdeenshire golf course.
He said that he was pleased with the outcome of last year's independence referendum, which resulted in a No vote.
On speculation around a second referendum in the near future, Mr Trump said: "I would say that the winning team should be extremely upset if that is even thought about.
"I had heard it would be 50 years before it could happen again."
"I thought staying together would be a better thing but it's not up to me and I didn't want to make my thoughts clear on the matter because I felt it wasn't up to me, but the people made the right decision."
