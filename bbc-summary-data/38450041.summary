Stephen Mullan, his partner Miriam Ramsey and his children, Ben, 12, Leah, 10, and Rhys, 9, were caught up in the fire at Seacoast Road, Magilligan, at 16:00 GMT.
Mr Mullan said a spark from the hearth fire caught his youngest son, Rhys' clothing.
The boy suffered third degree burns.
"Rhys' arm caught fire and we tried to get it out but when I looked around, I noticed the house was on fire. I said to my oldest son, Ben, 'Get Rhys out and I'll deal with this fire'," Mr Mullan told BBC Radio Foyle.
"But it was too far gone and it just happened in seconds. The chair in the sitting room caught.
"Ben rolled Rhys on the chair and got the fire out on his arm. Miriam got Leah up the stairs into the back bedroom. Ben was very calm.  I just saw flames. It was a matter of minutes, the whole house was completely covered in smoke.
"In panic, I kept trying the front door knowing it was locked. Ben said we needed to get upstairs."
"Me and the two boys ran up the stairs, Miriam and Leah were already in the back room. I got the fire escape window opened and the whole lot of us got onto a flat roof at the back. We contacted the emergency services then."
Mr Mullan and the three children were able to clamber off the roof, while firefighters brought his partner to safety.
The family were treated for smoke inhalation at the scene. They were then taken to hospital.
"Ben was amazing. He kept so calm," Mr Mullan said.  "He stayed with Rhys the whole time... He never panicked, he just went straight, calm head, dealt with the situation brilliantly. He was unbelievable."
Rhys suffered third degree burns to his face and body. He is now out of intensive care but remains in hospital.
Three fire appliances were called to the scene of what the five service called a "severe" blaze, believed to have started in the living room of the house.
Dermot Rooney, Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, said the telephone operator was able to keep them calm.
"They were stuck for 20 minutes," he said. "Our operators are highly skilled in terms of gleaning information from distressed callers."
He said that in the case of a fire, people should ensure doors are closed and put themselves somewhere where they can be rescued easily.
He reminded the public of the Fire Service acronym STOP.
S for smoke alarm, T for testing the alarm at least once a week, O for being aware of obvious dangers like candles, cooking appliances and Christmas decorations and P for having an escape plan and ensuring everyone in the house knows it.
