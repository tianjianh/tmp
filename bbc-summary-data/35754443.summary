Sam Hain: Warwickshire youngster shows his class for Bears in Dubai

Warwickshire youngster Sam Hain has proved that he is back to full fitness ahead of what may prove a breakthrough summer for a 20-year-old earmarked as an England player of the future.

The Hong Kong-born, Australia-bred batsman missed two months of the 2015 season with a dislocated shoulder when diving to stop a ball in the outfield.
But Sunday's 85 off 57 balls in Dubai against the West Indies showed class.
"It was a mature innings. Sam batted really well," said boss Dougie Brown.
"Very measured. As measured as you can be in Twenty20. He showed what he can do, but we're not getting carried away because we already know he is a talent.
"Without the shoulder injury which affected his throwing, he would have played some form of white-ball cricket for us last season."
Fellow batsman Laurie Evans, who captained the Bears for Sunday's second of two T20 friendlies with the Windies, added: "Sam Hain batted really well against a high-quality bowling attack.
"It was the sort of pitch where it was difficult getting in and he stayed there when we lost a few wickets and gave us something to bowl at."
The Bears lost the game by three wickets at the International Stadium, on the back of Friday's 13-run defeat in the first game.
After making 823 first-class runs in 12 matches at 51.43 as a teenager in 2014, even breaking Ian Bell's record as the youngest Bears centurion, he scored 547 in 10 matches at 36.46 last summer.
Now he is fit again, England-qualified Hain will again be coming back onto the radar of James Whitaker and his fellow Test selectors. But Bears director of cricket Brown says that he is not the only youngster to have impressed in the Persian Gulf,
"Sam is just one of a lot of guys pushing for places on the evidence of the two games against West Indies," added Brown. "Ateeq Javid and Josh Poysden bowled superbly against high-class batsman coming hard at them.
"In both games our fielding was outstanding and in all departments our skill levels were exceptional at times. Games like these against international opposition can be very one-sided but that was far from the case. We pushed them close both times. In those sort of games it is about much more than the result,
"It's about players getting opportunities and there were a lot of positives in there. We have got a lot of healthy competition for places and I'm sure that will only increase because the start of the T20 season in England is still quite a way away."
Warwickshire's next assignment on their tour to the Persian Gulf is to travel to Sharjah to train ahead of a two-day meeting with Midlands rivals Worcestershire on Saturday and Sunday at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi.
