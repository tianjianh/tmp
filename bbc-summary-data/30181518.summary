[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hucknall police officer Chris Young on trial for sex charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer "abused his position" to "satisfy his own sexual desires" over nine years, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Chris Young who has been suspended from Nottinghamshire Police, faces seven counts of sexual misconduct.
James House, prosecuting, said the Hucknall-based officer targeted female witnesses in criminal investigations, some of whom were vulnerable.
The trial of Mr Young, 47, who denies the charges, is expected to last about two weeks.
Opening the trial at Derby Crown Court on Monday, Mr House told the jury that Mr Young, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, would pick out women involved in investigations, flirt and compliment them before starting sexual relationships.
The court heard Mr Young would visit the women at home and work, often in police uniform and even while on duty.
"This case is about a police officer who used his position, his status, his knowledge and access to information to his own advantage to satisfy his own sexual desires," Mr House said.
"He targeted women he came into contact with during the course of his work. Some were vulnerable, others not so vulnerable but flattered by his advances and his position as a police officer."
Mr Young had relationships with seven women who cannot be named.
The prosecution said he behaved this way for nine years to "varying degrees of success".
"Some rebuffed him. Some had some sexual relations, others had repeated sexual liaisons with him," Mr House said.
"The prosecution say he abused his position of trust as a police officer."
Mr Young faces four counts of engaging in sexual activity with four women, two of behaving in a sexually inappropriate way and one of touching a woman's breast, all while acting as a police officer.
The case continues.
