The film, which features scenes shot on Skye, stars Michael Fassbender in the lead role and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth.
The costumes include Macbeth's boots, Lady Macbeth's banquet dress and one of the three witches' garments.
Moray has connections to the real and fictional Macbeths.
Clothes-maker Johnstons of Elgin is displaying Lady Macbeth's Inverness banquet costume and Macbeth's tunic and wool blanket.
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's coronation costumes will later be added to the Johnstons display following a show in London.
Lady Macduff's banquet dress and riding outfit together with accessories are on display at Elgin Museum.
Macbeth's battle costume has been loaned to Brodie Castle near Forres as well as Lady Macbeth's dress and cloak in which she delivers the famous "Out damned spot" speech.
The Falconer Museum in Forres has one of the witches' costumes as well as the costumes of the characters Duncan, Banquo and Fleance.
The costumes and props, including daggers and jewellery, have been loaned by film distributor Studiocanal as part of a partnership agreement with VisitScotland to promote Scotland on the back of the film's release in UK cinemas on 2 October.
They will be displayed at the four venues until the start of November when all the items will move to the Moray Art Centre in Findhorn.
Scott Armstrong, of VisitScotland, said: "I've no doubt that film fans up and down the country will relish the opportunity to see costumes that not only appear in this new film but are also worn by some of its biggest stars.
"It's fantastic to see local tourism businesses capitalising on this outstanding opportunity and I hope that the film will lead to even more visitors coming to the Highlands and Moray to tread the same ground as one of Scotland's most famous kings."
Esme Saville, of Moray Speyside Tourism, said: "We are delighted to have these costumes here bringing a little of the magic of the movies to Moray and we hope that it will bring people to the towns to appreciate their history and culture."
