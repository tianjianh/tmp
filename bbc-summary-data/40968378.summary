Robert Snodgrass: West Ham winger is told he can leave the club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham have told Scotland midfielder Robert Snodgrass that he can leave the London club, either on a permanent basis or on loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hammers signed the 29-year-old from Hull City in January for Â£10.2m on a three-and-a-half year deal.
But after scoring seven goals in 20 matches for Hull, Snodgrass failed to score in 15 Premier League appearances for West Ham last season.
Sunderland boss Simon Grayson said he is interested in signing Snodgrass.
"When people like him become available you would be foolish not to consider it," said Grayson, who managed the Scot at Leeds, on Friday.
"That would be a deal dictated by finances. Can we do it? Who knows, but we might ask the question."
Former Norwich player Snodgrass has been capped 24 times.
