The 20-year-old academy product made his debut for the Hove-based side in the One-Day Cup in 2014.
He played a total of five Championship matches for the club - four of which came towards the end of last season - and also made a second One-Day Cup appearance in 2016.
Meanwhile, 19-year-old all-rounder Delray Rawlins has signed his first professional contract with Sussex.
The academy product, who has agreed a one-year deal, has recently been representing Bermuda, the country of his birth, in the ICC World Cricket League Division Four but will also travel with England's Young Lions programme this winter.
