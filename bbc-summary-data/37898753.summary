Cryne joined Barnsley's board in 2003 as part of a consortium led by ex-Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale.
Ridsdale left the Championship club in December 2004, leaving Cryne and former chairman Gordon Shepherd in control.
In August, Cryne told the Barnsley Chronicle that he would welcome takeover offers from fans' groups.
