Andy Moll, 59, was part of a three-man team exploring a dive vessel six miles south of Swanage on Sunday 24 May.
The body of the father-of-four, from North Curry, near Taunton, was recovered near the site of the wreck, on Friday night, Dorset Police said.
A large search operation covering around 10 nautical miles was carried out after he failed to surface.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency called off the six-hour search for Mr Moll at 23:00 BST on the Sunday.
Mr Moll had been a diving instructor trainer and also served nationally with the British Sub-Aqua Club.
