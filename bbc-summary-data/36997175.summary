Adam King: Swansea City midfielder joins Southend United on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Southend United have signed Swansea City midfielder Adam King on a season-long loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
King, 20, has made just one first-team appearance for the Swans since joining the Premier League club from Scottish side Hearts in January 2014.
The Scotland Under-21 international spent time on loan at Crewe last season, scoring five goals in 26 games.
King's move is subject to international clearance, ruling him out of Saturday's season opener against Gillingham.
