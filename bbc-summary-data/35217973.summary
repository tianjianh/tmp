Mitchell, 45, from the New Forest, fought back from 1-0 and 2-1 down to reach the last 16.
New Zealand's Caldwell hit nine 180s, but Mitchell's finishing was decisive.
In the women's event, England's 2015 runner-up Fallon Sherrock was knocked out by Denmark's Ann-Louise Peters in a sudden-death leg.

The 21-year-old's exit was another surprise after Anastasia Dobromyslova's first-round defeat on Saturday.
Sweden's Peter Sajwani and English two-time champion Ted Hankey won preliminary-round ties.
Hankey, the men's champion in 2000 and 2009, was making his first appearance at Lakeside in four years following an unsuccessful switch to the Professional Darts Corporation circuit and a period of ill health.
He eased past Canada's Dave Cameron 3-0, while Sajwani beat England's Sam Hewson 3-2.
