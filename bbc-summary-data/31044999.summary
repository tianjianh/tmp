Murray's fiancee, Kim Sears, was caught on camera apparently swearing, prompting comments on social media.
Asked about that incident and the tension in the entire match, Murray said: "In the heat of the moment, you can say stuff that you regret."
There appeared to be heated words from both players during the contest.
Murray put the atmosphere down to the pre-match focus on his former coach, Dani Vallverdu, who is now working with Berdych.
Addressing the media after his 6-7 (6-8) 6-0 6-3 7-5 win, the Scot, 27, said: "When there's a lot of tension surrounding something, which you created, it's completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight."
Murray also claimed Berdych found the atmosphere difficult to handle.
"Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court... there was tension there for him as well," said the former Wimbledon champion.
Sears was seen on camera apparently aiming a colourful outburst towards the Czech's team when Murray broke back in a tense first set.
That set was eventually won by Berdych in a tie-break, but Murray fought back superbly to reach his eighth Grand Slam final.

He will face Serb Novak Djokovic or Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka on Sunday. They meet in the second semi-final on Friday.
The early stages of Murray's semi-final were filled with tension.
Murray was annoyed by Berdych's complaints about the balls, while the Czech appeared to exchange words with the Scot at a changeover.
Berdych insisted there was nothing untoward.
"I said to myself: 'Well done, Tomas'," he explained. "That's it. That's what I said. I think I'm allowed to do that when I win a set."
Murray also received a time violation as he waited for the crowd to quieten at one point in the match.
Spectators took time to settle after seeing a replay on the big screen of Murray's fiancee reacting to the previous point.
"It was only in the first set there was tension, like right at the beginning of the match," added Murray.
"It wasn't like there was loads going on there. Obviously at the end of the set, when he said something, that was really the last thing in the entire match where there was any tension. It was fine after that."
Berdych had reached the last four without dropping a set, beating 14-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal along the way,.
But the 29-year-old was outplayed by Murray after the first set.
After his win, Murray took the opportunity to back his coach, Amelie Mauresmo, saying: "I'm just very happy for her that I won the match.
"I got asked all the time about my ex-coach working with Tomas and no one was interested in anything I was doing with Amelie or the way I was playing or anything.
"A lot of people were also criticising her at the end of last year, like the way I was playing was her fault, when I'd spent two weeks training with her up to the end of the year, until the training block.
"There was very little time to spend with each other. There's no reason for her to be criticised for anything."
Murray joins the likes of Andre Agassi and his former coach Ivan Lendl as a four-time Australian Open finalist.
The Scot said he was "very proud" of his achievement, given the fact he is playing in an era that also features Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer.
"To be in the final four times here, because I'm surrounded by guys like Roger, Novak and Rafa, doesn't look like much, but that doesn't happen that often," he said. "I'm very proud of that."
