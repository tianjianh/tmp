Welsh Government's five-year plan 'will mean cuts'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour will keep its election promises despite uncertainty over Brexit, but cuts to some services are inevitable, the first minister has warned.

The pledges are included in the party's five-year plan for government.
Increased free child care and more apprenticeships are promised, along with an M4 relief road and a South Wales Metro public transport network.
Plaid Cymru said the programme was "lacklustre", while the Conservatives said Labour had let Wales down.
The most expensive commitments cover 30 hours of free childcare a week over 48 weeks for parents of three and four-year-olds, and 100,000 apprenticeships open to people of all ages.
The programme covers what the Welsh Government will try to achieve, while the first indication of what will be cut will emerge when its draft budget is published in October.
The main pledges include:
A Welsh Government source said there had been a "full and frank assessment of every pound, shilling and pence that we spend" in light of the financial uncertainty surrounding Brexit.
He added: "Some tough decisions will have to be made in the first year.
"Salami slicing is not going to get the job done this time round. There will be areas and programmes that will be cut."
Responding to the claims on BBC Radio Wales, the first minister said: "There are going to be cuts... I'm not going to pretend otherwise.
"Of course, our budget is shrinking, it has been for many years and that means very difficult decisions have to be taken.
"We are going to have to look at some of the schemes we have delivered for many, many years and make a judgement."
A programme, called Taking Wales Forward, reflects many of the pledges outlined in Labour's manifesto for the Welsh Assembly election in May.
Mr Jones said Labour would see through its election promises, including building an M4 relief road and a South Wales Metro.
He said: "The UK's withdrawal from the European Union creates some uncertainty and challenges, but our mandate is clear.
"The Welsh Government's relentless focus will be on driving improvement in our economy and public services, which are together the bedrock of people's daily lives.
On local government reform, Mr Jones said many services would have to be delivered "on a wider basis" in future, but he would not say whether this meant council mergers were still on the cards.
Plaid Cymru AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said the programme for government portrayed the "gulf" between the two parties.
That was despite pledges that were part of a deal struck in return for allowing Carwyn Jones to be re-elected as first minister back in May.
"It should come as no surprise that a lacklustre manifesto has led to a lacklustre programme for government," said Mr ap Iorwerth.
"Yes, it's good to see the elements that Plaid Cymru drove through in our post-election one-off agreement, including a pledge to create 100,000 new apprenticeships and a new drugs and treatments fund, but Labour's lack of innovative ideas shines through again."
As the official opposition in the assembly, Plaid said it would be "challenging Labour to do better".
The Conservatives said it was "difficult to disagree" with the plans but said Labour had "let Wales down" since devolution.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said: "As usual we are left with little by way of detail, and Carwyn Jones's claim that Wales is punching above its weight is delusional.
"In spite of our many and varied talents, the evidence suggests that the exact opposite is true.
"Under Labour, the Welsh education system ranks behind Vietnam; large swathes of Wales are poorer than parts of Bulgaria, Romania and Poland; and Welsh NHS waiting times are the longest in the UK.
"If the Labour Party thinks that Wales punching above its weight, then they have a very low opinion of our country indeed."
Janet Jones, Wales policy chair for the Federation of Small Businesses, said: "We welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government to supporting innovation and providing additional support for businesses.
"Key to that commitment must be a new economic development strategy which meets the challenges facing the Welsh economy in the coming five years.
"That strategy needs to contain fresh thinking and should place a focus on growing small firms into the successful and grounded medium-sized businesses that Wales needs to put our economy on a stronger footing."
Brexit will cast uncertainty over the next five years, says Carwyn Jones.
But as someone who campaigned for a Remain vote, he is bound to talk up the risks - as he sees them - of leaving the EU.
Whatever comes from Brexit, we know for certain there are plenty of hurdles that will make life difficult for Mr Jones if he is to deliver this five-year programme.
Labour has no majority in the Senedd. Today's statement is a chance for him to explain how he will make Labour's manifesto a reality. But in doing so, he must keep other parties on side to maintain his grip on power.
And we know there will be growing pressure on the Welsh Government budget. More cuts loom and sources close to the first minister say they have already had to wield the axe to raise the funds necessary to pay for expensive manifesto pledges.
