[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dumbarton 2-1 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Garry Fleming's strike midway through the second half moved Dumbarton up to eighth in the Scottish Championship following a win over Falkirk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sons ended a dreary first half ahead thanks to Robert Thomson's 44th-minute header from Sam Stanton's floated corner.
Falkirk equalised when Craig Sibbald profited from a scramble in the area to drill past goalkeeper Alan Martin.
But Fleming finished from Stanton's fine through ball two minutes later.
Victory lifts Dumbarton above Ayr United, who drew with bottom side St Mirren, on goal difference and also level on points with Dunfermline Athletic.
Falkirk remain third but will be disappointed to miss the chance to keep pace with leading duo Dundee United and Hibernian.
