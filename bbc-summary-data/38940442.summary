[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 1-1 Luton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Striker Alfie May announced himself on the Football League stage as he helped Doncaster rescue a point against promotion rivals Luton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Substitute May, playing for eighth-tier Hythe Town prior to joining Doncaster in January, showed excellent composure to slot an equaliser in the 80th minute.
League Two leaders Rovers had been chasing the game since the 54th minute when Jordan Cook slammed home a shot from the corner of the box after a fine counter-attack.
It had been an enthralling contest between Doncaster and a Luton side looking to claw back ground on the sides in the automatic promotion places.
Rovers started the brighter and Tommy Rowe twice went close to opening the scoring in the early stages.
But the Hatters forced their way into the game with a block from Niall Mason needed to keep out Danny Hylton.
The visitors took the lead early in the second half after Mason was caught out in midfield, allowing Cook through to blast past Ian Lawlor.
The hosts pushed for the leveller but found no joy until 10 minutes from time when May raced on to Conor Grant's stunning through ball and slotted home.
