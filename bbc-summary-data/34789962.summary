Maghaberry Prison: Regime change for republican prisoners

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The regime for dissident republicans at Northern Ireland's high-security prison will change as part of plans to address serious concerns raised in a highly critical report.

The prison service is discussing the possibility of a new unit at Maghaberry.
It will also hold other high risk and dangerous prisoners.
An inspection report last week described the prison as "unsafe, unstable and in a state of crisis".
It also said that the regime for dissident inmates was part of the problem.
They account for less than 5% of the overall prison population, but a much greater proportion of the resources, with staff from other areas is often diverted there.
"They consume a disproportionate amount of management attention," said Brendan McGuigan of Criminal Justice Inspection.
"Giving preference to maintaining the regime for separated prisoners over every other area in the prison is unfair and has a negative impact on more than 900 men who make up the majority of the prison population.
"This position is untenable and a radical new approach is needed."
There are currently 32 dissident republican inmates at Maghaberry.
They are held behind an internal security fence in separate blocks called Roe House.
Some loyalists are also held in separate blocks called Bush House behind the same fence.
Phil Wragg, who was appointed governor of Maghaberry in August, told the BBC a new approach is being considered.
"How we operate Roe House is under review at the moment to see whether there is an opportunity for us to consider operating a separate regime, a separated facility," he said.
"The discussions at the moment are that the facility, if there was to be one, would be within Maghaberry."
The proposed new facility would hold other prisoners regarded as dangerous or high risk currently held in other parts of Maghaberry.
That would mean the rest of Maghaberry could be run as a Category C prison, which would require lower security and staffing levels.
