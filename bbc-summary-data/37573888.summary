City Hall is exploring potential plans to build what could become London's largest film studios.

London mayor Sadiq Khan has launched a feasibility study into building studios in Dagenham east London.
The new development would be the first purpose-built film and television studios in the capital for at least 25 years.
Barking and Dagenham council and the London Local Enterprise Partnership will now develop a business case.
An £80,000 feasibility study will look at demand for such a facility and the economic benefit it could bring to East London and the city as a whole.
The new studios would complement London's three existing film studios at Twickenham, Ealing and Three Mills, the mayor said.
Approximately three-quarters of the UK's film industry is based in and around London, making it the third busiest city for film production in the world after Los Angeles and New York.
Last year, the capital saw £1bn of inward investment from international film production.
Those behind the proposals argue new studio space would help meet increasing demand and deliver more multi-million-pound productions to the capital.
The creative industries already provide 800,000 jobs in London and generate £35bn for the economy.
City Hall argued the new studios would create "a range of permanent jobs in the East End".
The biggest US studio-backed productions can spend over £100m in the UK.
The proposed site for the new studios at Dagenham East is located in front of London-east industrial park.
Mr Khan said: "From James Bond and Star Wars to Harry Potter and Bridget Jones's Baby, London has a vibrant production history and some of the best studios in the world.
"To sustain and grow this success story, it is critical the capital gets significantly more studio and production capacity to maximise the opportunities for filmmaking."
