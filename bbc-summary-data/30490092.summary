[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The police were attacked after stopping a car on the outskirts of the village of Killeagh shortly after midnight on Monday.
One officer received a serious head and eye injury and was taken to Cork University Hospital. The second officer was less seriously injured.
The police patrol car was also rammed.
The vehicle then made off in the direction of Youghal and rammed a second patrol car before heading towards Dungourney.
Police went to an address at Ballymartin, Dungourney, and a garda spokesman said there was  "another violent disorder incident" when officers came under attack.
Four men, aged 18, 22, 25, 46 and a 27-year-old woman are being detained in Midleton, Cobh and Fermoy Garda Stations.
A number of weapons, a car and cash have been seized.
The five people arrested are expected to appear before Mallow District Court on Tuesday.
