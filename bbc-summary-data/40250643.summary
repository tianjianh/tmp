Jeremy Corbyn Labour critics urged to take 'long hard look'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Critics of Jeremy Corbyn should take a "long hard look" at themselves after the election result, a supporter of the Labour leader has said.

Ex-Cardiff councillor Darren Williams, who sits on Labour's national executive committee, said their "judgement and loyalty" was in question.
He also claimed senior figures in Welsh Labour had lacked ambition, seeking mainly to hold rather than gain seats.
A Welsh Labour spokeswoman said it was "easy to be wise after the fact."
Since the result, which saw Labour gain three seats and increase its share of the vote in Wales, a number of high-profile critics, including the Caerphilly MP Wayne David and the Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock, urged other Labour MPs to get behind their leader.
Mr Kinnock also said he would be honoured to take a front bench role.
Mr Williams declined to name individuals but said: "It's right that Jeremy should reach out and welcome into his front bench team some of those who have been critical of him in the past.
"But I do think that for one or two people who have been persistent, and in a very personal way, publicly critical of him at times that have been very difficult for the party, I think these people's judgment and loyalty needs to be questioned.
"If I were him, in one or two cases, I might say thanks for the belated support, but no thanks.
"Now is not the time to indulge in recriminations but I do think some people really need to take a long hard look at some of the things they have been saying in the last year or so, and really re-evaluate their ideas about the leadership."
Mr Williams also criticised a "pessimistic" outlook of Labour's chances, saying the party could have picked up a few more seats if it had been "a bit more ambitious".
Labour regained Cardiff North, Gower and the Vale of Clwyd from the Conservatives, but also came close to in Tory-held Aberconwy and Preseli Pembrokeshire, and the Plaid Cymru seat of Arfon.
A spokeswoman for Welsh Labour said it was "easy to be wise after the fact."
She said: "At the start of the campaign, we were 10 points behind in the polls, which predicted Welsh Labour losing at least 10 seats. By the end, we were 11 points ahead.
"This didn't happen by magic, it happened because of a well-organised, energetic campaign led by Carwyn Jones in Wales alongside a UK campaign led by Jeremy Corbyn that captured the mood of the country and built support.
"It was this approach that enabled Welsh Labour to make gains, and out-perform other parts of the country."
