[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bus firm Arriva to make 'adjustments' for disabled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A North East bus company has been told to make "adjustments" so that wheelchair users are not unduly disadvantaged when using its buses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darlington Association on Disability had claimed Arriva North East drivers failed to stop for wheelchair users.
But a Teesside County Court judge has ruled the firm had "not breached the Equality Act" and chair users were not at "substantial disadvantage".
However, recommendations were made by the judge at Teesside County Court.
Seven disabled people had claimed wheelchair users had been refused access to some buses where there was already a pushchair on board.
But Arriva said its staff complied fully with Department for Transport guidelines.
One of the judge's recommendations for the Sunderland-based bus firm was a "hotline" for wheelchair-using passengers who want to use the service.
Chris Fry, managing partner at Unity Law, who is conducting the campaigners' legal case said "the judgement doesn't go far enough" and said the claimants will be seeking an appeal.
But Nigel Featham, managing director for Arriva North East, said: "We welcome the judgement but were disappointed that the matter went to court as we are always open and willing to discuss issues affecting people with disabilities to help make public transport even more accessible wherever possible."
