Treble-chasing Yorkshire have been hit by the loss of batsman Travis Head, who has been picked by Australia for their limited-overs series in Sri Lanka.

The 22-year-old has been added to the squad for two one-day internationals, on 21 and 28 August in Colombo and Dambulla, and a Twenty20 match in Pallekele on 6 September.
It means the South Australian will miss the rest of Yorkshire's season.
Head scored 390 runs in eight limited-overs games for the Tykes.
"Travis is a long-term prospect for Australian cricket in all formats," said national selector Rod Marsh. "We think he will benefit greatly from working in the conditions we have here in Sri Lanka.
"He will arrive here a few days earlier than the other ODI players so he can take the opportunity to work with the Test team as they prepare for the third Test."
The main body of the Australia tour party are preparing for the third Test against Sri Lanka, which starts in Colombo on Saturday, the visitors having already lost the three-match series.
Head has got the call following a successful time with Yorkshire including a brilliant 175 on his One-Day Cup debut against Yorkshire, in which he hit the Tykes' highest-ever score in 50-over cricket, as well as making 54 on his Tykes first-class debut.
Yorkshire now lose him not only for this Thursday's T20 Blast quarter-final against Glamorgan at Cardiff, but Finals Day too, should they make it, as well as as the rest of the One-Day Cup, in which Yorkshire have been paired with a quarter-final at Canterbury against Kent on 18 August.
He will also miss the final six matches of their County Championship run-in, starting with this Saturday's Roses match match against Lancashire at Old Trafford. But the Tykes, chasing a third successive title, are permitted to bring in an overseas player replacement.
"Travis is undoubtedly a real talent and has much to offer the game," said Yorkshire director of cricket Martyn Moxon. "Although the timing is not ideal, it affords an opportunity to another member of the playing group and our focus is firmly on Thursday's T20 quarter-final against Glamorgan in Cardiff."
Regulations prevent Yorkshire from recruiting a T20 and One-Day Cup replacement.
