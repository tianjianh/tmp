Unqualified driver admits killing friend in Glasgow crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was not qualified to drive and had no insurance has admitted causing the death of his friend by careless driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William McIntyre, 28, had "partied" all day with 25-year-old John Wilson before the crash on Great Western Road, Glasgow, on 26 January 2014.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard he lost control of the car, which hit a tree. Mr Wilson died at the scene.
Sentence on McIntyre was deferred until a later date.
The court heard that McIntyre, from Drumchapel, Glasgow, and Mr Wilson, had been going for cigarettes when the crash happened.
McIntyre held only a provisional driving licence which he had obtained eight days earlier.
The tree which the car struck crushed the passenger area of the car, including the window and roof.
When emergency services arrived they saw that Mr Wilson had been killed and McIntyre was unconscious in the driver's seat.
He was taken to the Western Infirmary, and while there, under the Road Traffic Act, a blood sample was taken from him while unconscious.
He was in a critical condition for several days.
Police spoke to him on 25 February and asked him about the crash but he said he had no recollection.
He also refused for the blood sample taken from him to be analysed for alcohol or drugs.
Father-of-three McIntyre, who has more than 20 previous convictions, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving, driving without insurance and refusing to give permission for a specimen of blood to be analysed.
