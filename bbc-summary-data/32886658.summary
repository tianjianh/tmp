Doll-house collection moves to potting sheds at Newby Hall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A collection of 65 dolls' houses is due to go on display at a stately home in North Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The houses, said to be "historically accurate", can be seen in the former potting sheds at Newby Hall near Ripon.
The collection includes a miniature Adam house with a replica of Newby Hall's tapestry room.
Collectors and miniaturists Caroline Hamilton and Jane Fiddick gave the collection to Newby Hall when it became too big for them to house.
Newby Hall was built by Sir Christopher Wren in the 1690s and later adapted by Robert Adam. It is now considered to be one of Britain's finest examples of Adam-style architecture.
Also going on display are 26 pieces chosen by Ms Hamilton and Ms Fiddick to demonstrate the miniaturist's skills including hallmarked silver, hand-blown glass, real china, minute stitching and hand-carved wood.
The potting sheds conversion cost £150,000, of which £97,000 came from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The dolls' house collection will be on public display from 30 June until 27 September, and from April to September each year thereafter.
Ms Fiddick said: "It is heart-warming to think that the pleasure our houses have given will be continued in a permanent home at Newby Hall.
"With its gracious Adam rooms, the hall is a miniaturist's dream. Some panels of the famous Newby Tapestries have been as closely reproduced as I could manage in my 1/12th scale Adam House, so it is a particularly fitting setting for the collection."
Ms Hamilton founded and ran the London Dollshouse Festival for 20 years.
