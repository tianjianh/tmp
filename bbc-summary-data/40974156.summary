[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eoin Bradley and Stephen O'Donnell's goals in the first half proved enough for the Bannsiders despite the dismissal of defender David Ogilby.
Coleraine are tied on the maximum nine points with Glenavon, who are top on goal difference, and holders Linfield.
Linfield ran out easy 4-0 winners at Dungannon while Glenavon hammered Ballymena 6-1 at the Showgrounds.
Newly-promoted Warrenpoint edged a 1-0 home win over Ards while Ballinamallard United drew 1-1 with Cliftonville.
Coleraine, third last season, will be delighted with their start having been faced with a tough-looking opening schedule against Dungannon, Cliftonville and Crusaders.
Bradley nodded Oran Kearney's side into a 22nd-minute lead and O'Donnell scored just before half-time with another close-range header.
Coleraine had to play the last 28 minutes without central defender David Ogilby as he was sent off when a hand ball offence meant a second yellow card.
They saw out the valuable win despite Crues substitute Jordan Forsythe pulling one back in stoppage-time.
Linfield rarely looked threatened in a routine win over Dungannon at Stangmore.
Paul Smyth, Niall Quinn and an own goal by former Blueman Seanan Clucas made it 3-0 at the break and Andy Mitchell netted the fourth with a late penalty.
Linfield have not lost a domestic fixture since 3 January and this was their third clean sheet in a row.
Glenavon were the top scorers of the day with a remarkable 6-1 success at Ballymena.
Incredibly, all the goals came in the second half and were scored by different players.
Adam Foley, James Singleton, Sammy Clingan (penalty), Andy Hall, Bobby Burns and Andrew Mitchell netted for Glenavon while United's solitary response was an 80th-minute penalty by Tony Kane.
Glentoran boss Gary Haveron will be disappointed with is side's draw at home to his former club Carrick.
The Glens looked on course to maintain their 100% start when Ross Redman shot them into the lead in the first half , but Lee Chapman headed Carrick's equaliser 40 seconds after the restart.
Former Portadown striker Darren Murray scored in Warrenpoint's 1-0 win over Ards.
Ballinamallard took the lead through a Ryan Curran penalty but Garry Breen equalised for Cliftonville who may feel they should have taken the chances they had to win the game.
