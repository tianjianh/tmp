The jobs at the factory in Lincoln are under threat after parent company PepsiCo announced changes for the Newark Road site.
The factory, which makes Quavers and some of the Walkers Sensation ranges, employs about 250 people.
PepsiCo said it had "looked extensively" at the site and it had been a "tough decision to make".
Spokesman Steve Switzer said: "We are continually reviewing our operations to ensure we remain competitive and take full advantage of future growth opportunities.
"This move will significantly change the way we pack our goods, improve efficiency and ensure Lincoln has the capacity to support the long-term growth of the Walkers business in the UK.
"This has been a tough decision to make and we recognise this is difficult news for some of our employees."
The Lincoln site has been in the city for more than 70 years and was originally the home of Smiths Crisps.
Leader of the city council Ric Metcalfe said job centre staff would be offering support to the affected workers.
He added: "Your heart has to go out to the individual workers and their families in terms of the impact of this when people have already been struggling with pressure on household incomes, and this is just added misery. It is very bad news indeed."
MP for Lincoln Karl McCartney described the news as a "silver lining to a very dark cloud".
He added: "It is upsetting for the individuals affected but the upside is this secures the future of the Walkers site in the centre of Lincoln."
