Head coach Jones has been in charge since the departure of director of rugby Lyn Jones on 20 April.
His role will be expanded with the region dispensing with the post of director of rugby.
"Kingsley is highly respected by this group of players and we absolutely feel that he is the right man to take charge of the team," said chief executive Stuart Davies.
"His appointment as head coach rather than director of rugby, means that we will be reviewing the roles and responsibilities of the wider management team, whilst Kingsley and I will also discuss bolstering the coaching team to add further support, skills and experience."
The 46-year-old joined Dragons in 2013 as assistant coach, at the same time as overseeing the Russian national team.
He was appointed head coach of the Welsh region in 2014.
Dragons finished in 10th place in the Pro12, one place ahead of Zebre despite winning a game fewer than the Italian side.
The Welsh region finished ahead of them after picking up 10 losing bonus points during the season.
