The International Cycling Union (UCI) said it was investigating an incident of "technological fraud" in the women's under-23 race.
The race was won by Great Britain's Evie Richards, but none of the podium finishers is under suspicion.
If confirmed it would be the first case of its kind in elite cycling.
The UCI said in a statement that the bike "has been detained for further investigation".
