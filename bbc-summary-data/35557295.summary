The partner of Sian Blake has been arrested by UK police on suspicion of murdering the ex-EastEnders actress and their two sons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arthur Simpson-Kent was arrested at Heathrow Airport after arriving in the UK on a flight from Ghana.
Ms Blake and her sons, aged eight and four, disappeared on 13 December and were found buried in the garden of their London home on 5 January.
He has been taken to a west London police station.
The actress, who played Frankie Pierre in 56 episodes of EastEnders in 1996 and 1997, and Zachery, aged eight, and Amon, four, died from neck and head injuries, post-mortem tests found.
She had been suffering from motor neurone disease.
Police officers arrested Mr Simpson-Kent, the children's father, on a beach in Ghana four days after the bodies were found.
He left the UK days after Ms Blake and the two boys were reported missing.
Scotland Yard is under investigation by the police watchdog for the way it handled the missing persons inquiry and why it took more than three weeks to find the bodies at the actress' home in Erith.
