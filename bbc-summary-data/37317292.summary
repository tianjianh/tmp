About 140 employees at Community Safety Glasgow (CSG), an arms-length council body, walked out on Wednesday in an ongoing row over pay for shift work.
Their five-day action will come to an end on Sunday.
CSG said cameras would record as normal with monitoring arrangements in place.
A spokesman for CSG said: "CCTV cameras will continue to operate and record as normal. Monitoring will be provided from within existing resources."
He added: "This strike is entirely unnecessary and ill-conceived. We are more than willing to talk this through and there is more than ample time to reach a fair settlement.
"We urge the union reps to get back round the table and discuss these issues constructively."
The staff taking part in the action belong to three trade unions - Unison, Unite and GMB.
Unite regional officer William McGonigle said: "Community Safety Glasgow wants to remove out-of-hours payments for our members, which could see many losing up to Â£4,000 in their take-home pay.
"That's a massive cut, and we simply can't agree to it.
"We urge Community Safety Glasgow to stop attacking their hard-working staff, and to get back around the negotiating table with us to come up with a sensible solution."
CSG said that a pay review "designed to ensure balance and fairness" for all staff had "delivered improved or identical pay for 83% of staff".
The spokesman said: "We accept that a small group of staff would lose money as a result of the pay review as it currently stands.
"But we have guaranteed that those in detriment will have their pay protected at current rates for the next two years to allow time for a negotiated settlement of the issues."
