Dan Sparkes slotted home from 12 yards for his fifth goal of the season as Braintree claimed an early lead.
But, Sean Marks was shown a straight red card when he swung an elbow at Ian Gayle in a challenge and the Iron had to play with 10 men for nearly an hour.
Harry Lee and Michael Bakare hit the woodwork for the visitors but it could not halt Welling's 12-game winless run.
