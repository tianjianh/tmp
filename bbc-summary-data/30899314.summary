[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
RockNess, one of Scotland's largest music festivals, has been cancelled for the second year in a row.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Organisers of the event held at Dores on the shores of Loch Ness have confirmed that it will not be taking place.
Last year's festival did not go ahead because a date could not be found that did not clash with the World Cup and the Commonwealth Games.
No details have been released on plans to host RockNess next year.
Before 2014, the event had been held every June since 2006 at Dores, near Inverness.
The three-day festival typically drew more than 30,000 revellers to the area.
It has featured some of the biggest names in UK and international music, including Daft Punk, Fatboy Slim, Steve Aoki, Basement Jaxx and Madness.
