[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sturgeon to launch SNP council election manifesto

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon is to launch the SNP's campaign for the forthcoming council elections, characterising the contest as a "clear choice" between her party and the Tories.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland goes to the polls for local authority elections on 4 May.
The first minister and SNP leader will set out her party's manifesto for the vote at an event in Edinburgh.
She said every vote for her party in the poll would be "a vote against Tory austerity".
And she said SNP councillors would "always put their local communities first".
In the last set of council elections in 2012, the SNP on 32.3% of the vote, taking 425 seats across the country, just ahead of Labour.
However, the SNP ultimately ended up running fewer of Scotland's town halls than their rivals, a position they aim to change in May.
Ms Sturgeon said: "The council elections are a clear choice between the SNP who stand for strong and vibrant local communities - and a Tory party which has become a single-issue, Brexit-at-all-costs machine.
"SNP councillors will always put their local communities first - they are not there to simply make up the numbers and be used as a proxy war in national political games.
"From the abolition of ring-fenced funding and our transformational Community Empowerment Act, the SNP has a long track record of pushing power down to local communities.
"Every vote for the SNP on May 4th is a vote against Tory austerity, and a vote to protect vital services and jobs. All of our candidates are working hard every day to earn the trust of the people they want to represent and after the election will continue to work every day to preserve it."
