Football League: Monaghan unchanged for big Donegal Division One game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Monaghan have named an unchanged team for Sunday's big Division One Football League clash against Donegal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ulster sides - along with Dublin and Tyrone - are among four counties topping the table on seven points.
Niall Morgan and Padraig Hampsey replace Mickey O'Neill and Cathal McShane in two Tyrone changes from the defeat by Donegal for their Mayo game.
Cavan earned a superb away win over Mayo last weekend but a home defeat by Kerry on Sunday could relegate them.
Mayo boss Stephen Rochford makes two changes from the Cavan defeat with Chris Barrett and Evan Regan replacing Donal Vaughan and Conor Loftus.
Also in Division One, Dublin are odds on to stretch their unbeaten run to an all-time record of 34 league and championship games by beating relegation-threatened Roscommon at Croke Park on Saturday evening.
All three Ulster counties in Division Two are in relegation trouble going into their games on Sunday with bottom-placed Derry and Fermanagh occupying the drop spots at the moment and Down just ahead of the Ernemen on scoring difference.
However such is the tight nature of Division Two that two closing wins for Fermanagh and Down could put them in contention for promotion.
Derry look set to include Slaughtneil duo Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers in their squad for the vital home game against Cork, who are only a point ahead of the Oak Leafers in fifth spot.
Mark Lynch and Danny Heavron will also be available to Derry boss Damian Barton after injury.
After three successive defeats, Fermanagh got back on the winning trail by beating Clare last weekend but a reverse against unchanged Meath in Navan would keep them very much in the relegation mix.
Tomas Corrigan has been passed fit to start for Down while Chris Snow returns in goal in place of Thomas Treacy.
Down are in the same category as Fermanagh going into their home contest with Galway, who currently are in second spot in the table on seven points.
Galway boss Kevin Walsh has named an unchanged team from the win over Derry with Michael Daly set to play on Sunday after lining out for the county's under-21s in the Connacht semi-final against Mayo on Saturday.
In Division Three, there is a crucial all-Ulster clash at the Athletic Grounds on Saturday night with promotion contenders Armagh facing an Antrim team still in the relegation mix despite last weekend's win over Laois.
Armagh go into the weekend in third spot - a point behind leaders Tipperary and Louth.
But Tipperary face Louth on Sunday so Armagh will find themselves in a promotion place if they beat the Saffrons and there is a winner at Semple Stadium.
Kieran McGeeney makes two changes from the impressive 3-15 to 0-11 win over Louth as Gavin McParland and Stefan Campbell take over from Ciaran McKeever and Aidan Forker.
Forker's straight red card from last weekend's game has been overturned by the GAA's Central Hearing Committee so he could yet play a part in Saturday evening's game.
