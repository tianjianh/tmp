Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson said it was "great to feel like a football player again" as he returned to action following a long-term injury.

The 24-year-old was an injury-time substitute for the Cherries in their 2-1 win at Aston Villa on Saturday.
Wilson, Bournemouth's leading scorer last season, missed six months of the club's first Premier League campaign with medial knee ligament damage.
"There's nothing like being back out on the pitch," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"It was only a few touches, but it's nice to feel like a football player again."
The former Coventry City striker required surgery following the injury he sustained against Stoke in September and revealed his return came a week earlier than planned.
"I'd originally targeted the Liverpool game (at home on Sunday), but one week sooner is perfect for me," added Wilson. "There's a little bit of match fitness still to regain, but I feel strong and ready."
