[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leaders Northampton stretched their unbeaten League Two run to 17 games as they hit back to deny 10-man Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two Matt Green headers, from free-kicks by Mal Benning and Chris Clements, put the Stags in control, but the game turned when the hosts had Jamie McGuire sent off in first-half injury-time.
Substitute Ricky Holmes scored from the penalty spot to make it 2-1 after James Collins went down in the box.
And a close-range John Marquis strike following a corner earned a point.
Northampton, who remain 13 points clear at the top of the table following Oxford's draw with Cambridge, could have won it late on but substitute Sam Hoskins shot over when well placed.
The Stags move up a place to 13th, but are eight points off the play-off spots with seven games to play.
