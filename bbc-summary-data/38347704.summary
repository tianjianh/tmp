[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Gabby and Chris Adcock are through to the semi-finals of the World Superseries Finals, as they defend their title in Dubai.

The husband-and-wife pair beat China's Lu Kai and Huang Yaqiong 24-22, 21-19.
They finish as runners-up in group B and will face Indonesia's world number three pairing Debby Susanto and Praveen Jordan in Saturday's semi-final.
The Commonwealth champions became the first Britons to win a Superseries title at the event last year.
The Adcocks, ranked eighth in the world, have won two and lost one of their group matches.
Badminton is one of five sports to lose its UK Sport funding for the 2020 Olympics, but is appealing against the decision.
