Police received a report at about 22.35 BST on Monday that a man had been shot in both ankles at Culdaff Gardens in the Creggan area of the city.
It is believed that four masked men were involved in the paramilitary-style attack.
The victim was taken to Altnagelvin Hospital for treatment. His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
A woman, who lives in the area, heard the shots.
The witness, who did not want to be named, told BBC Radio Foyle she saw the man crying for help.
"I just heard a car pulling up really fast and people getting out of the car and gunshots. Then they got back into the car and took off speeding.
"When I looked out the window I seen the fella coming crawling, on his hands and knees crying out for help.
"I just can't get over it really, the kids on the street could have been out playing or anything," she said.
The shooting was condemned as "wrong" by Sinn FÃ©in councillor Colly Kelly.
"There can be no place for these type of incidents in our society," he said.
"I would urge anyone with any information on this shooting to bring it forward to the police."
