Derek Serpell-Morris, who has played sets at Glastonbury under the name DJ Derek, was reported missing by his family on 23 July.
He was seen leaving the Criterion public house on July 11 and is believed to have caught a bus to Thornbury.
The BBC understands a river search has started in the area and will continue on Wednesday.
House to house enquiries will also be carried out.
DJ Derek's great niece, Jennifer Griffiths, previously said she was losing hope of finding him alive.
He is described as a white male, of slim build and average height, with grey hair. He also wears glasses.

The former accountant, a resident of St Pauls in Bristol since 1978, has played across the UK and appeared at the Big Chill.
He also released his own compilation album, worked with Massive Attack and appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video.
