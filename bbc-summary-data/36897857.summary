[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Greaves, 29, from Bronygarth, Shropshire, went missing after leaving his friends to spend some time alone near the ancient site of Machu Picchu.
Search teams found his body in a 40-metre crevice in the Andes mountains nine days after he was reported missing in April.
The Shrewsbury coroner John Ellery recorded a verdict of accidental death.
Mr Greaves, who had moved to Wrexham, had been expected to return home on 10 April.
Mr Greaves had been trekking with friends in dense jungle near Machu Picchu, the inquest at Shirehall, Shrewsbury, heard.
He left the group to spend his 29th birthday, on 9 April, alone.
The inquest heard that judging by the amount of rations he had left, the furniture maker had died close to or on his actual birthday.
His father Simon previously said his son had sought quiet reflection before embarking on the next stage of his life.
He told the inquest his son would be "mourned by many".
"Harry was always just Harry - philosophical, spirited nature with a booming laugh who touched the lives of people wherever he met them," he said.
