Hatton Garden jury hears raiders brag about 'biggest robbery ever'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The jury in the Hatton Gardens trial has heard recordings of the men accused of the biggest burglary in English history bragging about the Â£14m heist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police put recording devices in the cars of Terry Perkins and John Collins after the Easter weekend raid.
Perkins is heard bragging that officers "can't work out" the crime.
Of the eight men charged, three deny conspiracy to commit burglary and a fourth denies conspiracy to conceal or transfer criminal property.
The rest - Collins, 74, Perkins, 67, Brian Reader, 76, and Daniel Jones, 58 - have admitted conspiracy to burgle.
The contents of 72 safety deposit boxes were stolen after a concrete vault was drilled into.
Before the recordings were played, Judge Christopher Kinch told Woolwich Crown Court: "There are some colourful sections and some choice language."
The devices that captured the conversations were placed in Perkins's blue Citroen Saxo and Collins's white Mercedes. The voice of John "Kenny" Collins, 75, was also heard, the prosecution alleges.

The prosecution alleges that a man referred to in the conversations as "Carl", is Carl Wood, 58, while "Bill" is William Lincoln, 60 and the "taxi driver" is Jon Harbinson, 42.
A man referred to as "Hughey" is allegedly Hugh Doyle, 48.
In a conversation recorded on 15 May, Perkins is heard telling Jones: "Sellable yes, necklaces - all stone ones, few of them.
"Few of those bracelets ones, then you got the necklace with the (expletive) big emeralds in it with the matching earrings."
Perkins suggests it is good that the police think the raid was an inside job.
He goes on to brag: "No, they can't work that out. That is the biggest robbery that could have ever ever been."
"Yeah," replies Jones.
Perkins was heard discussing how with his share of the goods he has at least paid for his daughter's holiday, and that if he melts down his gold it could be his pension.
Home Affairs Correspondent Daniel Sandford reports Perkins asked where "the stones" had been left. Jones refers to "leaving them over the cemetery".
The jury was told at an earlier date how Jones buried his share of jewellery in graves in Edmonton Cemetery in north London.
The recordings also reveal conversations about the victims whose jewellery was stolen.
Jones talks about one of the victims saying to Perkins: "I feel a bit sorry, don't you?" to which Perkins responds laughing "Give it back to him."
The trial continues.
