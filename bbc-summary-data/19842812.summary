Aberdeen set for Hogmanay fireworks display

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen's Hogmanay fireworks display will go ahead this year, despite earlier fears about funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The event had been facing the axe after sponsorship dried up.
However, councillors have now opted to spend Â£50,000 from the Common Good Fund to put on a display to see in the new year.
Fresh efforts will be made to attract private sector sponsors for future years.
