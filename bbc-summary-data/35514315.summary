An estimated 201,003 fans attended the Scottsdale event, taking the week's total crowd to 535,035.
Five-time major winner Mickelson is five shots adrift of leader Danny Lee, who is 13 under after carding a 67.
Japan's Hideki Matsuyama (68) and Rickie Fowler (70) of the United States are tied second on 10-under.
Ireland's Shane Lowry, who was three shots off the lead after the second round, slipped to joint 10th after a one-over 72 left him on six under par.
The previous largest crowd - also at the Stadium Course - was 189,722 in 2014.
