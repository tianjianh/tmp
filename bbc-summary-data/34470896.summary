The annual report for the Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust says it spent £3.3m on placements outside the area in 2014-15 compared with £800,000 in 2013-14.
It says this was due to the increasing demands placed on the services.
The trust said it had been taking steps to cut the use of out of area beds.
Patients are sent out of the counties when no suitable mental health beds are available.
The annual report is going before the trust's annual general meeting.
Michael Scott, chief executive at the trust, said: "By taking a number of steps, including the opening of new 12-bed ward at Hellesdon Hospital and investing almost £1m into our community services, we have been able to reduce the number of Norfolk patients in out of area beds down to six today."
The trust annual report says it spent £24.8m on temporary pay, 15% of the trust's total pay bill and £8m higher than the previous year.
The majority of this money was spent to cover vacancies and ensure safe levels of staffing in wards.
The trust said it was trying to "reduce the level of spend and increase our recruitment of key frontline staff".
The mental health trust for Suffolk and Norfolk, which has a budget of £212m, has also found itself with a year-end deficit of £3.7m.
A report to its AGM said it had planned to have a surplus of £1.9m at the end of 2014-15.
A report to the trust said the major reason for the deficit was spending on temporary staff and out of area placements.
