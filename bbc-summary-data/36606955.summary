Steve Davis: Crewe Alexandra captain Ryan Lowe not consulted over managerial sacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra captain Ryan Lowe is unhappy he was not spoken to by anyone at the League Two club about their managerial change.

After the club's decision to sack Steve Davis following Saturday's 3-0 loss at Mansfield, ex-Alex skipper Dave Artell was invited to step up as manager from his job within Crewe's academy.
"Obviously, Dave's been given the nod," Lowe told BBC Radio Stoke.
"I hope he does well and we'll have to now see where this takes us."
But after one of his former clubs Bury made an approach in December for 38-year-old Lowe to return to Gigg Lane as player-coach, the Liverpudlian admitted to surprise at being left out of the loop at Gresty Road.
"In all honesty, I'm a bit disappointed no-one rang me," he said. "With me being the club captain, and with the situation that materialised six weeks ago with Bury.
"I've played with Dave a couple of times, at Chester and Shrewsbury, and we get on a like a house on fire. But that's football. I'm always there to lean on, whoever it may be.
"I've had a bit of stick myself by sticking by him (Steve Davis), but I'll always stick by the manager, whoever it is."
Former Alex player Artell, who rejoined the club's backroom staff in 2014, takes over an out-of-sorts club who have won just twice in 21 games.
"The fact is we haven't been good enough throughout the season," said Lowe. "Early on, we were okay for the first two months. But then we packed in a bit and we haven't done as well as we should have.
"And some of the players have to look at themselves and take a bit of responsibility."
Crewe have extended Chelsea winger Alex Kiwomya's loan until the end of the season.
The 20-year-old nephew of former Arsenal and Ipswich Town striker Chris Kiwomya was due to end his existing loan spell on 9 January.
But Chelsea have agreed to allow Kiwomya, who has scored seven goals in 25 appearances, to see the season out at Gresty Road.
