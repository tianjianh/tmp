Two brothers who were led to safety from their grandparents' home during floods in Cumbria have been given a Christmas gift by their rescuers.

Sebastian and Jacob Holmes, aged five and three, and their family were stranded for 12 hours, on 6 December.
To coax the "terrified" boys to safety, from the bungalow in Levens, the RNLI volunteer rescuers promised them their helmets.
Their father Alan said the gifts delivery was a "fantastic" gesture.
The brothers were among six members of their family and two dogs, carried out of the bungalow after they used flash lights to signal for help while standing on kitchen worktops and bunk beds to escape the rising water.
Mr Holmes said: "The boys were sitting on the top bunk but they were scared and crying that they wanted their daddy to come and help. We felt so helpless.
"When we heard the RNLI team had managed to get them out safely we were just so relieved. We are both just so grateful.
"To take the effort to come up here and meet the boys in person and deliver them in time for Christmas is a fantastic gesture."
The RNLI volunteers visited the family at their home in Lytham St Annes on Wednesday to give them rescue helmets to the boys as a Christmas present.
The team, along with other emergency services, evacuated hundreds of people from their homes across Cumbria as "unprecedented" levels of flooding hit the county.
Cumbria is still recovering after some areas were hit by flooding three times in less than a month - many flood-hit areas are braced for further problems with more heavy rain forecast for Christmas night and Boxing Day.
