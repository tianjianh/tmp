[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 1-4 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moses Emmanuel scored twice to fire Dover into the National League play-off places following victory over Maidstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emmanuel opened the scoring in the 29th minute when he fired home at the second attempt after goalkeeper Lee Worgan had saved his initial shot.
And it was 2-0 10 minutes into the second half when the home defence failed to deal with Ross Lafayette's cross from the right and Emmanuel pounced to drill home from an acute angle.
Maidstone got themselves back into the game after 61 minutes when Vas Karagiannis converted from close range but Dover restored their two-goal advantage when Richard Orlu played in Lafayette and he made no mistake in firing across Worgan into the net.
Ricky Miller then wrapped up victory in stoppage time when Lafayette's ball sent him clear to slot home.
