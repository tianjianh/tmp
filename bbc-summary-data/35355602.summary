Midfielder Dack, 22, has scored 13 goals for the League One side this season, including 11 in the league.
The former Charlton youth player is under contract until 2018.
City were told their bids were short of Gillingham's valuation, but the Championship club have secured the signing of a midfielder - QPR's Ben Gladwin on a three-month loan deal.
