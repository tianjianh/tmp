Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said the 20-year-old would be out for "a few weeks" after leaving him out of his squad to play Arsenal on Sunday.
Pochettino said Alli "twisted his knee in a clash with a team-mate".
England play Scotland on Friday and Spain the following Tuesday at Wembley.
"I hope it is not a big issue, it's bad luck, he's an important player for us," Pochettino added.
"He will be out for a few weeks. We need to assess him today, tomorrow. That is football and sometimes it happens."
