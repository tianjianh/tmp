South Korea protests: Seoul rally against Park Geun-hye

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tens of thousands of protesters in South Korea have held a mass rally against a raft of government policies that they say weaken democracy.

The protest was big, rowdy and attended by a wide cross section of people but there was no repeat of violence which marred a similar rally last month.
About 18,000 police were deployed in the capital, Seoul.
Protesters oppose plans including changes to labour laws and greater controls over history textbooks.
Left-wing critics say this will lead to a whitewashing of past South Korean dictatorships.
About 14,000 people are estimated by police to have attended the rally, far fewer than the 60,000 that attended the 14 November demonstration.

Saturday's protest went ahead after a court turned down the government's move for an injunction made in the aftermath of violence at the previous demonstration.
The demonstrators were unhappy over moves by President Park Geun-hye's conservative government to dismiss workers based on performance and to place a ceiling on the salaries of senior employees to encourage employers to recruit younger people and reduce youth unemployment.
An arrest warrant has been issued against the head of the militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU), who has taken sanctuary in a Buddhist temple in Seoul, over the 14 November rally.
On Saturday Han Sang-gyun repeated a call for a general strike against "labour conditions that only fattens capitalists".
President Park is the country's first female president and was elected two years ago.
