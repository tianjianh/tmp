Oxford University professor makes Lego Hertford College

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Oxford University professor has created a Lego version of his college, complete with an "alien experimentation laboratory" and a graffiti tag.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has taken Dr Andrew Beaumont six months to build, using 30,000 bricks to build the 6ft (1.82m)-long version of Hertford College.
Inside is a "Hogwarts-style" spiral staircase, copies of rooms and a Lego version of principal Will Hutton.
The model is to be unveiled at the college's open day on 1 July.
Dr Beaumont, a colonial historian, has previously made Lego versions of the 700-year-old college chapel and Bridge of Sighs.
His models, built in his spare time, are all constructed from memory. He does not use drawings or plans, he said.
Dr Beaumont said the bricks were sourced from distributors in Eastern Europe.
The model includes two parts which have a QR code, enabling hopeful students to scan and view college's prospectus.
"It's a useful message to show prospective students that we don't take ourselves too seriously,' he said.
