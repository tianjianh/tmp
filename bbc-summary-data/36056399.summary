[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrister Omar Khan jailed for supplying cocaine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A barrister who was due to move into his own chambers in Huddersfield has been jailed for supplying cocaine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Omar Khan, 31, had worked at The Johnson Partnership in Nottingham for five years before he was arrested.
Erlin Manahasa, Albert Dibra and Nazaquat Ali were sentenced alongside Khan - who was jailed for 40 months - at Nottingham Crown Court.
They all admitted the same charge, relating to offences committed between 1 October and 4 December last year.
The court previously heard the case involved the recovery of 1kg (2.2lb) of cocaine.
Digby Johnson, a partner at the firm, told the BBC last month that they did not represent Khan - who had set up his own office and was about to leave the company.
Mr Johnson called Khan's actions "stupid" but described Khan, of William Street, Huddersfield, as "a lovely guy" who was "incredibly hard-working".
Manahasa, of no fixed address, was jailed for four and a half years, Dibra, of Joyce Avenue, Nottingham, for seven and a half years, while Ali, of Chard Street, Nottingham, was sentenced to five years in prison.
