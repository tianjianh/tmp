A series of tweets claiming to be from "The Legion" also gave out a London address said to belong to Mr Mallya.
Mr Mallya appears to have regained control of the account and the tweets have been deleted.
The businessman is being investigated in India over alleged money laundering.
Mr Mallya has been in the UK since March this year. India revoked his passport and asked the UK to deport him in May, after an Indian court issued a warrant for his arrest.
The tweets posted to his account included a list of luxury cars that the group claimed were owned by Mr Mallya, as well as a photograph of what appeared to be a residency permit of "unlimited" duration.
The group said that the information published was just a "trailer" and that more would be released soon.
This appears to be the second time the group has taken over Mr Mallya's account.
The businessman appeared to regain control of the account, posting to saying that the group had "hacked" him and was attempting to blackmail him.
Tweets then appeared after that denying the claims of blackmail and promising to "expose" Mr Mallya further over the coming weeks.
Mr Mallya made his fortune selling beer under the Kingfisher brand and branched out into aviation, Formula 1 racing, and Indian cricket.
The flamboyant businessman incurred large debts when Kingfisher airlines failed in 2013 and he is being pursued by a group of mainly state-run banks who lent him money.
He is alleged to have repeatedly failed to appear before investigators in India over financial irregularities at the airline.
He has denied fleeing India, saying he is travelling on business. He has also claimed he is the victim of a "media witch hunt".
