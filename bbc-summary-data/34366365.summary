Marriott replaced injured Craig Mackail-Smith in the first half as Jonathan Smith put Luton ahead after Luke Guttridge's effort was saved.
Rakish Bingham wasted two good chances for the hosts before Billy Paynter's diving header levelled it up.
Marriot scored twice in four minutes to extend the Hatters lead and Ollie Lee curled in from 25 yards in injury-time.

Luton assistant boss Terry Harris told BBC Three Counties Radio:
"It's been a long week, a fair few miles, but a fantastic week.
"If somebody had said take six points and score seven goals, you'd have snapped their hands off.
"Jack's come on and taken his opportunity, we're absolutely delighted for him."
