[SN]TITLE[SN]
Councillors approve new Inverness developments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland councillors have approved a number of major planning developments proposed for Inverness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They include Hercules Unit Trust's plan to open three restaurants - a Frankie and Benny's, TGI Fridays and Nandos - at the Inverness Shopping Park.
Tulloch Homes have a proposal for 60 new homes on the site of the city's former Glebe Street swimming pool.
Tuesday's south planning applications committee also approved student flats at Rose Street.
However, councillors objected to another major scheme - 13-turbine Tom Nan Clach Wind Farm near Dava Moor and Lochindorb Castle.
The project could now go on to be considered by a public inquiry.
