The ex-Peterborough player, 30, made 23 appearances last season for the League Two side, who were beaten in the play-off final by Blackpool at Wembley.
Midfielder Tom McCready and full-back Connor Riley-Lowe have also been let go but six have been offered new deals.
"We are yet to establish whether we are able to carry three goalkeepers in the squad," said Exeter boss Paul Tisdale.
"With Bobby's contract expiring, he has not received an offer, although we would love to keep him if it were possible."
Christy Pym and James Hamon are the other keepers on the Grecians' books.
The Devon side have 18 players under contract for next season, including forwards Ollie Watkins and David Wheeler, with defender Troy Archibald-Henville and Jamaica international Joel Grant among those yet to respond to offers from the club.
