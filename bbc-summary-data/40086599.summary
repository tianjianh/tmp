The crash happened at the Dolly's Brae entrance of Castlewellan Forest Park at about 16:50 BST on Monday.
The ambulance service said that the two people were discharged after being treated by paramedics.
The Mourne Mountain Rescue Team said that the pair had walked away from the crash.
"The pilot and passenger managed to escape the wreckage and walk to a nearby forest road to meet with the attending ambulance and fire service," the team wrote on Facebook.
The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA), which manages the forest park, said the aircraft had "made an emergency landing".
Members of a local flying club and others examined the aircraft and organised the removal of the wreckage.
It is understood there was low cloud and mist in the area at the time of the crash although it is not yet known what caused the incident.
