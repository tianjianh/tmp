The migrant described as "very angry" walked into a police station on Monday and made the claims after a decade in the city, police said.
He was arrested in what police said was a "strange incident".
Greater Manchester Police's city centre team tweeted the man had been handed over to immigration staff.
The man was later de-arrested following immigration checks.
