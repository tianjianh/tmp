The email, written after an appearance at the Pakistan consulate in Birmingham on 14 August, was leaked to The Guardian newspaper.
Indian-born Paul Sabapathy CBE said Pakistanis needed to be taught "basic common courtesy and civility".
He has apologised "unreservedly and wholeheartedly" for the comments.
The Guardian reported Mr Sabapathy's email said: "Pakistanis are lovely people individually but there is a lot of work to do to teach them basic common courtesy and civility.
"They talk to themselves and do not engage with the wider community. They are living in the UK not Pakistan.
"Whilst being rightly proud of their Pakistani culture and heritage they need to explain better and engage more with their non-Pakistani brothers and sisters if they want their children to succeed as British Pakistani citizens."
Mr Sabapathy, who is originally from Chennai, was in the city to celebrate Pakistan Independence Day.
He announced his resignation on Friday and said: "I wish to apologise unreservedly and wholeheartedly for the offence I have caused to the Pakistani community and others, by the contents of my private email.
"I have today written to all those who received my original email to express my sincere sorrow and regret. I have asked for their forgiveness in the hope that my comments do not damage relationships between the many communities of the West Midlands."
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: "The Royal Household would like to acknowledge the tremendous work done by Mr Sabapathy since his appointment in 2007 to support the work of the Royal Family and to bring together and work with the communities in the West Midlands."
The position of Her Majesty's Lord-Lieutenant of West Midlands was formed in 1974. Duties include arranging royal visits and presenting awards on behalf of the crown.
