FA Cup: Arsenal and Aston Villa celebrity fans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Arsenal faced Aston Villa in the FA Cup Final, an impressive roster of celebrity supporters would have been cheering them on. From David Cameron to Jay Z, both clubs have an impressive line-up of famous fans. But which club's A-listers care most about their team?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The second in line to the throne versus his younger brother - match-ups rarely come bigger.
In a new interview for the BBC's Match of the Day, the Duke of Cambridge spoke of his love for Aston Villa and his nerves ahead of the final.
He also said he hoped his son Prince George and daughter Princess Charlotte would follow in his footsteps.
Prince William is believed to have started supporting Villa while at school and has been spotted at Villa Park. As president of the Football Association, he also presented the FA Cup trophy to Saturday's winners.
One person celebrating the fact Arsenal were the recipients is his brother Prince Harry, who spoke briefly about his hopes of a Gunners win during a recent visit to New Zealand.
His support also dates back to childhood, but it is unclear why he picked the club.
Neither prince is on Twitter, but followers of spoof accounts suggest Prince Harry might shade his brother in the social media stakes.
Winner - Prince William
Hollywood A-listers Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks have won two Oscars apiece, as well as a stack of other awards.
Both have some big films to their names, including Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and Dances With Wolves for Costner and Apollo 13 and Forrest Gump for Hanks.
A recent convert to football, or "soccer", in 2008, Tom Hanks admitted he became a Villa fan thanks largely to their name and club colours.
"Here in England you have other footballing entities like Manchester and Arsenal and Chelsea...and here's Aston Villa! What suburb of Rome is Aston Villa from?!" he said.
In an email sent to BBC Radio 5 Live on the morning of the cup final match-up, Hanks wrote:
Hanks here. I've been an Aston Villa fan since 1984 - true to be claret and blue for 21 years. Good luck in the FA Cup!
Wait! Not enough exclamation marks!
Go Aston Villa in the FA Cup!!!!!!!
Costner hoped Wembley would be Arsenal's Field of Dreams on Saturday. He became a fan while filming Robin Hood in the UK in 1990.
"I remember being taken by the emotion of it," he told the club's Youtube channel last year.
"I don't pretend to be a super fan. I could never be confused with someone who knows everything about Arsenal, but they're my team and when I come [to London] I try to see them play."
On Twitter, Hanks trumps Costner with more than nine million followers, compared with Costner's combined 147,000.
While Hanks has posed with a Villa scarf, Costner is featuring Arsenal in his latest film, Criminal, due out next year.
Winner - Costner
While under different circumstances, David Cameron and David Miliband might have gone head-to-head at the recent general election, they will now square up metaphorically at Wembley.
Miliband has been based in the United States in recent years, but that has not stopped him keeping up with the Arsenal results.
Born in London, he has been a vocal supporter of the Gunners.
In a government blog in 2008 he wrote: "I am now the proud owner of a handshake, a picture and an autograph from.....Arsene Wenger."
Mr Cameron, meanwhile, maintains he has been a Villa fan since childhood.
He was often taken to matches by uncle and former club chairman Sir William Dugdale and watched them beat Bayern Munich in the European Cup final.
A long association, however, did not stop him naming West Ham - who also play in claret and blue - as his favourite team in a slip-up during the general election campaign.
The hashtag #villagate trended on Twitter for a while as users seized the opportunity to mock the prime minister, who blamed "brain fade".
Winner - Miliband
US rapper Jay Z might not be the most vocal or knowledgeable Arsenal supporter, but he has been spotted at the Emirates.
In an interview with the club's magazine in 2010 he praised their "beautiful football" and said he fell in love with the club after watching Thierry Henry play for the team about 10 years ago.
The 21-time Grammy award winner is part owner of the Brooklyn Jets basketball team and has been linked with a stake in Arsenal in the past.
Mr Beyonce is also about as A-list as they come, with about 100 million record sales to his name.
Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward were all brought up around the Aston area of Birmingham.
Formed in 1968, the band became pioneers of heavy metal, thanks to tracks such as as Paranoid and Master of Reality.
They have sold more than 70 million records worldwide and won two Grammy Awards. In 2006 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Geezer Butler seizing the opportunity to shout "Up the Villa" as they left the stage.
Butler has been spotted at a few Villa games and proudly sports a club shirt on his website.
Sabbath lag well behind in the Twitter stakes, however, with 992,000 followers, compared with Jay Z's more than three million.
Winner - Black Sabbath
Former S Club 7 singer and solo artist Rachel Stevens lines up on Arsenal's side.
The band sold 14 million records and had four UK number ones before breaking up in 2003. They reunited for last year's BBC Children in Need.
Arsenal have previously described her as a "devoted" fan but she rarely mentions the club to her almost 90,000 Twitter followers.
Model and TV presenter Emma Willis, meanwhile, is best known for fronting Big Brother and The Voice.
Born in Birmingham, she is a long-time Villa fan who once modelled a club shirt while trying to break into the fashion industry.
As a youngster, the club said she was regularly to be seen in the Holte End at Villa Park.
Today she lives in London and boasts more than one million followers on Twitter.
Winner - Willis
Double Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah, who grew up in London, has spoken of how he wanted to join the club when he was a boy.
His first athletics coach Alan Watkinson once described having to bribe a 13-year-old Farah with an Arsenal shirt to persuade him to run a cross country event.
Regularly attending matches at the Emirates stadium, the team's performance is often the focus of his Twitter updates.
England and Warwickshire batsman Ian Bell, meanwhile, has won three Ashes series and was named an MBE for his part in the 2005 series.
Born near Coventry and a life-long Villa fan, he drew praise even as a teenager and is often cited by experts and fans alike as one of England's most stylish players.
He has gone on to score more than 7,000 test runs for England.
Winner - Farah
Writers Nick Hornby and Benjamin Zephaniah have widely proclaimed their love for their respective clubs.
Hornby came to fame with his autobiographical novel Fever Pitch which described his love for Arsenal and helped make football fashionable again in the 1990s.
Since then he has gone on to sell millions of books across the world. Many of them, including Fever Pitch, High Fidelity and About a Boy, have been turned into films.
On his website he claims to have been educated at Highbury, studying "Football/Facts of Life".
Author, poet and life-long Villa fan Zephaniah wrote a poem in praise of the "claret and blue" for their FA Cup quarter final against local rivals West Bromwich Albion.
Born in Handsworth, Birmingham, he said football was a key part of community life but that there had been little to celebrate in recent years.
A regular at Villa Park and, like Hornby, sometimes spotted in club colours, Zephaniah cannot match his rival in sales.
However, he could name Nelson Mandela among his fans and boasts 14,000 followers on Twitter, to Hornby's 7,000.
Winner - Hornby
