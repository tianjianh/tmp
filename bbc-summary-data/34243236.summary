[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn takes big risk with McDonnell appointment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn said he would unite the party. Two days in he has two big problems - a lack of women in the top jobs, having promised a new equality, but a bigger one perhaps, his choice as shadow chancellor.  The appointment of John McDonnell is a risk, a big risk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
I understand that Jeremy Corbyn was warned by members of his own camp not to give the crucial role of shadow chancellor to his close friend and campaign manager, John McDonnell.
There were concerns over how his appointment would appear and the impact it would have on the rest of the shadow team.
He was also warned by at least one senior figure outside his campaign circle not to give him the job, the perception being that giving McDonnell the position would be a "declaration of war" on the rest of the Parliamentary Labour Party. And McDonnell's position was a factor in other MPs' decisions on whether to take a job.
Corbyn's team are going to have to defend some of Mr McDonnell's more controversial positions - and they'll do that perhaps without widespread support from MPs. Some MPs are aghast - one told the BBC "it is a disgrace  - there's only one thing worse than being ignored in politics and that's being laughed at".
So Corbyn begins with a problem on his pick for the economy, that crucial area where Labour has struggled to build credibility.
Another senior MP said, "the idea of having three men at the top of the party is ridiculous - we are the Labour Party, this isn't what we are about".
Two days in Jeremy Corbyn has a significant problem he was warned to avoid, one of his own making. The size of his victory is an insurance policy - but my goodness, he's going to need it.
