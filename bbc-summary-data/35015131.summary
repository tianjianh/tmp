Gary Scott, known as GJ, 17, was found in Marquis Road, Finsbury Park, at about 23:00 GMT on Tuesday.
His mother, Annette Gill from Tottenham, described him as a "good boy" and said he had been studying mechanics at college.
Adrian Carpenter, 30, and Jermaine Reid, 27, both of Victoria Road, Crouch Hill are due to appear at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court later.
In an emotional tribute earlier this week, Gary's aunt, Melissa, said: "He'll be missed by all of us. GJ was such a lovely kid. He didn't give us any trouble."
He is the 15th teenager to be fatally stabbed in London this year.
