Rachel's Dairy said it was consulting on potential redundancies and reduced hours at its factory in Aberystwyth.
The company said it was doing "everything in our power to minimise the impact on Rachel's consumers and employees".
It is not known how many of its 92 staff could go.
The company's website says it is the largest private sector employer in Aberystwyth, employing staff in roles from production and distribution to sales and food technology.
A Tesco spokesperson said: "We always listen to what our customers want and regularly review the products we offer to ensure we have the best value and range possible.
"Rachel's Dairy products will still be available in some stores in Wales"
