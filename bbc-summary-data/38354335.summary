Forfar are seven points clear of Arbroath, who move above Elgin City by beating them 3-2.
Edinburgh City extended their unbeaten league run to seven matches with a 0-0 draw at Clyde's Broadwood Stadium.
Montrose won 2-1 away to Berwick Rangers, while Stirling Albion beat Annan Athletic to move off bottom spot.
Fraser Mullen's free-kick gave Cowden the lead against Forfar, but Lewis Milne headed the visitors level.
Swankie's first strike of the day temporarily gave his side the lead, only for Mullen to convert another free-kick.
Kris Renton's strike put the hosts back in front, Josh Peters fired Forfar level again and Swankie's left-foot shot in stoppage time settled the match.
There was also late drama at Gayfield, where Elgin moved into a two-goal lead through strikes by Brian Cameron and Chris McLeish.
Bryan Prunty headed Arbroath back into the match and then set up Steven Doris to equalise.
The hosts had on-loan Dundee United defender Jassem Sukar sent off for a second booking and Elgin's Thomas Reilly suffered the same fate.
There was a further twist in the tale as Keiran Stewart fouled Colin Hamilton and Doris converted the resulting penalty.
It was an early spot-kick that gave Annan the lead at Forthbank Stadium, Max Wright scoring after Ross Smith had impeded Aidan Smith.
Darren Lee Smith's strike and Ross McMillan's header turned the match in Stirling's favour in the first half and Dylan Nguene Bikey fired Albion's clinching goal 15 minutes from the end.
Ryan Ferguson and substitute Jonny Court netted either side of Michael McKenna's leveller as Montrose claimed their second consecutive win over Berwick, with all three goals coming in the second half.
