Roma concede late as Leverkusen draw Champions League thriller

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roma threw away a two-goal lead late on to draw a thriller with Bayer Leverkusen and leave themselves bottom of Champions League Group E.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Javier Hernandez scored twice for Leverkusen but two Daniele De Rossi strikes before half-time made it 2-2.
Miralem Pjanic placed a low free-kick to give the Italians the lead, before Iago Falque converted for 4-2.
But Kevin Kampl curled in from range and with four minutes to spare, Admir Mehmedi tapped in a dramatic leveller.
The German side could have won it when Hernandez fired narrowly wide at the end. They sit second in the group on four points, three adrift of leaders Barcelona, who beat BATE Borisov 2-0.
Their coach Roger Schmidt said "this was far from a normal football game", while sporting director Rudi Voller admitted his side "lost the plot" after Roma had scored their first.
Roma - who are without an away win in the Champions League since 2010 - are now bottom of the group and will realistically need to beat Leverkusen in the Italian capital on 4 November to stand a chance of reaching the last-16.
