Joe Reilly, 43, a father of one, was shot twice in the chest at Glenwood Court, Poleglass, earlier this month.
Two other people in the house at the time were told to lie on the kitchen floor while the shooting took place.
Police spoke after revisiting the scene as part of a reconstruction to encourage witnesses to come forward.
Det Ch Insp Peter Montgomery urged people to "remember there is a handgun out there which may be used to inflict another death".
He said that a number of witnesses had come forward since the shooting but that police "need the community... to provide us with information so that we can progress our investigation".
"A line of enquiry I'm following is in relation to drugs and I believe this murder has been carried out by a paramilitary organisation," said Det Ch Insp Peter Montgomery.
"At this stage it's too early to say which organisation and I need the public to come forward to help me identify what organisation I should be concentrating on and who are the gunmen involved."
He said that police have a "clearer picture of where the killers went after the murder" and know "the type of clothing the killers were wearing".
"Both were wearing half-zip hooded sports tops and skin-tight jogging bottoms.
"Both had their faces covered and at least one had a Celtic scarf up over his face and was wearing dark-rimmed glasses."
He added: "As members of a civilised society, we owe it to ourselves, to each other and to victims like Joe Reilly and his family to put those responsible for his death before the courts."
