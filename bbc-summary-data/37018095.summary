[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 0-1 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter City are still searching for their first point of the season as Crawley Town completed the ultimate smash-and-grab at St James' Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side dominated the first half and went in at the break wondering how they had not gone in front.
Ollie Watkins hit the crossbar with a spectacular overhead kick, while Liam McAlinden spurned the chance to head Exeter in front when he missed a header from Robbie Simpson's header back across goal.
Jason Banton was Crawley's most dangerous player and he curled a shot wide from 20 yards at the beginning of the second half.
Exeter's best chance fell to Watkins after 68 minutes when a partially-cleared cross fell at his feet, but he rushed his finish and screwed his shot high over the bar.
Exeter were beginning to run out of ideas and Crawley hit them on the break with the only goal of the game with six minutes remaining.
Poor defending allowed Josh Yorwerth to walk through the Exeter defence and plant a low shot into the bottom corner from 15 yards.
Lloyd James curled a free-kick over the bar in stoppage time, but that was Exeter's only real effort at goal after Yorwerth's strike.
