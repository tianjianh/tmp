Dornoch Area Community Interest Company has organised the festival.
Chairwoman Jenifer Cameron said: "The tourism sector is immensely challenging so we are working hard to show all we have to offer in Dornoch as well as in the surrounding areas.
"We have a tremendous richness of whisky production in this area and we are working with our neighbouring distilleries to celebrate it.
"Our whisky festival will be a real highlight of the year and we're sure will become a popular annual event."
