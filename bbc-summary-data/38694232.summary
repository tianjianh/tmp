R's boss Ian Holloway gave the 20-year-old Irishman his first-team debut at Wolves on 31 December, and he has started two of their last three games.
"It's been an unbelievable couple of weeks for me," Manning said.
"It's been a whirlwind but I've enjoyed every minute and now the contract is sorted, I'm hoping I can kick on."
