Robot lifeguard EMILY starts work at Shell Island

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A robot lifeguard is to go into service off the Gwynedd coast to help if someone gets into difficulty in the sea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The remote controlled device can be deployed from the shore to provide a buoyancy aid until rescuers arrive.
Known as E.M.I.L.Y (Emergency Integrated Lifesaving Lanyard), it will be used by campsite staff on Shell Island from Thursday.
Workers have rescued three adults and three children in incidents this year.
Boss Richard Workman, who has had training to use the device, said such incidents put rescuers in danger as well as the person in difficulty so he wanted to find a way to reduce risks to all concerned.
"It can provide buoyancy until helps arrives," said Mr Workman.
The equipment has been used in the USA for several years.
Mr Workman said it could be deployed while waiting for crews from nearby RNLI lifeboat stations at Barmouth and Criccieth to arrive at an incident.
He said the device, which cost Â£8,000, has a speed of 20mph (32km) so it could reach someone 200m (656ft) off shore in seconds.
"If we can show the potential then there may be more [put into use] in the UK," he said.
