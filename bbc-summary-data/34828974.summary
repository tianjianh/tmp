Robertson, invited to the tournament after winning the Gdynia Open earlier this year, made a break of 114 on the way to opening up a 6-3 lead.
Northern Irishman Allen struck a 112 in the final session, but Robertson took the 14th and 15th frames for the title.
Ronnie O'Sullivan decided not to defend his title.
The Englishman will also miss snooker's second most prestigious event, the UK Championship, which starts on on 24 November in York.
"I played really well in the first session and the second was a little bit tighter," said Robertson, who took the Â£100,000 prize money. "I am very happy and it is the first major title I have picked up in over 12 months."
