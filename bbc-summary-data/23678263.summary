Massive sink hole destroys Florida hotel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than a hundred holiday makers had to be evacuated from a Florida hotel in the USA after a massive sinkhole opened up underneath it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was caused by limestone rock underneath buildings being eroded by water, making a big hole in the ground.
A third of the hotel fell into the hole, and more than a hundred holiday makers had to be taken to safety.
Millions of dollars of damage is caused by sinkholes in Florida every year.
