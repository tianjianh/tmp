[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evans took another step towards a possible world title shot in a scrappy fight that swung in favour of the champion in the later rounds.
Ormond was down twice at the end of the final round as two left hands to the body secured a 10-7 round for Evans.
The judges scored the contest 97-91, 99-89, 96-93 in favour of the Welshman.
Evans stated before the fight that he wants a shot at WBO lightweight champion Terry Flanagan and victory over Ormond will improve his WBO ranking of ninth.
