[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of people waiting more than a year to see a hospital consultant for the first time has increased.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rise applies to patients in Northern Ireland, according to a report by the Department of Health.
Ministerial targets aim for no longer than a nine-week wait for a first outpatient appointment.
But at the end of June 2016 more than 30,000 patients were waiting more than 52 weeks for their first appointment. That is 6% more than in June last year.
It also equated to more than 10% of all of those waiting for an appointment - some 225,593 patients.
The number of people waiting to be admitted to hospital as an inpatient has also increased.
More than 70,000 patients are on the list for inpatient care - 10,000 more than this time last year.
Of the people on the list for inpatient care, almost 7,000 had been waiting for more than a year.
The waiting times for medical tests or procedures has also gone up.
At the end of June more than 96,000 people were waiting for such a service.
