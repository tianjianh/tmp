'Ask for Angela' safety code word for dates scheme begins in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A code word campaign for people feeling unsafe on a date is being adopted in Aberdeen.

It allows people to subtly ask for help by going to the bar to 'Ask for Angela' - alerting staff that they need help.
A total of 25 Aberdeen venues are taking part in the campaign, with posters advertising the venture in participating establishments.
It was the brainchild of Lincolnshire County Council, and was endorsed by Hollywood star Ashton Kutcher.
It is now being rolled out, and is being introduced in Aberdeen this weekend, including venues such as Soul, Revolution and Espionage.
The Angela code aims to notify bar staff to situations where people may feel uncomfortable or unsafe, allowing them to step in.
Aberdeen City Council licensing board convener Marie Boulton said: "I am delighted that we have now launched the Ask for Angela campaign in Aberdeen.
"It has been hugely successful in Lincolnshire and well received from people across the UK and worldwide."
Hayley Child, who works as the sexual violence and abuse strategy co-ordinator for Lincolnshire and came up with the idea, said: "Angela was a play on the word (guardian) Angel."
