Oxford-born Smith, 23, finished third in Australia after fellow Briton Cal Crutchlow crashed from second place on the final lap, as Valentino Rossi won.
"I didn't see that crash, so I didn't know which position I was," said Smith.
"I came across the line, saw 'third' or 'Smith' and I thought something was wrong with the screen."
Smith continued: "Then I started making some weird noises inside my helmet. It's a special, special moment for me."
"It was a strange race. I tried to push at the beginning but was far too aggressive.
"I had lots of big moments and nearly crashed three or four times in the opening two laps, so I had to take it down a peg or two."
Smith now lies eighth overall in the world standings, with two rounds to go - in Malaysia and Valencia - and has his sights set on improving that position.
"We've closed in on the top six in the Championship - that can be our target for the remaining two races," he said.
