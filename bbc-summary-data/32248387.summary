Writing on Instagram, the 47-year-old accused people involved in the film for having a lack of respect towards Shakur's legacy.
"Tupac was much more than a hip hop artist... He was a black man guided by his passions," Singleton wrote.
The Boyz n the Hood director has been replaced by Carl Franklin.
Shakur was one of the most popular hip hop artists of all time, selling millions of records around the world.
He also appeared in several films, including Poetic Justice directed by Singleton.
He died in September 1996 in Las Vegas after being shot four times by an unidentified assailant.
Singleton said he now planned to make his own rival film about Shakur.
"The reason I am not making this picture is because the people involved aren't really respectful of the legacy of Tupac Amaru Shakur," Singleton said.
"To Pac's real fans just know I am still planning a movie on Tupac.  It doesn't matter what they do mines (sic.) will be better... Of most importance was his love of black people and culture... Something the people involved in this movie know nothing about."
Shooting is expected to begin in August or September, according to Greg Mielcarz, a spokesman for producers Morgan Creek.
Mr Mielcarz told Variety that Singleton left the project over creative differences several months ago.
