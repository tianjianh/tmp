After the leadership result was announced, Mr Eastwood paid tribute to Dr McDonnell, who had led the party since 2011.
"Alasdair has stretched every fibre of his being for this party," he said.
"He is a man who has given the work of two lifetimes for the good of this party and the community he serves."
Mr Eastwood also pledged he would work together as a team with Mr McKinney.
Under his leadership, he added, the SDLP's "principal conversation" would be "about shaping this country for the next 20, 30 and more years".
Among his first tasks as leader will be to make key strategic decisions over continuing negotiations between Northern Ireland's main parties aimed at resolving the current political crisis at Stormont.
Dr McDonnell, the MP for South Belfast, told party delegates he had "given his all and a little bit more" during his time at the helm.
He added: 'I wish to offer Colum every best wish as he continues, I hope, to renew, regenerate and rebuild the party."
