Legia Warsaw 1-1 Dundalk (Agg: 3-1)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundalk's attempt to become the first Irish side to make the Champions League group stages fell just short as they lost 3-1 to Legia Warsaw on aggregate after a creditable 1-1 draw in Poland.

Robbie Benson lit up an uneventful first half with a stunning sweetly-struck right-foot volley into the top corner from the edge of the area.
The hosts had Adam Hlousek sent-off for a second yellow card on 67 minutes.
Michal Kucharczyk equalised with a composed solo effort in added time.
Dundalk will go into the Europa League group stages, emulating the achievement of fellow League of Ireland side Shamrock Rovers in 2011. The draw will be made on Friday.
Legia Warsaw will await the outcome of the Champions League draw in Monaco on Thursday after becoming the first club from Poland to reach the group stages for 20 years.
The visitors, who secured a league and cup double in Ireland last season, had qualified for the qualifying play-off by defeating Belarusian champions Bate Borisov 3-1 in the previous round, aided by a memorable 3-0 second-leg victory.
Dundalk boasts a population of just 39,000 and the club went into the second leg of their tie at the Polish Army Stadium having already banked more than Â£4m for their European exploits, with more set to come as their European adventure continues.
Dundalk's chances of progression appeared to be slim after their 2-0 defeat at the hands of the Polish champions in Dublin last week, but Benson's magnificent first-half strike was just reward for Stephen Kenny's side's efforts in the opening half.
Benson had come into the side to replace suspended captain Stephen O'Donnell and his perfectly executed goal was his fourth of the season and his second in the competition.
Benson went close to grabbing a second in the 63rd minute but his overhead bicycle kick, after David McMillan headed into his path, flew over the bar.
Hlousek received his second booking four minutes later for hauling down Ronan Finn but Dundalk were unable to take advantage of the extra man.
Kucharczyk's thunderous late strike on the break extinguished the Irish side's hopes and exploited the gaps in their defence as they pushed forward in search of the goal that would have taken the game to extra-time.
