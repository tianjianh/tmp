More than 80,000 music fans are expected to attend the three-day festival over the weekend.
Scottish synthpop band Prides became the first band to perform at the festival's new home when they took to the main stage soon after the main arena opened to fans.
Other acts on the line-up include The Libertines, Kasabian and David Guetta.
The event was moved across Perthshire to Strathallan after concerns were raised about an oil pipeline running under the festival's long-time home at Balado.
After a lengthy planning battle, organisers DF Concerts won permission to host T in the Park at the estate for the next three summers.
Festival director Geoff Ellis said: "We're delighted with how everything is going so far.
"There's an incredible atmosphere onsite and Prides did Scotland proud with a brilliant opening performance on the main stage."
Organisers urged those heading to the festival over the weekend to plan their journey.
Mr Ellis added: "As it's a brand new site for everyone this year, we ask fans not to assume anything and to take the time to explore and get to know the campsite and the arena.
"We're starting with a blank canvas and we want everyone to respect our beautiful surroundings."
Police Scotland said 12 arrests had been made so far, with a total of 83 crimes recorded, including thefts from tents.
Supt Colin Brown said: "The vast majority of people have enjoyed themselves today and taken our advice and behaved responsibly.
"However, a small number have ignored that advice and have been dealt with. Our advice is simple: look after yourselves and your friends, behave and have a good time."
Selfie sticks, flagpoles and nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, have been  banned from the festival site.
Friday's acts at the festival also included Sam Smith, while Saturday sees Avicci, The Libertines and Twin Atlantic take to the stage.
On Sunday, the event will be closed by Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds after performances by Stereophonics and The Prodigy.
