Hearts winger Jamie Walker and Partick Thistle forward Ade Azeez have been cleared of diving after being booked last week.

A Scottish FA disciplinary tribunal upheld their clubs' appeals against their yellow cards.
Azeez had been cautioned after going down under a challenge by Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon during Thistle's 4-1 defeat on Friday.
Walker was booked after a collision with Rangers' Jason Holt on Saturday.
The Edinburgh side lost the Scottish Premiership game 2-0 at Ibrox.
Both players have now had their yellow cards rescinded.
Azeez had been booked by referee Craig Thomson 10 minutes from the end of the Glasgow derby with his side trailing 3-1.
John Beaton cautioned Walker, who was substituted by Hearts early in the second half, four minutes before half-time with the visitors 1-0 behind.
Earlier this season, Walker had been retrospectively banned for two matches for simulation after Beaton awarded Hearts a penalty in their 2-1 defeat by Celtic in August.
