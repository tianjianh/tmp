The Scotland international, 34, was pursued by Aberdeen this summer and offered a new one-year deal by Hull, where he played 14 games last season.
However, a potential move to Pittodrie was derailed when the player flagged up hernia trouble.
Maloney, who had two previous spells at Celtic, will be a development coach with the Scottish champions' under-20s.
He made 215 appearances for Celtic, scoring 52 goals, winning five league titles, five Scottish Cups and three League Cups.
Capped 47 times for Scotland, Maloney also featured for Aston Villa, Wigan and Chicago Fire.
"I think he'll bring a lot," said Celtic first-team coach John Kennedy. "He's decided himself he wants to stop playing and move into the coaching side.
"The manager and the club had a chat with him and decided they were happy to bring him on board.
"He's a guy who brings a wealth of experience in terms of starting at the club as a young player and moving into the first team and being very successful.
"He's a model professional, a player our first team players will look up to, never mind our young players.
"When he does things he does things properly. He'll bring a lot to the table."
