Stevenage 0-1 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Molyneux eased Morecambe's relegation fears by scoring the only goal in a surprise 1-0 victory at play-off chasing Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Molyneux's goal midway through the second half helped the Shrimps end a nine-game run without a win and they remain eight points above the League Two drop zone with four games of the season remaining.
Stevenage came into the fixture having won their last eight home matches but it took half an hour for them to fashion a first attempt, with top scorer Matt Godden bending a shot past the far post before Luke Wilkinson bundled a good chance wide.
Morecambe then passed up a clear opening just before half-time, as Aaron Wildig went through one-on-one only for Chris Day to stand strong in making the save.
The hosts cranked up the pressure in the second half, with Godden's shot on the turn being tipped over by Danijel Nizic just after the hour mark.
But the visitors stunned their hosts in the 68th minute when Wildig played the ball left to Molyneux, who blasted a first-time shot past Day.
Morecambe's triumph moves them up to 17th in the table while Stevenage drop a place to sixth after a second defeat in a week, having been thrashed 4-0 by Colchester last Saturday.
