The event, which is open to amateurs and international champions, takes place on 22 August on Windermere.
It is run by the South Cumbria Rivers Trust (SCRT) to raise funds.
Entrants in one of four categories must make a stone skip on the surface of the water at least three times, with the winner making the longest throw.
Entry costs Â£3 for adults, Â£1 for a child and Â£10 for a team of up to four people.
Competitors get three stones, from a selection provided by the organisers, and skims must stay within lanes laid out in the water.
Julius Barratt, of SCRT, said: "We hope to encourage as many people as possible to enter, so that we can raise lots of money for river conservation, so that both local residents and visitors can enjoy the leisure activities and scenic beauty that they provide."
