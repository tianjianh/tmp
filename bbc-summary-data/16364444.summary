Glynis Breakwell has written more than 20 books as a social psychologist and joined the university in 2001.
In September, Bath was named as university of the year by the Sunday Times newspaper.
"I want to share this recognition with everyone who has made it possible and to thank them," she said.
Lord Tugendhat, university chancellor, said: "Professor Breakwell richly deserves this honour."
He added her "energy and determination" helped the university become successful over the past 10 years.
Peter Troughton, chair of the university's council, added "Her confident leadership has had a profound effect on the performance of the university academically and financially."
Elsewhere in Somerset, the co-founder of Yeo Valley Organics, Mary Mead, has been appointed an OBE for services to sustainable dairy farming.
Giles Clarke, the chair of the England and Wales Cricket board, who lives in Wrington, will become a CBE.
