[SN]TITLE[SN]
Maidstone United 0-2 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Johnson's brace was enough for Gateshead to clinch a 2-0 win over Maidstone at Gallagher Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Heed struggled early on, with Anthony Acheampong and Kevin Lokko both going close as the hosts started with purpose.
Johnson had Gateshead's only real shot on goal during this period, hitting a post from George Smith's 12th-minute cross, but he went one better just before the break by successfully nodding home Manny Smith's flick-on from close range.
Johnson's second of the afternoon after 70 minutes gave the visitors the breathing room they deserved and Maidstone have now lost four on the trot.
