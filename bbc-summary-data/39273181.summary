[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sports Direct slavery brothers subject to new restrictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two brothers jailed for modern slavery offences have been made the subject of a new court order in a bid to further protect their victims.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Erwin and Krystian Markowski, from Nottingham, recruited men from Poland to work at a Sports Direct warehouse.
Under the rules of the directive, the pair will have to disclose their bank details to police and are forbidden from carrying more than £500 in cash.
The order, granted earlier this month, will run for 10 years.
The brothers, who were jailed for six years in January, will no longer be able to contact their previous victims for the duration of the 10-year order.
Nottinghamshire Police said it was the first time it had applied for a Slavery and Trafficking Prevention Order, under the Modern Slavery Act.
If the brothers breach any of these restrictions they could be given a further prison term of up to five years.

Erwin, 38, of Cedar Road, and Krystian, 35, of Harcourt Road, Nottingham, brought the men from Poland to work at Sports Direct's warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.
A court heard earlier this year how they controlled their victims' bank accounts and kept most of their wages, totalling £35,000, between 2015 and 2016.
The brothers were also given a two-and-a-half year sentence for fraud to run at the same time as the six years.
