[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England women began their World Twenty20 campaign with a routine 36-run victory over Bangladesh in Bangalore.

England, champions in 2009 and runners-up in the past two tournaments, were taken to their total of 153-7 by 60 from captain Charlotte Edwards.
Bangladesh, who have only won five of the 29 T20 matches they have played, never threatened the target.
Katherine Brunt conceded 17 runs from her four overs and Anya Shrubsole took 2-27 as Bangladesh closed on 117-6.
Tougher tests lie ahead for England, starting with hosts India in Dharamsala on Tuesday.
Here, led by Edwards, the highest runscorer in T20 internationals - men or women - they professionally dealt with mediocre opposition.
The captain mixed accumulation and powerfully dealing with the bad ball, guiding England through a potentially difficult moment when they lost Sarah Taylor and Heather Knight for the addition of only one run.
At 71-3, she was joined by Nat Sciver, who made 27 out of a partnership of 47, while Danni Wyatt and Brunt added late power as England took 35 from the final three overs.
The chase was always likely to be too much for Bangladesh, a team who had never previously made more than 115 in a T20 international.
Opener Sharmin Akhter was bowled by the impressive Brunt in the first over of the reply and, from there, England were always in control.
Nigar Sultana and Salma Khatun did add a Bangladesh record 64 for the fifth wicket, but the match was already over as a contest.
England coach Mark Robinson told Sky Sports: "I thought we went backwards today. We were safe and we don't want to be safe. We lost our way in the middle with the bat and made poor decisions with the ball. Maybe that's a good thing, because it leaves a bit in the tank.
"We weren't bad. Six out of 10. We're going in the right direction, but today we didn't quite get to the heights.
"That's not how we said we are going to play. In the middle of the innings, you can't settle for six an over. We're better than that."
England captain Charlotte Edwards: "It's always nice to start with runs, but the win was the most important thing. It was a good total, there's a bit of work we can do on our bowling and fielding but we're pretty pleased.
"Bangladesh played really well towards the end, and we've got a big game next against India. The new coaches have challenged us to express ourselves, there's still a lot to come from us as a team."
Ex-England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on BBC Test Match Special: "I'd like to have seen more from the middle order, where there was a little bit of a flutter of wickets. That will be punished by Australia or India.
"We've talked about the reliance on Edwards and Taylor, and I'd like to see a big score coming from Heather Knight as this tournament flows, because she is the next generation."
