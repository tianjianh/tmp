Five minutes from time, substitute Ade Azeez added a second, tapping in from George Francomb's cross.
Mathew Stevens pulled one back for the Bees from close range, but Neal Ardley's side held on for the points.

"I don't think we really played as well as what we can do and as well as we have done here.
"This place has been a fantastic home for us, and I don't say it very often, I thought today they were better than us in far too many areas."
"We're used to this. We know how to play against the wind and the rain and it's very, very difficult to play here."
AFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley told BBC Radio London:

"First half against the wind was always going to be about making sure we stayed strong.
"We played well, we defended well for most parts and it's a great away win.
"Let's just enjoy it, keep going and enjoy trying to chalk these points up on the board.
"If we don't, we're going to have had a good season anyway."
