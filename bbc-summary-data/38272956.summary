[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron nearly took the lead when Russell Penn headed Manny Parry's effort off the line.
It was one of the few highlights of the first half, and affairs did not spring to life until the hour mark.
Jack Midson broke the deadlock for Braintree with a firm header from Reece Hall-Johnson's cross.
James Bolton's close-range header was fielded by Sam Beasant as the Tynesiders pushed for an equaliser.
McLaughlin eventually provided it five minutes from time, and Gateshead could even have won it a minute later when Jordan Burrow fired wide when in on goal.
