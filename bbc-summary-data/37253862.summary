Officers in a marked patrol car spotted the dark vehicle driving erratically along Philip Lane in Haringey at about 21:45 BST on Thursday.
When they followed and tried to stop the car it sped off, striking the man. He remains in hospital with non life-threatening injuries.
It is the second crash involving a Met police pursuit in a week.
Police are still hunting the driver of the vehicle involved in the incident in Haringey. One witness said the injured man was a local bus driver.
The Met said the Directorate of Professional Standards had been informed and that officers from its Serious Collision Investigation Unit were dealing with the incident.
Officers appealed for information and said efforts continue to trace the driver.
In a separate incident on Wednesday, aspiring 10-year-old actor Makayah McDermott and Rozanne Cooper died after a car pursued by police crashed into them in Penge, south-east London.
The pair were run over as they walked along Lennard Road, along with Makayah's twin older sisters Niyah and Yahla, who were trapped under the car and managed to crawl out when bystanders lifted it off them.
Another eight-year-old family member was also injured, but she and the twin girls have since been released from hospital.
