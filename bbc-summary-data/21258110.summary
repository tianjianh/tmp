The show, which stars Matthew Macfadyen as Inspector Edmund Reid, has attracted an average audience of 7.1 million.
Ripper Street, which has been widely praised for its authentic portrayal of Victorian London, will return for an eight-part run in 2014.
The show has earned a 22.9% audience share in its Sunday evening slot.
Ripper Street has not been without controversy, with its first episode attracting more than 90 complaints from viewers concerned about its graphic sex and violence.
"Quality and ambition run through Ripper Street, from Richard Warlow's original scripts, the incredible cast and the captivating direction," said Ben Stephenson, controller of BBC Drama Commissioning.
"All combine to create a period series with a modern and gripping edge."
"I am enormously grateful to have been given the opportunity to return to 'H' Division once more," said Warlow.
The writer said he would be "working tirelessly to ensure that those who have joined us each week will find ever more compelling crime-fighting thrills down on Ripper Street the second time around".
Ripper Street is made by Tiger Aspect Productions and Lookout Point in association with BBC America.
The show has become the US cable channel's second most successful drama after Doctor Who.
