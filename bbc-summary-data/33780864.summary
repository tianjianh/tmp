Edin Dzeko: Roma agree £14m fee for Manchester City striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko is poised to join Serie A side Roma after the clubs agreed a £14m fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old Bosnia-Hercegovina international joined City from Wolfsburg in January 2011 for £27m.
He signed a new four-year contract at Etihad Stadium last summer.
However, manager Manuel Pellegrini recently admitted Dzeko was likely to leave following the £49m capture of Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling.
Dzeko was City's leading scorer with 15 goals in 2012-13 and hit 26 more in all competitions as they won the Premier League the following season, but he managed only six goals in 32 appearances last season.
