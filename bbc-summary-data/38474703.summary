Stourbridge were the lowest-ranked side left in the competition.
And after Sam Wood's scrappy opener for the hosts, Dan Scarr turned home a second-half free-kick which looked to have earned Stourbridge a replay.
But striker Akinfenwa headed in a left-wing cross with seven minutes remaining to knock out the Glassboys.
Stourbridge, who had knocked out League One Northampton to reach the third round for the first time, more than held their own for long spells against a side three divisions above them.
Wood hooked in Wycombe's first from close range, before the non-league club levelled through Scarr with 20 minutes remaining.
But Akinfenwa nodded in the winner, which sent Wanderers through to round four for the first time since 2001, when they went on to reach the semi-finals.
Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio: "Fair play to Stourbridge, they were the better team in spells. What they gave us today was a real full-blooded cup tie.
"Either club being in the fourth round is a fairytale. Don't dismiss how big Wycombe Wanderers in the fourth round is.
"I'm really proud. We didn't play as good as we have done but we got through which was all we wanted to do."
Stourbridge manager Gary Hackett told BBC WM 95.6: "When you've been at a club for so long and you see that amazing support, it was a bit emotional. There's nothing wrong with that, I don't think.
"I didn't expect it (to be asked to address the supporters at full-time) and sometimes you don't know what you're saying in circumstances like that, but I wanted to say a big thank you from everybody connected with the football club for the support we've had today.
"Of course it (the cup run) will make a difference. Financially, it will put the club in a very strong position, and I think people will remember this day for a long, long time - albeit in defeat."
