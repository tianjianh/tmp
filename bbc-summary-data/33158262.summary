[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff-based online beauty products company is creating 100 new jobs following an expansion.

Escentual.com, started by Rakesh Aggarwal in 2000 in his parents' garage, has moved to a new operations centre at Ocean Park.
The move was backed by the Welsh government to ensure the expansion stayed in Wales.
The jobs will be created over the next two years and a further 20 will be safeguarded.
