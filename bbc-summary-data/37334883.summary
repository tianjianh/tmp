PMI Index: Weak sterling boosts NI exports and border shops

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's private sector grew in August as the weakening of sterling boosted exports and cross-border shopping, a survey has suggested.

The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is a monthly survey of a panel of firms, tracking indicators such as new orders, employment and exports.
It had shown a fall in activity in July, the first month after the Brexit vote, but has now bounced back.
The survey also points to accelerating inflationary pressures.
This is due to increased import prices because of the fall in value of sterling.
The PMI is produced by Ulster Bank and its chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said that while the headline shows a return to growth there are also "notable weaknesses.'
He said "the two growing concerns are the surge in inflationary pressures and stagnation within the local services sector."
The services sector is the dominant part of Northern Ireland's economy.
The survey showed it had its first fall in employment levels in 39 months and also experienced a drop in new orders.
Mr Ramsey said the full effect of growing inflationary pressure will depend in part on firms' ability and appetite to absorb higher import costs.
But he warned consumers: "Price rises and a squeeze on disposable incomes is already in the pipeline.
"This will hit consumer spending and economic growth in the months ahead."
