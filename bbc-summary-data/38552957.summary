Ice Hockey: Mixed results for Edinburgh Capitals against rivals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh Capitals captain Jacob Johnston was delighted as his team ended their losing run of games - but was then left to rue another defeat.

The Caps ended a seven-game winless run with a 3-2 home victory over Dundee Stars on Saturday before going down 6-0 on Tayside in Sunday's rematch.
And it left Johnston bittersweet after a weekend that promised so much on the back of their success in Murrayfield.
"Saturday's win felt really good," Johnston said. "We've had some downs and battled adversity in the last few weeks so it was great to break that losing run.
"We were really looking for those points on Sunday and we didn't get them.  It was a good opportunity to make it a four-point weekend as they're close to us in the standings.
"We looked at it that way, but every game we go in, we have to be expecting a win.  We can't expect to beat certain teams and we have to starting getting victories if we want to start climbing."
The mixed weekend left the Caps still three points adrift of second bottom Dundee after the two games, but they do have two games in hand over Marc LeFebvre's side.
That losing run, which consisted of them conceding an eye-watering 47 goals, came to an end as they beat the Stars 3-2 at Murrayfield on Saturday.
Ian Schultz and Matt Tipoff scored to bookend the first period as Edinburgh started the game in the best possible way, with Mason Wilgosh adding a third early in the second period.
Stars hit back through Matt White and Kevin Bruijsten, but couldn't find an equaliser to extend their poor run of form to 13 losses in their last 14 games.
The game went back to Tayside on Sunday as Dundee hosted, but the Stars snapped their own run of seven straight defeats with a 6-0 shutout win over Michal Dobron's side.
Dundee went four up during the second period when Mikael Lidhammar, Brett Switzer and two from Matt White put them in a comfortable position.
Two more from Justin Faryna in the third supplemented what turned out to be a good night for the Stars in the end.
Fife Flyers picked up two excellent points on the road at Manchester Storm on Saturday to begin their double header, winning 4-2 in a game that was goalless for the first 35 minutes.
Ryan Dingle eventually broke the deadlock before Taylor Dickin levelled as both teams went in after two periods, locked at 1-1.
Dingle restored the lead then Sebastien Thinel extended it before Matt Bissonnette pulled one back for the home team.  Flyers debutant Bryan Cameron added a fourth to take the win.
In Sunday's return game in Kirkcaldy, they made it two wins from two and four points with a 3-1 win on home ice.
Paul Phillips put the visitors in front late on in the first period, but the Flyers turned things around as Brendan Brooks and Dingle each scored, with Justin Fox adding a late empty net goal.
Braehead Clan started their weekend at in-form Nottingham Panthers and although they missed five players, they still took a point in a 4-3 overtime loss.
Lee Baldwin opened the scoring for the Clan, but Panthers turned the game around through Brian McGrattan and Matt Carter before Mike Hammond levelled for the Glasgow men.
Jeff Brown and Alex Leavitt traded goals for either team, taking the game into the extra period where Robert Farmer sealed victory with the overtime goal.
Clan returned to Glasgow to host league leaders Cardiff Devils and despite more heroics from the depleted team, finished with a penalty shots loss after a 2-2 draw.
Daniel Åhsberg's opener was cancelled out by Joey Hadded, before Bari McKenzie put Braehead in front in the second period, which was equalised through Andrew Hotham.
The Devils held out on penalty shots with their goalie Ben Bowns saving Åhsberg's crucial effort to secure the points for the Welsh side.
