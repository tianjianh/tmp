Murray, 29, secured victory over fifth seed Ferrer in one hour, 30 minutes.
The British number one seed was dominant throughout and will face Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov in Sunday's final.
Earlier, British number one Johanna Konta reached the women's final and broke into the world top 10.
Murray has reached nine finals in 2016, but it is the first time he has made it through to the China Open final.
The Scot was a break down in the opening set before coming back to win the next five games.
Ferrer had lost his previous six encounters with Murray and there was no coming back after the Scot went 4-2 up.
The double Olympic champion then took a 3-1 lead in the second set, and despite losing his serve he came back to clinch a place in the final.
Dimitrov took the other final spot after his semi-final opponent, Milos Raonic, was forced to withdraw with an ankle injury.
