The 33-year-old suffered several broken bones after suffering an accident while leading the Dundrod 150 Superbike race in August.
The TT racer and television personality, who has returned to work as a truck fitter, is now recovering.
"I still want to race, but I'm not going to rush into deciding what or where I'm going to race," Martin said.
"Having a few days off work gave me time to think about what I want to do, and realise all the things that have had to go on hold."

Martin says he does not remember anything about the crash at Dundrod on 6 August.
He lost control of his Tyco BMW at Ireland's Corner on the circuit as he was leading the Superbike race by less than a second from Bruce Anstey.
"I headbutted the ground at 130mph, then skidded into a dirt field and catapulted off a few things," Martin added.
"The impact I hit the ground with was massive.
"I broke five vertebrae and they had to rod my spine because I broke my sternum too.  I broke five ribs and two metacarpals in right hand, too, and my hand's been plated.
"There's no better physio than working on trucks and I know when I'm doing too much, I'm not planning to do anything that puts the recovery back."
