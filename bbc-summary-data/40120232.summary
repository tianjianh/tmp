The 20-year-old joined the Cumbrians in March from Indian side Delhi Dynamos and made one substitute appearance.
He came through Premier League club West Brom's academy system.
"Samir is an excellent technical player and we now need to school him in what he needs to do when we are out of possession," said boss Keith Curle.
