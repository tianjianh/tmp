Firefighters were called to the flat, in the Renfrewshire town's Fairway Avenue, at about 16:05 on Monday.
They found a "well-established fire" and eight crew members in breathing apparatus entered the flat where the woman's body was discovered.
Police have appealed for information and said a joint investigation with the fire service would be carried out to establish the cause of the blaze.
Det Sgt Ian Ross said: "Our inquiries are at an early stage to gather more information on this fire, and a joint investigation will be carried out with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service to establish the cause of the fire.
"At this time, I would ask anyone with information that may assist our investigation to contact Paisley Police Office through the 101 number."
The fire service said crews from Paisley, Barrhead and Renfrew were sent to the scene.
