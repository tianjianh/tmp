[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hampshire flood defence scheme funding brought forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Central government funding has been brought forward for a number of flood defence schemes across Hampshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It includes the Buckskin area of Basingstoke, where more than 80 homes were evacuated in February 2014 after groundwater flooding.
Hampshire County Council can now access a Â£2.1m fund a year earlier than originally expected from 2016-17.
Schemes for Romsey and Winchester can now access funding immediately rather than having to wait until 2020.
Many residents in Buckskin were unable to return to their homes until the following winter after more than 77 million litres of water had to be pumped out.
An independent report recommended a review of the area's drainage system and the "setting up [of] a threshold at which point actions should be taken".
Hampshire County Council has already started the first phase of a feasibility study to mitigate flooding. The funding is subject to the approval of a business case.
Cleansing and repairs to the existing infrastructure in Buckskin has already started while an electricity substation has been moved.
