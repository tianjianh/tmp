Richards, 33, has scored 18 goals for the League Two leaders this term, but will be out for at least four weeks.
Marquis, 23, played for the Cobblers in 2013-2014, scoring in their final game against Oxford to avoid relegation.
"It's a very different situation. I want to help a team already doing really well get promoted," he said.
Marquis has made a total of 27 appearances this season, having had a loan spell at Leyton Orient, but only scored once.
He is out of contract at the end of the season, and continued to BBC Radio Northampton: "I went to Leyton Orient earlier in the season and played the majority of games in midfield, which obviously isn't my best position but at least I was playing there.
"I went back to Millwall and wasn't really playing, mainly because the two forwards are playing well; Steve Morison's the captain and Lee Gregory's already got 20 goals this season."
