[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
County Championship outsiders Lancashire kept their thin title hopes alive as they bowled out Division One bottom club Warwickshire for 200.

Ex-Zimbabwe paceman Kyle Jarvis took 6-67, well backed by South Africa's Ryan McLaren, all the wickets falling from the Statham End at Old Trafford.
It could have been worse for the Bears but for a ninth-wicket stand of 76 from Jeetan Patel (47) and Olly Stone (32).
Liam Livingstone then made an unbeaten 41 to help Lancashire close on 112-3.
With nightwatchman Stephen Parry seeing it through on 15 from 21 deliveries, the hosts still have Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Jos Buttler to come in the morning.
Lancashire, in second place at the start of play, were actually closer to the top flight's drop zone, 40 points clear of danger with five games left, but 41 points behind leaders Essex.
Warwickshire began the game 31 points adrift of safety, although boosted by their first Championship win of the summer in their last game, against Middlesex at Lord's three weeks ago.
Since then, former Lancashire boss Ashley Giles' Bears have shown their greater aptitude for the shorter form of the game by reaching T20 Blast finals day for the third time in four years.
But, although former Northants paceman Stone has so far had a decent first-class debut for his new county after his year out with a knee injury, it was pretty much a case of normal service being resumed for the Bears on their return to Championship duty,
From 89-3 at lunch, including the loss of both new Championship captain Jonathan Trott and his predecessor Ian Bell to McLaren (4-45), Warwickshire slumped from 89-3 to be bowled out for 200 by tea. All Jarvis's wickets came in the afternoon session, including a run of four in 24 balls.
Lancashire seamer Kyle Jarvis told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It came after a pretty shaky start this morning when I didn't bowl well at all. I had a few tough words at lunch time and then got six in the session.
"It was two sessions completely different. I bowled terribly and had no rhythm from the James Anderson End, which is where I normally bowl from.
"I decided to switch it around. It then came out really nicely. I've not got many wickets from this end in my four-year career here. That's just the way it goes."
Bears first-team coach Jim Troughton told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"We spoke to Ashley Giles - and he said there were times when they might have bowled first on these types of pitches because they are a little bit tacky.
"Batting first was the right option, especially with them going in with three seamers and two spinners. We'll have to see over the four days how it behaves if there's a lot of sun on it.
"They bowled well and in good areas, but we didn't have that skill to stem the bleeding. Jeetan did well and Olly. That was a good effort to get us to 200."
