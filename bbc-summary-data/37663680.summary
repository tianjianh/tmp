[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra 0-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Dolan's second-half strike clinched Yeovil's fifth win in seven league games as they won 1-0 at Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder's curling free-kick proved decisive after the Glovers came under the cosh in the first half at Gresty Road, where Crewe were sinking to their first home loss.
The Railwaymen were on top for large parts with Chris Dagnall driving an effort across goal and George Cooper heading over.
Keeper Artur Krysiak was Yeovil's hero, coming off his line swiftly to thwart Ryan Lowe twice in quick succession.
Yeovil's Tahvon Campbell could have made more of a loose back-pass by Ollie Turton but fired into the side netting.
The visiting goal led a charmed life at times with defender Jon Guthrie inches away from finding the far corner with a header and Dagnall's crashing 20-yard drive bouncing off the underside of the bar.
Yet Darren Way's side were more positive after the break and they took the lead in the 62nd minute when Dolan struck a free-kick from 30 yards into the bottom corner.
Dagnall was thwarted by the woodwork again when his header from sub Callum Ainley's cross looped onto the frame.
But Yeovil could have had another when sub Francois Zoko struck the post from Dolan's free-kick.
