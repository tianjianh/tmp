A new publication is offering a comprehensive guide to end of life care facilities across Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Atlas of Palliative Care has been compiled by academics based at the University of Glasgow's Crichton campus in Dumfries.
It includes maps, tables, lists and diagrams showing which services are available, at what level, and where.
The atlas contains previously-unavailable data on palliative care services across Scotland.
The team behind it is led by Prof David Clark of the Crichton-based End of Life Studies Group.
He said it would be a vital resource for policy-makers, decision-makers and "thought leaders" across Scotland.
The project was part-funded by the Scottish government.
A spokesperson said the atlas would support a range of work to fulfil a vision that, by 2021, everyone in Scotland who needed palliative care would have access to it.
