In March, the firm, which employs 7,000 people across four sites in Wales, revealed changes to its pension scheme which could see workers retire at 65 rather than 60.
The workers attended the event at the town's Princess Royal Theatre on Saturday.
Ballot papers are being sent out by unions over possible strike action.
Multi-unions chair, Alan Coombs, said: "I think it goes to show how concerned people are about their pensions and what it means to them...and their families.
"They make plans for the future, for mortgages, for children going to college, based around what their pension is going to deliver for them."
Tata Steel has said its pension scheme is facing a financial shortfall, mainly due to people living longer.
It has been consulting with workers about replacing it with a "more balanced solution".
The company has said it will "consider employees' views" before making a final decision.
Tata has sites in Port Talbot, Llanwern in Newport, Shotton in Flintshire and Trostre, Carmarthenshire.
