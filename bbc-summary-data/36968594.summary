Newcastle United have rejected two bids for Spanish forward Ayoze Perez this summer, says manager Rafael Benitez.

Perez, 23, joined the Magpies in 2014 from Benitez's former club Tenerife and scored six top-flight goals last term.
"This year we have received two offers (for Perez)," Benitez told BBC Newcastle. "We don't want to sell him.
"He has been working very hard during the summer, he is doing well. Directly, one coach was calling me, asking for him, with a good price to be fair."
Newcastle added Senegal midfielder Mohamed Diame and Republic of Ireland defender Ciaran Clark to their squad on Wednesday, after meeting release causes for both.
And Benitez says he would still like to add to his squad, with the Magpies' Championship campaign starting away to Fulham on Friday, 5 August.
"We are still looking for two or three players, if it is possible," he added. "We know that we need something, to give a little bit more balance."
The former Liverpool and Chelsea boss also spoke about speculation linking France midfielder Moussa Sissoko with a move away from Newcastle.
"We will try to do the best for us," said Benitez. "If he has to go because we have the right offer, fine.
"If he stays with us, fantastic. We are doing what we have to do to protect Newcastle United and to help Moussa Sissoko, the professional.
"If he goes because we have the right offer, it has to be good for the club too. Sometimes it is worse to keep players if they are not happy."
