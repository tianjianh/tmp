[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roma moved four points behind Serie A leaders Juventus after beating Lazio in a controversial Rome derby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Strootman dispossessed Lazio defender Wallace inside the area before firing his side ahead.
Unused Lazio substitute Danilo Cataldi was sent off moments later after pulling Strootman's shirt as the Roma player was celebrating his goal.
Radja Nainggolan sealed the points at the Stadio Olimpico after beating Federico Marchetti from 25 yards.
Roma move back up to second in the table after AC Milan had earlier leapfrogged them with a 2-1 win over Crotone.
There was no shortage of incident as Roma beat their city rivals for the fourth successive game in Serie A.
With the game goalless, Roma thought they had won a penalty when the referee pointed to the spot after Bruno Peres went down inside the area.
After a short delay the official changed his mind and awarded a free-kick just outside the area. Replays clearly showed the Brazilian defender had slipped.
The red card for Cataldi, who was warming up on the sidelines, came after he reacted to Strootman appearing to throw water in his face.
Lazio had the better chances in the first half, Ciro Immobile blazing two good opportunities over the bar.
Former Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko had a header from six yards brilliantly saved by Marchetti when the game was goalless.
Lazio are fifth in the table on 28 points, four behind Roma and eight behind Juventus, who beat Atalanta 3-1 on Saturday.
The derby was again played out in front of thousands of empty seats as a large number of Roma fans protested against security measures.
