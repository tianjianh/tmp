The 20-year-old is yet to feature for the Blues but had a brief spell on loan at Newport County last season.
"I know Mitch well from my time at Chelsea and he is a great addition," Reds head coach Dermot Drummy told the club website.
"He's got lots of experience at under-21 level but he needs to get Football League experience."
Beeney becomes Crawley's eighth new arrival of the summer transfer window.
