[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Back from the dead' Sam Ledward dies at 108

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 108-year-old man has died, 79 years after he was mistakenly declared dead following a motorcycle accident.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samuel Ledward, of Gwernaffield, near Mold, Flintshire, was in a coma so deep that doctors ordered his body be taken to the mortuary following the crash in 1936.
But the mistake was realised when he started moving.
Mr Ledward died on Tuesday in Blackpool, where he had moved a few months ago to be near his son.
His neighbour Sheila Smith said: "He was such a lovely man. Always dressed smart and so interesting."
Born and brought up in Cheshire, Mr Ledward and his late wife, Edith, lived in Blackpool.
When Mrs Ledward died in 1993, he moved to Gwernaffield to live with her cousin.
