Food waste "rescued" from supermarket skips and hospitals in Bristol is to be served up in migrant camps in Calais.

Skipchen, a not-for-profit cafe in Stokes Croft that cooks food that has been thrown away, is heading to the French port to set up a field kitchen.
The community chefs are hoping to provide about 800 meals a day for the estimated 2,000 people in the camp.
Skipchen's Katie Jarman said: "These people are in dire need of this food, so we're going to take what we can."
Thousands of migrants are currently living in makeshift camps on a site near the port of Calais - designated by the French government.
"Currently there's only 500 meals being served and it's estimated there are 2,000 people in the camp," said Ms Jarman.
"We're going to take as much food waste as we've found in the South West and we're going to travel through London and pick up some more food and go 'skipping' on the way."
The "campaign cafe", set up seven months ago by The Real Junk Food Project, plans to take two tonnes of unwanted food with them and run a mobile kitchen until the end of May.
"It's a very, very desperate situation," said Marianna Musay, co-director of the cafe.
"There's no toilets, no showers and only 600 people get fed one hot meal everyday.
"I think we have to be very emotionally prepared for what we're going to find."
