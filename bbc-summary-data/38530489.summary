Peterborough will take inspiration from Tottenham's victory over Chelsea when they visit the Premier League leaders in the FA Cup, says boss Grant McCann.

Spurs ended Chelsea's 13-match winning run and McCann said his League One side, known for attacking, will try to mirror their "front foot" football.
"We won't be changing for Chelsea. That may sound a bit arrogant, it's not, it's a cup game," said McCann.

"It's going to be tough, we all know that, but we've got nothing to lose."
He continued: "We're under no illusions we're playing against probably one of the best teams in Europe at the minute."
McCann has given his side, currently just outside the third-tier play-off places, some time off this week to "rest their minds and legs" after a busy Christmas period.
The former Northern Ireland international went to White Hart Lane on Wednesday to watch Tottenham defeat Chelsea 2-0 with a brace from midfielder Dele Alli to end the Blues' attempt to make Premier League history with a 14th successive victory.
McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "We want to get after them. Spurs played on the front foot, got after them and caused them problems
"That's what we want to do. We will have attacking players in our team and want to play on the front foot in their half.
"The higher up you play, the more time you get on the ball, but you've got to be good with it because they're so quick at breaking on you."
