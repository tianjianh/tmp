The 23-year-old tore a medial ligament in the Gulls' 2-0 loss at Tranmere.
The former Plymouth Argyle player missed much of last season after a similar injury in the other knee.
"It's another real blow for him. He took it as well as you'd expect and hopefully he'll see the positive, kick on and come back stronger," manager Kevin Nicholson told BBC Sport.
It is expected to take between four and six months for Young to recover from the injury, which may require surgery.
"Everyone knows what a good player he is and if it wasn't for his injuries, the chances are he wouldn't be with us because I think he would have kicked on higher," Nicholson added.
"I want him to go on and do good things in the game, so it hurts me for him.
"From a management point of view I've got to find a way around it, but I want Youngy to make sure he comes back fit and ready."
