The 32-year-old Dane spent the second half of last season on loan at the Lilywhites where he made 14 outings.
Lindegaard made 29 appearances for Manchester United over five years before his move to the Baggies.
"I'm really happy that things have fallen into place before we get closer to the season," he said.
"It was a very easy decision. I could have gone to several other clubs in England but it was a no brainer, I wanted to stay here."
