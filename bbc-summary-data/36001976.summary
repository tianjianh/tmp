Balotelli, 25, has scored three goals in 17 appearances this season for Milan, who sold him to the Reds for Â£16m in 2014.
"He has an immense desire to stay at the club. I hope he shows that with his performances," said Adriano Galliani.
"I've told him that based on what he's shown, he doesn't deserve to stay."
Italy international Balotelli is set to return to Liverpool after his loan spell ends in June.
"I told him to convince me that he should stay, as we want the best for him," added Galliani.
"He has promised me he will do that and I hope he does."
On Saturday sixth-placed Milan host Serie A leaders Juventus, who are six points clear of second-placed Napoli with seven games of the season remaining.
