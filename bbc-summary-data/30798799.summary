[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new management team has been credited with making improvements at an underperforming Dumfries school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
St Ninian's Primary School was rated weak in six out of eight performance categories by education inspectors in 2013.
The latest report by Education Scotland said progress has been made in raising standards in nursery and primary classes.
Inspectors said more time is needed to deliver further improvements.
Since the first report, a new head teacher has been recruited who has been credited with making a "very positive difference" to the school.
The report said staff had worked hard to improve literacy and numeracy skills and pupils' achievements are recognised and much more valued.
Inspectors said more time is needed to ensure the improvements are maintained.  A follow up visit will be made to the school within a year.
