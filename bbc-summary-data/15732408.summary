Stourbridge 2-0 Plymouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southern Premier side Stourbridge reached the FA Cup second round for the first time in their history with a shock replay win over 10-man Plymouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Argyle had Paul Bignot sent off in the first half for kicking out at Sean Evans, who had just fouled him.
Bricklayer Paul McCone scored the opener after the break, heading home Sean Gebbis's corner into the bottom corner from six yards out.
And Evans sealed it when he converted following Jake Cole's parry.
The scoreline did not flatter seventh-tier side Stourbridge, who were unlucky to need a replay following Onismor Bhasera's 88th-minute equaliser for Plymouth in the first game at Home Park.
And the West Midlands side's win over the Football League's basement club means they will host League One side Stevenage in the second round.
Goalscorer Paul McCone won the West Midlands final of the Guild of Bricklayers junior competition this year
Stourbridge played excellently throughout the game and could have taken a first-half lead when Evans' centre found Ryan Rowe and his shot was well saved by Cole.
And things were looking ominous for Plymouth when Bignot retaliated to Evans' foul, which sparked a melee.
The Glassboys continued to dominate and Ben Billingham saw his top corner-bound shot saved by Cole before the break.
They did not let up after half-time and McCone, who works by day for his father's company, headed them into a fully deserved lead.
Plymouth's chances were few and far between and Durrell Berry's weak effort which was easily saved by Lewis Solly summed up their evening.
Stourbridge, sensing they were on the verge of something special, should have had their second when Paul Lloyd's cross hit the bar and Leon Broadhurst's headed the rebound off the crossbar with keeper Cole beaten.
But they had their clinching goal when the lively Rowe saw his shot saved and Evans found the corner from the rebound.
Plymouth never looked like getting back into it and had Billingham's late shot crept in rather than flew wide, there could have been few complaints in Devon at the scoreline.
