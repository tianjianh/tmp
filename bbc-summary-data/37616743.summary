The Olympic athlete was born in the city and adopted by a couple from South Wales when he was six months old.
Until 2014 he did not know his birth parents, or that his father was Jamaican, which he said could explain his speed.
Now, 43, Jamie has taken his search back to Nottingham and been followed by cameras for a BBC documentary.
