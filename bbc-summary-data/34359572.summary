Supporters in the south stand tore down hoardings displaying Tottenham slogans.
Ten spectators were arrested at the League Cup tie for a range of offences, including criminal damage. The FA will leave the matter to the police.
"We don't want any violence. We are at the disposal of the authorities to help them to sort it out," said Wenger.
Arsenal won the match 2-1, through two goals by Mathieu Flamini, and will play Sheffield Wednesday in the next round.
