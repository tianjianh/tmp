Nobbs, 80 also wrote for The Two Ronnies, Ken Dodd and Frankie Howerd.
Cleese described the writer as a "lovely kind, gentle man with a delicious sense of humour".
Stephen Fry added: "Oh no! David Nobbs has died. I liked him very very much. Such a brilliant comic writer and such a kind, wise man."
Cleese said on Twitter: "Very sad today to hear of the death of David Nobbs. First worked with him on the Frost Report in 1966.
"He wrote many top-class shows and books. His masterwork: the Reggie Perrin shows."
The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, first broadcast in the 1970s, told the story of a man, played by Leonard Rossiter, desperate to escape his dull marriage, disappointing children and daily grind of his job.
Impressionist Rory Bremner tweeted: "Much more to the lovely David Nobbs than Reggie P. But what a brilliant creation that was! #mourning Reggie."
Doctor Who writer and Sherlock star Mark Gatiss paid tribute in a famous quote from the series: "'1,2,3,4 make 'em sweat outside the door, 5,6,7,8 always pays to make 'em wait - COME!' RIP David Nobbs."
The British Humanist Association's chief executive Andrew Copson said: "David Nobbs was a very special talent and we were all honoured to have worked with him over his years as a patron of the BHA."
Ricky Gervais, creator of The Office, also paid tribute to Nobbs, by borrowing a catchphrase from the character CJ, played by John Barron, who was Perrin's tyrannical boss.
He tweeted: "I didn't get where I am today by not knowing what a genius David Nobbs was. RIP."
And Little Britain star Matt Lucas wrote: "Reggie Perrin and A Bit Of A Do were masterpieces. David Nobbs leaves the world a richer place."
Author Irvine Welsh, who wrote the novel Trainspotting, said: "Very sad to hear of the death of inspirational David Nobbs, who I had quite a few laughs with.
"A comic genius and an excellent human being."
Nobbs also wrote more than 20 novels and his final work, The Second Life of Sally Mottram, was published last year.
