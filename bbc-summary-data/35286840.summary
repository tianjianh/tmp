Where are the proposed flood protection schemes?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has launched the country's first national flood risk management plan which includes 14 separate local strategies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They identify 42 flood protection schemes that have been proposed for action over the next five years at a total cost of Â£235m. Ministers said the plan would help protect up to 10,000 properties.
The following schemes have been prioritised by Sepa for Scottish government funding.
The proposed river flood protection scheme will address flood risk from the Brothock Water and include improvements to flood defences and the construction of two flood storage areas. Coastal flood protection works will be phased in by the council. The scheme will provide a 1 in 200 year standard of protection.
The scheme would consist of flood embankments and sheet piling to protect properties from the 1 in 50 year event.
The scheme will include new sea walls and set-back embankments, sand dune replenishment and rock armour. It will provide a 1 in 200 year (plus climate change) standard of protection.
This scheme would complete the Broxburn flood prevention scheme. It would consist of two flood storage basins in the catchment of the Liggat Syke and provide a 1 in 100 year standard of protection.
The scheme would consist of flood embankments and protect the Meadows car park and residential properties from the 1 in 50 year event.
The proposed work includes diversion of extreme flows and watercourse restoration to remove a substantial network constraint close to Biggar Street. The flood mapping for the Camlachie Burn should be revised to include all elements of the scheme to understand any remaining residual risk now and in the future.
Feasibility studies indicate that the scheme should include temporary storage of flood water on two burns plus a relief culvert in the town to a standard of 1 in 200 years. There have been a number of floods in Campbeltown in recent years including incidence of sewer flooding which the scheme should contribute to reducing. The detailed design should also include consideration of runoff reduction (woodland planting, land management techniques) and the creation of wetlands and ponds.
This scheme is undergoing detailed design work with a 1 in 200 year standard of protection, including an allowance for climate change. The scheme includes sections of embankments, sheet piled and concrete retaining walls, and rock armour revetments along the embankment to reduce wave overtopping and to protect against erosion.
This scheme would reduce the combined flood risk from the Water of Ruchill, River Earn and River Lednock. It would consist of flood defences and flood storage areas and provide a 1 in 100 year standard of protection.
It is recommended that the council progress work on the proposed flood protection scheme on the upper River Garnock.  The proposed scheme, consisting of storage and direct defences, would provide protection to properties in Dalry, Kilbirnie and Glengarnock from the River Garnock, Powgree Burn and Rye Water.
A flood protection scheme in the form of direct defences is under development for Drumnadrochit to reduce flood risk from the River Enrick. The scheme is being designed to a standard of 1 in 200 years. It will be complemented by further investigations of the potential for natural flood management on the tributaries upstream of Drumnadrochit.
It is recommended that the council progress preparation work on this scheme. Further design work is required to refine the preferred option for the scheme, which at present is to maximise upstream flood storage and construct defences from Hunter's Burn to Castle Street, and downstream of Castlegreen Street, to address coastal flooding. In addition to these actions the use of property level protection within the scheme should be investigated.
It is recommended that the council progress work on the Whitesands scheme. Further work on the design of the scheme is still being carried out. The identified design should look to promote the most sustainable combination of actions, enhance the local amenity value of the river while taking account of the local concerns including construction of flood defences along the River Nith.
The scheme will include set-back walls and flood defences. The construction work to raise the sea wall at the Central Waterfront is to start in 2015/16. The scheme will provide a 1 in 200 year (plus climate change) standard of protection.
Flood protection works have been proposed for Edinburgh to further reduce flooding from Water of Leith. The proposed works will likely include Coltbridge, Gorgie and Saughton.
This would include the River Carron, Grange Burn, River Avon and the Forth Estuary shoreline. The scheme would consist of flood defences, sediment management, tidal barriers/ gates and natural flood management and would provide a 1 in 200 year standard of protection. Implementation of this scheme is likely to span a 10 year period from 2017-2027.
The work would involve a number of conveyance modification actions including: upgrading of culverts, construction of a new connection chamber and tidal valve.
Work should be progressed as per the Greenock Flood Protection Scheme. The work involves a number of conveyance modification actions, along the Bouverie Burn.
This would reduce flood risk from the River Tyne. The scheme would consist of flood defences, possibly in combination with natural flood management.
The scheme would consist of flood defence walls and embankments to provide protection to the town from flooding from the River Teviot. Scottish Borders Council is also looking at flood-proofing specific buildings and the provision of storage and pumping of seepage flows. The scheme would provide a 1 in 75 year standard of protection.
A flood protection scheme has been confirmed and is being progressed to construction on site to reduce flood risk from the River Deveron and the Meadows Burn. The scheme includes a combination of improved conveyance using replacement culverts, construction of embankments and temporary flood water storage and has been designed to a 1 in 200 year standard of protection including an allowance for climate change.
The works include upgrading a culvert at Market Place and a new overflow pipe at Gowkhouse Road. A separate natural flood management study is being carried out in the area which may identify additional actions that could be included within the flood protection scheme.
The works will include the profiling of the channel and provide scope to improve the ecology and morphology of the River Kelvin in addition to the flooding benefits. The proposed works could offer protection up to a 1 in 75 year flood.
A flood protection scheme is under development for the perimeter of the harbour in Kirkwall. The scheme will complement existing defences to reduce the flood risk. The scheme includes the construction of direct defences and is being designed to a 1 in 200 year standard of protection including an allowance for climate change.
The Langholm Flood Risk Assessment has been completed which identified potential works within Langholm, including construction of flood defences along the River Esk and Wauchope Water.
A flood risk assessment and economic appraisal have been developed which have identified options to manage flooding in the area. The current option includes the creation of a breakwater with flood walls. These will also protect against wave overtopping and erosion.
Initial remedial work has helped to reduce the level of risk in the area however further analysis should be carried out to establish the remaining level of risk and the most sustainable combination of actions to manage this risk.
This would address surface water flooding. The scheme would consist of pumping stations and provide a 1 in 100 year (plus climate change) standard of protection.
This would reduce flood risk from the River Esk. The scheme would consist of flood defences and earth embankments and would provide a 1 in 200 year standard of protection.
Previous flooding and the New Cumnock Flood Study have shown a risk of flooding in the area and identified actions that would help mitigate the risk, including construction of flood defences along the Afton Water and Connel Burn and sediment management along the Afton Water.
A flood protection scheme has been confirmed and is being progressed to construction on site. The scheme includes a network of ditches to the north of Newmill, a cascade, flood walls and a replacement bridge. It has been designed to a 1 in 200 year standard of protection including an allowance for climate change.
The Newton Stewart Flood Study identified potential works, including construction of direct defences along the River Cree and Penkiln Burn. The study is being further refined to consider actions that increase the level of protection offered. This includes raising of a footbridge over the River Cree in combination with increased direct defences.
It is recommended that the council looks to progress the flood protection scheme proposed for the Gotter Water in Quarrier's Village. Inverclyde Council have completed a study which investigated the creation of embankments on the south bank of the watercourse upstream of Quarrier's Village, with flood defence walls downstream of the embankments on both banks along the reach.
A flood protection scheme has been proposed for the Annaty Burn in Scone. The preferred option consists of raising existing footbridges and constructing riverside defences. The scheme would provide a 1 in 200 year standard of protection.
This scheme is undergoing detailed design and consists of the replacement of culverts, sediment and debris management and temporary flood storage. The scheme will protect communities affected by flooding on a number of occasions in recent years and is being designed to a 1 in 200 year standard of protection including an allowance for climate change.
This scheme aims to reduce flood risk on South Uist as well as the southern coast of Benbecula. The scheme will likely include the construction of embankments, beach recharge at Gualan Island, sand dune/machair restoration and may also include property level protection for any residual risk. The flood protection scheme would be constructed to a standard of 1 in 100 years (locally 1 in 200 years) and will include an allowance for climate change. An option to relieve flooding by creating larger openings in the South Fords causeway is also being considered by the local authority.
This would address flooding from the South Queich, Gelly Burn and Clash Burn. The scheme would consist of flood defence walls and provide a 1 in 200 year (plus climate change) standard of protection.
This scheme has been proposed for the Kinness Burn in St Andrews. The scheme requires detailed study and design.
The scheme would consist of flood embankments and would provide a 1 in 200 year standard of protection. The scheme has a low benefit to cost ratio, but has been identified as the only option for Stirling.
A Flood Order was published in July 2015 with a flood protection scheme undergoing detailed design to reduce flood risk to Stonehaven from the River Carron and Glaslaw Burn. The scheme will include a combination of new culverts and alterations to bridges, removal of weirs and installing trash screens and the construction of direct defences. It is being designed to a 1 in 200 year standard of protection including an allowance for climate change.
The Stranraer Flood Protection Works is split into different items. The first will help to alleviate flooding to properties in the Ochtrelure area, by increasing hydraulic capacity issues at the head of the system. The favoured option includes diversion of flows. The second item of work is concerned with flooding on the Town Burn mainly downstream of the railway culvert. The preferred option for the Station Road area is to regulate flow passing through the railway culvert and therefore alleviate flood risk in this area.
This scheme is an extension of the existing defences, and will increase the level of protection to a number of properties along parts of the Auldhouse Burn and White Cart Water. The proposed scheme includes building flood walls in locations where properties are still identified to be at risk.
