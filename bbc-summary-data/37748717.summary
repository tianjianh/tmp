Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba, and Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero also feature.
Other Premier League names on the list are West Ham midfielder Dimitri Payet and Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.
Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona's Lionel Messi are included.
Messi, who claimed a record fifth award in 2015, or Ronaldo has taken the prize every year since 2007, when AC Milan's Kaka took the honour.
Vardy and Mahrez won the Premier League with Leicester last season and Algerian Mahrez was named Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year.

Bale scored three goals as Wales reached the Euro 2016 semi-final and won the Champions League with Real alongside Ronaldo.
Pogba, Payet and Lloris are included after finishing runners-up with France to Ronaldo's Portugal at Euro 2016.
Luis Suarez and Neymar are included alongside Barcelona team-mate Messi, the trio having scored 106 club goals combined in 2016.
France Football magazine revealed the 30-man shortlist on Monday.
Fifa ended its association with the award in September.
