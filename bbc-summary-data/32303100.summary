Alix Bussey, 23, was hit by a car on 9 April, while making her way back to a hotel in the resort of Riviera Maya. The Foreign Office is investigating.
The Bowburn Infants School teacher was nearing the end of a 10-night break with her boyfriend, Durham Police said.
Miss Bussey's parents Colin and Penny described her as a "devoted teacher" who had wanted to work with children from the age of seven.
The school's head teacher, Christine Ormerod, said staff and students were "deeply saddened".
"Alix was an excellent teacher, enthusiastic and committed to all of the children she taught," she said.
"She will be very much missed by everyone within the school community."
A spokesman for Durham Police said: "Although few details of the incident have been confirmed, it appears Alix was struck by a vehicle as she and her boyfriend made their way back to their hotel after a night out."
Mr Bussey, 50, said "We're absolutely devastated by what has happened and waiting to be given more information by the Foreign Office.
"Alix adored being a teacher, it was all she wanted to do from the age of seven and she was devoted to the education and welfare of the children she taught.
"She lived life to the full, loved to party and she and her boyfriend Jonathan Boyle were besotted with each other.
"Although they had been away on several occasions this was their first holiday abroad and they had been having a great experience."
