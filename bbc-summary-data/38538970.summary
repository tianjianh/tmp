[SN]TITLE[SN]
Preston North End 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton fell to their first loss since September and slipped to second in the Championship with defeat at Preston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Huntington gave Preston the lead when he headed in Paul Gallagher's free-kick at the near post.
Brighton improved after going behind, with Glenn Murray twice going close and Oliver Norwood firing just over.
But Callum Robinson fired in the hosts' second, while Tomer Hemed missed a late penalty for the Seagulls as they failed to turn pressure into goals.
Brighton are now one point behind Newcastle at the top of the table following the Magpies' 2-1 win at Brentford, but they have a game in hand.
The loss is just their second away from home this season, and their first defeat in 18 games in all competitions, a run which stretched back to their EFL Cup third-round defeat by Reading on 20 September.
Preston have never lost at home to Brighton in their history, with their latest victory the tenth in 16 meetings between the sides at Deepdale.
Simon Grayson's side have climbed to ninth in the table, just six points outside the play-off places.
Preston manager Simon Grayson:
"It was a complete victory, a very well-deserved win against a really strong team.
"It's looking like Brighton will end up in the top two this season - or even win the league - so for us to beat them so convincingly says a lot about this team.
"We looked strong throughout, but this result has been coming for quite a while now. We've been putting in some strong performances lately, but not really getting the results we've deserved."
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"I can't complain about the result. We were beaten by the better side on the day.
"The timing of the first goal was bad news for us. From that point on we're chasing the game.
"We should have done better defending the early goal, but having said that we know how dangerous Paul Gallagher can be in a set-piece situation.
"He's probably the best in the Championship in that kind of situation, though his free-kick should have been better defended."
