Bassist Gene Simmons say they hope to "blow the heavens to smithereens and take no prisoners" when they perform at Donington Park in Leicestershire.
They will take to the stage on Sunday 14 June, having last headlined in 2008.
Muse and Slipknot have already been announced as the festival's two other headliners.
Since forming in 1973, KISS have undergone multiple line-up changes but singer Paul Stanley, as well as Simmons, have remained constant throughout.
The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame in 2014 and all four original members attended the ceremony.
Stanley and Simmons currently perform with Eric Singer on drums and Tommy Thayer on lead guitar.
Nothing about the band is understated. Throughout the years, their performances have included pyrotechnics, flaming guitars and fire breathing.
Enter Shikari will headline the second stage on Sunday night. They're due to release their new album in January.
Singer Rou Reynolds said: "The thing I love more than anything is playing outside, at night. It is an honour to be closing the night and because of this we will bring with us illuminations. Do attend."
KISS's main support on Sunday will come from Motley Crue, in what could be their last ever UK festival performance.
The band are due to disband for good in 2016.
Former Guns N Roses guitarist Slash will also take to the stage on Sunday as he performs with Myles Kennedy, and The Conspirators.
"Download is a very special event for me." he said. "It's been a major destination since I started and I'm always excited to be a part of it."
Download is one of the first festivals to announce the bulk of its main 2015 line up already.
Tickets go on sale on Thursday.
Other acts performing across the weekend include Faith No More, Marilyn Manson, Five Finger Death Punch and A Day To Remember.
