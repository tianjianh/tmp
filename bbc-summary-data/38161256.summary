[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flynn, 61, was the Swansea boss who masterminded the club retaining their Football League status on the last day of the 2002-03 season.
He has since worked with the Wales age-grade teams and was caretaker boss of the senior side for two games.
During eight years in charge of the Wales under-21s, Flynn oversaw the progression of Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Wayne Hennessey.
Several of the youngsters went on to form the nucleus of Chris Coleman's Euro 2016 semi-finalists.
Flynn, who played for Wales 66-times, was a firm favourite at the Vetch Field and cemented his legacy when they retained their Football League status on the final day of the 2003 campaign with a 4-2 win over Hull City.
Port Talbot-born Flynn, who played for Burnley, Leeds United and Cardiff City, has also managed Wrexham and Doncaster Rovers.
