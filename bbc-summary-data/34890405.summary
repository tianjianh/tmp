Three vehicles with nine occupants were riding off-road when one rolled off a path in New Radnor at about 02:30 GMT on Saturday, the fire service said.
A rescue involving the fire service, mountain rescue, ambulance service and a rescue helicopter was launched.
Brecon Mountain Rescue Team (MRT) said the men were "lucky to be alive".
Two were airlifted to Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, while the other was taken by land ambulance to hospital in Hereford.
Mark Jones, deputy team leader of Brecon MRT, said it was a "very difficult" site to access and conditions were bad.
The vehicle was "completely disintegrated" at the bottom of the slope by the time his team arrived, Mr Jones added.
He said the rescue, which was not completed until six hours after the alarm was first raised, involved up to 60 emergency services personnel .
Staff were sent from Mid and West Fire and Rescue Service, all four south Wales mountain rescue teams, police, the Welsh Hazardous Area Response Team, the ambulance service, and the search and rescue helicopter from St Athan.
Simon Prince, response manager at the fire service, said of those rescued: "They had not looked at the weather report before going out.
"They hadn't prepared for the weather conditions, or prepared the route either."
