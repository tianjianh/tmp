[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The average cost of a cremation in Northern Ireland has increased by 82% in the last five years, but it still the least expensive service in the UK.

The price rise was revealed after the BBC submitted Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to local authorities that run crematoriums across the UK.
The average cost of a cremation at Roselawn crematorium, run by Belfast City Council, was £198 five years ago.
This year the price rose to £360, but is still the cheapest by some distance.
In comparison, a cremation in the London borough of Hackney will cost more than £1,000.
The average price of an adult cremation in the UK has risen by a third over the last five years and now stands at £640, according to the data.
The City of Belfast Crematorium, based at Roselawn Cemetery at Crossnacreevy, just outside the city, provides cremation services for people from all over Northern Ireland.
According to the FOI responses, Roselawn recorded the second highest price rise of all the UK crematoriums surveyed across the five year period.
The highest price hike was in Barrow-in-Furness, England, where cremation costs increased by 101% and now stand at an average of £721.
