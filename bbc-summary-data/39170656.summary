[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham remain without injured pair Erik Lamela and Danny Rose for Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final, which will be shown live on BBC One from 13:30 GMT.

Michel Vorm, Kieran Trippier and Harry Winks could come into an otherwise full-strength side.
Millwall goalkeeper Jordan Archer is a major doubt to face his former club Tottenham because of a groin injury.
There are no other injury concerns, with Steve Morison and Jed Wallace both returning as substitutes last weekend.
Steve Wilson: "Tottenham go into what will be the last ever FA Cup tie played at White Hart Lane in great spirits. As their new home takes shape where Paxton Road used to be, Spurs are unbeaten on their old ground since May.
"Enter Neil Harris and his Millwall team. Two divisions down - but certainly not lacking in confidence. Indeed the Lions are the only team in the top four leagues who are yet to lose a game in 2017, and have conceded only two goals in their last 13 games.
"Logic says Tottenham will win - but if this season's FA Cup is remembered for anything, it will be for the defiance of logic.
"Just ask Lincoln…and Sutton…and Oxford…and Wolves…and Plymouth…and Eastleigh."

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino on Millwall: "It is another London derby and we were watching all the games and they fully deserve to be in the quarter-finals.
"They were better than the Premier League teams. We are aware about that situation. We respect them.
"It is clear how they play, very compact, clear in their idea how they manage the game."
Millwall manager Neil Harris: "I'm looking forward to it. The test in front of us speaks for itself - it's a huge fixture.
"Not only are we playing in an FA Cup quarter-final - the best club competition in the world - but we are also going to Tottenham Hotspur, who are a really talented side.
"But, we've earned the right to pit ourselves against one of the best in the country. We've got nothing to lose and everything to gain."
I think this is where the Lions' run ends. Spurs striker Harry Kane cannot stop scoring and his partnership with Dele Alli looks very special. Tottenham will just be too strong for them.
Prediction: 2-0
