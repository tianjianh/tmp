Burleigh, who can operate at fly-half or centre, joined the club in 2014 from New Zealand Super 15 side Highlanders.
"The club's heading in the right direction under Alan Solomons. I see a good future for Edinburgh and I want to be part of it." Burleigh said.
"We're building nicely towards our targets in the league this year and the next couple of seasons I see us challenging for more finals."
Burleigh, 29, has played 11 times for Edinburgh this season - often at fly-half - as the Murrayfield club have forced themselves into contention for a top four finish in the Pro12.
Competition for the number 10 jersey will increase at Edinburgh next season, with the summer arrival of Glasgow Warriors and Scotland fly-half Duncan Weir.
