Leeds United: Nigel Gibbs wins damages over exit from Championship club

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Leeds United assistant manager Nigel Gibbs has been awarded Â£331,426 in damages over his exit from the club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gibbs left Elland Road in July 2014, two months after boss Brian McDermott.
At Thursday's hearing in London, the judge Mr Justice Langstaff said that Gibbs had not been assigned work befitting his status and felt he was standing around "doing nothing".
The ex-Watford man resigned after being told by then head coach Dave Hockaday that he had no future at the club.
He was excluded from taking any meaningful part in the training of the first team and was told by email that his role was to be confined to working with the under-18 and under-21 players, which the judge said was not reasonable.
Gibbs is now the assistant head of player development at Tottenham.
