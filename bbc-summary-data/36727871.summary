The 23-year-old took gold with a unanimous points victory, with one judge giving him the win by 30-27 and the other two judges scoring it 29-28.
For Aloyan, a two-time world amateur champion, the silver was an upgrade on the bronze he won at London 2012.
Zoirov's gold medal was Uzbekistan's third of the Games.
And Fazliddin Gaibnazarov added a fourth shortly afterwards when he beat Azerbaijan's Lorenzo Sotomayor on a 2-1 split decision to win light-welterweight gold.
