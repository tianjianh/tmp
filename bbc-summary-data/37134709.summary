A hive of honey bees has been destroyed at an apiary in the Highlands after the insects were found to be infected with the disease, American Foulbrood (AFB).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]

There is no permitted treatment in the UK for the disease, which kills bee larvae.
The Scottish government said there was a ban in place on the movement of bees and related equipment from the affected area.
