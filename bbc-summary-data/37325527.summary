[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 1-1 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Curtis Weston's late goal saw Barnet draw with Colchester at The Hive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bees started slowly, affording their opponents time to pick passes and they were punished when Drey Wright pulled the ball back to Tariq Fosu-Henry who gave the visitors a sixth-minute lead.
The home side struggled to keep possession in even the simplest situations and manager Martin Allen was forced to make a change after just half an hour, throwing on Jamal Campbell-Ryce.
And the substitute made a real difference, tormenting left-back Ben Dickenson and picking out Shaun Batt just before the break but the striker could only head over from three yards.
Barnet continued to look strong after half-time but still needed Josh Vickers' strong right hand to keep out Wright's shot.
But just a minute after Luke Gambin had seen a shot cleared off the line, Curtis Weston finished off a goal-line scramble to bag an 82nd-minute equaliser.
