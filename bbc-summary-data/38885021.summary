[SN]TITLE[SN]
HMP Channings Wood is a prison 'in decline'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
HMP Channings Wood has been described as a "prison in decline" in a report by the chief inspector of prisons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In his report Peter Clarke said the Devon jail was struggling to cope and safety had deteriorated.
He found inmates did not feel safe and the level of violence had "increased noticeably" since the last inspection in 2012.
Michael Spurr from the National Offender Management Service said he recognised immediate action was needed.
More on the prison 'struggling to cope', and other news
The prison, in the village of Denbury, held just over 700 prisoners at the time of the unannounced inspection in October 2016.
Mr Clarke said: "The senior management team had a number of vacancies, including that of deputy governor, all of which left substantial strategic and operational gaps.
"As a result, our major concern is that the prison just doesn't have the necessary strategies, plans or resources at a senior level to halt the deterioration."
Inspectors were concerned to find that:
Mr Spurr said "experienced senior leaders" had been appointed who would be working in the prison and supporting the governor to tackle the issues raised in the report.
"More prison officers have been recruited to help tackle violence and the prison has increased the use of metal detectors to help find weapons and mobile phones," he said.
