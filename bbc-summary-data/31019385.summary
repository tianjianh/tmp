[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jake Blakeley, 18, of Abbotts Road, Didcot, was acquitted on a charge of preventing the lawful burial of Jayden Parkinson after the jury failed to reach a verdict.
Jayden was murdered by his brother Ben, 22, who is serving a life sentence.
Mr Blakeley previously admitted perverting the course of justice and is due to be sentenced on 10 March.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had no more evidence to submit and Judge Patrick Eccles ruled Mr Blakeley was not guilty.
There were screams from the public gallery when it was announced.
Jayden's mother, Samantha Shrewsbury, shouted: "Not once has he said sorry for my daughter."
The jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict after almost 11 hours. It was the second time a jury failed to reach a verdict on Mr Blakeley.
Jayden, 17, was strangled by Ben Blakeley, 22, in December 2013 and then hidden near Didcot before being buried in his uncle's grave.
Oxford Crown Court heard that younger brother Mr Blakeley thought he was burying weapons, a cat and a dog. He denied preventing a lawful burial.
Days later they dug at a second site - their uncle's grave at All Saints Church in Didcot - where Jayden's body was found on 18 December.
