There were no reports of injuries. The fire, which broke out after midnight, was extinguished several hours later.
It took place at the Sagami Depot, a US Army post in Sagamihara, which is 40km (25 miles) south-west of Tokyo.
The US Army said the warehouse stored compressed gases including nitrogen, oxygen and freon. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the blast.
US officials have also said that the warehouse did not store ammunition or hazardous chemicals.
One resident told public broadcaster NHK that she heard continuous explosions for 10 to 15 minutes.
"Orange sparks were rising quite high. I couldn't see smoke but smelled something like gunpowder," she told NHK.
