The teenager, named locally as Jack Sheldon, was discovered at a property on Byron Avenue in Campsall, near Doncaster, on Thursday evening.
Police said the boy was found as the blaze was being put out.
A joint investigation between South Yorkshire fire service and police is under way to establish the cause of the fire.
Jack's great-grandmother Irene Bennett said: "All I know is that he burnt to death in a shed."
Investigators with sniffer dogs are searching the semi-detached house and the garden has been screened off.
Neighbours attempted to tackle the blaze as emergency calls were made to the property at about 20:30 BST, the fire service said.
Simon Dunker, from South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue service, said: "On arrival we found a shed well alight and proceeded to extinguish the fire. At that time is when we discovered there had been a fatality within the shed."
Floral tributes have been left outside the property. One read: "We all loved Jack, he was a great lad. We're going to miss him."
Another said: "RIP Jack, gone but not forgotten. Can't believe it was only yesterday that I saw you."
Ed Miliband, former Labour Party leader and Doncaster North MP, has tweeted: "All my thoughts with his family".
Doncaster Mayor Ros Jones said she was "deeply saddened to hear of the death" and his "thoughts and prayers are with his family".
A formal identification of the body is yet to take place and the investigation is not expected to finish until Saturday at the earliest, the fire service said.
