Alastair Cook aims to 'enjoy cricket again' after losing ODI captaincy

Alastair Cook is aiming to start "enjoying my cricket again" next year following the disappointment of being removed as England one-day captain.

Cook, 29, was replaced last week by fellow batsman Eoin Morgan - less than two months before the World Cup.
"We have 17 Tests up to January 2016, including Australia at home and South Africa away, which are the two marquee series," Cook told Sky Sports.
"Hopefully I can get back scoring some runs and enjoying my cricket again."
During the recent 5-2 series defeat in Sri Lanka, Cook said he would not resign, but a selectors' meeting on Friday took the decision for him.
He had been appointed to lead the one-day side in 2011, but he averaged only 27.52 in his last 20 one-dayers before Morgan replaced him.
Cook added: "It has been an interesting couple of days, both frustrating and disappointing but sometimes these things happen. I have to take it on the chin.
"I will get away from it for a couple of weeks but it is gutting. It is frustrating when you have put so much in but I wish the guys all the best."
Cook was speaking after beating James Anderson in a one-legged match before play began at the PDC World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace.
He and Anderson were part of the television commentary team for South African Nolan Arendse's qualifying round win against Hong Kong's Alex Hon.
