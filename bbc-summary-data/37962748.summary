Stacey Burrows, 16, was with 17-year-old Lucy Pygott when they were hit by a Ford Focus in Aldershot on Tuesday.
Athletes paid tribute before taking part in the Hampshire Cross-Country League fixture in Bournemouth.
Both girls were dedicated runners and members of Aldershot, Farnham and District Athletic Club (AFD).
Hampshire cross country team manager David Vosser said the deaths had had a big impact on athletics across the country.
"Today is very very raw.
"There is a deep level of respect between athletes so it was special to take a moment to think about them today," he said.
"I'm very encouraged by the number of people who've turned out today to do what Stacey and Lucy loved doing, and that was to run," he said.
Lucy was this year's England Under-20 3,000m champion and European Youth Championships bronze medallist. Stacey was the Hampshire Under-17 3,000m champion.
A serving soldier has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving, two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and two counts of careless driving while unfit through drink or drugs. He has been bailed until February.
