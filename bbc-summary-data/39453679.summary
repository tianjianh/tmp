The explosives were found by a member of the public at Hurst Spit near Milford-on-Sea on Thursday night.
Police said the munitions disappeared overnight, before bomb disposal experts arrived in the morning.
Officers described one of the shells as "unstable and potentially dangerous" and said anyone seeing them should call 101.
The man who made the discovery picked up the shells before alerting the emergency services, police said.
Despite being warned to leave them and get out of his car, he returned the shells to the top of the spit before officers arrived.
Ch Insp Rob Mitchell said: "The explosive ordnance disposal team advised they would attend at first light.
"A decision was made to set up a cordon around the shells and officers returned to the scene in the early hours of the morning to find the shells still in situ.
"When officers attended the scene again shortly before 07:30, the shells had gone but the police tape and the towel they had been placed on were still there."
