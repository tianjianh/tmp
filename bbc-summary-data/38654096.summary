Two preferred sites for a park-and-ride to the east of Bath have been chosen from a shortlist of eight

A report, put before councillors, said both locations are close to the city and would attract the largest number of users from the A4, A46 and A363.
It recommended if "site B", with 800 spaces, cannot be secured then "site F", also 800 spaces, should be sought.
A meeting of Bath and North East Somerset Council on 25 January will consider both options.
Councillors were told neither site was in a flood plain and that "site B" had potential for a future rail link.
Conservative leader Councillor Tim Warren said the park-and-ride was crucial to the council's plan to improve transport, tackle congestion and grow the local economy.
"The debate we need to have is not about whether Bath needs new infrastructure. It's about how we can deliver new infrastructure in a way that protects Bath's heritage and is sensitive to its surroundings, whilst at the same time meets the needs of a growing, thriving city," he said.
The proposed eastern park-and-ride would join the city's other three at Newbridge, Lansdown and Odd Down.
