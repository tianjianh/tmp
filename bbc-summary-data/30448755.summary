Liverpool City Council has put together the plan to tackle "voids" across the city.
The project will see an expansion of the Homes for a Pound scheme and action taken to acquire rundown properties from owners.
The plans will go before the council's cabinet next Friday.
The proposals include the introduction of an "Interested Developer" list for small investors, local builders and landlords interested in buying and refurbishing empty homes.
They will be connected with owners looking to sell up.
Some poorly maintained properties could be repaired by the council - with the owners then footing the bill.
More money will also be made available for compulsorily purchasing neglected properties.
Mayor Joe Anderson said: "Empty homes are a blight on our communities and are a huge deterrent to people wanting to live in an area.
"We want to send out a strong message to the owners of empty properties that it is simply not acceptable to allow their homes to be a magnet for fly tipping, anti-social behaviour and general blight.
"They owe it to the city and their neighbours to keep their homes in good condition, and if they don't then we will take enforcement against them."
