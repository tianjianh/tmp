London gun amnesty sees 350 weapons handed in to Met Police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 350 guns have been handed in to police stations in London as part of the Met Police's first firearms amnesty in six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 12,300 rounds of ammunition were also handed in, as well as World War One weapons.
The surrender started at 07:00 GMT on 10 November and lasted two weeks.
Those surrendering firearms did not face prosecution for illegal possession and could remain anonymous.
All weapons and ammunition were forensically checked for evidence.
Weapons with antique value will go to museums and the rest will be destroyed.
Det Ch Insp Gary Bruce said: "The surrender has led to a significant number of lethal-barrelled weapons and ammunition being taken off the streets, preventing them from falling into the hands of criminals, in particular gang members, and helping to further reduce gun crime in the capital."
Last year 300 firearms were seized.
