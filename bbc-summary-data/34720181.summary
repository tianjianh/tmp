The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will announce in the new year which six sides will take part in the inaugural Twenty20 event next season.
Sussex, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight support the Ageas Bowl's bid.
"We feel the bid sits very well with our development of women's and girls' cricket here," bid general manager Bobby Parks told BBC Radio Solent.
Former Hampshire wicketkeeper and academy manager Parks revealed the bid will be submitted by the deadline of 13 November.
"We've managed to encourage six other counties to come with us," he added.
"We feel creating a region will really strengthen our bid and encourage the ECB to award it our way."
Twenty eight organisations told the ECB of their interest in forming teams for the competition before the initial expression of interest stage closed in August.
The Women's Super League will be a T20 competition only for its first year before taking in the 50-over format as well from 2017.
It will receive a Â£3m investment from the ECB over four years.
The plan is to attract the world's best players to compete alongside England's leading female cricketers similar to Australia's Women's Big Bash League, which begins its inaugural season in December.
