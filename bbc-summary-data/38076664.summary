The image taken by Katherine Fotheringham shows a fog bow with a brocken spectre and cloud inversion.
She captured the weather events while walking up Beinn a'Chrulaiste in Glen Coe on Sunday.
The inversion, a phenomena which sees cloud form below the summits of hills and mountains, stretched all the way to Ben Nevis, said Ms Fotheringham.
All three weather events are considered to be rare.
On Sunday, fog bows were also photographed on Rannoch Moor and the Cairngorms.
Brocken spectres are a spooky weather effect believed to be behind the myth of the Big Grey Man of Ben Macdui, sometimes described as Scotland's Big Foot.
According to the Met Office, the brocken spectre effect is produced when a person stands above the upper surface of a cloud - on a mountain or high ground - with the sun behind them.
When the person views their shadow the light is reflected back in such a way that a "spooky circular glory" appears around the point directly opposite, said the Met Office.
