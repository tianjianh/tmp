Collin rose to meet Ben Greenhalgh's cross to book the Isthmian Premier Division side a meeting with Wrexham.
He had earlier put Maidstone ahead from a rebound, only for Darius Charles to volley an equaliser for Stevenage.
But Collin had the last word, sending Maidstone to round two for the first time since they reformed in 1992.
Their victory was also the first match in the main draw of the FA Cup to be played on a 3G artificial surface.
A goalless draw at Stevenage had earned the Stones a replay at the Gallagher Stadium, the ground they moved into in 2012 on their return to the town after a 24-year absence.
They were ahead inside two minutes, with Jay May running onto a flick and seeing his shot parried by Stevenage keeper Chris Day into the path of Collin, who finished from an angle.
The visitors, 60 places above Maidstone in the league pyramid, remained vulnerable to long balls all night, but they improved and put pressure on the home goal, with Lee Worgan called on to save from Lee Barnard and Roarie Deacon.
The Boro got their reward after half-time when Simon Walton turned two defenders on the Maidstone left and crossed for Charles to volley home from 12 yards out.
From there, it was Stevenage who looked more likely winners - Worgan again forced to deny Chris Whelpdale -  only for the visitors to be caught out late on.
Greenhalgh surged down the left and crossed to Collin, whose header sent Maidstone to Conference side Wrexham on Saturday, 6 December.
