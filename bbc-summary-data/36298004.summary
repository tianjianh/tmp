Appointed on a short-term basis in January with the Swans in the Premier League relegation zone, Guidolin guided them to a 12th place finish.
He was rewarded with a new two-year contract, and Swansea's fans repeatedly sang his name during the game.
"It was fantastic," Guidolin said.
"It was a nice surprise for me. A magic moment and a nice day with the sun shining and the fans singing.
"If it happened, it is for my players. They run, they work very hard and they changed the situation since January.
Swansea will now turn their attention to preparing for their sixth successive season in the Premier League.
Guidolin has said he will not have the final say on transfers, with that responsibility falling to chairman Huw Jenkins.
"For this situation, to prepare a good team for next season, I'll speak with my chairman," Guidolin added.
"But we have a good team and I think we need something more, but not many changes in my opinion.
"I have my idea of what I would like to change but in front of you [the media] it's difficult to say. My attitude is to keep private."
One player who has been linked with a summer move to the Liberty Stadium is former Swansea striker Wilfried Bony.
The Ivory Coast international left the Swans for Manchester City for Â£25m in January 2015, and he was an unused substitute on Sunday.
Swansea's supporters chanted Bony's name, and with the 27-year-old a peripheral figure at City, Guidolin was asked if he could return to south Wales.
"I don't know," was the Italian's response.
"I don't know him but I know his characteristics as a player.
"I like him. He's a good player and I know he worked very well here. For this, people here like him."
