Brentford defender James Tarkowski has returned to training but will not be considered for selection for Saturday's trip to Preston North End.

The 23-year-old asked not to play against Burnley last Friday following two transfer bids from the Clarets.
"I thought it was right to keep him away from the club for a while and give him time to reflect," Bees head coach Dean Smith told BBC Radio London.
"He needs to settle down a little bit and get back to fitness as well."
Tarkowski was initially named in the starting XI to face Burnley but, after discussions with Smith, declared himself unavailable to play and the centre-back was subsequently dropped entirely from the matchday squad.
The Bees have rejected recent bids for Tarkowski, saying offers have not met their valuation for the former Oldham player.
"We have dealt with it internally, in terms of the discipline side of it," added Smith. "He will be available moving forward for sure."
