The event is being held in the village of Southwick in Northamptonshire, with thousands of spectators expected.
Richard Howard, who is the ringmaster of the day's events, said 10 countries were competing, including Japan, South Africa and the US.
The event started in 1965 and has grown year-on-year ever since with competitors playing on eight podiums.
The winner on the day is led to a conker throne and crowned with conkers - and Mr Howard said whoever won would have gone through several rounds and have smashed many conkers to have gained "the title and the honour" of being a world-class conker player.
He said: "Usually the ones who are good at it are people with a good eye - people who are good at shooting, tennis players, sports people."
For those without experience he said the key to a win was to aim for the weakest point of the conker - the part where the lace goes through it, "as close to the string as possible" and not to hit it too hard.
Some 200 people are taking part in the competition.
Mr Howard said: "It's not often you get the chance to become a world champion."
