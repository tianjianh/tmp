Dom Waldouck: Newcastle Falcons take ex-England Saxons centre on month's trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-England Saxons centre Dom Waldouck is to spend a month on trial at Premiership side Newcastle Falcons following a US rugby stint with Ohio.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Waldouck, 28, left London Irish in April to move to the Pro League having made just five appearances for the Exiles after a move from Northampton.
He spent six years at Wasps, playing 77 top flight games before the move to Saints, where he played 30 matches.
The three-quarter will arrive at Falcons in late July.
Director of rugby Dean Richards said: "He has now played two or three seasons without significant injury and seems to be back into the groove."
