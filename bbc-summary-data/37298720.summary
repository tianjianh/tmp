PSNI officer Allen Kennedy faces gun and silencer charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has been remanded in custody accused of trying to acquire a gun, ammunition and silencer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Allen Kennedy is also charged with having quantities of ecstasy and cocaine with intent to supply.
The 30-year-old, whose address was given as c/o Strandtown Police Station in east Belfast, was arrested in the city on Monday.
He faced six charges at Belfast Magistrates Court.
The policeman is accused of the attempted possession of a handgun, 10 rounds of ammunition and a silencer in suspicious circumstances and with intent to endanger life.
Mr Kennedy, who is currently suspended from duties due to unrelated matters, is further charged with having bullets and a shotgun cartridge.
He faces further allegations of having Class A drugs with intent to supply, and possession of cannabis.
All of the alleged offences occurred at locations in Belfast and Newtownards on 5 September.
Standing in the dock dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, Mr Kennedy confirmed he understood the charges, replying: "I do."
A defence solicitor told the court his client was not seeking bail at this stage.
He was remanded into custody to appear again by video-link in four weeks time.
