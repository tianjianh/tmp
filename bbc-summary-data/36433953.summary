Designs have been published showing the planned transformation of a popular Edwardian public bath house in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Govanhill Baths closed in 2001 despite a local campaign to save it. It reopened in 2013 as a community hub, run by Govanhill Baths Community Trust.
The group has secured enough funding to re-open the venue as a swimming and wellbeing centre in late 2018.
The architect's designs for the revamped building will be on public display at the baths from 15:00-20:00.
The open day will feature live music and art installations and volunteer tour guides will show people around the building.
Visitors will also be able to experience a 3D digital tour of the new building, which has been designed by Hall Black Douglas Architects and Alistair Coey Conservation Architects.
The cash is now in place to carry out the renovations work with the main funding coming from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Big Lottery, Historic and Environment Scotland and Glasgow City Council.
A new reception will be formed within the existing ground floor foyer space that will lead directly into a community cafe with access to the garden, facing onto Calder Street.
The learner and ladies pools will be restored and refurbished.
Changing facilities, including family and accessible cubicles, will be added as well as a new Turkish suite featuring both a sauna and steam-room.
The existing first floor slipper baths will be re-developed to create a community gym and activity space, with a number of historic cubicles retained and restored to accommodate private bathing and changing.
