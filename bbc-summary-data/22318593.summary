[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal Welsh hold Anglesey 'freedom' parade in Holyhead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Royal Welsh have marched through Holyhead to be granted the freedom of Anglesey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The honour, agreed unanimously by the county's councillors, allows the regiment to march with "colours flying, drums beating and bayonets fixed" on ceremonial occasions.
The regiment was formed on St David's Day 2006 from The Royal Welch Fusiliers, The Royal Regiment of Wales and the Royal Welsh Regiment.
It recruits primarily from Wales.
Its most recent appearance on the streets of Wales was in March when members of the 3rd Battalion paraded in Swansea to mark St David's Day.
That event went ahead despite the absence of the Queen, who had been due to hand out ceremonial leeks to the soldiers.
The parade in Holyhead on Saturday was led by the regimental colonel, Brig Philip Napier.
Anglesey council chief executive Richard Parry Jones said: "Holyhead has had a close affinity with the armed forces over the years and it's fitting that the freedom parade be held in the town.
"The granting of the freedom of Anglesey to the Royal Welsh will mean that the name of the regiment takes pride of place on the Roll of Honorary Freemen of the County."
Brig Napier said: "This historic step marks the very strong connection we with our forebears the Royal Welch Fusiliers have with the isle.
"It is a particular pleasure for the parade to be held in the historic and lovely town of Holyhead."
