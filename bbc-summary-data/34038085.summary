Colourful makeover for taxis in India

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of designers have turned the interiors of 30 taxis in Mumbai, in India, into works of art.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It's called the Taxi Fabric Project and the idea is to give new designers and artists to an opportunity to show off their work.
Taxis are a popular mode of transport in India so it's hoped lots of people will see them.
They feature all sorts of images from historic freedom fighters to life under the sea.
