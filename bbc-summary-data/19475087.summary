The 39-year-old Zimbabwean has scored over 24,000 runs in all competitions during a 12-year stay with the county, winning seven trophies along the way.
He said: "It deeply saddens me that I have to leave at the end of the season. I have thoroughly enjoyed my 12 years.
"My family have loved every year here, and we feel so privileged to have been associated with this wonderful club."
Goodwin has scored 48 centuries and averages 49.24 for Sussex in first-class competition.

In total, he has racked up almost 14,500 runs in 190 matches.
He has hit two triple centuries and holds the record for the county's highest innings, a score of 344 not out against Somerset in 2009.
Goodwin said it had been "a privilege" to be a part of the Sussex side which won the County Championship three times in the space of five seasons, secured back-to-back Pro40 triumphs and lifted the Twenty20 Cup in 2009.
He scored the winning runs which won the county's first Championship in 2003 and hit a six off the final ball of the match to win the Pro40 title in 2008.
"To the coaches, support staff and most of all, my wonderful team mates that I have been blessed to play alongside over the years, it has been an honour to have had so much success in winning trophies for ourselves and the club," Goodwin continued.
"I feel so humbled to be a part of such a wonderful team, club and ethos and offer huge thanks to so many wonderful sponsors and supporters."
Sussex cricket manager Mark Robinson paid tribute to the batsman, who played 17 Test matches for Zimbabwe.
"Murray is arguably the best ever batsman Sussex have had and he will be greatly missed," Robinson said
"Not only on the pitch, but [also] in the dressing room as well by all those he has helped and supported in his time at the club.
"I would like to thank Murray for the help he has given me, and the great service he has given to this club. I wish him and his family all the very best for the future."
Despite his previous achievements, Goodwin has struggled for form in the County Championship this year.
He has scored 267 runs in 21 innings in Division One this season, leaving him with an average of 13.35 in the four-day game in 2012.
