Wales' record try-scorer Shane Williams has revealed his new international ambition is to help coach his country after he retires from rugby.

The 34-year-old wing will win his 87th and final Wales cap in the 3 December Test with Australia in Cardiff.
Now the 2008 IRB International Player of the Year hopes to follow Rob Howley from a star player on the pitch to be a part of Wales' managerial set-up.
"I'd like to be [Wales coach], I know it's a tough job," said Williams.
"It would be nice to do it one day because I love Welsh rugby and I'll keep loving Welsh rugby even after I finish playing.
"I'd like to do something with Wales in the future as a coach or something else.
"I've had a great time with Wales and the Ospreys, it has been my life and hopefully it stays that way even when I finish playing."
The Osprey hopes to add to his record 57-try haul for Wales at the Millennium Stadium against the Wallabies in what he has confirmed will be his final Wales Test.
Former Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Rob Howley joined Warren Gatland's backroom staff just after the New Zealander's appointment and a month prior to the start of Wales' 2008 Grand Slam triumph.
Williams, a Lions tourist in 2005 and 2009, is preparing to draw an illustrious 11-year Wales career to a close.
But the double-Grand Slam winner, who is second behind Australian David Campese on rugby's all-time top Test try-scorer list, hopes his involvement with the Wales team can one day continue in an off-the-field role.
"I used to dream of playing for Wales so why not?" said Williams, whose current Ospreys deal expires in the summer of 2013.
"I'd love to come back and do something like Rob Howley. For Rob to be coaching Wales after finishing rugby not that long ago is incredible.
"And what he brings to the way Wales want to attack, he gets overshadowed a little bit as he really does a lot with Wales.
"If I could do something like that and be as successful as Rob in a few years then great. I'd love to be part of it."
If Williams became Wales head coach, he would be the first former Welsh international to coach Wales since Ron Waldron managed the national team between 1990 and 91.
