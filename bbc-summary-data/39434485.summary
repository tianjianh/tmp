[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man on trial for murdering his estranged wife had talked about "paying someone to get rid of her", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gytis Griskevicius is alleged to have attacked Marina Erte, 33, at her flat just hours after celebrating his birthday at a barbecue with friends.
Lincoln Crown Court was told the attack was motivated by jealousy as Ms Erte was in a relationship with another man.
Griskevicius, 32, of St Ann's Lane, Boston, denies murder.
The court heard Griskevicius was so angry after the couple separated in 2015 that he wanted her out of the way.
Anita Zeleznova, a friend of Ms Erte, told the jury the accused loved his wife very much and could not stand to see her with another man.
"He said he was willing to pay someone to get rid of her," she said.
"As far as I understood he meant to murder her," she told the court.
Ms Zeleznova denied a defence suggestion that she was deliberately trying to make things bad for Griskevicius.
She told the jury: "I don't have any motive to lie."
The court also heard from another friend who claimed Ms Erte was concerned Griskevicius was stalking her after he found out where she lived.
The court previously heard the attack "was motivated by jealousy" after the defendant discovered Ms Erte was in a relationship with another man.
It is alleged Griskevicius drowned his estranged wife with a shower attachment before setting fire to her flat in Boston to destroy the evidence.
Ms Erte's naked and badly beaten body was found in the bath at her flat by firemen who had been called out by neighbours in May.
The trial continues.
