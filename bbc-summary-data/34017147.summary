The former health secretary, who was in Wrexham last Sunday, held a question-and-answer session at Penlan Social Club.
He has promised more freedom for Welsh Labour and devolution that "holds us together as a United Kingdom".
Yvette Cooper, Jeremy Corbyn and Liz Kendall are also in the battle to be crowned Labour leader in September.
Speaking on Saturday, he said: "I am for the second time in a week in Wales because of the importance of Wales to our party, both [in the] past but also looking to the future.
"We've got the Holyrood elections and Welsh assembly elections next year so Wales and Scotland will be very big in our immediate plans going forward."
Mr Burnham has said Labour has been "too out of touch with its grassroots" and has pledged to do "whatever I can" to hold the party together.
Several senior Labour figures have claimed the party faces years out of power if Mr Corbyn is elected leader, although the veteran left-winger has the support of more constituency parties than any other candidate.
