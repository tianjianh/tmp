[SN]TITLE[SN]
Solicitors firms CMG and Cunningham and Dickey to merge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Belfast-based legal firms, CMG and Cunningham and Dickey, have announced a merger.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Belfast office of CMG Cunningham Dickey will be based in their May Street premises while its office in Bangor, County Down, will remain in Market Street.
Two of the three partners, Brian Speers and Michael Robinson, are recent former presidents of the Law Society of Northern Ireland.
Cunningham and Dickey was founded in 1870, while CMG started as the practice of William Graham in Newtownards in 1910.
The merged firm said the amalgamation would strengthen its matrimonial and children's law advice and representation, while it will also have strengths in acting for residential housing developers.
