The club will be known as Arsenal, and say they will use the 'Women' title only when "official clarity" is needed.
Arsenal are the fourth top-tier side to carry the 'Women' name, with six teams using the 'Ladies' moniker.
In a message on the club's website, captain Alex Scott said the name change was a "bold statement of intent, support and unity".
She continued: "The term 'Women' delineates between men and women without as many stereotypes or preconceived notions and it is in keeping with modern-day thinking on equality.
"We are moving forward together as a club and I hope that this sends out a message that times are changing for the better."
