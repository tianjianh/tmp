Network Rail is lowering the track and carrying out platform modifications, in preparation for the electrification of the Great Western Main Line.
The line will be shut from Saturday until early on 11 April. Keynsham and Oldfield Park stations will be closed.
It is part of a Â£2.8bn project to electrify the line between London and South Wales.
Andy Haynes from Network Rail said: "Once completed, the residents of Bristol and Bath will be a step closer to the benefits that electrification will bring.
"These include faster trains with more seats and more legroom, and less noise and cleaner air for those who live close to the railway line.
"In addition, faster journeys and the ability to move more people by train will also benefit businesses in the area, helping to drive economic growth across the south west."
Regular rail replacement bus services will run between Bath Spa and Bristol Temple Meads while the line is shut.
