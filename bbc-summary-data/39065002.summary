[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone United manager Jay Saunders has extended his contract with the National League club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 38-year-old was appointed by the Stones in March 2011 and led the Kent club to promotion from National League South last season via the play-offs.
Terry Casey told the club website that he and fellow co-owner Oliver Ash wanted to continue their "love affair" with Saunders.
"He remains the best manager I have ever had contact with," Casey added.
"There is a bit of uncertainty about which league we are going to be in next season, so we felt it right to nail down the future,"
Maidstone, who will go full-time next season, are 21st in the National League table, one point from safety.
The club have not disclosed the length of Saunders' new deal.
