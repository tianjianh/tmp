The Scottish-Brazilian partnership, seeded second, prevailed 6-7 7-5 10-5 against the number four seeds.
It is the pair's second title this year after February's success in Acapulco, Mexico, and a 25th tour-level championship victory for Soares.
"Twenty-five is amazing; hopefully I can make it to 50," said Soares.
Murray, 31, now has 18 titles to his name.
"We had a few close losses this year and it was nice to see it through and get it over the line and get another trophy," the Scot told the ATP website.
Murray and Soares won the Australian Open and US Open last year, finishing the season at the top of the world rankings.
