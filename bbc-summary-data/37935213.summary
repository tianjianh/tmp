Allen started well and made a clearance of 100 to draw level at one frame each.
It was 2-2 at the interval before back-to-back centuries of 124 and 109 put O'Sullivan 5-2 ahead and he clinched victory in the next frame.
The five-time world champion will play Scotland's John Higgins in Sunday's final at the Ricoh Arena.
A first prize of Â£100,000 is on offer for the tournament winner.
Antrim's Allen will be the home favourite at next week's inaugural Northern Ireland Open at the Titanic Exhibition Centre.
