Bournemouth osteopath struck off for blue badge fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dorset osteopath has been struck off following convictions for blue badge fraud and avoiding parking fines.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On one occasion, Nigel Graham, 56, illegally parked in a disabled space outside a court while he was inside admitting misuse of blue badges.
The BBC filmed the offence in 2015.
The General Osteopathic Council said the "degree and persistence of Mr Graham's dishonesty was fundamentally incompatible with practice as an osteopath".
The council removed him from its register and said he was now unable to practise in the profession.
Graham, of Southbourne, was appearing before Southampton magistrates in June 2015 when his illegally-parked car was given a ticket outside.
The car was driven away with the ticket still attached to the windscreen.
Inside the court, he had pleaded guilty to five counts of false representation to avoid parking fines in Southampton, Bournemouth and Christchurch, and one count of illegally using a disabled person's blue badge.
The badge was in the name of his deceased mother and had been applied for after her death.
Graham was given a suspended jail sentence and ordered to do 120 hours' community service.
The General Osteopathic Council said it noted the strong language used by the magistrate, who said these were "despicable dishonest offences committed... over a long period of time with no regard to bona fide blue badge holders".
The council said when Graham appeared before them in May, he "continued to obfuscate" and showed "no insight into the seriousness of his criminality".
