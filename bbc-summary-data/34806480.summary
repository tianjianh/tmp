Rob Lawrie, 49, from Guiseley, faces a prison term if convicted of trying take the girl to her relatives in Leeds.
The girl's father Reza Ahmadi said Mr Lawrie "only wanted to help, he's going to jail and I feel guilty".
Former soldier Mr Lawrie is due before a French court in January.
Two petitions urging the UK Foreign Office to seek clemency from French officials have secured more than 123,000 signatures.
The Home Office said Mr Lawrie knew "there was a proper process".
The Afghan girl, known as "Bahar" was living in the camp with her father.
Her father said: "He wanted to help me and help my child and he didn't want money, only to help.
"He's going to jail, only for helping, I feel guilty."
Mr Lawrie said: "This (camp) is no place for a child.
"The jungle is an ex-chemical dump, there's asbestos everywhere.
"At that point a I just knew what I had to do."
Home Office minister Charlie Elphicke said: "Mr Lawrie knew what he was doing, he made a decision to smuggle this person.
"A decision to take the law into his own hands, he knew there was a proper process for claiming asylum and he knew that that process should have been followed."
Mr Lawrie hid Bahar in a compartment above the driver's seat of his van.
He was stopped by border officials who discovered two Eritrean boys had sneaked into the vehicle without his knowledge.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We have been in contact with French police regarding Mr Lawrie's arrest, and are ready to provide consular assistance if requested."
