Met policeman running gym with convicted man quits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Met police officer who runs a gym with a man convicted of a violent attack is to resign from the force.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Glen Oliver set up the gym in Crawley, Sussex, with Daniel Bell, who was one of four men found guilty last year at a retrial in Crete of causing GBH to a former footballer.
The Met told the PC his business was not compatible with his police role.
Mr Oliver said he was given the choice to resign from the police or walk away from the profitable business.
He told BBC South East's Charlie Rose: "I don't agree with my employer's decision.
"I don't believe I've done anything wrong."
Mr Oliver said he had spent two and a half years building up the business and felt he had no choice but to leave the Metropolitan Police.
Robert Hughes, 35, was left brain-damaged after he was attacked in Malia in Crete in 2008.
The former Oxford United player was assaulted outside a nightclub. He was stabbed with a broken bottle, stamped on and left in a coma.
After his mother Maggie Hughes complained about the gym, the Metropolitan Police found no evidence of misconduct, but the IPCC ordered it to reinvestigate after she appealed.
Mrs Hughes said: "Glen Oliver has made his own decision to leave the Metropolitan Police.
"I'm not happy with that decision. My son was injured by the very person this officer went into business with."
Mr Oliver said he would leave the force at the end of the month.
Bell, from Horley in Surrey, along with the three other guilty men, also from Surrey, was given a three-year suspended jail term and told he was free to return to the UK.
