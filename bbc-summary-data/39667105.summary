Comments: Your good luck messages for London Marathon runners

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 37th London Marathon is taking place on Sunday, 23 April, with thousands of runners joining in to raise money for charity.

The gruelling 26.2-mile race has taken place in the capital every year since 1981.
This year around 40,000 runners are expected to set off from the starting line, including this lot hoping to break some weird world records.
