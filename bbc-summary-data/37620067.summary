[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The remains were found by a member of the public shortly after midday on Monday just off the A628 at Tintwistle, near Glossop.
Officers said the corpse was too badly burned for the gender to be confirmed. A post-mortem examination has not yet taken place.
The area where the remains were found is just outside the Peak District and is a popular walking spot.
Detectives said they had launched a murder investigation and asked for anyone who may have seen anything unusual in the area to contact them.
