"Suspicious items" were found at the 27-year-old's home on Naseby Road in Alum Rock, West Midlands Police said.
Police went to the address following reports of the man walking around with a hammer. A search revealed substances in unlabelled bottles.
Detectives are investigating his "background, links and recent movements".
The contents of the bottles are being analysed by specialists.
Homes in the street were temporarily evacuated on Sunday while police, the fire service and army officers conducted safety checks on the items, but explosive experts said there was no immediate risk to the public.
