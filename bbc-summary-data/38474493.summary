[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow v Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow manager Paul Cox has a fully-fit squad for the FA Cup third-round tie against Rochdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Jordan Williams is set to keep his place in the starting line-up after returning from suspension in Monday's 4-1 defeat at Gateshead.
Rochdale's Joe Bunney suffered a fractured metatarsal earlier this week and will be out for three months.
Peter Vincenti (ankle) and Brian Barry-Murphy (Achilles) are absent, and Donal McDermott (illness) is a doubt.
