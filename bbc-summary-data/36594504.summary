The 30-year-old made 16 appearances for the English League One club last season after leaving Blackpool.
St Mirren manager Alex Rae said: "I worked with him a couple of years ago at Blackpool in the Championship - we have a quality player on our hands.
"It was just an opportunity really that presented itself. I knew Gary was looking to get back up the road."
MacKenzie began his career with Rangers, has also had spells with Dundee, Milton Keynes Dons and Bradford City and was called up to Scotland squads in 2011 and 2012 without winning a cap.
"He's experienced, he brings physicality," Rae told St Mirren's website. "You want to have a physicality throughout your team, but he's also a very good footballer."
MacKenzie, who also played four times on loan to Notts County in League Two last season, explained his desire to move back to Scotland.
"I've been in England for six years and I had moved the family back up to Scotland three years ago, but it hasn't been ideal," he said.
"When I spoke to Alex, he told me there was a possibility that I could come here, get back to playing and enjoying my football and going home to my family, it was very appealing.
"I obviously respect Alex and I've worked under him before - he's a good coach."
