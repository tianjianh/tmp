[SN]TITLE[SN]
M74 driver admits causing death on hard shoulder near Larkhall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver has admitted causing the death of a man by driving into him as he stood by his car on the hard shoulder of the M74 in South Lanarkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicholas Williams crashed into 60-year-old William Johnston in November 2014.
The 59 year old from Bristol offered a guilty plea to driving without due care and attention but this was rejected by the Crown.
He will now stand trial accused of the more serious offence of causing death by dangerous driving.
It is alleged that Williams travelled at "excessive speed" and did "repeatedly fall asleep" while behind the wheel.
It is also claimed he did "repeatedly change lanes without warning".
Williams is said to have gone onto the hard shoulder, hitting Mr Johnston and a stationary vehicle.
Prosecutors said Mr Johnston, of Biggar, South Lanarkshire, was left so severely injured that he died.
A trial was set for May next year in Glasgow and he was granted bail.
