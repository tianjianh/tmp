[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six people have been sentenced at the end of what Hampshire police described as its biggest ever drugs inquiry.

They were part of a Manchester-based gang which the force said controlled most of the heroin and cocaine trade in Southampton.
The six received sentences ranging from suspended jail terms to five-and-a-half years in prison.
In May, the gang's three leaders were sentenced to between nine and 12 years.
The gang's leaders were:
All three gang leaders were convicted of two counts of conspiracy to supply class A drugs and one count of money laundering.
Judge Peter Ralls QC told Southampton Crown Court the trio ran a "sophisticated and highly organised drug network".
Police said the group known as the Manchester Boys or Manks were thought to have controlled two-thirds of the heroin and cocaine market in Southampton, as well as establishing supply lines in Winchester and Brighton.
Over a period of 14 months, couriers made dozens of runs between Manchester and Southampton, exchanging drugs and cash at rendezvous points in the Midlands.
Hampshire Constabulary said 30 people had been convicted as part of Operation Buntline - the first time it had taken out an entire drugs network from top to bottom.
Det Ch Insp Ellie Hurd said: "There is a big market for class A drugs in certain parts of Hampshire.
"Every month we are arresting people involved in the supply of drugs and we are seizing cash, drugs and sometimes firearms."
