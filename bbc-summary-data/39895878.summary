Locations for the Guy Ritchie-directed movie included near the Bealach na BÃ , a pass in Applecross, and Devil's Pulpit, near Killearn.
Charlie Hunnam, who plays Arthur, said: "One of my favourite places in the UK is the Highlands of Scotland."
"When I found out that we were shooting there I was very, very excited."
The star of Pacific Rim and former TV series Sons of Anarchy and Byker Grove, added: "The Highlands of Scotland are absolutely sensational."
Hunnam made the comments in a video for VisitBritain, which has created a tourism campaign around the film.
The actor's experience of filming in the Scottish Highlands was starkly different from those of other film stars to have shot scenes there.
Scarlett Johansson described shooting scenes in Glen Coe in November 2011 for sci-fi Under the Skin as "brutal, cold and wet".
At the movie's world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, she told a news conference: "It was as if you had just picked us up and dropped us into the middle of absolutely nowhere.
"It was harsh and it was brutal and it was cold, it was wet and it was terrifying but we pulled through."
Michael Fassbender and Paddy Considine told of battling the elements on Skye while shooting 2015's Macbeth.
Fassbender, who starred in the lead role, described the island as "cold, wet and beautiful".
Considine said some of the other members of the cast succumbed to hypothermia during the filming.
He told the BBC at the film's Edinburgh premiere: "It got pretty bad there."
"A few people got hypothermia. We got hit by horizontal rain. It came and hit you sideways," added the actor who played Banquo.
Fassebender said the production encountered "rain, sleet and snow - all the wetness of the elements".
Another actor, Noel Clarke, told of getting frostbite during filming for the film Centurion in the Cairngorms in 2009.
However, the film crew for 2012's Bond flick Skyfall enjoyed themselves in Glen Coe and Glen Etive, and described being "absolutely blown away" by the Highland landscape and the sight of red deer stags.
