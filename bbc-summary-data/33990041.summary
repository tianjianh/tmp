Oil firm EnQuest reports sharp profit slump

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Sea oil firm EnQuest has reported sharp drops in revenue and profit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Aberdeen-based company said revenue was down 13% to $444m (Â£283m) compared with the first half of last year, with pre-tax profits down from $120m (Â£76m) to $11m (Â£7m).
Production rose by 17% in the first half of this year due to Malaysian fields but North Sea output declined.
The drop in profit was put down to the lower oil price and a reduction in the value of assets.
Enquest has significant projects in the UK North Sea requiring investment, including the Kraken field, east of Shetland.
Production in UK North Sea fields was down from 25,300 barrels per day to 21,900, while Malaysian production added 7,800 barrels per day.
Its half-year results show that it has reduced the operating cost per barrel from $45.90 to $39, and expects to continue cutting until it reaches the low thirties range.
The chief executive, Amjad Bseisu, said: "EnQuest has responded well to the lower oil price environment, delivering a strong performance driven by production gains and cost reductions.
"As the current capital programme reduces over the next two years and EnQuest benefits from lower cost operations and higher production, we expect to move into positive free cash flow at prevailing oil prices."
