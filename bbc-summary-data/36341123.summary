The French 29-year-old, ranked 14th in the world, was advised by his doctors to miss the tournament in Paris.
Monfils was beaten in the fourth round last year by Roger Federer, who withdrew from this year's tournament on Thursday because of a back injury.
The French Open draw takes place from 10:15 BST on Friday, with Britain's Andy Murray seeded second.
