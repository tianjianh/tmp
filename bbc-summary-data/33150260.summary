Strathallan T in the Park move gets entertainment licence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to move T in the Park festival to Strathallan Castle have crossed another major hurdle with the award of a public entertainment licence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move won the backing of Perth and Kinross Council's development management committee last month, and has now also been given the green light by the licensing committee.
The event is due to take place on the weekend of 10 to 12 July.
Aspects of the move have proved controversial with some residents.
Following a drawn-out planning process which included two public consultations, planning permission was given to stage the festival at Strathallan for the next three years, so its impact could be assessed.
Concerns raised among the 1,600 letters of objection sent to the council included traffic management and the potential impact on wildlife, including ospreys which nest near the site.
However, the planning application was unanimously backed by councillors after no attempt to block it was made.
Licensing committee members were warned that, as many of the same issues were likely to come up in the public entertainment licence debate, they should not move to refuse the application on a previously-heard objection unless they could show that the development management committee's "reasoning was flawed".
The committee unanimously agreed to grant a licence for this year's event, although not for the full three years approved by the planning board.
