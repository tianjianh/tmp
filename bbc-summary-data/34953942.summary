The North Antrim MLA made the comments in a speech at his party's conference.
Mr Allister told TUV members that the "rollover unionism" had "renewed its vows in government with the IRA".
He said the recent deal reached by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Sinn FÃ©in and British and Irish governments was "a series of climbdowns".
He slammed the executive's record in a number of policy areas, saying: "What a catastrophic failure DUP-Sinn FÃ©in misrule has been."
In criticising the executive's energy strategy, Mr Allister said: "Windbags and windfarms are putting us out of business."
He said the TUV would lay out a "positive vision" in the upcoming Northern Ireland Assembly election.
Underlining the party's support for a parliamentary system of voluntary coalition and opposition, Mr Allister said his party were the "trailblazers for democratising Stormont".
The TUV announced 11 candidates selected so far for next year's election.
They include Henry Reilly, the former Northern Ireland chairman of the UK Independence Party, who will stand in South Down.
