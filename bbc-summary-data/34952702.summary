Australia v New Zealand: Kiwis battle to save Adelaide Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Zealand face a battle for a victory to level the series after an eventful second day of the first day-night Test in Adelaide.

The Kiwis were reduced to 116-5 at stumps to lead by 94 runs with paceman Josh Hazlewood doing the damage with 3-32 under the lights with the pink ball.
Earlier, Australia were dismissed for 224 with wicketkeeper Peter Nevill top scoring with 66.
Australia lead 1-0 in the three-match series.
A crowd of 42,372 attended the second day, after 47,441 watched day one at the Adelaide Oval.
The hosts had added only 64 runs to their overnight total for the loss of six wickets when the scoreless Nathan Lyon was controversially reprieved by the decision review system at 118-8.
New Zealand appealed for a catch at slip after a Mitchell Santner ball hit Lyon's upper arm during an attempted sweep shot and then called for a review after it was turned down.
'Hot spot' technology showed a mark on Lyon's bat but third umpire Nigel Llong upheld the on-field decision.
The decision cost New Zealand their second and last review and triggered a momentum shift.
Lyon smashed Santner for 15 runs in one over, sweeping a four and a six, then another four behind square in three consecutive balls.
Nevill brought up a half-century before Lyon was caught by Kane Williamson in the slips off Trent Boult, having scored 34 vital runs in a ninth-wicket stand of 74.
Left-arm paceman Mitchell Starc hobbled to the crease after suffering a stress fracture to his right foot on day one - but blasted spinner Mark Craig for 20 runs in one over, smashing two fours and two sixes over wide long on, as Australia charged past New Zealand's total of 202.
The Kiwis eventually polished off the tail when Nevill lofted to Santner to give Doug Bracewell impressive figures of 3-18.
After Kiwi openers Martin Guptill (17) and Tom Latham (10) survived a tricky 30 minutes before the dinner break, Australia's bowlers dominated the evening session under the lights.
Hazlewood accounted for both openers before Mitchell Marsh chipped in with the wickets of Kane Williamson (nine) and skipper Brendon McCullum (20).
Australia tightened their control when Hazlewood trapped in-form Ross Taylor leg before for 34 just before the close of play.
Australia's team masseur and logistics co-ordinator Grant Baldwin was drafted in as a substitute fielder during New Zealand's second innings.
The 28-year-old, who played second XI cricket for Victoria eight years ago, was chosen to replace the injured Mitchell Starc.
Australia had three young players from their academy system available, but Cricket Australia opted for Baldwin, who has experience of fielding in tour matches. He even bowled an over for an Australia XI in South Africa last year.
However, Baldwin made several errors and South Australia's Sam Raphael has now been called up to fill in for Starc for the remainder of the Test.
