Tyson Fury: Frank Warren expects Ukad delay as BBBofC reiterate licence stance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyson Fury's boxing licence will not be reinstated until after his UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) hearing - which promoter Frank Warren fears could be in October.

Ukad last week postponed a hearing into the Briton testing positive for a banned substance in February 2015.
Fury, 28, had hoped to box in July but the British Boxing Board of Control told BBC Sport he is suspended "until the matter is dealt with by Ukad".
Ukad, which has not given a timeframe, does not comment on individual cases.
BBBofC general secretary Robert Smith said: "I haven't seen any new dates yet. I presume they are trying to sort them out with legal advisors but until that hearing, his licence is suspended."
Warren described the postponement of the hearing as a "liberty" and suggested the government could "intervene".
"Ukad have got a problem," said Warren. "He's entitled to make a living. If he's done wrong then get it over with. How can this be right? Why does it drag on from 2015?"
Fury also faces potential repercussions for refusing to fulfil a later test based on perceived persecution by Ukad.
Warren asserts this took place when the former heavyweight champion of the world was struggling to cope with depression and that when Fury's uncle and trainer called Ukad "an hour later", they "refused to come back".
Fury, 28, and his cousin and fellow heavyweight Hughie Fury, 22, were charged by Ukad in June 2016 as a result of urine tests conducted 14 months earlier which showed traces of nandrolone.
Between the failed tests and charge, Tyson Fury claimed the WBA, IBF and WBO world titles from Wladimir Klitschko, while Hughie Fury fought four times.
Both men deny any wrongdoing but their hearing was postponed after over two days when Ukad cited a "potential conflict of interest" on its panel.
Hughie Fury is still free to compete but Tyson lost his licence in October 2016 as the BBBofC moved "pending further investigation into anti-doping and medical issues".
If the case is dismissed, Warren hopes Fury will fight on 8 July on the undercard of Billy Joe Saunders' WBO middleweight title defence against Avtandil Khurtsidze in London.
