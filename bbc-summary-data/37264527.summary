[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 1-2 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fine double from Omar Bogle saw Grimsby end Luton's unbeaten record at Kenilworth Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luton substitute Glen Rea had cancelled out Bogle's first-half opener on the hour-mark, but Grimsby's in-form striker won the game on 82 minutes.
The visitors had the best early chance with Bogle dragging an effort wide, before Luke Summerfield's fierce drive drew a fine block from defender Alan Sheehan.
Home goalkeeper Christian Walton made a splendid save on 20 minutes, tipping over Dominic Vose's 20-yard deflected drive.
They took the lead on 29 minutes when Bogle netted his sixth of the season, finishing with ease after Summerfield's shot rebounded into his path.
Bogle looped another header over the top, while in the second period, Walton had to make an excellent low save from the striker's angled drive.
The Hatters finally had their first shot on target with 50 minutes gone, Jack Marriott's half-volley well saved by James McKeown.
The Grimsby goalkeeper then denied Mariott twice in quick succession with fine stops, before he was beaten on 59 minutes when Rea arrowed a shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards.
The Mariners won it with seven minute to go as Kayden Jackson's pinpoint cross was headed in by Bogle.
