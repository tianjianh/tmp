The 26-year-old has scored four tries in 12 Test appearances, but has not played for his country since 2013.
He has been at Japan Top League side Toyota Industries Shuttles since July 2015, after leaving Blue Bulls.
"For Ospreys to secure such a quality player is a major coup. We look forward to welcoming him to the region," said general manager Andrew Millward.
"JJ is a much-needed, quality addition to the squad, who not only brings experience at the highest end of the game, but also a real dynamism in the wider channels."
Millward said the retirement of Andrew Bishop and Ashley Beck's knee injury had left Ospreys "stretched at times" in midfield.
He added: "JJ is the kind of player who, with his physical attributes, can be really captivating. We want to compete at the very top level and he is the kind of player you need to be able to do so.
"He fits the mould in terms of what we are looking for in his position. Supplementing our current options with a quality player like JJ will help us as we look to compete on two fronts in 2016."
Engelbrecht, who can also play wing, but specialises in the outside centre position, has also played for Western Province, Stormers and Bulls.
