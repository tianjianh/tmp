Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust came under fire following the death of Connor Sparrowhawk, who drowned in a bath at Slade House in Oxford.
Now an internal report has criticised the trust's "poor or non-existent" communication with families.
Its boss Katrina Percy resigned earlier this month after public pressure.
The report was carried out by psychologist and researcher Stephany Carolan, who spoke to 17 people from 12 families.
All of them had family members whose deaths were investigated by the trust between April 2013 and March 2016.
Ms Carolan said one father found out about his daughter's death "via a convoluted route that involved Facebook" when the trust had his contact details.
She said: "Many of the families interviewed expressed intense anger about the experiences that they had, and scepticism that this review would result in any change.
"This anger came from repeated failures by the trust to communicate with them."
Julie Dawes, interim chief executive at the trust, said the report "makes very difficult reading for us".
She said: "I want to personally apologise for the distress our investigation processes may have caused in the past.
"We know we need to improve and we are committed to doing things better."
She added that an update on the changes would be given to the families involved in six months.
