The 29-year-old, whose previous deal was due to run out this summer, joined the Toffees in 2012 and has scored 39 goals in 171 appearances.
Everton made the announcement before their final home Premier League game of the season against Watford on Friday.
"I want to win a trophy here - this is the best club for me," the Belgium international said. "We are heading in the right direction."
Mirallas has scored four times in 33 league appearances this season and has made more than 30 appearances in each of his five seasons at Goodison Park.
"We have an amazing manager, an amazing team and amazing fans," he added.
"This is an exciting time for the club. I hope we sign some top players to fight for the Champions League places next season."
