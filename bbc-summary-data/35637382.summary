[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Jack Marriott got the winner in the 76th minute as he fired in from a tight angle under keeper Barry Roche.
Before that, Luton's Craig Mackail-Smith had gone close for the hosts, who move up to 13th place.
Shrimps' Kevin Ellison and Chris Doyle both forced good saves and Ryan Edwards headed over late on, but they have now lost eight of their last nine games.
