Basildon stabbing: Joram Bakumanya jailed for life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for life for murdering an uncle trying to protect his niece from unwanted advances.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Mitchell-Monroe went to get a haircut during a shopping trip with his 23-year-old niece in June 2016.
When she was on her own she was approached by Joram Bakumanya, 22, in the Market Pavement area of Basildon.
Her uncle, when he came to help her, was stabbed three times by Bakumanya, who was found guilty of murder by a Chelmsford Crown Court jury.
The court was told how Bakumanya, of no fixed address, fled and discarded the kitchen knife used in the attack on 37-year-old Mr Mitchell-Monroe.
He was arrested in Timberlog Lane a short time later.
Bakumanya was told by Judge Patricia Lynch QC he would serve at least 25 years in prison.
Mr Mitchell-Monroe's family has previously described him as their "hero", and said his death had left them "devastated".
Det Insp Al Pitcher, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: "Joram Bakumanya is a very dangerous and callous individual who had armed himself earlier in the day and then committed a savage attack on Mr Mitchell-Monroe.
"This deadly incident was initiated by Bakumanya when he began harassing a young woman who was just out shopping on a summer afternoon.
"Feeling concerned for her safety, she telephoned her uncle to ask him for help."
