[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Down pulled off a surprise result in Division Two by running out 1-15 to 1-07 winners away to Ulster rivals Derry.

It means back-to-back victories for a county who were relegated last year and started this season with two defeats.
The Mourne men made a stunning start and had 1-10 on the board before Derry got their first score on 26 minutes.
Elsewhere in Division Two, Fermanagh are bottom of the table after falling to a 4-14 to 0-14 defeat at the hands of Kildare in Newbridge.
The result achieved by Down will raise eyebrows as the county's football fortunes were thought to be at a low ebb.
I expected a lot more from Derry as everyone knew the losers today would be under pressure of relegation.
Eamonn Burns' men reeled off an amazing run of scores through Barry O'Hagan (3), Darragh O'Hanlon (3), Caolan Mooney (2), Joe Murphy, Conor Maginn and a goal by Ryan Johnston to lead 1-10 to 0-0.
Conor McAtamney got Derry's first point which was quickly followed by a goal scored  by Niall McGuckin.
When McAtamney and Emmet McGuckin tagged on further scores, a Derry revival appeared to be underway.
But Down kept their nerve and deserved their eight-point success.
Meanwhile at Newbridge, Fermanagh were no match for promotion-chasing Kildare.
Fermanagh landed the opening three points but were then blown away by the Lilywhites.
Midfielder Tommy Moolick snapped up two goals and corner-forward Chris Healy also found the net.
Fermanagh got the last four points of the half to trail 3-06 to 0-09 at the interval.
However, Kildare effectively killed off the game by scoring a goal and three without reply at the start of the second half.
It was full-forward Daniel Flynn who bagged the hosts' fourth goal to leave Fermanagh heading for their third defeat from four matches in Division Two.
Barry Mulrone, Sean Quigley and Tomas Corrigan got among the points, but the Erne men had Ryan Jones sent off late on.
"The goals had a massive bearing on the game," said Fermanagh manager Pete McGrath.
"There was a 13-minute spell when they scored 3-6 and two of those were preventable and down to lapses in concentration.
"Kildare are physically imposing and outgunned us.
"We battled but we were playing against a team better than ourselves."
