England batsman James Taylor says he is ready to return to Test cricket against Pakistan after a three-year absence.

The 25-year-old, dropped after averaging 16 in his only two Tests in 2012, faces competition from Jonny Bairstow for the three-Test series in the United Arab Emirates.
"Three years of experience have helped. I know my game better," Taylor said.
England play Pakistan A on Monday, the first of two two-day tour games before the first Test starts on 13 October.
Taylor's highest score in two Tests against South Africa in 2012 was 34.
However, he averaged 49.55 for Nottinghamshire in the County Championship this summer, including a career-best 291 against Sussex.
He hit his maiden international century and finished as the second highest run-scorer in England's one-day series against Australia in September.
"I've scored the volume of runs I was asked to, to get back in the side," he said.
"I also have the confidence of knowing I've scored runs against the best sides in the world."
"It has been a frustrating few years. Getting those knock-backs - when I thought I was going to get selected and wasn't - kind of drive you forward and spur you on that bit more."
