Limavady man Joe McCloskey pleads guilty to one punch attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man from County Londonderry has pleaded guilty to carrying out an attack on a man.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joe McCloskey, 38, from Anderson Crescent in Limavady, pleaded guilty to committing the attack in Derry in September 2014.
McCloskey, who has previously served 20 jail sentences, knocked his victim unconscious outside a bar on Foyle Street.
He has received an eight month jail sentence, suspended for two years.
Among his previous convictions are four for indecency offences, 14 for drugs offences and numerous public order and driving offences.
The attack on Foyle Street followed an exchange of words between McCloskey and his victim.
A barrister said McCloskey had recently started a job and took the matter "very seriously".
He said that after McCloskey knocked his victim unconscious, there was no follow-up attack against the man.
District Judge Barney McElholm described McCloskey's actions as "stupid" and said he could "just as easily have been before the court facing a murder charge, hoping that it would be reduced to a charge of manslaughter".
"This is the sort of thing that has to be discouraged.
"This cowardly practice that has developed to hit people with sucker punches without warning is an extremely dangerous phenomenon.
"We have seen all too often the results of such punches are essentially death or very serious brain injuries."
McCloskey was also ordered to pay his victim Â£750 in compensation within twenty-six weeks.
