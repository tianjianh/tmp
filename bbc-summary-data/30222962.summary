This time the guys have become the first group to have their first four albums debut at number one in the US.
Their fourth album, conveniently named Four, topped the Billboard 200 album chart having sold 387,000 copies in its first week.
Four is the second-fastest selling album of the year in the US. Only Taylor Swift's 1989 sold more in its opening week with 1.28m sales.

Take Me Home - 2012
Midnight Memories - 2013
The album also went to number one in the UK on Sunday.
Speaking to Scott Mills on the Radio 1 Chart Show, Liam Payne said the response to the new album had been "huge".
He went on to describe feeling "like a president" when the band arrived by speed boat at the US launch of the album at Universal Studios in Florida.
"I was told there was going to be 200 people but there. There was like 10,000. It's pretty amazing, I don't understand how," he said.
The 21-year-old also confirmed that Four would not be the group's last album and said reports that it would be were based on "jokes".
He added: "Whatever you say you are held to account for. It's ridiculous. About 97, 98 per cent of the stuff we say is stupid stuff."
One Direction were named artists of the year at this week's American Music Awards with Four also being named album of the year and favourite pop/rock album.
The band were also named best international artist at the Aria Awards in Australia on Wednesday night.
