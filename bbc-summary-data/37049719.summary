Borja relishes Llorente Swansea City link-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Swansea City signing Borja says "healthy competition" with fellow Spanish striker Fernando Llorente will benefit the team.

The 23-year-old signed from Atletico Madrid for a club record fee of Â£15m following Fernando's Llorente's move from Sevilla.
Borja said: "We can adapt and play with two strikers or just one, whatever the boss asks from us."
The record signing will not play in Swansea's season opener at Burnley.
Borja added on Llorente: "We don't know each other personally but I've been told he's a really good guy.
"I'm sure we'll both work together well and do whatever's best for the team."
Borja was born in Madrid and came through the academy at Atletico, but has spent the past five seasons on loan away from the Vicente Calderon.
"Of course there's a bit of frustration I didn't play much at Atletico," said Borja, who scored 18 goals last season in La Liga for Eibar.
"I grew up there, went through the ranks and wish I'd had more of an opportunity in the first team."
Despite competition from La Liga and Premier League sides for the Spaniard's signature, Borja says his decision to join Swansea was not difficult.
"Swansea showed the most interest, they seemed to want me more than anyone else," he said.
"It's a great club who have a lot of confidence in their players and I really want to make a good impression here."
Unlike 31-year-old Llorente, who was a part of his Spain's 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012-winning squads, Borja has yet to earn a senior call-up for his country.
But he hopes to emulate ex-Swans striker Michu, who went on to earn a cap for his country after a prolific season with Swansea.
"Michu did a great job at Swansea which eventually earned him a place in Spain's squad," said Borja.
"If only I could score as many goals as he did, helping the team in every possible way, for the good of Swansea, but also to put myself in the frame for national selection too."
