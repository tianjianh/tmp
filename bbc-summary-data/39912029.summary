[SN]TITLE[SN]

Liverpool are hopeful forward Roberto Firmino will be fit to play on Sunday despite a muscle problem.

If he is unavailable then the Reds could deploy the same starting line-up which began the 4-0 win at West Ham.
Jurgen Klopp's side need a win to guarantee qualification for next season's Champions League.
Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew may again be without Daniel Ayala, Gaston Ramirez and Victor Valdes because of injury.
Guy Mowbray: "It's all very simple.
"Liverpool need to win for a top-four place. They're at home to a side that has already been relegated. Liverpool win.
"Now put yourself in the position of a Reds fan if it's still 0-0 after 75 minutes, with Arsenal in front against Everton. Heart going faster?
"Take it a notch higher and see yourself as a Liverpool player in that scenario. Tension rising, snatching at chances, with Boro summoning up the spirit of their last visit to Anfield in the League Cup two seasons ago.
"All very dramatic - and that's how we'd like it on Match Of The Day!
"In reality, it's likely to come back to two words from earlier.
"Liverpool win."

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "The Champions League, for different reasons, is a wonderful competition. You can earn a lot of money there, that's money we didn't have last year - but we are already in a good position.
"We are a club without financial problems and we have money to spend but it makes sense to think before we spend and that is what we are doing.
"The Champions League would be the icing on the cake but that's it."
Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: "I've enjoyed it in some ways because I knew it was a huge challenge. But at the end of the season we didn't get what we set out to achieve and that has come as a huge disappointment.
"The players and I have a very good relationship based on mutual respect, but together we haven't won enough football matches.
"It's been difficult to accept, but at the same time I've learnt lots and learning about yourself helps you move forward."
One big effort from Liverpool will get them over the line, and there will be a good atmosphere which will help.
It is a big game and if they are not revved up and they cannot beat Boro, then they do not deserve to be in the Champions League.
