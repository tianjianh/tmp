[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It wasn't just Hull City and fellow relegation-sufferers Burnley and QPR who bade farewell to the Premier League on the final day of the season.

For some of the division's most celebrated stars, it was also time to say goodbye.
For some it was a fairytale farewell; for others, a nightmare ending. Some will be remembered as club legends; others bow out unwanted.
Here, BBC Sport looks at five farewells that defined the final day - and five more stars who could be on the move over the summer.
Who he's leaving: Manchester City.
Where he's going: New York City FC (Major League Soccer).
His final match: Lampard couldn't have scripted his 609th and last Premier League appearance any better. The midfielder signed off in style with a typical goal, rifling home James Milner's cut-back from ten yards out to help Manchester City beat Southampton 2-0.
What he said: "I couldn't have wished for anything else. I'm proud of all of it. I'm a lucky boy, to come to a big club like this for a season, I've made a lot of friends. For a young boy with a dream to play in the Premier League, to go to my hometown club West Ham and then go to Chelsea and win everything, it doesn't get better."
What they said: "I think he deserves the farewell all our fans gave him in the stadium. It was very important also for him to score. I think it was the perfect afternoon and perfect goodbye for him. He deserves it for his brilliant career and being a great person" - Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini.
Who he's leaving: Liverpool.
Where he's going: LA Galaxy (Major League Soccer).
His final match: Gerrard's Premier League swansong could not have been more different from that of his former Premier League team-mate Lampard. The Liverpool legend endured a nightmare send-off as his side were hammered 6-1 by Stoke - although he did at least get on the scoresheet.
What they said: "I am sure Steven wasn't anticipating the manner of that being his last performance, but credit to him, he was trying to drive his team on. It is only right and proper we recognise the impact he has had in English football and at his club as well. I wish him well, he has been a credit to his country and his club as well" - Stoke manager Mark Hughes.
Who he's leaving: Chelsea.
Where he's going: As yet unknown.
His final match: Drogba was taken off injured in the first half and was carried from the pitch by his team-mates. Chelsea went on to record a 3-1 win over Sunderland.
What he said: "I want to play for at least one more season and in order to play more football I feel I need to go to another club. All the fans know my love for Chelsea and I hope to be back here in the future in another role."
What they said: "For these players to know him, to train with him, to play with him, to live with him, to share with him I think is fantastic. He was very, very good for these young people, people like Hazard, Willian, Oscar. These people learned from a good example" - Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho.
Who he's leaving: Manchester United.
Where he's going: Back to parent club Monaco.
His final match: Turned out to be the 1-1 draw with Arsenal on 17 May, where he waved goodbye to United fans when he was substituted. Missed the final-day match with Hull due to injury.
What they said: "Falcao is a top professional and a good human being. On behalf of myself and everyone at the club I would like to wish him well for the future. I am the manager and I have to decide which players are to go and which have to come" - Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.
Who he's leaving: West Ham.
Where he's going: Plans to take an extended break from football.
His final match: Allardyce's tenure at West Ham ended in disappointing fashion as his side were beaten 2-0 by Newcastle. He was subjected to abuse from travelling supporters as Newcastle went ahead.
What he said: "I didn't want to stay. I suppose you could say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either. I thought it was the right time to leave - and probably the right time for me and the club."
What they said: "He leaves the club in a considerably better state than when he arrived and, for that, the board are truly grateful" - West Ham chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold.
Who he might be leaving: Burnley.
Where he might be going: Linked with Liverpool and Real Sociedad.
What he said: "It was quite an emotional day for me today. I think everybody knows what's been going on off the pitch and I wanted to finish my last game here in style."
Who he might be leaving: QPR.
Where he might be going: Linked with Southampton and Newcastle.
His final match: Austin scored a consolation goal as relegated QPR were beaten 5-1 by Leicester in their last Premier League game.
Who he might be leaving: Liverpool.
Where he might be going: Linked with Manchester City and Arsenal.
What they said: "Raheem has two years left on his deal and I expect him to see those two years through" - Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers.
Who he might be leaving: Chelsea.
Where he might be going: Linked with Arsenal.
What he said: "This is the end of the season and I will have time to sit down and do all the thinking and decide what I want to do. I want to compete with the best players every week and if I go anywhere I hope it will be the same as this incredible journey I had with Chelsea."
Who he might be leaving: Manchester City.
Where he might be going: Linked with Liverpool and Arsenal.
What they said: "James will make a decision at the end of the season. He is a very important player and he gave us a lot of spirit for the whole season. He must decide his future and what is best for him."
