A 21-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the death of Irish student Karen Buckley, Police Scotland say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Miss Buckley, from Cork, was reported missing after a night out in Glasgow on Saturday.
Police said a body had been found at a farm to the north of Glasgow, following a four-day search for the student.
Formal identification of the remains has not yet taken place, they said.
Miss Buckley's relatives have been informed about the discovery, which was made on a farm on the outskirts of Milngavie, six miles from Glasgow city centre.
Specialist police divers, a helicopter crew and search dogs have all been involved in the search for the qualified nurse, who moved to Glasgow in February to study occupational therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University.
Her handbag was discovered in Glasgow's Dawsholm Park on Tuesday and officers later began searching land around High Craigton Farm near Milngavie.
The man was formally arrested after being detained for questioning on Wednesday. He is expected to appear at a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Friday.
Miss Buckley was seen on CCTV leaving Glasgow's Sanctuary nightclub with a man in the early hours of Sunday.
She had arrived at the nightclub with friends at about 23:45 on Saturday and at about 01:00 she told them she was going to the toilet. She failed to return and did not take her jacket.
Her friends have said she had had a few drinks, but was not drunk.
Police said later that they had traced a man who told them he had travelled with Miss Buckley by car to a flat in Dorchester Avenue, in the Kelvinside area of the city, but he said she had left at about 04:00 on Sunday.
Miss Buckley's family travelled from Cork to Scotland on Tuesday to make an appeal for information.
A special prayer service was held near her home in Mallow on Wednesday, and a fundraising page set up by Miss Buckley's former classmates to support her family had raised over Â£28,000 by 12:30 on Thursday.
Irish consular staff have been helping the family since Miss Buckley's disappearance.
Ireland's minister for foreign affairs, Charlie Flanagan, said the thoughts and prayers of everyone in the country were with the Buckley family.
He added: "On behalf of the government, I wish to express appreciation for all that has been done by the Scottish authorities, and especially Police Scotland in Glasgow, to find Karen and to support the Buckley family throughout this very difficult time."
In a statement, Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) said it was "deeply saddened" by the events.
The statement added: "Our thoughts are with Karen's family, friends and classmates at this very difficult time. GCU's student support service, our academic staff, and the advice centre at the Student's Association are available to any students who need support."
