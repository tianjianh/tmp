[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A leading consultant has told a jury that a baby girl who was rushed to hospital by paramedics was "effectively dead'' when she arrived.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney was giving evidence at the trial of west Belfast man Christopher O'Neill, who denies murdering his baby daughter Cárágh .
Three-month-old Cárágh Walsh died on 7 February 2014.
She died two days after being taken to hospital from her Glasveigh Park home in Twinbrook.
Dr Maney was giving evidence on the second day of the trial at Craigavon Crown Court, sitting in Armagh, of Mr O'Neill, 26, from Whiterock Road.
It was suggested to the jury on the opening day of the trial by a prosecution counsel that a reason for the baby's death was that "perhaps he, ( Mr O'Neill) had snapped because she was crying and he could not get her to settle, only he knows that''.
The lawyer said it was not suggested that Mr O'Neill intended to kill his baby daughter, but that being unable to quieten her, he "must have lost self-control and that he caused those catalogue of injuries identified by the pathologists".
Dr Maney told the trial on Wednesday that on 5 February, 2014, the hospital received a call to the red "emergency telephone'' on the paediatric ward advising that a paramedic crew was on its way with a three-month-old baby girl who was in cardiac arrest.
When the ambulance arrived at the hospital doors, it was met by Dr Maney and her team who rushed baby Cárágh in for emergency treatment.
Dr Maney told the jury: "At this point we took over her airways. She had agonising breathing. Her breathing was not sufficient to sustain her life.
"She needed assisted breathing. She had no heart rate. She was effectively dead.''
The consultant paediatrician said that as a result "time was of the essence'' and her team of experts set about trying to save the baby's life.
The doctor told the trial judge that a needle was inserted into the infant's bloodstream through the bone marrow in her shin bone with "life saving medication to restart her heart''.
"At 12.43pm her heart was resuscitated. We started to feel pulses in her groin. We listened to her heart. She had heart sounds and the chest compressions were discontinued. Her cardiovascular system was responding."
Asked by the prosecution counsel if baby Cárágh was stablised at that stage, Dr Maney replied: "I would say her rate had come back.
"We had taken over her breathing but she was still gravely ill. We needed to support her breathing and give her constant care and support on a life-support machine. An anaesthetist inserted a tube from her mouth to her lungs.''
Earlier, emergency medical technician Paul McParland told the jury how on 5 February, 2014, he received an emergency call to go to Glasveigh Park as an infant had taken ill.
He said that he was about to climb the steps to the second floor flat when he was met by a colleague, Mr Heaney, who was carrying baby Cárágh out in his arms.
Mr McParland said that as he made his way back to the ambulance he was "met by a considerably highly emotional woman who tried to run towards Mr Heaney and I blocked her path''. He added that he did not know at the time that it was the baby's mother.
The court heard from the witness that the baby's father then got into the ambulance and the seriously ill baby was rushed to the Royal Victoria Hospital, arriving within five to seven minutes.
Under cross examination by a defence counsel, Mr McParland confirmed to the jury that he did not notice any marks or swelling on the baby when he attached a defibrillator to her body.
