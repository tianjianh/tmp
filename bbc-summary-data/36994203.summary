[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 1-2 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool scored two goals in 90 seconds as they completed an unlikely comeback at Exeter League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam McAlinden put Exeter ahead, but a double blow inflicted by Hartlepool in the second half saw Michael Woods and Billy Paynter secure the points for the visitors.
Before his goal, McAlinden had a chance for Exeter after 17 minutes when he ran onto Tom McCready's long ball forward, but his shot took a deflection and went over the bar.
However, McAlinden broke the deadlock after 31 minutes when Ollie Watkins reacted quickly to a quick Craig Woodman throw and pulled the ball back to the former Wolves striker, who rolled the ball across goal and into the far corner.
Hartlepool were poor and made a double change at the break and it was one of those new faces, Padraig Amond who should have levelled straight after half-time, but he poked wide of goal after some poor Exeter defending.
Ollie Watkins then hit the post for Exeter before Lloyd James curled a free-kick against the top of the crossbar as the hosts sought a second goal.
Hartlepool equalised after 74 minutes as Exeter failed to clear and Woods rammed home the loose ball.
Soon after it was 2-1, as Lewis Alessandra crossed low into the box and Paynter lashed home from 10 yards to give Hartlepool the lead. Watkins missed Exeter's best chance to equalise as he glanced a header wide.
