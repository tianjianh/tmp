A broken-down trawler with six fishermen onboard was towed to Lochinver in Sutherland by Lochinver RNLI on Wednesday night.
Earlier on Wednesday, Kyle of Lochalsh RNLI went to the aid of a man stuck on his small boat in rough conditions in Glenelg Bay.
A Met Office warning of high winds is in place until 13:00 on Thursday.
Forecasters warn that winds could gust to 75mph across the Hebrides, Sutherland, Caithness and Orkney.
Gusts of 50-60 mph are likely in many areas of Scotland during that period of the warning, which started from 01:00 on Thursday.
High winds have already been affecting large parts of Scotland west coast and the Highlands.
Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne said poor weather conditions has been causing disruption on many of its routes.
Kyle of Lochalsh RNLI's call-out on Wednesday afternoon saw the crew help a man get to shore from where his small boat was tied up in Glenelg Bay.
The man was safely dropped off at the ferry slipway at Glenelg.
