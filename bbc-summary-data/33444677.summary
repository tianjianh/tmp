Yang Guang, nicknamed Sunshine, was happily swinging on his hammock, chomping away on bamboo, when a big stick of it fell on him and made him jump.
The moment was captured by a CCTV camera in Sunshine's enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo.
Alison Maclean, who works with the giant pandas, said: "Yang Guang is normally a very peaceful and calm animal, who loves sleeping and eating.
He had quite a fright though when a stick of bamboo he'd forgotten he'd put aside for later fell and broke the silence!
Our bear quickly recovered though and happily went back to lazing about and giving himself a good scratch."
