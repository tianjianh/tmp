What does new hospital mean for Glasgow?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new South Glasgow University Hospital will be one of the biggest campuses in Europe and it will mean a massive shake-up to health services in the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new campus is built on the site of the old Southern General in Govan in the south west of the city.
It will house a new 1,109-bed adult hospital and a 256-bed children's hospital.
There will also be a two major A&E departments - one for adults and one for children - a maternity hospital and state-of-the-art laboratory services.
Every patient in the general wards in the 14-floor hospital will have their own single room with an en-suite and views out across the campus.
Demolition of the old Southern General surgical block will begin in the summer and be completed by the middle of 2016.
The brand new children's hospital on the South Glasgow site is next door to the adult hospital but it has a separate identity and entrance.
It is a five-storey building with 256 beds and will replace the existing Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill in June.
Patients from the old Victoria Infirmary and the nearby Mansionhouse Unit will begin the move to the new hospital in May.
The new Victoria, across the road from the old building, will continue its outpatient and minor injuries functions
Some services from the Western Infirmary, such as renal dialysis, will begin the move to the South Glasgow in April.
The Western Infirmary outpatients and minor injuries unit will move to the Yorkhill site until they move to Gartnavel in 2016.
The plan is to close the old Victoria and the Western Infirmary when the move is complete.
Gartnavel will transfer some services, such as ENT inpatients, to the South Glasgow and it will take in some services from the Western.
The accident and emergency departments at the Victoria and the Western infirmaries will close once the South General move is complete.
After the move is completed there will be two A&Es serving Glasgow - at the South Glasgow and the Royal Infirmary.
The Vale of Leven Hospital, New Stobhill Hospital and the New Victoria will retain a Minor Injury Unit (MIU) for sprains, burns and simple fractures.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said that it would embark on a massive communication drive across the city to make sure everyone was aware of the changes.
Leaflets will be delivered to every household affected, outlining the changes to A&E provision.
The refurbishment of the Southern General Maternity Unit was completed before construction of the new hospital began.
The hospital is a national centre for certain specialist services for newborn babies and provides state-of-the-art intensive care services.
The opening of the unit enabled maternity services at the former Queen Mother's Hospital at Yorkhill to close.
Glasgow now has two maternity units - the South Glasgow and the Princess Royal at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
