Sir Winston Churchill's funeral plans up for auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Meticulous plans detailing Sir Winston Churchill's funeral are to be sold.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They map out the procession, St Paul's Cathedral ceremony, military flypast, and the coffin's transportation on the Thames and by train for burial in Oxfordshire.
Seller Janet Bunnett was given the plans of "Operation Hope Not" by her policeman father, who worked the day of the funeral, on 30 January 1965.
They are expected to fetch between £400 and £600 when they are auctioned later.
Ms Bunnett, of Westerham, Kent, said her father Philip Bainbridge told her people were "running around like scolded chickens" behind the scenes on the day.
The former prime minister had died of a stroke on 24 January.
Talking of her father's role, Ms Bunnett said: "He was pretty busy.
"He didn't say an awful lot about it. I think he was sad to have to do it, because he'd been all through the war, and of course Winston Churchill was very famous.
"But he just wanted to do it well for the Old Man. So that's what they did, they worked really hard."
One million mourners lined the route, while 350 million people watched it on television around the globe.
The coffin was later transported via train to Oxfordshire for the private family burial in St Martin's Church in Bladon, close to Blenheim Palace.
Ms Bunnett said she was auctioning off the documents because she could not choose which of her six grandchildren to pass them on to.
"I thought if I could sell it... I could give them £100 each," she added.
"I know it's not a lot of money, but it would be something from their great granddad."
The documents go under the hammer at Farleigh Court Golf Course near Warlingham, Surrey.
Also on sale is a Winston Churchill Toby jug from 1940.
Designed by Clarice Cliff after Churchill became prime minister, only 350 of the 31cm (12.2 in) high jugs were produced.
It is estimated to sell for between £600 and £1,000.
