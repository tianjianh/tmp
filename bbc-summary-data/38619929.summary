[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 2-0 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Hartlepool manager Dave Jones looked on as goals from Nicky Featherstone and Brad Walker earned the hosts a much-needed win over Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jones, watching the action from the stands ahead of taking charge on Monday, saw the hosts produce an accomplished display at the Northern Gas and Power Stadium.
Pools dominated possession from the off but spurned a great chance to take the lead when striker Rhys Oates was denied from the penalty spot following Ronnie Henry's 40th-minute handball.
It mattered little, though, as the hosts netted twice in the next six minutes.
Featherstone grabbed the opener, firing into the roof of the net after seeing an initial effort superbly saved by Jamie Jones, before Walker, restored to the starting line-up, turned home a second following good work from Oates.
Stevenage responded well in the second half, with Matt Godden twice rattling the crossbar either side of a Tom Pett header which went narrowly wide.
But Hartlepool, who also went close through substitute Padraig Amond, ultimately secured a deserved victory.
