Anthony Steele was hurt when the dog's tether got tangled in his wheel in Heysham, Lancashire, in August 2012.
He suffered fractures to his skull, shoulder and ribs and a permanent loss of hearing in one ear.
The 59-year-old said he made the insurance claim "so people are aware of the dangers of retractable dog leads".
Mr Steele was training on Heysham promenade for the Coast to Coast cycling event with around 10 other riders when he saw "a small white dog dart across my path".
"I had no idea of the severity of my injuries suffered until I had come round in hospital."
He said he had not cycled since his fall and now suffers from "permanent hearing loss, dizziness, headaches, balancing issues and pain in my right shoulder".
He added that he could not "quite believe all of this has been caused by someone who could not control their dog".
The compensation, which was awarded to help with his rehabilitation, was agreed in an out-of-court settlement ahead of a hearing in Manchester.
