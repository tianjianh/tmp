Bosnia and Serbia tussle over war crimes suspect Oric

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bosnian prosecutors have urged Switzerland to hand over a former Bosnian Muslim commander arrested on 10 June - and not to send him to Serbia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Naser Oric was detained in Geneva on an international arrest warrant issued by Belgrade, which now wants him extradited to face trial in Serbia.
Serbia says he was involved in the deaths of nine ethnic Serbs in 1992.
He commanded Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) troops in Srebrenica - scene of the worst massacre by Bosnian Serb forces.
The latest dispute between Bosnia and Serbia comes at a sensitive time.
On 11 July Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic is due to attend a commemoration in Srebrenica for the massacre victims. Nearly 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were killed there in 1995.
Mr Oric was acquitted of war crimes by a UN tribunal in 2008.
The Bosnian state prosecutor's office said it had asked Switzerland to hand him over so that he could face trial in his own country. The office said it would co-operate with Serbian prosecutors and would consider their allegations against him.
