[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby schools closed by burst water pipe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two schools have been closed after a burst water pipe flooded the area with mud and silt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pipe in Chester Green, Derby, burst at about 04:30 GMT on Sunday, sending water gushing along Mansfield Road.
Ivy House School and Carlyle Infant School in Littleover were closed, while people in Chaddesden, Littleover and Mackworth reported brown water coming from taps.
Severn Trent Water said it could take up to five days to fix the problems.
Mansfield Road has been shut to traffic and bus services have been re-routed.
Sarah O'Kane from Severn Trent apologised for the inconvenience and said reasons for the pipe failure would not be known until the road had been dug up.
Shops and businesses on Mansfield Road are still open.
