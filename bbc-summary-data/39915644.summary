The Tigers will play in the Championship next season after losing 4-0 at Crystal Palace.
Silva took charge in January until the end of the season and led Hull to six wins in 17 league games.
"We have to analyse with the board and chairman," said the Portuguese after his side's relegation was confirmed.
Hull, four points from safety with one game left, return to the Championship 12 months after winning promotion via the play-offs.
Silva, 39, has been linked with a move to Southampton, who are managed by Frenchman Claude Puel.
"It is not a moment to look for excuses, what we felt in the last four or five games is that too many things have happened with our club," added Silva.
"I will talk to the board and the chairman first, talking inside the walls of the club.
"We started to lose in pre-season when we were making our preparation.
"We tried to do many things in January, but it's not good to be signing six or seven players in January, and losing two.
"The most important thing is for the club to understand what they did in a bad way, to prepare.
"You start to win or lose a season ahead one year in advance. I will give the board and the chairman my opinion, about what they need to do differently to make sure this doesn't happen.
"We'll talk in the next few days. Now it's time to be calm and see what is best, first for the future of the club, and also for my career as well."
Hull captain Michael Dawson admitted the team deserved relegation after poor form.
Despite having a better home record than eighth-placed Southampton, the Tigers managed just one away win and six points on the road.
"The feeling of relegation is a hard feeling to express," Dawson, 33, told BBC Sport.
"It wasn't today we got relegated. The manager gave us a fighting chance but we've come up short.
"We've had some tough away games. Our form has been terrible.
"Relegation is the worst feeling as a footballer. Twelve months ago, it was an unbelievable feeling. I know how hard it is to get out of out of the Championship. We'll regroup and come back fighting."

To say the Hull fans look disgruntled is an understatement. I wonder what the manager is thinking? Will he stay after relegation? I know what my money is on.
It has been a real surprise to me these last few games for Hull.
They got themselves in a situation where they could have stayed up but they have totally given up. You could almost say they have bottled it.
Crystal Palace were one point outside of the relegation zone after a run of one win in 11 games when Sam Allardyce took charge in December.
Victory over Hull ensures they are guaranteed a fifth straight season in the Premier League.

Palace have beaten Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool in recent weeks but went into the Hull match on the back of three straight defeats.
"To come away with wins against Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal, it shows you how big a task it was," said Allardyce.
"We've done it with a game to go."
