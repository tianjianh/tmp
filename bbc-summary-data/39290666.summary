He steered the county to two National League titles in 2002 and 2004, as well as promotion in the Championship.
Derrick played over 200 matches for Glamorgan and New Zealand's Northern Districts as a seam bowler and lower-order batsman.
He worked for the Cricket Board of Wales until he was taken ill in August 2016, subsequently undergoing brain surgery and chemotherapy.
"JD embodied all that is good about cricket at both professional and club level. Glamorgan CCC, and Welsh cricket as a whole, has lost a great and loyal servant, and the game will be very much the poorer for his passing," said the county in a tribute statement.
Born in Cwmaman, Derrick made his senior county debut aged 20 and became a regular member of the first team, with his county career spanning the years 1983 to 1991.
He recorded a highest score of 78 not out and a best bowling performance of six for 54, and was handed his county cap in 1988.
Derrick moved into coaching and was involved with the first team in the late nineties, before taking over on a more permanent basis in 2002.
"When I finished playing, I wanted to help Glamorgan in any way the county needed me," he said at the time.
"I've never had a problem working where the county wants me."
His appointment quickly brought success as Glamorgan clinched the one-day National League title in 2002 and 2004, working with captain Steve James and his successor Robert Croft.
They also reached Twenty20 finals day in 2004 and were promoted to the First Division of the County Championship, but lasted just one season in the top flight.
Derrick was replaced as coach in 2006 but continued to work in Welsh cricket and play for his club Aberdare, as well as showing his expertise as a BBC Wales commentator.
He was appointed national performance director of the Cricket Board of Wales in 2010 and at the time of his illness, he was pursuing a hectic schedule developing future generations of Welsh talent.
He managed Wales's age-group sides for both boys and girls as well as the senior Wales women's side, attending matches throughout the summer and running nets through the winter.
A fundraising dinner organised by Glamorgan and the Professional Cricketers' Association in December of 2016 paid for modifications to his house, so that he could continue to live at home while undergoing chemotherapy.
