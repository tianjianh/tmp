[SN]TITLE[SN]
Overdue library book returned to school 120 years late

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An overdue school library book has finally been returned - 120 years late.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Microscope and its Revelations, by Dr William B Carpenter, was borrowed by former pupil Professor Arthur Boycott, who attended Hereford Cathedral School between 1886 and 1894.
It was discovered by his granddaughter Alice Gillett.
The school has promised to waive any fines - which based on the rate at Hereford Library of 17p a day, would have amounted to a staggering Â£7,446.

Mrs Gillett discovered the book while she was sorting through a collection of 6,000 books following the death of her husband earlier this year.
On discovering the HCS library stamp inside the book, Mrs Gillett, who lives near Taunton, decided to return it.
"I can't imagine how the school has managed without it," she said.
The book would have been of good use to young Boycott as he eventually graduated with first class honours in Natural Science and became a distinguished naturalist and pathologist.
