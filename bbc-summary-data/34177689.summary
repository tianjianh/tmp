The players complained of "terrible stomach aches" after eating a meal of spaghetti bolognaise on Sunday at the team's hotel in Minsk.
Luxembourg had contacted European football's governing body Uefa about possibly rescheduling the game.
But a team spokesperson says the players are feeling "much better".
The food poisoning came one day after Luxembourg, fifth in Euro 2016 qualifying Group C, beat Macedonia 1-0 at home.
Both Luxembourg and Belarus are already out of contention for qualifying for next year's tournament in France.
In 2006, 10 Tottenham players came down with food poisoning before a vital match with West Ham.
Spurs lost 2-1, enabling their rivals Arsenal to secure fourth place and a Champions League spot ahead of them.
