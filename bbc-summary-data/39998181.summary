Jedburgh schools campus plan moves closer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new education campus in a Scottish Borders town have moved a step closer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A pre-application notice was submitted on Friday, paving the way for full proposals for Jedburgh in due course.
The project would see Parkside and Howdenburn Primaries and Jedburgh Grammar School closed.
It would see the creation of a new campus with all education for children aged from two to 18 in the area taking place on one site at Hartrigge Park.
The ground was bought for housing by Jedburgh Town Council over 50 years ago but has not been developed.
Scottish Borders Council has said the campus would have state-of-the-art classrooms and learning spaces, the very best IT infrastructure and first-class leisure and dining provision, as well as the very best sporting and PE facilities.
Consultation into the proposals is currently ongoing in the area.
The project could be approved later this year with the new Jedburgh campus operational by 2020.
