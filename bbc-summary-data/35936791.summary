[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fugitive who was recaptured four years after jumping from a court room dock may never be released from prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Moran, 34, from Salford, was rearrested in a raid on a luxury villa on Spain's Costa Blanca in 2013.
Moran leapt from the dock and assaulted four security guards at Burnley Crown Court in February 2009.
Moran, described as having a "premier league criminal lifestyle" was given an indeterminate sentence and jailed for public protection.
Judge Norman Wright, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, said Moran posed a real danger to the public and will only be released when the parole board consider him safe.
Describing him as "ruthless, deceiving and cunning", he imposed a minimum tariff of eight years and 236 days.
"I have come to the conclusion that you are dangerous," the judge told Moran.
He had previously been sentenced for threatening Royal Mail guards with a gun, machete and baseball bat in Colne, Lancashire, in May 2005.
Moran went on the run after escaping from court and travelled to Paris, Monaco, Thailand and Italy before settling in Spain.
The judge said the raid in Colne was carried out with "military precision and discipline".
He added that 11 years after the robbery, the ferocity of the attack still lives with injured security guard James Hodkinson.
