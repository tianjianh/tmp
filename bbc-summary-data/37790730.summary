The photograph was taken by Fran Hockley, 29, of Stackpole, when she was diving off the coast of Skomer Island.
It was highly commended in the British Sub-Aqua Club's (BSAC) nationwide Great British Diving photography competition.
Ms Hockley said it was a "really lucky shot" but she was "delighted" with the recognition.
"There were lots of mums with their pups playing around and I took a few shots, but it wasn't until I got home that I realised how well this one had come out," she said.
About 340 photographs were entered into the competition and more than 2,300 people voted for the best image.
