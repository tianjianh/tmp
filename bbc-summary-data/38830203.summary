Manager Gianfranco Zola says the anger he and his players feel at Birmingham City's 10-game winless run will provoke a reaction and an upturn in fortunes.

Blues lost 1-0 at home to Reading on Tuesday - their eighth Championship match without a victory following Zola's appointment in mid-December.
"It is very frustrating to lose a game like this," the Italian told BBC WM.
"I was proud because the players gave every bit of energy. I feel sorry for them because they didn't deserve that."
Despite defeat against the Royals, Zola's side remain 12th in the table, and are only nine points adrift of the play-off places.
Blues were as high as fourth at the end of November under previous boss Gary Rowett, before he was sacked and replaced by the former Chelsea and Italy striker on 15 December.
Zola added: "There is a lot of anger inside at the moment - within myself and within the players.
"And this anger will get the reaction that we need to have. It cannot be like this all the time; it will happen.
"I saw a strong desire and motivation to react. There was good talking so I am expecting something; it will happen. We work hard and we don't deserve this."
