[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 1-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MK Dons marked Robbie Neilson's first home league game as manager with victory over AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The clubs, both offshoots of the old Wimbledon FC, have met four times, but never before in a league fixture, and the Dons have now won three.
Neilson's side were the most industrious throughout, restricting Wimbledon to just three shots on goal.
Dean Bowditch scored the game's only goal from the penalty spot after Dean Lewington was felled by Dannie Bulman.
The win was MK's first at home in the league in 16 games, dating back to 5 March last season when they were in the Championship, and the first since Neilson left Scottish Premiership side Hearts to take over from Karl Robinson on 2 December.
Despite the milestone win over a side that started life in the ninth tier of English football in 2002, the hosts remain 10 places and five points adrift of Neal Ardley's men.
While the fixture was another significant part of the two clubs' histories, it lacked the sort of fervour that surrounded their maiden meeting in the second round of FA Cup in 2012, a match with MK Dons won 2-1.
A crowd of 11,185 were at Stadium MK with away support of almost 2,000, despite a boycott by a number of AFC Wimbledon fans.
