How to follow the FA Cup final on the BBC
Wenger not sure if final will be his last game
Conte's Premier League champions came through Sunday's final league game against Sunderland without any injuries - so the Blues have a full squad to select from.
Wenger, whose team missed out on a Champions League spot for the first time in 20 years, have defensive problems.
Laurent Koscielny's sending off in the 3-1 win over Everton means he is suspended and is omitted from selection.
Gabriel was taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury and has been ruled out while Shkodran Mustafi has had concussion symptoms and remains doubtful.
Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hopes to return from a hamstring injury but long-term absentees Santi Cazorla and Lucas Perez are not in the running and thus not available for selection, either by Wenger or in the team you pick.
