The League One club have paid an undisclosed fee for the 20-year-old, who has agreed a two-and-a-half-year deal at Stadium MK.
Muirhead joined Hearts from Partick last summer and has scored twice in 19 appearances for the Edinburgh club.
The deal is subject to international clearance, but he could be in the squad against Northampton on Saturday.
"It's a new chapter in my career and hopefully I can kick on from now," said Muirhead.
"I worked with Robbie for the past six months and as soon as I heard he was interested, I knew I wanted to sign for him again."
Muirhead is Neilson's first signing since taking over as MK Dons boss in early December.
