The 40-year-old leaves the Ajax under-19 job he had just taken this summer to work with new head coach Unai Emery at the French champions.
Kluivert had spells with Ajax, Barcelona and Newcastle as a player and has been Netherlands assistant manager and managed Curacao's national side.
"I am extremely honoured to join such a great club," he said.
"I will conduct my mission with great ambition and rigour. We are all in Paris to reach the very high objectives set by the club and meet the expectations of the players and supporters alike.
"As I am moving to Paris, I would also like to express my gratitude to Ajax Amsterdam, the club thanks to which I discovered top-level football and which has always given me their trust."
