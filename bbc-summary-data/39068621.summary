[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nice 2-1 Montpellier

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nice striker Mickael le Bihan scored twice on his return after 17 months out with a broken leg as the Ligue 1 title contenders beat Montpellier.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Montpellier led when Steve Mounie took advantage of a defensive ricochet to fire home.
Le Bihan, whose last appearance was in September 2015, came off the bench after an hour and levelled with a 20-yard effort.
And he converted Arnaud Souquet's through ball for a late winner.
It was only the 26-year-old's fourth game for Nice, having suffered his injury weeks after a move from Le Havre.
Montpellier almost levelled in injury time when Ryad Boudebouz's free-kick struck the post.
Nice are behind leaders Monaco on goal difference, though their local rivals can go three points ahead again when they visit Guingamp on Saturday (16:00 GMT).
