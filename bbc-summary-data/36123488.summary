Humberside Police said Daniel Hatfield, 52 and Matthew Higgins, 49, died "after suffering significant multiple injuries".
Their bodies were found at a house on May Street on Friday.
Two women, aged 27 and 36, and a 38-year-old man are being held in police custody.
Det Supt Matt Hutchinson said police were keen to find out more about the movements of the two men in the week before their deaths.
"We also want to speak to people who know anything about the murder or have information about people attending or leaving May Street in the week prior to the men being discovered," he said.
"It is important to re-iterate that these murders are being treated as an isolated incident, however high visibility patrols will continue in the area to provide additional reassure to the local community."
