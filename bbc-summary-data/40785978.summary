Reading moved in to the second round of the EFL Cup thanks to Liam Kelly's well-taken brace against Gillingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Royals were held until the 21-year-old's fine strike from the edge of the area broke the deadlock on 71 minutes.
He made the win safe late on, smashing in from close range after good work from ex-Swansea winger Modou Barrow.
Reading goalkeeper Anssi Jaakkola had earlier saved well to deny the Gills' Tom Eaves from what was arguably the visitors' best chance of the game.
