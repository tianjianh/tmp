The couple were reported missing on 15 February when they failed to return from a trip to the mountain.
Another climber found the technical ice axe below the Shroud/Boomers Requiem area of the Munro.
Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team has asked that if anyone had lost an axe they should contact police.
The team, which has continued the effort to find Ms Slater and Mr Newton, said this would mean it could be ruled out as clue to the location of the missing pair.
