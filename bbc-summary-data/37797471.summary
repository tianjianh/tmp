Post deliveries will be reinstated to a row of properties in Torfaen after Royal Mail said walking on a grass verge was "too dangerous".

The health and safety ban in Severn View, Garndiffaith, near Pontypool, came after a postman complained.
But Royal Mail said it would reinstate deliveries to two of the 10 houses after a "further safety assessment".
It has also proposed installing external mailboxes to the rear of the other eight properties.
"If they are willing to do something to help residents, I can't complain," said local county councillor Gwyneira Clark.
"I wouldn't want to jeopardise health and safety.
"But would like to be there with the residents and a representative from the post office before they action any alternative post boxes."
Royal Mail initially said a short stretch of grass between car tracks and residents' front doors was unsafe so the 10 homes needed to collect mail from a local Post Office.
"We apologise to residents at Severn View for the continued disruption to their mail service," a Royal Mail spokesman said on Friday.
