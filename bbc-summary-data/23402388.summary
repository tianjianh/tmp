[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christina Edkins died in March after being attacked on a bus on Birmingham's Hagley Road, as she travelled to Leasowes High School in Halesowen.
Pupils at St Patrick's Catholic Primary School in Ladywood have made and published a magazine to raise funds.
The memorial shield will be given to pupils for outstanding personal achievement in sport.
St Edmund's Catholic Primary School, which Christina attended, is a sister school to St Patrick's with shared staff and activities.
Bereavement counsellor for both schools, Lorraine Sergeant, said: "A lot of children were affect by the tragic loss of Christina.
"Children were coming to school very upset, obviously with the media coverage and everything."
She said the magazine created by pupils continued Christina's achievements by celebrating "youth and children's young experiences".
Proceeds from its sales will buy the memorial sport award, chosen because it reflects Christina's love of sport and success as a netball player.
Ms Sergeant said that memorial garden was also being created at Christina's former primary school "to remember Christina for the happy things that happened in her life".
A man from Walsall is currently detained at a secure mental health unit, accused of killing Christina. He will appear in court for a plea and case management hearing on 6 September.
