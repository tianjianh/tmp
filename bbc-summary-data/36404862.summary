Figures from the UK Foundation Programme Office (UKFPO) showed 884 applications for posts in 2016. The previous year's figure was 696.
UKFPO is the official body through which medical graduates can apply for their initial post-graduate training.
The Scottish government said junior doctors were "valued members" of the healthcare team.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "Earlier this year a recruitment drive to attract more junior doctors to live and work in Scotland was launched by the Scottish government.
"A series of videos, featuring interviews with the Chief Medical Officer and trainee doctors working in NHS Scotland, was produced to highlight the many positive aspects of training, working and living in Scotland."
She added: "As a government we continue to maintain strong, positive relationships with the profession and enjoy a collaborative working relationship."
