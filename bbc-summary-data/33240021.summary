The new facility will include a GP practice and out-of-hours service, specialist clinics, a minor injuries unit and a base for community staff.
Mr Drakeford said it would help to provide care closer to people's homes.
Hywel Dda health board said the opportunities for integrated working would ensure "value for money".
Eirwyn Harries, chair of Cardigan Hospital League of Friends, said it was a "step forward" and hoped the long-discussed new centre would now open in 2019.
