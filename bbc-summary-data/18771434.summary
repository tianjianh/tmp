The listed Cliff Brewery building in Ipswich was home to the Tolly Cobbold brewery from 1723 until 2002.
Plans for a £30m overhaul by Cliff Quay Development will be on display at the Brewery Tap pub, which is next to the building, on Tuesday.
Consultant Clive Thomson said the development could generate up to 400 jobs and could be completed by 2016.
"The scheme is intended to restore and preserve a prominent local landmark and bring it back into beneficial use," said Mr Thomson, who works for Woodhall Properties Ltd.
He said the development would also feature retail outlets and a "possible brewery-themed visitors centre and micro brewery".
Ipswich Borough Council rejected another developer's application to convert the building into housing in 2004.
Mr Thomson said he was confident that concerns raised then, including one about a nearby company using potentially hazardous materials, were no longer issues.
