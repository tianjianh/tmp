This cat purrs 'louder than a tube train'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Meet Bluey the cat. You might need ear plugs for this one.

Bluey's purr is louder than a tube train, louder than an electric lawnmower, and above the level thought to cause damage if you're exposed to it long-term.
Staff at an animal re-homing centre in Cambridge were so shocked when she came in, they measured the decibels using an app - it came up as 93.
That could make Bluey the world's loudest cat.
Bluey is a 12-year-old tortoiseshell long-haired cat who came to the Blue Cross in Cambridge when her owner had to go into care.
Staff were immediately struck by her loud "throaty" purr. At first they were worried something might be wrong, so they gave her a medical check-up.
Alan Maskell, the Centre Manager said Bluey was fine, although her purr was putting people off giving her a new home.
"One chap came in specifically to see Bluey, but declined to take her as the purr would keep him up all night."
In fact, Bluey's purr could blow the current world record holder out of the water. Smokey from Northampton hit 67.7 decibels when measured by the Guinness World Records in 2011.
Guinness World Records told Newsbeat they're looking forward to receiving Bluey's application.
Alan told us Bluey may be slightly deaf, and may not realise how much noise she's making.
But he also wouldn't put it past her to be purring to get noticed.
"She's very affectionate and very friendly... she's all over you, she really wants the attention."
Fortunately many people have been won over by Bluey's "unique" nature. She's now got a new home to go to.
