Nathan Gill, another MEP, said his colleague would stay there for observation "as a precaution".
He insisted there was no danger to his health "even though it was at one stage touch and go".
He also said Mr Woolfe had "reached out a hand of friendship" to the other MEP involved, Mike Hookem.
UKIP has launched an inquiry into the incident in the European Parliament building in Strasbourg, after which Mr Woolfe subsequently collapsed and was taken to hospital.
The 49 year-old - among the favourites to be the party's next leader - had a precautionary brain scan which revealed there was no blood clot on his brain.
Nigel Farage said he has asked the party chair and secretary to conduct an investigation early next week.
He asserted "the truth will be discovered", adding: "Other claims being made in the media by representatives of UKIP who were not even there at the time are extremely unhelpful."
UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said there would be a full investigation and "appropriate action" if necessary.
The incident, understood to be between Mr Woolfe and fellow MEP Mike Hookem, took place during a heated UKIP meeting in the European Parliament.
UKIP sources said "a rumbustious argument" had taken place following claims Mr Woolfe had been considering defecting to the Conservative Party.
Accounts of what followed vary, with Mr Woolfe quoted in the Daily Mail as saying a punch was thrown at him.
UKIP did not deny Mr Hookem, who represents Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, left the room with Mr Woolfe, although a spokeswoman is reported to have denied that a physical fight took place.
The BBC has been told it is believed that Mr Woolfe banged his head against a window or a wall but then got up. Following a vote two hours later "he collapsed" and doctors were called and his wife was contacted.
Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, the UKIP chairman said the incident appeared to be a case of "two individuals who clearly got carried away" but it would be inappropriate to speculate over what caused Mr Woolfe to fall.
Mr Oakden said the events did not characterise or define UKIP, adding: "The party is far bigger than any one individual. That's something we have demonstrated particularly over these last few months."
In a statement, Mr Woolfe said: "The CT scan has shown that there is no blood clot in the brain. At the moment I am feeling brighter, happier, and smiling as ever.
"As a precaution, I am being kept in overnight awaiting secondary tests to make sure everything [is] fine."
Announcing an inquiry into the incident, UKIP interim leader Nigel Farage said: "It's two grown men getting involved in an altercation.
"It's not very seemly behaviour, but I'm not... going to get involved in the blame game, name names and say who did what."
Mr Farage has returned as UKIP leader until a fresh election is held to find a successor to Diane James. She announced her resignation on Tuesday after just 18 days in the job, citing professional and personal reasons.
Mr Woolfe, the MEP for North West England, later announced he will run for leader in the next election, having being unable to take part in the previous contest because he missed the deadline for submitting his nomination.
Raheem Kassam, the other candidate to have declared for the UKIP leadership so far, tweeted his best wishes for Mr Woolfe.
But after news of the altercation broke, one of UKIP's major donors, Arron Banks, issued a statement in which he threatened to withdraw his support for the party, saying it was at "breaking point".
He criticised UKIP's leader in Wales, Neil Hamilton, over comments he made in television interviews where he appeared to blame Mr Woolfe for events "before anyone knew if Steven was going to be OK".
Mr Banks also warned critics of Mr Farage not to prevent Mr Woolfe - who is seen as the interim leader's preferred successor - from standing.
