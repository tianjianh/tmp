Elected mayor 'could turn Guildford around'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A directly-elected mayor (DEM) would help to bring Guildford "into the 21st Century", according to a former council leader.

Stephen Mansbridge, who resigned last year in protest over how the borough council was run, said a DEM would be a real opportunity for the Surrey town.
Councillor Tony Rooth said it would be too costly and he could become "a dictator".
A referendum is being held on 13 October to decide the issue.
The vote was triggered by a petition signed by 5,269 residents.
Guildford currently has a ceremonial mayor appointed by the council.
There are currently 17 elected mayors in England, including those in London, Bristol and Liverpool.
Guildford Borough Council said the current leader, Councillor Paul Spooner, receives £22,092 in allowances.
DEM salaries elsewhere in the country are £65,000 but the council would have to agree a salary on the recommendation of an independent panel.
The cost of the referendum is estimated at £130,000.
"I left because I felt that councillors had put in place a system of governance that was weak and that will not deliver the decisions we need for Guildford to get into the 21st Century because its not there yet," said Mr Mansbridge.
"Guildford is not just another place. It should be the premier location outside London in the South East and it has been in decline for at least the last two or three years.
"We need to turn it around and make Guildford the place that it really can be."
Fellow Conservative Mr Rooth, also a former council leader, said having a DEM would cost a lot more money.
"It concentrates power and influence in the hands of one person, whereas at the moment all the 48 councillors elected by the residents have the choice of who the leader and his or her cabinet are," he said.
"You don't know now much power the elected mayor may take, who it is going to be or whether they will effectively be a dictator."
