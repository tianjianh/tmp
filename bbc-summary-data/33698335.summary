Spielplatz naturists enjoy chalet rebuilding court win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple who modernised their home in a naturist village can stay in their chalet after winning a court battle against their landlord.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John and Maureen Pearson bought their chalet at Spielplatz in Brickett Wood, Hertfordshire in 1992 and said they spent Â£100,000 on improvements.
The site's landlord, Spielplatz Ltd, wanted to evict them for altering the character of the building.
The Court of Appeal ruled the couple were protected by the Housing Act 1988.
The court heard the Pearsons had bought their chalet at the naturist community near St Albans for Â£36,000 and then gradually cloaked it in breeze blocks and put a new roof on it.
The appeal was told the work resulted in "some unfriendly correspondence" between the naturists and Spielplatz Ltd.
The company eventually sought to evict the couple claiming they were "changing an essentially wooden dwelling into a larger and more permanent brick/block structure".
In April 2014, the company lost a possession action at Luton County Court and it was challenging that ruling at the Court of Appeal.
Judge Sir Colin Rimer said the couple's chalet had become "part of the land" as it was too big and heavy to move, other than in pieces, and they had the protection of an assured tenancy.
Spielplatz - named after the German word for playground - was found in the 1920s and has 64 plots covering 12 acres (5 hectares).
