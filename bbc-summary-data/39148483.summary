In the first of four Tests, England led 2-1 at the break and scored twice late on to secure a comfortable victory.
Chris Griffiths, Sam Ward, Michael Hoare, Liam Ansell and David Goodfield scored for a much-changed England side.
"We were a little inconsistent as the group are learning about international hockey but it was nice to pick up a victory," said coach Bobby Crutchley.
England, who have six Olympians in their squad, are back in action against Germany on Saturday.
They then face a rematch with the hosts on Monday and another meeting with the Germans on Wednesday.
Phil Roper will miss those games, though, after being hit in the face by a ball during training. He is due to undergo surgery on Friday on a fractured cheek and nose.
England's women are also in South Africa and a squad boasting seven players who won Olympic gold in Rio have beaten their hosts 4-2 and 3-0 in two practice matches.
