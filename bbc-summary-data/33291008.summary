[SN]TITLE[SN]
Father acquitted over son's road death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been cleared of causing his son's death by careless driving as they travelled separately by truck and bicycle from work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Tetsill, 42, of Camelon, Falkirk, and his son Craig were on an unclassified road leading to Wester Aberchalder near Loch Ness in May 2013.
It was alleged Andrew Tetsill overtook his 21-year-old son's bike where it was unsafe to do so.
Sheriff Margaret Neilson acquitted him following a trial in Inverness.
The trial at Inverness Sheriff Court heard that Craig Tetsill would have survived with head and neck injuries if he had been wearing a helmet.
In evidence, Andrew Tetsill told the court: "Craig was standing at the side of the road as I approached. I was in first gear doing about 10mph. I passed him and pulled over as far as I could.
"I checked my mirrors and heard a thump. I stopped the truck and got out and saw Craig with one leg in front of the rear wheel of his bike and the other on top.
"I was screaming for help and hysterical and then gave him CPR until the ambulance arrived. "
Craig Tetsill sustained a severe head injury and died soon afterwards despite efforts by his father and other witnesses to save him, the court heard.
Police collision experts alleged Andrew Tetsill had been driving too close to his son and calculated that he was travelling at 38mph and his son at 16mph to 21mph.
A collision report concluded that Craig Tetsill's bike had turned sharply to the right causing him to lose control.
The rear wheel of his father's truck then ran over the front bicycle wheel, causing the rear wheel to rise, and throw Craig Tetsill 5m up the road.
However defence counsel Barney Ross challenged police conclusions and the method used to calculate the figures.
