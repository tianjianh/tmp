RP Adam has increased storage capacity and invested in new equipment at its Selkirk site.
Manufacturing volume at the facility rose by 11% in 2014/15 and is forecast to rise by a further 13% this year.
The company employs more than 50 staff in Selkirk and recent investments should help safeguard their positions.
Technical director Martin Carroll said: "With several new long-term contracts bedded in and a number of supply partnerships starting to bear fruit, we decided now is the time to invest in improving the entire site - both from a capacity and operational standpoint.
"RP Adam moved into our current site in the 1970s, when our business was much smaller than it is today.
"At the time, we built a purpose-built facility which allowed for room for growth - and now we have the right facilities in place to both sustain current and drive future growth, which matches the company's ambition."
The company - which is part of the Arpal Group and has had a Borders base for more than 100 years - said it still had "ample space" for further expansion in Selkirk.
"It is an exciting time for the company and this project at our factory further emphasises our desire to increase our manufacturing and logistics capabilities to match current and future growth," said sales and marketing director Max Adam.
