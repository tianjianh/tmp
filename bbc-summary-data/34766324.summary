Mark Mosley, 43, of First Drove, Burwell, was found guilty of killing Jess Smith, 36, from Potton in Bedfordshire, at a Cambridgeshire travellers' site on New Year's Day.
It followed a dispute at a New Year's Eve party.
A judge ordered Mosley must serve a minimum term of 30 years.

Cambridge Crown Court also sentenced Mosley to 10 years for attempted murder, three years for assault and 10 years for possessing a firearm, all to run concurrently.
An eight-week trial heard Mr Smith's nephew Paul Smith was assaulted by Mosley at the party at Comrades Club in nearby Soham.
In the early hours of New Year's Day other members of Paul Smith's family, including Jess Smith, also known as Jessie, went to the travellers' site at First Drove where Mosley lived.
They wanted to settle the dispute with what police described as two "fair bare-knuckled fights" with family members there to observe.
The trial heard during the fights, Mosley, who was not one of the participants, used a sawn-off shotgun to shoot Jess Smith three times, including once in the back as he was trying to get into a vehicle.
In a statement after the trial, Det Insp Al Page, who led the investigation, said Mosley "broke every rule of traveller culture in which disputes are resolved by a fair fight between individuals, without resorting to the use of weapons".
