Celtic goalkeeper Megan Cunningham is also back in Anna Signeul's party for the friendly against Spain on 8 March at Falkirk Stadium.
The trio missed last month's 6-0 thrashing in Sweden.
Scotland are preparing for their Women's Euro 2017 qualifier against Slovenia at Paisley 2021 Stadium.
Signeul's side top Group 1 with a 100% record as they aim to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands.
The match against Spain, which takes place on International Women's Day, is the first time the two sides have met since the play-offs for Euro 2013, which the Spanish progressed to after winning 4-3 on aggregate.
Former Arsenal players Beattie and Little had been on loan to Melbourne from Manchester City and Seattle Reign respectively.
Beattie opened the scoring and Little added the second in City's 4-1 win over Sydney in the W-League Grand Final having already topped the league table.
Glasgow City, who have won the Scottish title nine seasons in a row, have only three players in the current squad, outnumbered by Hibernian, last year's runners-up having four.
Goalkeepers: Megan Cunningham (Celtic), Gemma Fay (Glasgow City), Shannon Lynn (Vittsjo)
Defenders: Chloe Arthur (Bristol City), Jennifer Beattie (Manchester City), Frankie Brown (Bristol City), Rachel Corsie (Seattle Reign), Siobhan Hunter (Hibernian), Emma Mitchell (Arsenal), Joelle Murray (Hibernian), Kirsty Smith (Hibernian)
Midfielders: Leanne Crichton (Notts County), Kim Little (Seattle Reign), Joanne Love (Glasgow City), Christie Murray (unattached), Caroline Weir (Liverpool)
Forwards: Lizzie Arnot (Hibernian), Lana Clelland (Tavagnacco), Lisa Evans (Bayern Munich), Zoe Ness (Mallbackens), Jane Ross (Manchester City), Leanne Ross (Glasgow City)
