[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sexual abuse allegations against a former police surgeon are being investigated after alleged victims contacted Avon and Somerset Police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The allegations against Dr Reg Bunting, who died in 2013, were "immediately referred" to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) "to seek their advice", police said.
Det Supt Rachel Williams said the investigation was at an "early stage".
She said the report was almost complete and would be sent to the IPCC shortly.
Det Supt Williams said it was "still not yet clear how intensive" the investigation would be.
She said: "After victims came forward with the first allegations we made an immediate referral to the IPCC to seek their advice.
"They asked us to do some further work which is now almost complete and our report will be going back to the IPCC very shortly for their consideration about next steps.
"This was a very brave decision by the victims to come forward after so many years, and we're doing all we can to support and safeguard them with counselling and one to one support from our independent sexual violence advisors and the Bridge, our sexual assault referral centre."
