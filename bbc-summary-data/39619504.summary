The family of a 28-year-old Irish woman who was raped and murdered in India last month have issued an international appeal to help secure justice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danielle McLaughlin from Buncrana in County Donegal was found dead in a field close to tourist resorts in the western state of Goa.
One man has been charged with her murder.
The campaign has assembled an international legal team, headed by Londonderry solicitor Des Doherty.
"I spoke with the chief investigating officer in relation to the case before the Easter break and he assures me at this point, subject to any further evidence coming to light, that they are not looking for any other suspects," he said.
"That is something we are obviously looking very closely at in view of all the statements and video footage and photographs we have received ourselves to date."
A post-mortem examination concluded that brain damage and constriction of the neck caused the 28-year-old's death in Canacona.
A 24-year-old man, whose name has been reported as Vikat Bhagat, appeared in court last month charged with murder, and will also face rape charges.
