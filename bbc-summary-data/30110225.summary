Police in India's Haryana state have surrounded the ashram of a controversial Hindu guru who is wanted on charges including conspiracy to murder. Nearly 200 people were injured on Tuesday in clashes between his supporters and police.

Devotees of self-styled Guru Baba Rampal gathered in Delhi as tension mounted at his ashram in Hisar, about 175km (108 miles) north of Delhi.
An estimated 30 buses carrying police from neighbouring areas have arrived at the scene and the main road to the ashram has reportedly been blocked.
On Tuesday, hundreds of the guru's armed supporters clashed with baton-wielding police firing tear gas who tried to storm his fortified ashram and arrest him.
It's not even clear if Rampal is still in the complex - his followers say he has been moved to a private hospital for medical treatment. They say he has been too ill to attend court, where he also faces contempt charges.
Many of those injured are now being cared for in hospital. At least six people who were inside the ashram have died - their cause of death is not clear and post mortems are being conducted.
Police say Rampal's armed supporters are holding people hostage and using women and children as human shields. They say that more than half of the 200 injured are policemen.
