[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have appealed to the mother of a baby girl found dead on a footpath to tell them the child's name ahead of her funeral.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The infant, still with her umbilical cord attached, was found in a black bag by a member of the public in Marston, Oxford, on 29 February.
The baby was discovered with no signs of injury and a coroner recorded that she was stillborn.
Police said they wanted to find out if her family had any religious beliefs.
Det Con Sarah Danzelman, from Thames Valley Police, issued a direct appeal to the baby's mother to get in contact with her.
She said: "Shortly we will be arranging for a funeral for your little girl and we want to make sure she is laid to rest in an appropriate way in line with any beliefs you have.
"We are very keen to give your baby a name - a name that means something to you. Please let us know what her name is."
She added that the funeral service, which has not been given a date yet, would be open to anyone who wished to pay their respects.
