Nathan Jones: 'Powder-puff' Luton Town need 'killer instinct' in promotion race

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town manager Nathan Jones says his side's remaining eight games must "mean more" to his players if they are to win the "shootout" for promotion.

Jones said the Hatters "don't know how to grind out a win" after their 1-1 draw with lowly Newport County.
Luton are currently in fifth place in League Two, five points off the automatic promotion places.
Jones said his team were playing too many "powder-puff crosses or little passes when we want a killer instinct".
He told BBC Three Counties Radio: "We've only lost once in four games, but we've only taken three points. Now we have eight games to go - it's a shootout."
Danny Hylton gave Town the lead after five minutes at Rodney Parade, but Sean Rigg levelled for the hosts, who remain second bottom of League Two.
Jones, who signed a new three-and-a-half year contract with the Hatters on Monday, added: "It has to mean more to the [the players]. It's livelihoods. It's promotion. It can make or break them."
