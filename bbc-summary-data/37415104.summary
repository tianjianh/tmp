[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Roberts' goal secured Cambridge a 1-0 win against Yeovil which lifted the U's off the bottom of the League Two table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Roberts turned the ball home from close range after 65 minutes, pouncing after Artur Krysiak had saved Adam McGurk's header from Harrison Dunk's corner.
The goal was a deserved one for the home side, who dominated for most of the game, though they did survive an early scare when Ryan Hedges could only guide Nathan Smith's low cross over from close range.
Luke Berry fired off target three times from the edge of the box in the first period, while McGurk curled a free-kick into the side netting from 35 yards with a fine effort eight minutes before the interval.
Roberts nearly sealed the points from another Dunk delivery for Cambridge 17 minutes from time but saw Krysiak keep out his flicked header with a magnificent save.
With the last kick of the game, Hedges blazed a loose ball over the bar with Yeovil's best chance to snatch a dramatic point.
