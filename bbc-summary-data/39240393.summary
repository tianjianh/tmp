[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The only goal of the game came in the 59th minute when Ricky Modeste's cross was powered in with a diving header from Joe Healy.
After a quiet opening quarter of an hour, the home side nearly took the lead when Moses Emmanuel evaded a couple of challenges and his shot from seven yards was pushed against the post by Bromley keeper Ross Flitney.
Toby Sho-Silva had the best chance of the first half for the visitors, but his shot from seven yards was blocked and a defender beat Bradley Goldberg to the rebound.
The hosts dominated the second half, but Bromley went close to earning a point five minutes from time when Alan Dunne's header was cleared off the line by match-winner Healy.
