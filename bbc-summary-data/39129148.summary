Deniz Mehmet: Port Vale sign former Falkirk goalkeeper until end of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale have signed former Falkirk goalkeeper Deniz Mehmet on a short-term deal until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old ex-West Ham United youth team player spent four seasons in Turkey playing for Kayserispor, until January 2016.
He returned to Britain to join Falkirk for an undisclosed fee, but left the Scottish Championship club when his contract was terminated a month ago.
Mehmet will fulfil the role of understudy to Leonardo Fasan.
On-loan Celtic keeper Fasan has made five appearances since coming in to replace Jak Alnwick, the day after the latter's January deadline day move to Rangers.
If he makes a first-team appearance, Mehmet would become the fifth keeper Vale have used this season, following Alnwick, Fasan, the now departed Miguel Santos and youngster Ryan Boot, who has been on the bench since Fasan's arrival.
They also have two other young keepers, Harry Pickering and Sam Johnson, who is out on loan at National League North side FC Halifax and not allowed to return under new regulations.
Port Vale, still under the caretaker management of Michael Brown, are now five points from safety at the bottom of League One.
Bury, Swindon and Oldham all won on Tuesday night, while Vale's game at Rochdale was called off late on because of a waterlogged pitch.
But Vale, who visit play-off hopefuls Southend on Saturday, now have three games in hand on some of the teams around them.
