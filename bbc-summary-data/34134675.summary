With the hosts resuming on 227-5, Ansari added 81 runs to his overnight total before being trapped lbw by spinner Wes Durston (6-113) for 106.
Gary Wilson (72) and James Burke (79) also made valuable half-centuries, as Surrey were eventually bowled out for 560 after tea, a lead of 247.
Derbyshire were unable to respond with the bat, as bad light ended play early.
If Surrey can secure victory on the final day, they will secure their return to County Championship Division One, having been relegated with a defeat by Warwickshire in 2013.
Surrey all-rounder James Burke told BBC London 94.9:
"Coming in today, we weren't really sure of our position in this game, but we fought really well and got ourselves into a good position.
"Zafar [Ansari] batted brilliantly to get us into the position that we have so it's by no means easy to bat out there especially with the spinners.
"The ball's starting to do quite a bit out of the rough, so we know that if we stick to our guns we're in with a good shot."
