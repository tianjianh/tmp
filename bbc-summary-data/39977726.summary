Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes has confirmed captain Ryan Jack will leave the club this summer.

But amid speculation that out-of-contract Jack is a target for Rangers, McInnes revealed that no club has made an approach for the player.
"Others seem to know more than I do if what I'm hearing is true, but Ryan has now informed us it's his intention to move on from Aberdeen," McInnes said.
"There has been no official approach from any club about speaking to Ryan."
McInnes had previously said Jack offered him assurances that he would not be moving to Rangers, but on Friday the Dons boss said, "where he ends up I do not know".
"We're disappointed but we have prepared ourselves to try to deal with losing some good players and I'm confident we will get good players in," McInnes added.
Jack has made more than 200 appearances for the Dons since making his debut in 2010.
The 25-year-old midfielder came through the youth ranks at Aberdeen, who beat Rangers 2-1 at Ibrox on Wednesday night and will finish second in the Premiership this season.
The Pittodrie outfit, who face Partick Thistle in their last league match of the season on Sunday, meet Celtic in the Scottish Cup final on Saturday 27 May.
And McInnes revealed that Jack, who picked up a groin injury earlier this month, could be fit for the showpiece.
He and fellow-midfielder Peter Pawlett, who has been out with an Achilles problem, trained on Friday and could be involved on Sunday at Firhill.
"Both may travel but both may not, we will just see how they react," McInnes said. "I'd be keen to get both those players some minutes if possible.
"We want to finish with a positive result. More important than anything is we come through the game without any injuries.
"That's the priority and that's the message for the players, it's all about trying to peak for the cup final.
"It's not so much resting players. We will look at players who are maybe on the cusp of suspension for next season, we will look at players who need minutes so it gives me options for the cup final.
"But whatever team is picked, whether it's one or two younger boys who are playing, the emphasis is on winning the game.
"It's not the most important game and I can't say otherwise, the most important game is the cup final, but it would be nice for us to finish on 76 points and break our own record. And the only way we can do that is by winning."
