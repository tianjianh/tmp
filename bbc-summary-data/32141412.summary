Signatories including former Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne backed Tory plans to lower corporation tax to 20%, which come into force on Wednesday.
Labour, which dismissed the letter, says it would prioritise lower business rates for small firms.
It is also set to promise a curb onw "exploitative" zero hours contracts.
BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the letter to the Telegraph was a "significant intervention" from the business leaders with 36 days to go before the general election.
Other business chiefs to sign the Telegraph letter include BP chief executive Bob Dudley, Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam, Arcadia retail group head Sir Philip Green, and Nick Robertson, chief executive of ASOS.

YouGov's first poll following their Sunday 4% Labour lead had Conservative and Labour level-pegging on 35%; and TNS had the Conservatives one point ahead of Labour (33% v 32%) with UKIP on 16% - their highest figure in a campaign poll so far.
A ComRes poll of 40 Labour seats in Scotland confirmed other national polls, with a 19% swing from Labour to the SNP.
There was better news for Labour in two London-wide polls. ComRes had Labour on 46% and YouGov on 45%, with the Conservatives hovering around their 2010 share of 34%.
ComRes represented a 5.5% swing to Labour and YouGov a swing of 4%.
The Lib Dems were down from 22% in 2010 to 8% now.
UKIP continued to underperform in London with around 8-9%; and the Greens will be disappointed that they were on 4% in both polls in a city where they have performed better than average in the past.

The business leaders, who signed the letter in a personal capacity, say that the present government has supported investment and job creation.
"We believe a change in course will threaten jobs and deter investment. This would send a negative message about Britain and put the recovery at risk," they said in the letter.
The paper says the letter has five signatories who have previously supported New Labour: the entrepreneur Mr Bannatyne, the hotelier Surinder Arora, chairman of Dixons Carphone and Talk Talk Sir Charles Dunstone , theatrical producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh and businessman Moni Varma.
Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, said: "No one will be surprised that some business people are calling for low taxes for big businesses.
"That's nothing new and under Labour Britain will have the most competitive corporation tax rate in the G7.
"But whilst the recovery may have reached some firms it hasn't reached many others which is why we will prioritise tax cuts for the smallest firms with an immediate cut in business rates for 1.5 million small business premises."
However, Chancellor George Osborne said: "An intervention on this scale and with this clarity from Britain's business leaders is unprecedented in any recent general election."
The Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has also said that leaving the European Union would be an act of economic "self-harm" and could put the UK recovery at risk.
This issue includes the wider economy and deficit reduction but also employment and the role of business.

Later, at a campaign event in Yorkshire, Labour leader Ed Miliband will say a Labour government would guarantee "zero hours" workers the right to a contract after 12 weeks of working regular hours.
He is expected to say the "explosion" of zero hours contracts is a "symbol of the Tories' failing economy".
"It is leaving people without a reliable income, not knowing from one day to the next how much work will be coming in, unable to plan from one week to the next," he will say.
Under the changes, Labour said more than 90% of existing zero-hours contracts would be banned.
The CBI said Labour's 12-week proposal on zero hours contracts was "wide of the mark".
"Of course action should be taken to tackle abuses, but demonising flexible contracts is playing with the jobs that many firms and many workers value and need," said director-general John Cridland.
But unions welcomed the proposal.
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "We need a fairer system that guarantees zero-hours workers decent rights at work and stops them from being treated like second-class employees."
