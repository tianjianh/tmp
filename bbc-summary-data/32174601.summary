Nick Compton: England dropping 'like being dumped by a girlfriend'

Nick Compton says he has not given up hope of an England recall.

The opening batsman, who has rejoined Middlesex for 2015, played nine Tests but has not been selected since the 2013 home series against New Zealand.
On being dropped by England, the 31-year-old told the Guardian: "It is like being dumped by a girlfriend and you don't think they have given you the real reasons. There is no closure.
"But I am not going to give up hope. I don't want to accept it."
Compton was called up by England in 2012 after amassing 1,494 first-class runs for Somerset the previous season at an average of 99.6.
He made 208 runs in eight innings during his first tour in India, before compiling his two Test centuries in New Zealand in March 2013.
Having made just 16, 15, one and seven in the return series two months later, the selectors decided to discard him for that summer's Ashes contest, which England went on to win 3-0.
South Africa-born Compton, grandson of England great Denis Compton, feels he can still make a contribution.
"I feel like I'm in the prime of my career now and I want to kick on again," he added.
"I thought I was going well and then suddenly you get dropped and spend nights in bed lying awake reflecting."
Asked if he thought sacked batsman Kevin Pietersen deserves a place in the side, Compton added: "I have always had the belief you must pick the best team and manage it. Every player should be available.
"You want winners and if KP has his pads on, is in form and hungry, then I would want to be watching. The game is about bums on seats and we are in danger of losing that."
