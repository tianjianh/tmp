Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson praised his side after they recorded their third Scottish Premiership win at Tynecastle in the past week.

The 1-0 victory over Partick Thistle was Hearts' third clean sheet in a row following defeats by Hibernian and Dundee United.
"It was a tough one for us," Neilson told BBC Scotland. "Partick are on a good run of form just now.
"We have had three clean sheets, nine points, so it's been a good week."
Neilson was quick to highlight the impact made by Arnaud Djoum, who joined the club in September, and scored the only goal against the Jags.
"We were lucky to get him," explained Neilson. "He was looking for a club in the summer and had a couple of trials at places that didn't work out for him.
"He came to us just after the window shut, we brought him in and he's done fantastically well. We renewed his contract as he was on a short-term one; he is just a good player."
Neilson said he was unaware of the plane that flew overhead just at kick-off, trailing a banner that read: "No style, no bottle, Neilson out!"
"To be honest, I didn't see it," he said. "That's football, we are sitting third in the league and we are doing well but there is always somebody that's not happy.
"If somebody wants to spend their money on that, I would rather they put their money into the Foundation of Hearts like everyone else, but if that's how they want to do it then fair enough."
Partick Thistle boss Alan Archibald felt his players should have been able to cope with the threat posed by Hearts.
"We lost a goal from a set play," he said. "That was the biggest disappointment. We know they are a threat at set plays, we never did our jobs properly and that ended up being the difference between the teams."

Archibald knew a win would have taken Thistle to fifth spot in the table but insists all their focus remains on staying in the Premiership.
"First and foremost we have to stay away from the bottom," cautioned Archibald. "You see Motherwell won today and they went above us. That's the way it has been all season.
"The minute we creep away, we end up being dragged back a bit. We have to get ourselves safe and we definitely have got enough in that dressing room to do it."
