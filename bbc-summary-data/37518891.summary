[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The search for missing toddler Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos was temporarily halted because of a dispute over archaeological remains.

The Sheffield toddler was 21 months old when he went missing on 24 July 1991.
Officers uncovered ancient graves on Thursday during a fresh excavation of the area, which began on Monday.
Police said they were asked to stop by the landowner, but his concerns about the tombs had been resolved and the search would continue as planned.
Det Insp Jon Cousins, of South Yorkshire Police, said: "With the support of Greek authorities and in consultation with the landowner we have now resumed the dig and our search continues."
Specialists have been combing the farmland where Ben was last seen playing.
They were working on a tip-off he may have been crushed by a digger machine while his grandparents were renovating a farmhouse on the 2.5-acre site in the village of Iraklise.
Mr Cousins said: "Yesterday we unearthed an ancient burial site in the search for Ben.
"This site is of archaeological significance and so work was required to secure it.
"Whilst this matter was resolved, some of our officers visited the second site to ensure no time was wasted."
The four or five graves that diggers uncovered are believed to date from about 1,500 years ago.
