A regular in the Premier League club's Under-21 side, Kinsella, 21, has been in a number of matchday squads but has not yet played in the first team.
He made his professional debut during a three-game loan spell in League Two with Luton Town last season.
Kinsella is set to be available for Harriers' next six matches.
Meanwhile, midfielder Kenny Digie has signed an 18-month contract at Aggborough.
Harriers are currently 23rd in the National League table, nine points adrift of safety with 14 games to go.
