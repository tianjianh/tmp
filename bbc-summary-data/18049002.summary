The aircraft is understood to have gone down near the summit of Ben More near Crianlarich around 12:00 BST Saturday.
Central Scotland Police said neither man had been identified and inquiries were at a very early stage.
Ben More is a Munro 1,174m (3,852ft) in height. In 1973 four people died when a British European Airways passenger plane crashed into the mountain.
