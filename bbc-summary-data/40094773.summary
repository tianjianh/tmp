Walker, 23, came through Hearts' development system, has been a first-team regular at Tynecastle since 2012 and is under contract until 2018.
"[Head coach] Ian [Cathro] has been through quite an extensive discussion with Jamie to try to get him to stay," said Levein.
"Jamie said he has been here a long time and feels it is time to move on."
Walker has been linked with Scottish Premiership rivals Rangers.
"There comes a point with every player if we get an offer that's deemed to be acceptable then we'll look at that," added Levein.
"These are circumstances that happen."
