Real life 'Spider-Man' helps homeless in Birmingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A real-life "Spider-Man" has started taking to the streets of Birmingham to help the city's poor and needy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old bar worker, who like the comic book star wishes to keep his identity a secret, buys sandwiches from supermarkets and gives them to homeless people.
He ventures out one or two times a week between 21:00 GMT and midnight.
The do-gooder even has his own Twitter feed - @brumspiderman - so people can follow his adventures.
"I've worked with homeless and vulnerable people for three or four years and love seeing the smiles on people's faces," he said.
"Then I thought 'if they are happy now, imagine how much bigger the smile would be if it was Spider-Man giving out the food.'"
He said he has always been a fan of the web-swinging superhero and already had a Spider-Man costume left over from a birthday party.
"The response has been amazing - there is an instant wow factor," he said.
"People have seen me on Facebook or Twitter and they say what I am doing is really good. Some are even saying they want to do the same.
"I plan to do it for as long as I can."
