Swansea council outlines cuts plan to plug £38m gap

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spending on environmental and cultural services may be significantly cut as Swansea council tries to save more than £90m in the next three years.

The authority expects a £14m funding cut next year - part of a £38m budget gap - alongside "rising demand" for social care and other services.
The council said schools and social services will be prioritised, in line with feedback from the public.
Council leader Rob Stewart said it was responding to "unprecedented times".
He said the authority had made "significant savings" in recent years, with £50m of reductions in the last two, but "more needed to be done" to close the gap.
"Austerity is not over and the money we receive from the government is falling at a time when demand for our services is rising," he added.
"Every area of the council will be affected by reductions in funding, but we've made schools and social services our priority in line with the public's views."
Swansea is also looking to save millions more by streamlining its administration and back-office services and by generating additional income to help pay for services.
Mr Stewart said that without spending cuts, it would take a 100% increase in council tax to bridge the funding gap in the next few years.
"That's not fair and no-one would support it," he added.
Consultations on the budget proposals, involving the public and staff, will begin after the cabinet meets next week.
The council said it had given a commitment to "minimise" redundancies.
