The robbery, described as a "frightening attack" by police, happened at the salon in Gorgie Road at about 20:00 on Thursday.
Police said the woman had received minor bruising following a struggle.
Her son was also threatened with the knife when he arrived at the shop but was not harmed. The two men stole cash and a laptop.
The first attacker was white, in his late 20s, about 6ft tall, of thin build and had short dark hair.
He was also said to have "a large pointed nose", thick eyebrows and brown eyes.
He was wearing a blue puffer jacket and a scarf covering his mouth and spoke with a local accent.
The second attacker was white, 5ft 10in tall, of thin build. He was wearing a dark, waterproof jacket with a white stripe down the middle, dark skinny jeans and dark trainers with white soles.
Det Insp John Kavanagh, of Police Scotland, said: "The victim was subjected to a violent assault during the robbery, it was a frightening attack on a lone woman.
"We are keen to trace these suspects as quickly as possible. Anyone who may have seen the attack, or who recognises the description of the men involved, is asked to contact Police Scotland immediately."
