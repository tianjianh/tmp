Andrew Bedford, 27, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, was last seen in Ramsey on 28 September 1990.
Officers reopened the investigation in April and discovered human bones on land off Stocking Fen Road in Ramsey.
Detectives think Mr Bedford was killed with a shotgun sometime during the evening at a garage called Mongrel Cars, which no longer exists.
Mr Bedford was last seen on the evening of 28 September at Factory Bank, off Great Whyte in Ramsey.
Three people were arrested in connection with his disappearance but no-one was charged.
In April, police reopened the investigation as a murder inquiry saying they believed he had been shot.
Bones "consistent with being human" were found by scenes of crime officers, forensic scientists and detectives during a 13-day operation in the town in April.
On the 25th anniversary of his suspected murder, Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said he still believed the local community could hold the answer to what happened that night.
"Today marks a quarter of century of bereavement for Andrew's family and they are well overdue some answers," he said.
Mr Bedford was last seen eating a takeaway in a light blue Ford Cortina car.
He was wearing overalls, a khaki jumper, jeans and trainers. He was described as 5ft 8in (1.72m), medium build with mousey blond, curly, shoulder-length hair and had a number of tattoos.
A man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder remains on bail.
