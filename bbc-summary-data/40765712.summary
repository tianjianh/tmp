T20 Blast: Glamorgan stay top after 25-run win over Kent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan remain top of the T20 Blast Southern Group after they held their nerve to beat Kent by 25 runs in a high-scoring affair at Canterbury.

The hosts finished on 174-4 despite the efforts off Joe Denly (68 off 50 balls) and Sam Northeast (60 off 34).
Glamorgan's 199-2 was given a blistering start by Aneurin Donald's 50 off 31 balls.
Captain Jacques Rudolph then played a range of inventive shots in his unbeaten 77 from 52 deliveries.
It was his third half-century in seven innings, while David Miller chipped in with 43 off 26 despite Kent's seamers trying plenty of variety in their efforts to drag back the scoring rate.
Denly and Northeast continued the batting dominance with a stand of 89 in 8.5 overs to put the home side in the hunt, but the middle order could not keep the run-rate going against the accurate bowling of Marchant de Lange (1-26 in four overs) and Craig Meschede (1-12 in two).
England batsman Sam Billings did not reach the wicket until the 19th over with the game already sliding away from Kent.
Glamorgan batsman Aneurin Donald told BBC Wales Sport:
"Kent have a pretty strong batting line-up so it was nice for our top four to get the job done. That's what you're looking for in T20 for the top four to get the bulk of the runs, and [for me] to pick up the slack when Colin Ingram fails for once in a blue moon is nice.
"At the top of the order it's your job to get the big scores. I'm the aggressor trying to get us off to a quick start.
"Credit to our bowlers holding their nerve, it shows what a quality outfit we are this year and, if you get to 200, you're going to win more often than not with the experience of our bowling line-up.
"The target's another home quarter-final and trying to get to that Finals Day. I think we're one of the stronger teams in the competition this year and if we play the way we are, we're going to be there or thereabouts."
Kent captain Sam Northeast told BBC Radio Kent:
"When Joe and me were going, we felt we were in the game, but a few overs where you lose a wicket or low overs put us right behind, and it's hard work when the guys come in needing 12 or 13 an over.
"It was never going to be easy chasing that score and we're going to have to be better with the ball. The coaches and bowlers will get together and come up with a plan. We're going to have to have better plans and execute a lot better."
