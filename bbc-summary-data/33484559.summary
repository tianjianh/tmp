A suspected case of bird flu has been found at a Lancashire poultry farm, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said.

All birds at the farm in Goosnargh, Preston, are due to be culled and animal movements have been restricted within a 10km "control zone".
Defra said the decision to cull was "based on the clinical symptoms and emerging laboratory findings".
The risk to public health was very low, a spokesman added.
"We have a strong track record of controlling and eliminating previous outbreaks of avian flu in the UK," he said.
"The outbreaks in Yorkshire last year and Hampshire in February were both successfully contained, allowing restrictions to be lifted at the earliest opportunity."
Defra's chief vet Nigel Gibbens added: "We have taken swift precautionary action to limit the risk of the disease spreading. I would urge bird keepers to be vigilant for any signs of the disease."
The Food Standards Agency said there was "no food safety risk" for consumers.
There are two types of bird flu, the most serious of which - known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) - is often fatal in birds.
A less serious version - low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) - can cause mild breathing problems but affected birds do not always show clear signs of infection.
The NHS website says no humans have been infected with bird flu in the UK.
