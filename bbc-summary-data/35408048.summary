Shetland's spectacular Up Helly Aa Viking fire festival has been held in Lerwick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 1,000 men paraded through the streets before burning their replica Viking galley.
Hundreds of visitors arrived in the islands for the annual event.
This year's Guizer Jarl - festival leader - Mark Evans led his squad of latter day warriors, which included a number of relatives all the way from Brisbane in Australia.
Mr Evans portrayed the warrior Solmund Sigurdsson of Tonsberg.
The festival is a descendant of the ancient feast of Yule - which the Vikings held to celebrate the rebirth of the sun.
