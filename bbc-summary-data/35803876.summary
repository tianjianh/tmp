[SN]TITLE[SN]
Valencia 0-2 Celta de Vigo

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Neville faced criticism from Valencia fans as his side suffered a third successive La Liga defeat, losing 2-0 at home to Celta Vigo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some called for Neville to go, with the ex-England defender having overseen only three wins in his 16 league games.
Celta went ahead through ex-Manchester City striker John Guidetti with 10 minutes to go and added a second through Hugo Mallo four minutes later.
Valencia are six points above the relegation zone with eight games to go.
The club went out of the Europa League last week, despite beating Athletic Bilbao in the second leg of their last-16 tie, and still have to face four of La Liga's top six in Barcelona, Real Madrid, Villarreal and Sevilla during their run-in.
Neville said: "We must focus on the last eight games of the season. From my point of view, the situation is not good and the results not good enough. The fans are rightly frustrated, as am I."
England coach Neville has delayed meeting up with the national squad for friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands in the build-up to Euro 2016.
