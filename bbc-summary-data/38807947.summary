Kurt Jewson, 45, was hailed a "total hero" for sharing the picture - which showed him in his underwear with a catheter, stoma bag and scars.
Now undergoing radiotherapy, he has shared another picture to encourage men to learn more about the illness.
He said "things could have been different" had he been more aware.
Sharing both pictures on Facebook, Mr Jewson, from west Cornwall, said: "'Pants man' returns, one year on... even more tubby, pale and middle aged than before!"

In the post, he revealed he has had numerous operations, hormone therapy, chemotherapy and has lost his "silver locks".
Mr Jewson no longer has a stoma bag because the area that has been operated on has healed.
"If my 15 minutes have helped raise awareness, then it's been worthwhile," he said. "Of course, I'm now 'pants man' to all my friends but it's cool."
The original post was shared 250,000 times and viewed by 25m people.

Mr Jewson said his "world went into hyper mode" and said he received numerous messages from people affected by cancer.
"These messages were sometimes heart-warming, and sometimes tragic," he said. "To be honest, for a while it all became a bit much for me.
"I was struggling with my own cancer, and at the same time I vowed to myself to reply to every single person who had written to me."
Mr Jewson's radiotherapy will finish in March and his hormone treatment should end in September.
"Fingers crossed... I'm going on to have a long and happy cancer-free life," he said.
