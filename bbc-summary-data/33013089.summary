Paul Clement: Carlo Ancelotti gave Derby boss belief

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Derby County head coach Paul Clement says working as Carlo Ancelotti's assistant manager for the past six years convinced him he was ready to step up as a number one.

Clement, who replaced Steve McClaren at the Championship side, said it was an "honour" to assist the Italian.
"He is a great man who gave me a lot of belief I could do this job," Clement, 43, said at his first news conference.
"I can't wait to get started. This is a fantastic opportunity."
Clement was assistant manager at Real Madrid from 2013 but left the Spanish side soon after former Chelsea boss Ancelotti was sacked at the end of the season.
The former Surrey PE teacher began his coaching career with Chelsea in the 1990s and returned to the club in 2007, working with the first team under Guus Hiddink in 2009 and becoming a prominent figure with Ancelotti at Chelsea, Paris St-German and Real.
"It is a big step but one I am excited about, one I think I have the skills to deliver; I wouldn't have done it otherwise," Clement added. "I have had a burning ambition to be a head coach for a long time.
"I thoroughly enjoyed my time as an assistant; I worked at some fantastic clubs with some great players. But over the years I thought I would like the opportunity to be a head coach."
Clement said he has spoken to other clubs but was impressed by what the Rams had to offer.
"Derby really did interest me," he said. "It's a club with tradition, with a very strong supporter base and infrastructure and having spoken to [chairman] Mel Morris and [chief executive] Sam Rush and seen their vision for moving this club forward, I am excited to be a part of it."
