World number one Novak Djokovic swept aside Kei Nishikori to reach the final of the Paris Masters.

Defending champion Djokovic won a one-sided match against the Japanese sixth seed 6-2 6-3.
Serb Djokovic broke Nishikori twice in the first set and again early in the second as he triumphed in one hour and two minutes.
He will face Canadian seventh seed Milos Raonic, who beat Tomas Berdych 6-3 3-6 7-5, in Sunday's final.
Victory would see him claim his 600th career win and his 20th Masters title.
"I haven't dropped a set getting into the final and I feel fresh and motivated to play well," Djokovic said afterwards.
"I could see Kei wasn't serving at his best and maybe that was down to injury or feeling fatigued after finishing late against Ferrer.
"Regardless of that I played well and concentrated on what I had to do. I served exceptionally well in important moments and that encourages me for the final."
Raonic was made to work hard by the Czech fifth seed as he reached his second Masters final, after Toronto last year.
The 23-year-old, who defeated Roger Federer in the quarter-finals, broke Berdych for a 3-1 lead and quickly wrapped up the first set.
Although an early break allowed Berdych to level the match, he netted a backhand in a closely fought deciding set to give Raonic victory, before smashing his racket on the ground.
