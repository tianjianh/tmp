A burst water main in Leicester flooded a major road junction and affected supplies across the city.

Problems with the pipe were reported at about 04:30 GMT at the junction of King Richards Road near Tudor Road.
Severn Trent Water said a large amount of water had been released and they had isolated the area.
Supplies to thousands of homes were restored by the afternoon but lane closures are likely to affect rush hour traffic on Monday.
The water was reported to be up to two feet deep in some areas and roads were closed for several hours.
Sarah O'Kane, from Severn Trent Water, said engineers were working to get it fixed.
"Water came out of this pipe at the rate of 400 litres a second, so there is a lot of water around.
"This has to be cleared, either by tankers or natural drainage, before we can get in and repair the damage."
The company said if the water you are getting is discoloured, running the cold tap gently for about 20 minutes should clear up the problem.
