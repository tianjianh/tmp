The centre will provide training facilities for Dundee FC as well as a training and competition venue for other regional sport squads.
Plans for the regional performance centre for sport have been lodged with Dundee City Council.
Sports including badminton, basketball, netball, rugby and volleyball will be provided for in the new building.
Athletics, golf and track cycling will be part of the wider campus, which could begin construction next year.
Dundee FC managing director John Nelms told the club's website: "It's something that we've been working on for quite a long time.
"It will allow us to expand our offerings into the community and put our roots even deeper into Dundee."
Sportscotland, who are partners in the project with Dundee City Council, highlighted the need for a regional sports centre in Tayside and Fife in 2003.
A council spokesman said: "The bodies have been working together to develop the scope of the facility based on the various sports' strategic needs, affordability and sustainability as well as discussions with local sports clubs and the desire to have a level of community use.
"It is expected that planning permission will be considered in the next few months."
