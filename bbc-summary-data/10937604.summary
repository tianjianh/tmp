Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor has returned home after being discharged from hospital, four weeks after breaking her hip in a fall at her Los Angeles mansion.

Her departure follows earlier reports she would remain at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center in Los Angeles after contracting an infection.
Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, told reporters she was "happy" to be home.
"She can go on for many more years," he said of his 93-year-old partner.
Gabor had been expected to spend a week in hospital after undergoing hip replacement surgery on 19 July.
But her condition began to deteriorate after the operation, forcing her to remain longer than originally anticipated.
Her husband said Gabor was "not a young chick" and had been "scared" during her extended stay in hospital.
He knew his wife was "in good shape", however, when she "started flirting with the guys who took her home".
Gabor - who appeared in such films as Moulin Rouge and Touch of Evil - is partially paralysed and uses a wheelchair following a car accident in 2002 and a 2005 stroke.
The Hungarian-born actress was taken back to her Bel-Air mansion on Wednesday in an ambulance that formed part of a four-car convoy.
