[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The fate of remains found in a mass grave in Durham is to be discussed at a public event in the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The skeletons of up to 28 individuals, discovered in 2013, have been dated to 1650, and are believed to be captives from the Battle of Dunbar.
Thousands of Scottish prisoners were marched south, and many died while at Durham Castle and Cathedral.
A public event seeking feedback on reburial and commemoration will be held at Durham Castle at 20:00 GMT.
There will also be a chance to find out more about the project from the archaeological team involved.
It follows a similar event in Dunbar, where many of the soldiers would have come from.
Professor Chris Gerrard, head of archaeology at Durham University, said: "We want to give people in Durham and the North East an opportunity to hear more about something which is part of their history and heritage and to have a say on what happens next.
"Durham Castle is a fitting location for our second public event as...the individuals we found were buried in what would have been, in the mid-17th Century, the bottom of the Castle garden."
