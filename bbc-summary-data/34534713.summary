[SN]TITLE[SN]
Windermere deaths accused 'sought advice over generator'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gas fitter accused of the manslaughter of his partner and her daughter sought advice from mechanic friends before making amendments to a generator, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Eteson denies the manslaughter by gross negligence of Kelly Webster and her daughter Lauren Thornton.
The pair died on a boat on Windermere in April 2013.
Preston Crown Court heard Mr Eteson had fabricated the exhaust system of an onboard petrol-driven generator.
A statement from the 42-year-old, of Hale, Greater Manchester, was read out in court describing how the generator was used to power the boat's mains appliances.
The court was told he had taken the generator off the boat to make moderations by fitting it with a silencer because it was noisy for neighbours.
The system was fitted the day before the deaths of Ms Webster, 36, and her 10-year-old daughter, of Leyland, Lancashire.
During his voluntary interview in April 2013 Mr Eteson said he had been aware of the dangers of fumes.
He added that he had sought advice from friends and said the construction "wasn't something I took lightly".
The family had been at a 50th birthday on the evening of 31 March 2013 before returning to the boat.
The following morning Mr Eteson said he had felt sick and went to buy lunch before returning.
He said his partner had complained of the cold and the fan heater was put on at half power. The jury was told the generator was running as they ate their lunch and he then fell asleep at the table below deck.
The court heard when he woke he could not move and initially believed he was having problems with his heart.
In police statement, he said: "I just knew there was something not right with me. That's when I decided there was no-one about, I didn't know if they had gone shopping."
He said upon finding their bodies he tried looking for his phone before dialling 999.
The court heard carbon monoxide alarms on the boat had never been tested.
The trial continues.
