Euro 2016 - England v Slovakia: Who should Roy Hodgson pick?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brave and bold are just two of the words that could be used to describe Roy Hodgson's substitutions against Wales on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The England manager brought on strikers Daniel Sturridge and Jamie Vardy in Lens - and both had an impact.
Vardy scored shortly after the break and Sturridge struck a late clincher as England won 2-1 to move top of Group B.
Manchester United youngster Marcus Rashford came off the bench to good effect as well, replacing Adam Lallana.
All of which leaves the England manager with some tricky decisions to make before his team's final group game against Slovakia on Monday.
Do Sturridge and Vardy start? Will Harry Kane have to settle for a place on the bench? Former England captain Alan Shearer certainly thinks so.
And did Rashford to enough to force himself into the starting line-up?
Furthermore, after going gung-ho, all-out attack to turn around a 1-0 deficit against the Welsh, what sort of formation should Hodgson pick?
