Mark Hudson: Huddersfield Town captain signs contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Town captain Mark Hudson has signed a three-year contract extension, which will eventually see him join the club's coaching staff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old defender has made 78 league appearances for Town since joining from Cardiff in September 2014.
Boss David Wagner said: "It is a great move to keep him here as a coach in the long-term, but I believe he still has a big part to play on the pitch.
"He is a 100% professional and has a winning mentality."
