A chapel which closed more than a year ago when cracks appeared during the construction of a nearby retail complex is still awaiting repairs by the developer.

Rehoboth Baptist Chapel, next to the Regent Circus development in Swindon, was closed in January 2014 because of damage to its ceiling and walls.
Repairs by developer ISG had been expected to start two months ago.
The BBC has asked ISG for a comment but the company has not responded.
The chapel and people living near the Regent Circus complex, which opened fully in February, said they had been reassured by ISG at a public meeting in March 2014 that the damage would be "put right".
Tracy White, from residents group Back Garden, said the company had offered nearby residents a property survey and had also agreed to write to all those affected.
She said when she had contacted ISG to confirm whether "the letter was actually circulated to residents" she had received no reply.
Ms White said: "At that meeting, ISG's director made a public commitment to rectify any problems that the surveys identified.
"We know that there are residents on Cross Street whose properties back on to the development that have no access to their garages and back alley, which has remained closed off with fencing for nearly two years.
"We were also led to believe repair work would begin in February and March, and that concrete underpinning would start in April.
"Again, nothing has happened with this work."
Rehoboth Baptist Chapel has been hiring nearby St Mary's church for its congregation since the chapel closed last year.
