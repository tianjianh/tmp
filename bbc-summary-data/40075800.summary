Kell Brook broke his left eye socket in Saturday's defeat by Errol Spence Jr, his trainer Dominic Ingle has said.

The Briton struggled with swelling on his left eye midway through the bout as he lost the IBF world welterweight title to the American in Sheffield.
Brook, 31, had surgery after breaking his right eye socket in a loss to Gennady Golovkin in September.
"It's the same injury he sustained in the Golovkin fight but in the opposite eye," Ingle told BBC Radio 5 live.
Brook was knocked down by 27-year-old Spence in the 10th round and then stopped in the 11th, with his eye heavily swollen.
"It's disappointing for Kell to find himself in the same place again - in his comeback fight, but with the same damage," Ingle added.
"It is very unusual for it to happen again. He doesn't want to have to go through the same procedure of any operation again. It took a long time out and held him back from his training."
Brook said on Sunday that he knew from the seventh round that he had damaged the eye, adding that he struggled with blurred vision for the rest of the fight.
"I had a CT scan on my eye and the eye is broken again, same as the Golovkin one," Brook told Sky Sports.
"I remember the surgeon saying to me after the Golovkin fight, 'if you would have gone another round or so you could be blind' - so I've got that going through my mind as well."
