Abdoulaye Meite: Newport County release Ivory Coast international

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County have released Ivory Coast international defender Abdoulaye Meite after less than two months with the club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Meite, 36, turned out six times for the Exiles after joining in November 2016.
"Abs joined at a time when we had no real back-up in the centre-half position," manager Graham Westley said.
"He hadn't been training and wasn't fit but was available. To his massive credit, he made on-field contributions almost immediately."
