Six Nations 2016: Scotland's Matt Scott ruled out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland centre Matt Scott has been ruled out of the remainder of the Six Nations after damaging elbow ligaments.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott started Scotland's opening-weekend defeat by England, but Duncan Taylor took his place against Wales and Italy after a thigh injury in training.
Scott's latest set-back came in Edinburgh's 28-23 Pro12 defeat by Connacht on Friday.
The 25-year-old will have a further examination this week to determine whether he will need surgery.
Scott, who has won 34 caps, was forced off just 23 minutes into Edinburgh's defeat.
Scotland coach Vern Cotter will now decide whether to continue with Saracens' Taylor in midfield alongside Mark Bennett or bring in either Glasgow's Peter Horne or Alex Dunbar.
Scotland, fourth in the Six Nations table, play France at Murrayfield on Sunday.
