[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale have made their sixth summer signing - and their fifth in three days - by bringing in defender Graham Kelly from Sheffield United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old left-back has signed a one-year contract, with the option of a second year.
Kelly made his debut for the Blades against Coventry City at the end of the 2015-16 season - and also played last term in the EFL Trophy.
He went on loan to Stalybridge Celtic at the start of the 2016-17 campaign.
Kelly's arrival follows the return to Vale Park of striker Tom Pope and this week's signings, winger Cristian Montano, goalkeepers Rob Lainton and Sam Hornby and defender Joe Davis.
