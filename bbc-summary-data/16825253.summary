The 30-year-old has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal.
Spurs sanctioned Pavlyuchenko's exit on transfer deadline day as they completed a deal for French forward Louis Saha from Everton.
Pavlyuchenko joined Spurs from Spartak Moscow in August 2008 and scored 42 goals in 113 appearances.
"We thank Roman for his contribution and wish him every success for the future," read a Tottenham statement.
