Former Orange band teacher jailed for sex abuse of boys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former music teacher with an Orange band has been jailed for five years for historic sex abuse.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ivie Callison, 63, from Stranraer, was convicted of indecently assaulting five boys between the age of nine and 15 in Lanarkshire from 1979 until 1988.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that he abused some of the boys he taught in the band - as well as other victims.
Judge Sean Murphy QC told Callison: "The consequences for many of your victims will be life long."
"Their parents...thought the children would be safe in your company and you abused that trust."
As Callison was led away to begin his sentence one of his victims shouted: "Yes."
