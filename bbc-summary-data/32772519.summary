More than 118,000 tickets were snapped up in the first 12 hours of them going on sale at 09:00 BST on 16 May.
This year's eclectic line-up includes Sir Simon Rattle and the Vienna Philharmonic, Sir David Attenborough, Bryn Terfel and Pete Tong.
Edward Blakeman, director, BBC Proms 2015, said the demand for tickets had been "extraordinary".
"The level of demand for tickets for the broad range of concerts across the whole season has been extraordinary.
"We're delighted that so many people have booked tickets, and look forward to welcoming them to the Royal Albert Hall this summer to enjoy all the world-class music featured across the two months of the festival."
Within the first hour of booking, more than 31,000 tickets were purchased online, more than 10% cent more than in 2014, with 500 tickets-a-minute sold during peak periods on Saturday.
In addition, more than 1,600 Promming (standing) Season Tickets and Weekend Promming Passes were sold through the Royal Albert Hall on 15 May.
Among the most popular Proms, according to early bookings, are a concert of works by US composer and pianist Leonard Bernstein, whose musical scores included West Side Story, Yo-Yo Ma's Late Night performance of Bach's complete cello suites and Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius with Sir Simon Rattle conducting.
James Ainscough, who looks after event venue the Royal Albert Hall, said the popularity of the season came as "no surprise", citing the broad programme which encompasses large-scale choral works, a Prom featuring Sir David Attenborough's Life Story, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane, pop star Jarvis Cocker and Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel.
However, he stressed that tickets remained available for most events, while Â£5 Promming tickets would still be available on the day.
"The Proms has always been about bringing the very best music to the widest number of people," said Mr Ainscough.
"We look forward to hosting a wonderful summer of inspirational performances on the world's most famous stage."
There will be 92 concerts across the two-month music festival this summer, including a series of Sunday matinees aimed at families.
The BBC Proms runs from 17 July to 12 September. The full list of events can be found at the BBC Proms website.
