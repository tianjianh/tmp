Matthew Morgan: Dragons eye departing Bristol back

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport Gwent Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones says they would be interested in talking to versatile Wales back Matthew Morgan.

The 23-year-old former Osprey is leaving English second-tier club Bristol to return to Wales before the start of the 2016-17 season.
Dragons' local rivals Cardiff Blues have been tipped to sign Morgan.
But Jones said: "If he's interested in the Dragons, we're certainly interested in talking to him."
Former Sale, Gloucester and Russia coach Jones says Dragons were disappointed Morgan moved to Bristol instead of them for the 2014-15 season.
But Bristol failed to win promotion to the Aviva Premiership during his stint there.
Despite that, Morgan played at the 2015 World Cup for Wales to take his cap tally to five and Jones believes Morgan's international hopes can only be enhanced with a return to Welsh rugby.
"To be honest, of all the moves over the bridge et cetera, that was the one I was most disappointed with from a Welsh fan point of view," Jones added.
"He's a good young player and to go to the Championship in England, even though they [Bristol] are a well-coached side, I'm not sure it was the right move for him personally.
"I think he should be in a [Welsh] region, he needs to be playing.
"There's no doubt that [Wales coaches] Warren Gatland, Rob Howley, Neil Jenkins rate him, so if he's in a Welsh region, he will be pushing for international honours. He's got that X-factor."
Dragons host Cardiff Blues on Sunday, 27 December in the Pro12.
