Dumfries transport firm Currie European considers base move

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major transport firm is considering moving its base from Dumfries to a site closer to the main A74(M) motorway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Currie European operates a fleet of 250 trucks and 500 trailers across the UK and Europe.
It has 320 employees in total, with 185 of them in Dumfries where the company has been based since 1977.
Owner Tom Barrie said the distance from the motorway was a "significant drain" on profits and it was looking for a site in the region which was closer.
"In these challenging times it is important for us to run the business as efficiently as possible," he said.
"We are now exploring opportunities to relocate to a site along the M74 corridor to deliver modern premises fit for the 21st Century and consolidate our operations.
"This move will allow us to reduce unnecessary costs through increased driver productivity and decreased fuel consumption, which will ultimately improve our service to clients."
The company still intends to remain in south west Scotland.
Managing director Stephen Turner said: "We would encourage those with potential site opportunities in Dumfries and Galloway to contact us directly.
"It is an exciting time for the business, however, I'm keen to reassure our staff, clients and the community that we are committed to staying in the Dumfries and Galloway area and securing our long-term sustainability in the region.
"Moving forward we will now be engaging with the local community to update them on our proposals."
