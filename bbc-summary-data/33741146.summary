Akpom, 19, scored a hat-trick for the Gunners in pre-season and manager Arsene Wenger said he would not be sent out on loan.
Earlier on Friday, 20-year-old Hayden, who can play in defence or midfield, made the season-long move to Hull.
Both players are England Under-20 internationals.
"It's exactly what I need at this stage of my career," Hayden told the club website.
"This club is an ambitious one, so to be part of this is a great opportunity. It's a chance for me to prove myself."
He has played twice for the Gunners - both in the League Cup.
Akpom has had previous spells at Brentford, Coventry and Nottingham Forest, making a total of 26 career appearances without finding the net.
