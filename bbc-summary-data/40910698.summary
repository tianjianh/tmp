Fran Berry's triumph aboard the Tim Easterby-trained Golden Apollo in the six-furlong sprint clinched victory.
They won with 86 points, ahead of the Rest of the World side on 67.
Berry also won aboard Great Hall for trainer Mick Quinn, and the double secured him the Alistair Haggis Silver Saddle award for top jockey.
"This day is important," said Irishman Berry. "You get a big family crowd here, race-goers of the future, and if you can get the youngsters interested at a young age, it is only going to have a knock-on effect for racing in the future."
The Shergar Cup is contested by three-strong teams from Great Britain and Ireland, the Rest of the World, Europe and an all-female team, The Girls.
Pioneering jockey Michelle Payne pulled out of the event earlier on Saturday because of illness.
The Australian, who is the only woman to ride a Melbourne Cup winner, was replaced in The Girls team by Hollie Doyle.
Doyle was a narrow runner-up aboard Sir Robert Cheval in the opening Shergar Cup Dash, won by Spencer on the Dean Ivory-trained favourite Stake Acclaim.
The win by a neck gave Spencer the 2,000th British Flat racing success of his career and the 37-year-old said: "It's only a figure, but it's good to get there."
