Singer and songwriter Karine Polwart kicks off proceedings at the Easterbrook Hall in Dumfries on 26 May.
A wide range of theatre, music and comedy performances will follow throughout the region.
Billed as Scotland's largest rural performing arts festival, it runs until 4 June.
Among the events being highlighted by organisers are:
Ken Gouge, who chairs the festival, said the event had been going from strength to strength.
"We're anticipating our audience figures increasing again," he said.
"In the last two years we have more than doubled our audience figures and, indeed, our ticket income has gone up by 131% over the last two years.
"So we are clearly doing something right."
The full programme is available on the arts festival's website.
