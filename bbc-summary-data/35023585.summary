Some French clubs have fielded below-strength teams during the second-tier tournament's history.
Pau could pick or omit ex-New Zealand centre Conrad Smith and fly-half Colin Slade to visit Newport.
"We've got to be right on top of our game next week whether King Kong turns up or Minnie Mouse," said Jones
Jones' Dragons return to Europe after a 22-6 Pro12 win over Munster while Pau are 12th in the French Top 14 after a draw against Racing 92.
"There aren't any poor players in France," insisted Jones as he assessed his side's task against Pau.
"They're coached very well and they can always score a try from nothing."
Veteran Fiji wing Sireli Bobo and former Scotland prop Euan Murray are also among Pau's selection options.
The Dragons have six points from their opening two matches, while Pau have played only once after games were postponed in the wake of November's terrorist attacks in Paris.
Pau left Sale Sharks pointless in their 's only game in the competition despite running them close in a 29-20 defeat.
Jones added: "Because of where we are as a business we can't protect players, we've got to challenge ourselves to score four tries in 80 minutes of rugby."
Dorian Jones, who earned the man of the match award after kicking 14 points against much-changed Munster, wants to alter opponents' perceptions of visiting Rodney Parade.
"We need to start getting some respect from the opposition" said fly-half Jones.
"If they want to come here and roll out the boys that haven't had much game-time, we need to perform and make sure they do send their big names.
"We had a slow start [to the season] similar to last year, but Europe kicked us on and I feel we're going somewhere now."
Jones is relishing possibly facing All Blacks World Cup winner Slade.
"Being a young player coming through you want to test yourselves against the best, that's what you look forward to doing," said Jones.
"We want to play against big names, that's how you improve.
