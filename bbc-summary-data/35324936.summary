[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The history of the Boots No7 beauty brand and how it evolved alongside social changes affecting women is being explored in a new exhibition.

It is being held to mark 80 years of the brand, which was launched by the Nottingham-based company in 1935.
In Victorian times, colour cosmetics had been considered a form of deception more suited to actresses and prostitutes.
However, attitudes were changing by the early 20th century.
One of the exhibition's curators, Sophie Clapp from the Boots Archives, said people were partly influenced by the glamour of Hollywood stars.
"The suffragettes started to wear bright red lipstick as an act of defiance and then you get the flapper movement in the 20s, again showing that modernity and trying to be something a bit way out there, and really that softens in the 1930s," she said.
"We started to get requests from our customers later on in the late part of the decade, and our response was to start producing a few different products that were colour cosmetics."
Another curator, Dr Richard Hornsey from the University of Nottingham, said his favourite parts of the exhibition are from the middle of the 1930s.
'Not quite respectable'
"At the time cosmetics and particularly colour cosmetics were very daring and women don't really have much experience of them," said Dr Hornsey, a lecturer in Modern British History.  "There's very tentative advice about how to wear colour.
"There's this lovely line in one of the advice booklets that says 'Only you should know that the rouge is there'. Because it's still not quite respectable to wear make-up or to be seen to be wearing too much make-up, which is this big fear at the time."
Cosmetics were not rationed during World War Two, but manufacturers faced government restrictions on the amount they could produce.
"There's some anxiety early on about whether important factory resources should be spent on producing make-up, but then this realisation that make-up is really important," said Dr Hornsey.
"It's important partly because women are entering a lot of male jobs, going into factories, driving buses and so forth, and this is a way that women can retain their femininity while they're in uniform.
"But also there's something about the act of putting on lipstick, for instance, that becomes an act of defiance. 'I'm still going, I'm still beautiful, I'm still doing my daily routine, you haven't got me yet Hitler'."
Ms Clapp said there was an "explosion" in the number of products available after the war.
Beauty products were often promoted as a way of getting male attention, with one slogan telling women: "Someone is always looking at you. Stay lovely always."
But later the focus changed to women's self-expression and style.
"Suddenly there's a shift in the 70s where it's much more about them doing it to make yourself feel good," said Ms Clapp.
"And this seems to be a theme that's carried on and it's still really what we would think of today, as the reason why we put make-up on every day."
"Certainly the idea of looking good for men seems to have completely disappeared over the last several decades and I don't think that's going to be coming back," said Dr Hornsey.
The exhibition is at the Weston Gallery at Nottingham Lakeside Arts until 17 April and a series of free talks is also being held to accompany it.
