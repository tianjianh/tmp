A clock presented to the greatest Open golfing champion ever has been sold at auction for almost double its estimate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20th century bracket clock was presented to Henry "Harry" Vardon after he won the Open for the fifth time in 1911.
The legendary Jersey golfer won the Open title a record six times between 1896 and 1914 and the US Open in 1900.
Estimated at between Â£2,000 and Â£3,000, the clock was sold at auction in Wiltshire for Â£4,400.
Mr Vardon became the professional at South Herts Golf Club in 1902, according to Devizes auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son.
A silver hallmarked plaque on the clock reads: "Presented by The South Herts Golf Club To Harry Vardon Open Champion 1896, 1898, 1899, 1905, 1911 July 2nd 1911."
Born and raised in Jersey, Vardon honed his game on the fairways of the Royal Jersey golf club before going on to dominate the game, once winning 14 tournaments in a row.
Described as golf's first international celebrity, his arrival in the US to compete would prompt the New York stock exchange to close down so brokers could watch him play.
It is also understood he was also reputed to have been booked on the Titanic in 1912 to play in the US Open but did not travel because illness.
The lot - which included a certificated copy of his death certificate, newspaper cuttings, personal note paper and photograph - was sold to a British collector at the weekend.
