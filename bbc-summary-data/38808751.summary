[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greater Manchester mayor: Peter Clifford stands as Communist League candidate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A communist trade unionist is standing as a candidate in the Greater Manchester mayoral election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Clifford, 61, from Manchester, will contest the election on 4 May on behalf of the Communist League.
He will campaign about issues such as policing, tackling anti-Semitism and "declining" health care conditions.
The successful candidate will lead Greater Manchester Combined Authority, which is made up of the leaders of each of the area's 10 local authorities.
The mayor will chair meetings and allocate responsibilities to the authority's cabinet.
Candidates so far are:
Sean Anstee (Conservative)
Jane Brophy (Liberal Democrat)
Andy Burnham (Labour)
Peter Clifford (Communist League)
Stephen Morris (English Democrats)
Shneur Odze (UKIP)
Will Patterson (Green Party)
Mr Clifford, a production line butcher at Tulip Meats in Dukinfield, said: "I'm standing to help build a movement of working people to replace capitalism which is the source of the problem."
He said his campaign would take him on to door steps across Greater Manchester where he will explain "how working class people made the two great revolutions of the last century in Cuba and Russia".
"We will need to follow their example and to win we will need a working class revolutionary party, independent of the capitalists," he said.
