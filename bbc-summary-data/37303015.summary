[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the families of Ken Cresswell, 57, and John Shaw, 61, both from Rotherham, had been informed.
A guard of honour was formed as the body was taken away from the site.
The body of a third man Christopher Huxtable, 34, from Swansea was found in August.
Representatives of the missing men's families joined police and fire and rescue crews, and staff from site owners RWE and contractors Coleman and Company as the man's body was taken away at about 06:15 BST.
Police said contractors paused the removal of debris so specialists from the emergency services could enter the site.
Thames Valley Police confirmed the body had been safely recovered but has not yet been formally identified, which will be a matter for the coroner.
A police spokesman said: "Our thoughts remain with the families of Ken Cresswell and John Shaw and we would ask that their privacy is respected during this incredibly difficult time."
A fourth man, Michael Collings, 53, from Brotton, Teesside, died from multiple injuries following the partial collapse of the structure in February when it was due for demolition.
The remaining section was brought down using explosives in July.
