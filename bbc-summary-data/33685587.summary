Conley Thompson was found on Monday at a building site on Bank End Road, Worsbrough, near to his home.
Reverend Trevor Keightley from St Thomas and St James Church, yards from the site, said people had been "very distressed by this deep tragedy".
Conley's grandmother, Deborah Fraser, said Conley was thought to have slipped into a vertical plastic pipe.
Rev Keightley said the church would be open from 09:30 BST until 19:00 BST on Tuesday and Wednesday to support people.
"If they want to pray, to reflect or to share their grief, there'll be somebody here to help them through that process," he said.
Det Ch Insp Dave Stopford, of South Yorkshire Police, said the construction site had been checked but officers were unable to gain access as it was "securely locked".
The force is working with the Health and Safety Executive to establish the cause of death.
He was last seen playing in a park at about 20:00 BST on Sunday. Police were alerted when he did not return home two hours later.
Conley's grandmother said he was known to have played on the construction site before, and had been told not to go in.
"We know that he's got through a small hole in top of the construction site, and because it's been wet he's slid down and gone into a vertical pipe," Mrs Fraser said.
South Yorkshire Police said the death would be treated as unexplained until results of the post-mortem examination were released.
