Girls again performed better than boys at reading in Wales' National Reading and Numeracy Tests.

The second set of full results for around 250,000 seven to 14-year-old pupils have been published.
They were brought in in 2013 to drive up standards and help identify struggling pupils.
More boys than girls were above the standard scores for numeracy. Altogether more than two thirds of pupils had a "standard" score.
Every child is scored according to their test results, which take into account their age at the time of testing.
The mean score is 100 and the results detail the number of pupils scoring less than 85 and those above 115.
The headline results are similar to 2014.
Monmouthshire still has the largest proportion of pupils scoring above 115 - nearly a quarter.
But Blaenau Gwent still has the largest proportion scoring less than 85 (19%), although this has dropped slightly. In Monmouthshire, it is 8.9%.
The gap between girls and boys scoring above 115 stood at 4.7 percentage points according to the latest results.
