Rangers' Martyn Waghorn happy to forgo break for Europa League

Rangers striker Martyn Waghorn insists he will happily sacrifice an extended summer break if it means getting a taste of European action.

Following newspaper claims, manager Pedro Caixinha on Thursday insisted there is no discord among his squad over plans for pre-season.
And Waghorn does not mind a short break due to Europa League qualifiers.
"It is short and it's not ideal, but it happens and we are back for good reason," he said.
"We are back early because the European schedule dictates it, but you just have to get your feet up for 10 days and then get back to it.
"I am more excited about the prospect of being in Europe and it is one of those things that you've just got to get on with.
"You come to Rangers to play in these competitions and it is just the way the fixtures fall, but you can't go into a busy European schedule not prepared.
"The time off has all been worked out strategically and you just have to deal with it."
Waghorn insists that Rangers are not building an inferiority complex against Celtic.
Their Glasgow rivals have won four of their five meetings with Rangers - the other was drawn - this season.
After Celtic's 2-0 win in Sunday's Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden, Rangers host the latest Old Firm derby in the league on Saturday.
Asked if beating Brendan Rodgers' side was starting to feel like an impossible task, the Englishman said: "If you think like that, it will become that.
"It will be in the back of your mind the whole time.
"The thing about this team is that we have a lot of big personalities, a lot of big characters.
"We're all disappointed from the weekend, but we can use that the right way.
"We're going into Saturday in front of 50,000 at Ibrox, it's the last Old Firm of the season and we've got a point to prove. It's set up to be, hopefully, a good game.
"I understand we've not won against Celtic yet this season.
"But there is always going to be a time and there is always going to be someone who is going to beat them and you have to be positive going into these big games."
