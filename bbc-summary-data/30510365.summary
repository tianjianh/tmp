The band's nominations also include best track for Eez-eh and music moment of the year for their headline set at Glastonbury.
Royal Blood and Jamie T are both up for seven awards each.
The shortlists have been decided by NME readers, with the awards taking place on 18 February at 02 Academy Brixton.
Brighton rock duo Royal Blood are up for best British band and best live band, while Jamie T is up for best solo artist and best fan community.
Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, Royal Blood, and The Libertines will fight it out for two of the night's biggest awards, having all been named in both the best British band and best live band categories.
Kasabian said: "2014 has been such an incredible year for us, and being nominated for eight NME Awards is a better Christmas present than getting Castle Greyskull in 1986! Thanks very much."
Alt-J and Chvrches are also up for best British band while Fat White Family and Foo Fighters are among the best live band nominees.
The best album category will be fought out between Jamie T, Kasabian, Royal Blood, La Roux, Run The Jewels and St Vincent, with this year's worst band award being between 5 seconds of summer, One Direction, U2, Bastille, Blink-182 and The 1975.
This year's villain of the year category includes Taylor Swift, Russell Brand, Bono, Nigel Farage, David Cameron and Harry Styles who has been nominated for the award for the third year in a row.
Online voting for the awards, which is open now, closes on 16 January.
