Dumfries and Galloway Council staff cost cut levels outlined

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A report has outlined the scale of savings being made from council staff costs in Dumfries and Galloway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A range of measures are being taken in this financial year in a bid to trim more than £2m from expenditure.
More than 700 staff showed an interest in some form of early retirement or voluntary severance (ERVS).
A total of 153 have been approved to leave, more than 300 withdrew their interest after receiving terms and another 278 are still interested.
The staff being allowed to leave should deliver savings of more than £1.3m this year with £2.4m forecast in 2017/18.
Potential savings of another £3.1m have been estimated from all the other applications still in the system.
Reductions in overtime, a work life balance scheme, salary sacrifice and staff redeployment are also expected to deliver savings.
However, the report warns that trade unions are unwilling to agree to any changes to staff terms and conditions until all alternatives - including ERVS - have been "fully exhausted".
The local authority has already cut staff levels by the equivalent of more than 600 full-time posts in the past year.
