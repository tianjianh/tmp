Royal Mint sells tiny fractions of gold bars for £20

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Llantrisant-based Royal Mint has launched a service to allow people to buy tiny fractions of gold bars, with prices starting at £20.

The "signature gold" service has been added to the Mint's bullion trading website, which was set up last year.
It is the first time the Royal Mint has sold gold by price rather than weight.
The Mint says it hopes the new service will open up the world of gold trading to smaller investors.
Once bought, the gold will remain in the Mint's vault, which is protected around the clock by the Ministry of Defence.
