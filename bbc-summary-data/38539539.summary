Dunfermline Athletic 1-1 St Mirren

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Mirren remain seven points adrift at the foot of the Scottish Championship after a high-tempo draw with Dunfermline Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kallum Higginbotham's penalty nudged the hosts ahead before the break.
Almost immediately after half-time Gary McKenzie levelled for Saints with a powerful header from a corner.
Michael Moffat and Nicky Clark both spurned chances to restore the Pars' lead, while Saints' Lewis Morgan could have snatched a vital victory late on.
You can see where a lot of St Mirren's problems stem from as their defence looked fragile whenever Dunfermline attacked their backline with pace.
Veteran ex-Pars goalkeeper Jamie Langfield had to be lively to block a couple of early chances while Andy Webster cleared a Paul McMullan shot off the line and Moffat had a penalty claim denied.
That was for a reckless challenge by MacKenzie, who didn't learn his lesson, as a repeat incident in the 36th minute was punished by Willie Collum, with Higginbotham scoring from the spot.
MacKenzie's determination to make amends saw him steer a header from a Stevie Mallan corner against the post just before the interval.
This time it was the Pars who paid the price for ignoring a warning as the defender's perseverance paid off a minute after the restart - he powered home another Mallan corner.
It was his defensive qualities that were severely tested for long spells after that equaliser though as the Fifers went in search of the winner to strengthen their push for a play-off place.
Clark was a real handful with his movement and aerial ability but he could only look on with frustration after a dazzling run ended with Moffat turning his team mate's cross wide from six yards.
It took a brilliant diving save from Langfield to deny Clark a ninth goal of the season when his header seemed certain to hit the net, while Higginbotham flashed a couple of 20-yard drives wide.
Then two minutes from time Clark's glancing header went agonisingly wide as St Mirren dug in to claim their first point in three meetings between the teams this season.
Dunfermline manager Allan Johnston: "It is definitely two points dropped as far as I'm concerned. We created the most chances from open play and some really good chances at that.
"We've probably got to finish them off then we get caught with a block defending a corner that St Mirren work very well to get their equaliser.
"It's been a great run (nine unbeaten) but you are always going to get frustrated when you lose goals that are avoidable even though we have tightened up since the start of the season."
St Mirren boss Jack Ross: "After going behind against the team with currently the best form in the division then getting a point means there was more positives than negatives.
"If we can pick up points at place like this then win our home games then we will start to climb the table.
"In the main, the performance levels have been good but last week's (a 3-0 defeat at home to Queen of the South) wasn't acceptable and I was honest with the players in my criticism of them and they responded."
