Agg came through the youth system at Brighton, before spells with Arsenal, London Bees and Millwall.
The 23-year-old returned to Brighton to help them win promotion from the Women's Premier League last season.
"It is great to add another player to the squad, especially one with the desire that Lily has shown to join the club," head coach Willie Kirk said.
