[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mark McGhee to complete touchline ban after Motherwell game abandoned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark McGhee will serve the second match of his two-game touchline ban against St Johnstone after Motherwell's meeting with Aberdeen was abandoned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McGhee was in the stand at Pittodrie on Wednesday but floodlight failure forced the game to be called off.
The 59-year-old was banned after admitting use of abusing and/or insulting language towards a match official and a steward in November.
Bookings for Andy Considine and Stephen McManus at Pittodrie will not count.
Aberdeen defender Considine and Motherwell counterpart McManus were both yellow-carded before the initial floodlight failure that resulted in both sets of players leaving the field.
After an 18-minute break, play resumed at 0-0 but, almost immediately, the ground plunged into near darkness and the match was abandoned with the floodlight issues put down to a generator tripping.
McGhee had served the first part of his ban when Well drew 0-0 with Kilmarnock at Fir Park on Saturday and his side travel to face Saints at McDiarmid Park this Saturday.
