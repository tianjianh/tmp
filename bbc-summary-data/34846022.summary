Cox, 23, who can also play second-row, came through the youth system at Rovers and made his debut in 2011.
Cox, who played nine Super League games in 2015, has also had stints out on loan at Huddersfield and Halifax.
"Warrington are always near the top, always there or thereabouts, pushing for silverware and challenging for top spot," said Cox.
