[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Gregory rifled home after 13 minutes when the Gills failed to clear their lines after a corner.
Fred Onyedinma doubled the lead after 63 minutes, before Paul Konchesky saw red for his second yellow in eight minutes.
Bradley Dack's 25-yard shot gave the visitors hope, but Millwall deservedly held on.
The Lions went close when Shaun Hutchinson's header was cleared off the line by Baily Cargill, but the ball fell to Gregory, who clinically fired in his 10th of the season.
Millwall thought the game was over courtesy of eight minutes of madness from Konchesky.
The former Charlton and West Ham defender was booked after 58 minutes, before Onyedinma bundled his way past him to score five minutes later.
Konchesky then scythed the goalscorer down, leaving the referee with no choice.
Dack gave the Gills a lifeline after 76 minutes with a half-volley from 25 yards, before he too was sent off for a second yellow in injury time.
