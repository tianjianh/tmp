North Wales Police was called to an address in the Bryn Heulog area at 20:30 GMT on Thursday and David Kingsbury, 35, was found dead nearby.
A 38-year-old woman from Old Colwyn is being questioned by police.
Police are appealing for motorists "who may have had active dash-cams operating in their vehicles" to come forward and help their enquiry.
Officers said they were interested in hearing from anyone who may have seen or heard a couple arguing in Bryn Heulog, Llysfaen Road or Abergele Road between 19:00 and 21:00 on 5 January.
A post mortem examination revealed Mr Kingsbury died from a single stab wound.
Insp Kelly Isaacs said: "We would like to reassure the local community that Old Colwyn is a very safe place, with instances of violence, particularly of this nature, being extremely rare."
