Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 CSKA Moscow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham secured a place in the Europa League knockout stage as their Champions League campaign ended with a convincing victory over CSKA Moscow.

Spurs, who needed to avoid defeat to secure third in Group E, went behind when Alan Dzagoev scored from Zoran Tosic's headed flick-on.
But Dele Alli, who had already missed two good chances, half-volleyed in Christian Eriksen's cross to level, before Harry Kane finished a stylish move to put Spurs in front.
CSKA keeper Igor Akinfeev gifted Spurs a third when he inadvertently guided Alli's header into his own net after making an initial save.
It means Tottenham will enter the Europa League for the sixth consecutive season after their first appearance in the Champions League for five years ended in disappointment.
But there were positive signs for Spurs as they created numerous chances in a performance inspired by Eriksen's creativity and range of passing.
Who can Tottenham face now?
Despite Spurs' hopes of progressing in the Champions League being extinguished by a defeat at Monaco two weeks ago, boss Mauricio Pochettino opted for a strong side. He made just one change from the 5-0 win over Swansea in the Premier League on Saturday, bringing in Harry Winks for Mousa Dembele.
And the Argentine was rewarded not only with a Europa League berth, but also a first win for Tottenham at Wembley in their last seven outings - including domestic competitions.
Spurs' decision to play this season's Champions League home games at Wembley - and their upcoming Europa League games - meant they were left playing a game with very little at stake in the grand surroundings of the national stadium.
Tottenham have the option to use Wembley for all of their home games next season and, despite losing their first two group games there, a club-record attendance of 85,512 against Bayer Leverkusen last month and this win over CSKA Moscow might make that prospect more appealing.
There was further good news for Spurs as defender Toby Alderweireld came off the bench after missing the last 10 games through injury, suggesting he could be fit for Sunday's league game against Manchester United.
Spurs finished as one of the four best third-placed teams in the Champions League groups, meaning they will be seeded for the last 32 of the Europa League when the draw is made on Monday.
The full line-up for the draw will be determined by Thursday's final Europa League group games - but Spurs will face an unseeded side and cannot be matched with a team from England, should Manchester United and Southampton progress.
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: "First of all, thank you to our supporters. We were all disappointed after Monaco.
"It was good, we started to show how we play against Chelsea and Swansea and today confirmed we've increased our level."
Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli speaking to BT Sport: "It's frustrating when you don't put away an early chance. I started getting frustrated but it was important I put a chance away.
"We have a belief in the squad. We felt we were dominating and knew the chances would come."
Tottenham striker Harry Kane speaking to BT Sport: "We've learned to be better at home. You have to win your home games - you can't rely on away results.
"We've finished the campaign well, there's a bit of pride to send the fans home happy."
