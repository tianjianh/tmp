With Alex Revell on loan at Wigan and Idriss Saadi out with a hamstring injury, Slade is "confident" of boosting his striker resources.
Slade has also set his sights on two more recruits in January as the club targets a Championship play-off finish.
"If we possibly can, we will look to strengthen," Slade said.
"The important thing is between now and that window is to maintain some momentum that keeps us right in the hunt for promotion.''
Slade is already looking to the January transfer window to bolster his resources to sustain a play-off challenge, with his side currently seventh in the Championship.
"From my point of view it's always been a top-six finish and the players have definitely been buying into that," he added.
"If we can find the right couple of players and get the support in January that can add to that and keep us in there, we will do so.
"We talk openly about what we need with the owner [Vincent Tan] and the chief executive Ken Choo going into the January window.
"You never stop building your list between window to window."
Slade confirmed striker Kenwyne Jones will be in the squad for Saturday's game at fifth-placed Derby County,
The 31-year-old's fitness will be assessed on his return from international duty with Trinidad and Tobago.
Midfielder Peter Whittingham returns from a one match ban, while Kigasho Dikgacoi is back from a hamstring injury.
Fellow midfielder Joe Ralls will play against Derby having signed a contract extension and Slade believes it will be good business for Cardiff.
"I still think there is so much more to come from Joe," Slade said.
"There is more progress and improvement to come because he is still young and at a great age.
"Therefore providing he keeps his feet on the ground and is willing to learn, which he is, his value will continue to go up."
