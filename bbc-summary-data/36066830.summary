On Monday, the focus will be on Haverfordwest in the mainly rural Preseli Pembrokeshire constituency.  The area also includes the towns of Fishguard, Milford Haven and St David's.
At the last assembly election, the Conservatives won the seat with 42.4% of the vote with Labour coming second with 34.4%.
At the same election, Labour won two of the mid and west Wales regional seats with Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats taking one each.
On Tuesday the tour moves to Llanelli.
This is one of the key battleground seats where in 2011 Labour beat Plaid Cymru by just 80 votes.
The future of the steel industry will be a big issue as the town is home to Tata's Trostre tinplate plant which currently employs around 650 people.
Wednesday sees the tour's final day in the mid and west Wales region with a visit to Machynlleth in the Montgomeryshire constituency.
The town was was the seat of Owain Glyndwr's Welsh Parliament in 1404.
At the elections in 2011, the assembly seat was won by the Conservatives with a majority of 2,324 and 43.7% of the vote. They took it from the Liberal Democrats who had 33.6% of the vote.
The next stop is Anglesey on Thursday, and the island constituency of Ynys Mon.
This seat was won by Plaid Cymru in 2011 and subsequently held in a by-election in 2013 with nearly 60% of the vote.
Then on Friday, Wrexham welcomes the tour. It is the largest town in the north and the constituency borders England.
In 2011, Labour won the seat with 44% of the vote and the Conservatives came second with 26%.
You can follow the tour across all BBC Cymru Wales' services all week.
Then the following week, the tour starts making its way back down south.
