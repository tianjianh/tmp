[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wyton animal rights protest at Harlan breeding site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An animal rights protest which was the subject of a High Court case is being held outside a laboratory near Huntingdon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two groups objecting to Harlan Laboratories' breeding of animals for medical research have held protests at its four UK sites since April.
A High Court injunction earlier this month ordered them not to continue to wear bloodstained clothing.
The court permitted up to 100 people to protest at the Wyton site on Saturday.
Protests by the National Anti-Vivisection Alliance (NAVA) and Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) had been held at Wyton and at Harlan in Leicestershire, Oxfordshire and Derbyshire.
They had been marked by activists in bloodstained costumes, which the groups said represented the "slaughter" of animals.
On 3 August, the High Court heard the clothing amounted to harassment of Harlan staff, who are involved in animal husbandry, not vivisection.
After Saturday's demonstration, protests involving up to 25 people can be held for up to three hours, once a week, at each of Harlan's sites.
