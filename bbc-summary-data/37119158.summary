[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Ellam, 52, died on Monday after being attacked by the animal in the Sheepridge area of Huddersfield.
The force seized the dog from its owner in June on suspicion it was a banned pit bull breed. It was returned on 8 August.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) will investigate.

IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: "The death of Mr Ellam was a tragic incident and my sympathies go to his family.
"Our independent investigation will look closely at police actions prior to Mr Ellam's death, including the decision-making around the removal, testing and return of the dog.
"A criminal investigation into Mr Ellam's death is being carried out by West Yorkshire Police."
West Yorkshire police said it was believed Mr Ellam was trying to protect his own Yorkshire Terrier when the larger dog turned on him.
A 29-year-old, thought to be the dog's owner, was arrested in connection with the incident and later released on police bail.
The force said the dog had been taken to kennels where it will remain throughout its investigation into Mr Ellam's death.
