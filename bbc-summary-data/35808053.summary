Dougie Freedman was sacked on Sunday, meaning replacement Paul Williams - in charge until the summer - is the eighth boss to work for the Al Hasawis since the Kuwaiti family took over in 2012.
"I don't want to sell and walk away," Al Hasawi told BBC East Midlands Today.
"But if it carries on in the same thing as this, maybe I might do."
Forest have slipped to within nine points of the Championship relegation zone following a run of five defeats in their last six games.
And Al Hasawi admitted he is getting tired of the criticism he is receiving.
He added: "If people are pushing and always negative, and there is no appreciation, why should I continue?
"Maybe there are some people better than me and I am doing it wrong. If there is somebody who wants to buy the club and gives me the right money, maybe I do so."
