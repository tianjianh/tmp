[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Jamie Lindsay gave the home side the lead with a close-range effort just before the break.
Ross Forbes made it two at the start of the second half after Falkirk, one place behind Morton in the league, failed to clear inside the box.
Victory stretched the hosts' unbeaten run at home to 17 matches.

In a tightly contested first 45 minutes, the home side broke the deadlock just before the break and it came from a mix-up in the Bairns' defence.
David McCracken tried to clear a Forbes header just outside the six-yard box but as he swivelled to clear the ball, his effort fell at the feet of the onrushing Lindsay, who blasted in at the back post.
Falkirk's failure to clear cost them again directly after the break.
Forbes passed up a gilt-edged opportunity when the ball fell to him six yards out, but he was gifted a second chance and this time fired home from close range with the Falikrk defence looking on.
The visitors should probably have taken the lead after 20 minutes but Derek Gaston saved well at the feet of James Craigen, who found himself through on goal.
Peter Houston's side pushed hard late in the game looking for a lifeline, but in truth it was the host who looked more likely to add to their lead.
