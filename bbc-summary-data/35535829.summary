Game of Thrones trees: White lines have people seeing red

They feature in Game of Thrones and are one of Northern Ireland's most famous natural landmarks, but fans of north Antrim's Dark Hedges are concerned that road markings painted by mistake have spoiled their look.

The iconic tunnel of trees on the Bregagh Road near Armoy features as the Kingsroad in the smash-hit HBO television series.
However, the Department for Regional Development (DRD) has admitted that a contractor mistakenly painted white lines on the road under the trees.
It is the second setback for the Dark Hedges in just over a week.
At the end of January, Storm Gertrude ripped up two of the 200-year-old beeches that overhang the road and damaged a third.
While nothing can be done to replace the trees, the DRD has promised to rectify the contractor's error.
"Following completion of a small resurfacing scheme along a 200-metre stretch of the Bregagh Road at the Dark Hedges, the white lining at the junction with the Ballinlea Road was extended in error," a spokesperson said.
"The contractor has since been instructed to remove the line, and we expect this to be completed by tomorrow [Wednesday].
"The white lining will be burned off by the contractor.  Whilst there is the potential for some residual marking to the carriageway as a result of the removal, we are confident that, given the time of year and the number of vehicles using the Bregagh Road that any such marks will disappear soon.
"DRD will continue to monitor the condition of the surface over the coming weeks, and will take further action to repair the road if necessary."
Heather Morrison of the Dark Hedges Preservation Trust told the BBC: "I first saw the picture on Facebook  - so I drove over to see it for myself on Sunday.
"When I saw the white lines I nearly died."
Amateur photographer Bob McCallion has been photographing the Dark Hedges for 20 years.
He said the white lines were "sacrilege".
"They've just considered the road to be more or less like any other road in the country," he said.
Mr McCallion said while he was glad the lines were being removed, a wider strategy was needed to preserve the trees.
"If you go there for the first time, you think they're still brilliant and they are. But if you have been following them [over time], you will see the deterioration in those trees," he said.
"It's not Game of Thrones' fault, it's the lack of strategy or facilities to cope with those visitors.
"There's a whole scenario that doesn't seem to improve year on year."
