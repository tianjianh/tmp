But the BBC drama - which celebrated its 30th anniversary last month - was beaten to the TV soap of the year award by its ITV rival Coronation Street.
Ant and Dec were named TV personalities of the year for the third year running at the industry bash in central London.
Susanna Reid, meanwhile, won best news presenter/reporter for the second year in succession.
The event saw a number of last year's award recipients recognised again, among them Strictly Come Dancing (best reality programme), Channel 4's Gogglebox (best entertainment programme) and BBC Breakfast's Carol Kirkwood (best weather presenter).
Other winners included BBC One's popular teatime quiz Pointless (best daytime programme), Silent Witness (best crime programme) and Downton Abbey, which was named best drama over its ITV stablemates Cilla and Doc Martin.
Capital Radio's breakfast show was named best digital radio programme, while Radio 2's Chris Evans won the digital radio personality prize.
The event also saw the BBC's football highlights show Match of the Day honoured with a special Tric award.
Dyer's EastEnders character, Mick Carter, made his first appearance on Albert Square on 25 December 2013.
Speaking to chat show host Graham Norton last month, the 37-year-old Human Traffic star said he was "happy to sit back and be part of" a show he likened to "a retirement home".
First presented in 1989, the Tric Awards are voted for by members of the TV and radio industries.
