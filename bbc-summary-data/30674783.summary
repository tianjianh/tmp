Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has new injury concerns after wing-backs Rafael and Luke Shaw went off at half-time in Sunday's FA Cup third-round win at League One Yeovil.

Rafael suffered a fractured cheekbone in a challenge while Shaw was unable to continue because of an ankle problem.
Fellow wing-backs Ashley Young (hamstring) and Antonio Valencia (groin) are already sidelined.
"It was a very physical game," Van Gaal said.

"Rafael has an injury and a fracture of his bone so it was fantastic he had the guts to play through.
"I had to change him and also Luke Shaw because he had an ankle problem. He played on also. Rafael has already gone away in a car to the hospital. I don't know how he did it. I cannot say. I will have to watch the video. Also, the same with Shaw."
Despite the withdrawal of Rafael and Shaw at the break, United improved in the second half at Huish Park as goals from Ander Herrera and Angel Di Maria, on his return from a pelvic injury, secured a 2-0 victory.
Manchester United have not won the FA Cup since beating Millwall in 2004 and Van Gaal sees no reason why they cannot enjoy success in the competition this season.
"I want to win a title and the players also," the Dutchman said.
"I have been told by my assistant manager (Ryan Giggs) that Man United for over 10 years have not won the FA Cup, so maybe we can do that this year.
"But it's a very long way and the priority is also the Premier League."
