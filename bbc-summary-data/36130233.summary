The 42-year-old Scot joined the Shots last April and guided the side to safety this season.
"I had to make a decision for my family," he said.
"The board have given me their full backing throughout the season, but also have understood why I needed to make this decision to return to Scotland."
The former Dundee and Alloa boss has won 15 of his 45 league games at Aldershot and will take charge of the side for the last time at Bromley on Saturday.
The Hampshire side are 16th in the table heading into the final day of the season.
"I would like to thank Barry for his honesty in making what must have been a very difficult decision," Shots chairman Shahid Azeem said.
"We are sorry to lose him but recognise that some things are more important than football."
