In July, Leeds chief executive officer Ben Mansfield said Taylor did not want to sign a new contract at Elland Road.
The 22-year-old has been linked with moves to Premier League clubs West Brom, Burnley and Middlesbrough.
Meanwhile, Leeds have signed former Spain forward Pablo Hernandez on a six-month loan deal from Qatari side Al-Arabi with a view to a permanent move.
Hernandez played alongside Leeds head coach Garry Monk at Swansea between August 2012 and February 2014, when Monk was appointed as Swans head coach.
The 31-year-old moved to Qatar in July 2014, but spent last season on loan at Rayo Vallecano, who suffered relegation from La Liga.
