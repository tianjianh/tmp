Wing Joyce is one of four changes to the team following their heavy defeat by England in Cardiff.
The other changes see Rhiannon Parker come in at scrum-half, Rebecco de Filippo return at centre and Cerys Hale at loosehead prop.
Joyce scored two tries in a non-cap match against Spain in January.
"Jasmine and Rhiannon are two talented individuals who have been in and around the squad for a while now, and we feel the way they've performed in the warm-up games and in training has earned them this opportunity," Wales Women boss Rowland Phillips said.
After their defeat by England, Phillips says his players have responded well in training and they can rise to the occasion against Scotland, who were defeated 55-0 against France in their last game.
Phillips continued: "The response of the players following the England match has been outstanding. From the Sunday following that game, our focus immediately moved on to Scotland.
"Scotland's last two performances in the competition - losing to a last-minute play from Ireland and being very competitive in the first 20 minutes against France - shows how much they have improved this season. We will need to be ready for this challenge."
