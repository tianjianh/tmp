Corbin only joined Loughborough from Hertfordshire Mavericks in the summer.
But the 27-year-old suffered anterior cruciate ligament damage against her former club in just her second game.
"I'm trying to stay positive, keep my entire focus on the future and getting back fitter and stronger," she told the Loughborough Sport website.
Corbin had to be helped off the court during Saturday's game, which Loughborough lost 49-44.
"I will draw on the inspiration of having seen many of the greatest netballers and other athletes in the world come back from this type of injury," she added.
