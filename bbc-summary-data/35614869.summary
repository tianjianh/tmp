[SN]TITLE[SN]
Drug dealer jailed for Thomas Rossiter car killing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for 12 years and six months for drug dealing and causing the death of a man who was hit and dragged under his car in Kent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Rossiter, 42, died in hospital after he was injured in the incident on 4 July in Lynden Way, Swanley.
Erasmus Ahwoi, 30, of Stroud Green Gardens, Croydon, south London was jailed for eight years for causing Mr Rossiter's death by dangerous driving.
He was also jailed for four years and six months for drug offences.
Maidstone Crown Court ordered the two sentences to run consecutively.
Kent Police said Mr Rossiter got into Ahwoi's car but got out again after they got involved in a dispute.
Ahwoi then drove off and hit Mr Rossiter, dragging him along the road for about 100m (330ft).
Police used automatic number plate recognition cameras to trace the vehicle, a Kia Venga, which had been hired from a firm in Croydon.
Ahwoi was arrested on 10 July in London.
He was found guilty last month of the driving offence and pleaded guilty earlier to possessing cocaine and heroin with intent to supply and transferring criminal property.
A confiscation order for Â£96,369 was also put in place.
