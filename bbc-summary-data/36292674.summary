In one of the images, she's seen just about to dive into a pool with her father, King George VI.
In the other, she's looking at a bird that is perched on her arm.
The photos were released ahead of a gala show to mark her 90th birthday.
The celebration will be held at Windsor Castle on Sunday and will feature celebrities like Gary Barlow and Kylie Minogue.
Nine hundred horses will also take part in the birthday celebrations.
