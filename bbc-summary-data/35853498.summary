Luke Shaw is still in contention for Euro 2016 despite not having played for six months, according to England manager Roy Hodgson.

The Manchester United left-back was a regular starter for England before he broke his leg in a Champions League tie against PSV Eindhoven on 15 September.
Hodgson wants United to allow Shaw to prove his fitness before 12 May.
"Yeah, absolutely [the door is open]. All that remains is for him to get fit enough to be selected," said Hodgson.
"Luke Shaw's a player we believe in, we think is an excellent talent. We think he will be a major competitor with the other left-backs for a place in the squad."
Hodgson will announce his squad for the summer's European Championships on 12 May.
Tottenham's Danny Rose and Southampton's Ryan Bertrand have been selected at left-back for England's upcoming friendlies against France and the Netherlands.
United boss Louis van Gaal originally said Shaw would be out for at least six months and named the defender in their Europa League squad to give him a target for his recovery.
Hodgson added that he would be "disappointed" if United do not play Shaw before the end of the season, but admits that decision is "in the hands of the club".
"If they [United] decide they don't want to risk him in the final games, they do want to hold him back, they want to give him a pre-season to get 100% fit, there's not much I can do," he said.
"I would be a little bit disappointed in that I think the player deserves the opportunity, if he is fully fit, to be given a chance of being selected."
