The pair, aged 46 and 25, were detained by Port of Dover police on Monday after the attack on board P&O's Spirit Of France ship.
They remain in custody while officers continue to investigate.
P&O said the allegation led to a delay in travellers disembarking the ferry, which can carry up to 1,750 passengers.
A spokesman added: "As is our standard practice, disembarkation from the ship was unfortunately delayed for 45 minutes while officers arrived to meet the individuals involved.
"We would like to apologise sincerely to the other passengers for any inconvenience this may have caused to their onward journeys."
A Port of Dover Police statement said: "We were called on Monday 13 February to a report of an assault on a cross-Channel ferry.
"Officers attended and two men, one aged 46 and one aged 25, were arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. They are currently in custody."
In a separate incident on the same sailing, a small fire broke out below decks during routine maintenance work.
It extinguished by the crew within two minutes and no passengers were in danger.
