David Byrne murder: Fourth man held over hotel shooting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fourth man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a man at a boxing weigh-in in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Byrne was shot at the Regency Hotel in Dublin on 5 February.
A father and son, in their 50s and 30s, were arrested by the police on Tuesday.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) believe at least six people were involved in the attack which left two others wounded.
Three days after David Byrne's murder, Eddie Hutch Sr, 59, was also shot dead in his north Dublin flat in what looked like a revenge attack.
Both killings have been linked to a gangland feud in the city.
