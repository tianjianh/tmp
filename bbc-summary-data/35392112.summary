[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A recruitment fair is being held in Middlesbrough in a bid to find jobs for hundreds of redundant SSI steelworkers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 300 posts will be on offer from 30 employers at the SSI Task Force Jobs and Skills Fair at Middlesbrough College on Wednesday.
About 2,200 jobs were lost in October when Redcar's SSI Steelworks closed.
Chair of the SSI Task Force, Amanda Skelton, said it was a "great opportunity" to match people with jobs and to find retraining opportunities.
Previous job fairs held to help steel workers and contractors have resulted in more than 200 posts being filled.
