Gary Johnson's side had gone a club-record 22 league games without losing since a home reverse against Tranmere.
Robins defender Cameron Burgess inexplicably tapped past his own keeper to gift the hosts all three points.
Lee Cook could have doubled Eastleigh's lead but lashed over, while James Rowe had a shot well saved for the visitors.
The result moves the Spitfires up to eighth while Cheltenham could be knocked off top by the time they next play on Saturday, with second-placed Forest Green in action on Friday.
Cheltenham Town boss Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"We're not used to losing are we? We don't like losing and so after 23 games it's even more disappointing when you lose, because you start feeling you're a bit invincible.
"We came up against a clever team - in more ways than one - I felt we had more of the play, but we didn't create enough chances from our play.
"I'm disappointed, I've let the boys know some of them needed to show a little bit more and we'll see what happens over the coming weeks."
