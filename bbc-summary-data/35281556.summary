Independent research says 2.8 million women aged 14 to 40 who recognise the campaign say they have done some or more activity as a result.
And 1.6 million of those women say they have started exercising.
The snapshot survey asked a sample of 1,000 women in November 2015 about the physical activity they did and their awareness of the campaign.

The initiative aims to inspire women of all ages to participate in physical activity and exercise.
"I'm very encouraged by these new figures," said Sport England chief executive Jennie Price.
"They show This Girl Can is not just being talked about, but is also changing behaviour."
However, she added that there is still work to do.
"With a gender gap of 1.73 million fewer women playing sport compared to men, we need to keep getting the message out there that women come in all shapes and sizes and levels of ability," said Price.
"They should all feel able to exercise and play sport."
