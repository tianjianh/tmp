[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 0-1 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ademola Lookman's seventh goal of the season was all that Karl Robinson needed to see off his former club MK Dons and secure his first League One win as Charlton manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In what was a pretty dull and lifeless encounter between two mid-table sides who have faced off three times in as many weeks, Lookman's well-taken strike in the first half saw the Addicks secure their first win in seven games.
The hosts started the brighter of the two sides as both Nicky Maynard and Ben Reeves both saw their early chances fly just wide of Charlton goalkeeper Dillon Phillips' right-hand post inside the opening exchanges.
Dean Bowditch then failed to tap into an empty net just minutes later after Reeves' cut-back across the visitors' six-yard box found the Dons forward unmarked at the back post.
But it was the visitors who took a surprise lead through Lookman in the 38th minute after Andrew Crofts' excellent through-ball found the teenager one-on-one with Dons keeper David Martin before slotting home from close range.
Nicky Ajose almost wrapped things up for Charlton with five minutes to go after a mix-up in the Dons defence between Paul Downing and keeper Martin, but the striker's shot was well blocked.
