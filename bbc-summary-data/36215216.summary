Hillsborough families call for scrutiny group

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Families of Hillsborough victims are calling for a scrutiny group to oversee two police inquiries into the disaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawyers representing 22 families said the group would report directly to the home secretary and "provide scrutiny whilst maintaining independence".
Inquests concluded the 96 Liverpool fans who died were unlawfully killed.
The Crown Prosecution Service which is heading both the Independent Police Complaints Commission and Operation Resolve's inquiries is yet to comment.
Broudie Jackson Canter (BJC) solicitors said the families have agreed to meet Home Secretary Theresa May and the interim Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police Dave Jones following the conclusion of the fresh inquests.
BJC said the Hillsborough Article 2 Reference Group could comprise of two independent people appointed to go through documents in the investigations by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and Operation Resolve and raise any concerns to the home secretary on behalf of the families.
BJC said the group could also "preserve the right of a fair trial" for anyone facing charges after the findings of the criminal investigations while "maintaining independence".
Operation Resolve is investigating the causes of the disaster including the events on the day and those leading up to it. It is looking at a range of organisations and bodies involved in the preparation and planning of the 1989 FA Cup semi-final match.
The IPCC is looking into police actions in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster and investigating whether there was an alleged cover up.
The inquiries could finish by the end of 2016.
