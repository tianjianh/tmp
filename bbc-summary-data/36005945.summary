Masters 2016: Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke miss cut at Augusta

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke both missed the cut by some distance at the Masters after failing to break 80 on a day of tough conditions at Augusta.

McDowell, who looked well placed after an opening 72, hit an 81 which included eight bogeys and a double bogey and missed the cut by three shots.
Clarke, possibly playing in his final Masters round, slumped to an 84 which included four double bogeys.
The European Ryder Cup captain's 160 total was 10 outside the cut mark.
Clarke's round got off to a bad start as he double bogeyed the opening hole and his fate was sealed by a run of three more double bogeys and a bogey from the 11th.
The 47-year-old's five-year exemption for the all the game's four majors following his 2011 Open championship triumph will expire after the US Open at Oakmount in June.
But while McDowell, 36, and Clarke suffered disappointing exits, their compatriot Rory McIlroy is well placed to complete the career Grand Slam as he goes into the third round a shot behind leader and defending champion Jordan Spieth.
