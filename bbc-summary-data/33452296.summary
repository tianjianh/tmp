The families of UK aid workers murdered by Islamic State militants have backed calls for a national effort to combat extremists who groom young people.

The Muslim-led "Fightback Starts Here" coalition includes 100 charities, campaign groups and community organisations, as well as Christian, Jewish, Hindu and Sikh groups.
The campaign has pledged a collective effort to tackle extremism.
It has been backed by the families of murdered David Haines and Alan Henning.
Mr Haines and Mr Henning were both killed months after being kidnapped in Syria by IS, also known as Isis, while on aid missions.
Launching the campaign video online, the coalition said the UK urgently needed groups that had been actively combating extremism - from jihadism to neo-Nazis - to share their experiences more widely.
It has urged groups to help communities equip themselves with the tools needed to combat recruiters.
Mr Haines's brother, Mike, and Mr Henning's widow, Barbara, back the campaign and have signed an open letter calling on a united effort to "reject the lies that extremists spread".
Mike Haines said radicalisation and extremism comprised "the biggest challenge facing our communities in the UK".
"We cannot allow terrorist gangs to polarise our communities, we must stand united, pool our resources and expertise in tackling radicalisation and extremism, and send a clear message to those who wish to cause us harm that they will not defeat us," he said.
Mrs Henning said communities across the UK were being affected by "the serious threat of radicalisation and extremism by monsters like Isis".
"Their ability to use social media and the internet to spread hate must be stopped," she said.
"Now is the time that as a country, we come together and do everything within our power as a united community, to stop these vicious and poisonous groups from stealing our loved ones away."
The Fightback group said efforts over the decade since the 7/7 London suicide bombings had often been disjointed or too focused on expecting Muslims alone to find all the answers.
The group's open letter said: "We work every day to protect young people at risk from radicalisation, but it is a daily battle and one that demands a co-ordinated and concerted response.
"So today - with one voice - we launch our collective fightback against those who wish to do us harm."
Suleman Nagdi, of the Leicester-based Federation of Muslim Organisations and one of the co-ordinators, said: "The fightback has to start right here and right now - everyone has to step up to the challenge.
"Recent events continue to serve as a wake-up call to the serious threat of online and offline radicalisation.
"For too long we have seen a lot of good work in different parts of the community but we have never managed to gel the communities together."
Last month, Prime Minister David Cameron said there were radical elements of the Muslim community whose ideology paved the way for violent extremism, even if they did not go that far themselves.
The Home Office is currently preparing legislation aiming to curtail the extremist activity that falls short of terrorism-related offences such as encouraging violence.
The Fightback Starts Here coalition includes a number of influential Muslim-led groups that have played a key role in combating terrorism either by deradicalising young people involved in violent extremism or helping equip families to spot the warning signs.
Mr Nagdi said: "Many Muslim communities have spoken out against extremism and continue to do so but what we now need to do now is have a united voice.
"This is a true threat that we face as a nation. I do not think that we should single out a section of the community to say that you should be responsible because of the criminal activities of a handful of people."
