David Haye v Mark de Mori: Briton bulks up for heavyweight return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Haye says he has been setting two-hourly alarms to remind himself to eat as he bulks up for his return against Mark de Mori on Saturday.

The former WBA heavyweight champion fights the little-known Australian three and a half years after his last fight - a victory over Dereck Chisora.
"Instead of dieting down I've been packing the food in, eating every two, two and a half hours," said Haye, 35.
"I'm setting alarms to make sure I eat, that the weight doesn't get too low."
Haye says he has reinvented himself since he fought Chisora at Upton Park in July 2012.
Since that night, owing to a hand injury, a cut eye and a career-threatening shoulder injury, Haye has twice withdrawn from fights with Tyson Fury and another date with Manuel Charr, and in 2013 announced he had been advised to retire.
In advance of his comeback, he has also switched his trainer from Adam Booth to Shane McGuigan, while deciding that his former strategy to be as light as possible was flawed.
"In my old training camps, I used to come in around 15 stone - I'd lose a stone just cutting my food down," said Haye.
"The general consensus back then was, the lighter I am, the closer I am to cruiserweight, the faster I will be. That's all well and good, but when you're cutting weight down so low, and sparring big guys, I get injured.
"I'm not as ripped as I was in my last few fights, but it's not a bodybuilding competition. I'm more ripped than [De Mori] though."
Despite being a relative unknown in Britain, De Mori has lost only once in his 33 career bouts.
The 33-year-old Perth-born boxer's last defeat came in 2004, and 26 of his 29 victories have been via knockout.
In his own words, De Mori has "gone from a self-trained guy in my dad's garage with my wife wiping blood from my face to being properly trained".
He says he will not be relying on Haye breaking down injured, and will instead look for victory via a knockout.
"To put yourself in that position, you can't sit around on the outside dancing around and being defensive, you have to engage," said De Mori.
"It's a risky approach, but it's the only approach a guy with my style can take, and that's what I'm prepared for."
