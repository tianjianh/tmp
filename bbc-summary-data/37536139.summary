The Czech secured his 13th ATP title, and his second Shenzhen title, with a 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (2-7) 6-3 victory over third seed Gasquet.
Berdych, who missed the US Open with appendicitis, is ninth in the race to qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals.
"Five weeks ago I was in hospital, now I'm sitting here with the trophy," he said.
The win was Berdych's first ATP World Tour title since the Stockholm Open in October 2015.
The 31-year-old is aiming to appear at his seventh consecutive World Tour final but will need to overtake Rafael Nadal, who currently holds the final qualifying place.
"Luckily for me, everything is going well, I'm feeling good, sitting here as a winner," he added.
Russian Karen Khachanov, ranked 101st in the world, secured his first ATP title at the inaugural Chengdu Open as he beat fifth seed Albert Ramos-Vinolas.
The 20-year-old produced 14 aces as he fought back from a set down to register a 6-7 (4-6) 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 win over the Spaniard.
