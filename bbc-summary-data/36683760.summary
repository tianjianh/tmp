Caerphilly MP Wayne David made the comment in a BBC Radio Wales programme from the town on Thursday following the vote to leave the European Union.
He had been responding to a question about immigration, saying it was not an issue locally "in terms of numbers".
Mr David has apologised via Twitter, saying: "Ethnic minorities play a vitally important role in our society".
During the programme, he was asked: "In terms of hard figures, how much of an issue is immigration in Caerphilly?"
The MP replied: "Well, in terms of numbers it's not an issue.
"I mean, I think the only people who have coloured skin, if you like, are people who run takeaways".
Apologising for the gaffe, Mr David said on Twitter: "Ethnic minorities play a vitally important role in our society.
"Now more than ever, it is vitally important to combat racism in Caerphilly Borough and elsewhere."
A majority in Wales voted for Brexit, with Caerphilly recording one of the highest votes in favour of leaving the EU, by 58% to 42%.
On Monday, Mr David was one of several dozen MPs to resign from Labour's front bench in protest at the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn during the referendum campaign.
