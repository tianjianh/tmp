Horse 'stable' after Alfreton footbridge ordeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A horse is in a "stable" condition after getting all four legs stuck over the edge of a footbridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The animal is thought to have been walking across the narrow bridge when she fell.
The RSPCA harnessed the help of a vet and a team of firefighters to carry out the rescue mission in Alfreton, Derbyshire, on Tuesday.
The charity said: "The horse is stable and was not seriously injured during the ordeal."
Three of the horse's legs were stuck on one side of the bridge and the other on the opposite side.
RSPCA inspector Simon Parker, who went to help, said she had been "in quite a pickle" but "had a lucky escape."
The horse was not microchipped and the RSPCA has urged the owner to come forward.
