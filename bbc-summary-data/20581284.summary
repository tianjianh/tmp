Noble, a painter, draughtsman and installation artist, is the only artist who has shown new work for his Turner Prize exhibition.
His closest challenger is Elizabeth Price with odds of 2/1, followed by Spartacus Chetwynd at 11/4.
Luke Fowler is the outsider with 5/1 odds.
"Certainly the punters, the members of the public seem to think it's a two horse race," said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams.
"Now, people are going for an actual painter or designer, rather than a visual piece of work.
"I can honestly say [Chetwynd and Fowler] are the most unpopular since 2004. Fowler is the least popular in the last 10 years," he added.
The prestigious and often controversial Turner Prize is awarded to a British artist under 50 who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months.
An exhibition of the four artists' works opened at Tate Britain in October.
Noble has been the frontrunner to take the prize since the shortlist was announced in May.
Born in 1963, the artist explores society through drawings of a fictional town called Nobson Newton, which depict a dysfunctional and dystopian landscape that has been compared to the legendary William Hogarth and US cartoonist Robert Crumb.
His exhibited works included five new pencil drawings, along with five new drawings from a previous exhibition and three sculptures.
Elizabeth Price has been shortlisted for her exhibition, Here, which comprises three video installations.
The artist is known for creating works which draw on historic films and photographs.
Last year, the prize was held in at the Baltic Gallery in Gateshead - the first time the ceremony was held outside a Tate venue.
Scottish sculptor Martin Boyce won the Â£25,000 prize for his installation Do Words Have Voices. He turned three large white gallery pillars into square trees, topped by canopies of uniform white leaves.
Actor Jude Law will announce the winner of this year's prize at Tate Britain on Monday evening, to be shown live on Channel Four at 19:50 GMT.
The shortlisted artists who do not win the main prize will each receive Â£5,000.
