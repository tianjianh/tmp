Cross Hands West was previously earmarked for a Sainsbury's superstore, but the supermarket chain pulled out and sold the land to Conygar in 2015.
Conygar is now seeking permission to develop the site with a variety of shops, food stores, a pub/restaurant and a 562-space car park.
The application is currently out for consultation.
Responding, the leader of Carmarthenshire council, Councillor Emlyn Dole, said: "I fully support the above application."
A total of 10 units is being proposed for the site, including:
Neil James, chairman of Carmarthen Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said Cross Hands was an up-and-coming area, with many new houses being built there, but warned the proposed retail park would be bad news for nearby town centres.
"We are not a fan of these out-of-town shops," he said.
"There are some empty units in Carmarthen and even more in Llanelli - so it's a concern that building a retail park like this could take further footfall away from our town centres."
