Graham Barrow: Wigan Athletic need 'three from three' to stay in Championship

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Athletic need to win every game if they are to escape relegation to the Championship, a cause not helped by Monday's 2-1 "Sunday league" defeat by Brighton, says boss Graham Barrow.

Defeat by Brighton ended a run of back-to-back wins that had given Wigan hope of survival and leaves them five points adrift in the relegation zone.
Barrow says he was frustrated with the Seagulls' first goal in the loss.
"That's where we are with the points," Barrow told BBC Radio Manchester.
"It's as simple as that, that's what we have to do. There's no need to give up yet."
Goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard and his defenders were criticised by Barrow in the post-match press interview, as Brighton took the lead through Glenn Murray's goal from a ball over the top.
Haugaard, who is on loan from Stoke City, has started the past three games for Wigan in the place of Matt Gilks.
"He didn't have a lot to do," Barrow continued. "The first goal has really got me, from being in no trouble at all whatsoever. it's a Sunday league goal.
"We've got to look at that and see what we can do."
Barrow also seemed to suggest the decision as to who did play in goal has not been a personal one.
"That's the case, we'll have to see," he continued.
"We need to have conversations and see where we go. The worrying thing is it didn't get any better through the game."
