The Middlesex bowler, who missed the Pakistan series with injury, took 4-34.
The home side's only resistance came from opener Stephen Clarke, who carried his bat for an unbeaten 53.
England were 64-0 in reply when bad light stopped play, as they prepare for the first Test against South Africa which starts on Boxing Day.
Finn had Quinton de Kock caught by Alex Hales with just his third ball of the tour.
He followed up with a superb spell after lunch that saw him claim the wickets of Omphile Ramela, Khaya Zondo and captain Dane Vilas in just nine deliveries.
The uncapped Mark Footitt took 1-32 and Finn's other rival for a Test spot, Chris Woakes, was not selected.
Ben Stokes finished with figures of 3-25 while Stuart Broad took the other wicket.
Captain Alastair Cook was unbeaten on 36 while fellow opener Hales was 28 not out in reply.
Finn said: "We come into these warm-up games wanting to win them to get into good habits for the Test series and we've put ourselves in a very good position."
The 26-year-old paceman, who has taken 102 Test wickets in 26 matches at an average of 28 apiece, told BBC Sport he is pleased with his fitness, having recuperated at his favourite football club, Watford.
Finn said: "I had a fantastic time there. I like to think it was me that set them off on this winning run they are on! They were fantastically accommodating. To be allowed to see how they go about things was fantastic."
Asked about his 12-over spell on the opening day in Pietermaritzburg, he added: "I felt good. I got into my rhythm, I'm hoping I can prove I can bowl 20-odd overs in the day and be fit for the first Test match. You don't want to be gung-ho, especially with the nature of the injury I have had, but at the moment I am very confident."
