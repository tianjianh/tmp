Arriving in Wellington to rain and strong winds, Charles and Camilla were greeted by dignitaries, including Prime Minister John Key and his wife Bronagh.
During their trip, the Royal couple are due to see a flotilla of Maori canoes, and visit an eco-sanctuary.
They will also travel to Australia, where they will meet new prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, a vocal republican.
Charles and Camilla were greeted by Mr Key before leaving for a ceremonial welcome at nearby Government House with New Zealand's governor-general Sir Jerry Mateparae.
After spending a few days in Wellington, the royal couple will travel to Dunedin, Nelson, Ngaruawahia, New Plymouth and Auckland.
They are due to visit Turangawaewae Marae, the home of the Kingitanga or Maori monarchs, where they will view a waka armada of canoes on the country's longest river, the Waikato, on the North Island.
They will also visit the Orokonui Eco-Sanctuary - home to some of New Zealand's rarest birds, reptiles and plants in the most protected forest in the South Island - to mark New Zealand's Conservation Week.
They will then travel to Australia, where they are due to visit Adelaide, Tanunda, Canberra, Sydney, Albany and Perth.
Charles will meet Mr Turnbull on Remembrance Day in Canberra on 11 November.
Mr Turnbull, who is Australia's fourth leader since 2013, was chairman of the Australian Republican Movement for seven years.
In 1999 he led Australia's unsuccessful campaign to abandon the monarchy and become a republic, but has more recently said he does not regard the issue as a priority for his government.
On Monday, he announced Australia will no longer appoint knights and dames under its honours system.
Prince William and Kate's visit to Australia in 2014 with their son, George, has been credited with boosting pro-monarchy sentiment.
It will be the 15th time the Prince of Wales has visited Australia, where he is also due to celebrate his 67th birthday with a beach-side barbeque in Western Australia.
