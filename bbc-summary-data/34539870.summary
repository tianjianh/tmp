There were 78,970 geese recorded at the Angus reserve last year, beating the previous record of 65,060 set in 2010.
The Scottish Wildlife Trust said 56,637 had been recorded so far this year, approaching the 60,000 annual average.
Emma Castle-Smith, assistant visitor centre manager at Montrose Basin, said: "We are hoping this could be another record-breaking year."
She explained: "Seeing these amazing birds en masse is breathtaking for anyone lucky enough to witness it."
The geese have migrated 1,200km (745 miles) from Iceland and Greenland for the winter.
About 372,000 pink-footed geese spend the winter in the UK, thought to be about 90% of the world's population.
