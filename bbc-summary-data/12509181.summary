McVitie's in Tollcross, part of United Biscuits, said it was committed to the site and to ensuring it could perform in a highly-competitive marketplace.
United Biscuits said 93 posts were affected, from a workforce of about 700, but some jobs would be created.
The company said it hoped to avoid the need for compulsory redundancies.
