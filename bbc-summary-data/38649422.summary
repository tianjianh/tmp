TV cameras allowed in Manx parliament, vote MHKs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Isle of Man politicians have unanimously backed a move to allow cameras inside the Manx parliament, Tynwald.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new code of conduct means journalists can apply for permits to record proceedings in the chamber.
It brings the Isle of Man into line with the rest of the British Isles 27 years after the first House of Commons speech was televised in 1989.
House of Keys and Tynwald sittings are currently broadcast live on Manx Radio.
Previously, filming inside Tynwald has been tightly restricted, which Speaker of the House of Keys Juan Watterson said is "no longer justifiable."
He told the BBC: "It is quite legitimate to have people come and film as part of access to parliament. It is important and I think it is more widely recognised now than it ever has been.
"The move won't cost the taxpayer anything but will allow journalists to come and film what they consider newsworthy".
