[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Bush, 90, was released from the Houston Methodist Hospital and continues his recovery at home, his spokesman said.
Two years ago, Mr Bush was treated in the same hospital for more than two months for bronchitis and other issues.
He was president from 1989 to 1993, and heads a famous political dynasty.
His son George W Bush served as president from 2001 to 2009.
Another son, Jeb, said this month he would "actively explore the possibility of running for president" in 2016.
A statement from George Bush Sr's spokesman, Jim McGrath, confirmed the former president had been discharged.
"He is now resting at home, grateful to the doctors and nurses for their superb care."
Mr Bush is the oldest living former US president and a World War Two veteran.
He can no longer use his legs, but in June celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump.
