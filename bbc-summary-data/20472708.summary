The National Hockey League (NHL) has cancelled another two weeks of games, as the result of a lockout that threatens to wipe out the whole season.

The stoppage continues to 14 December, in a move that brings the total number of games lost to 422, or about a third of the 2012-13 season.
The US and Canadian league locked out the players in mid-September, a month before the season was due to begin.
The two sides are in a dispute over how to split $3.3bn (Â£2bn) in revenue.
The owners want to reduce the players' share of annual revenue to 50% from the current 57%.
The All-Star Game, which was to have been in Columbus, Ohio, on 27 January, has also been called because of the latest round of cancellations.
It follows the owners' rejection of a new offer by the Players' Association on Wednesday morning.
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman says the league is losing up to $20m per day, while the players are missing out on as much as $10m per day.
The work stoppage is the fourth in 20 years for the NHL. A previous union dispute saw the entire 2004-2005 season cancelled.
