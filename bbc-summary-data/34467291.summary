British Art Show: Ant farms and a Mini in 'best of British' exhibition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 1979 Mini and Perspex sculptures containing real ant farms are among the works in an exhibition that is held every five years to show the best in British contemporary art.

The eighth British Art Show features 42 artists who organisers say have made a "significant contribution to art in this country over the past five years".
The exhibition opened at Leeds Art Gallery on Friday.
It will then tour to Edinburgh, Norwich and Southampton.
The chosen artists range from painters and ceramics to those who appropriate everyday objects and others who work with video and even opera.
Anthea Hamilton's free-standing ant farms are supposed to bring normally static sculptures to life, while Jessica Warboys' Sea Painting was made by letting waves wash over paint.
Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin have used the data from DNA samples taken from Sigmund Freud's couch to design a series of tapestries.
Laure Prouvost, the 2013 Turner Prize winner, has made a fan, a bouquet of flowers and a hard drive that talk to visitors and each other about the point of their existence, while Lawrence Abu Hamdan has converted objects like boxes of tissues and crisp packets into listening devices.
Another artist, Cally Spooner, has turned YouTube comments into the lyrics of librettos that will be shown on screens and performed in the gallery by a soprano every day.
Curator Lydia Yee said: "One of the things we noticed is that, due to the fact that digital technology is so accessible these days, artists are either embracing it and it's become incorporated in their practice, or they are in some ways reacting against the pervasiveness of it.
"Some artists are returning to working with their hands or using very tactile materials and focusing on objects."
Artist Stuart Whipps has used a Mini that was manufactured in 1979 - the year of his birth, the year Margaret Thatcher became prime minister and the year of the highest level of industrial action since World War Two.
He has taken it apart with the help of former workers from the Longbridge car plant in Birmingham, which closed in 2005. Different parts will be shown in different venues - with the shell in Leeds and the stripped-down engine going to Edinburgh.
It will then be reassembled for the final stop in Southampton with the help of ex-Longbridge workers including 80-year-old Keith Woodfield, who worked at the factory for 30 years.
"I was interested in getting this object, this car, that came out of that tumultuous period as a way to think about that time and its legacy, which we're still living through now," Whipps said.
"Keith said to me, 'How is this art? You're just fixing up a car.' But I don't want to do anything artful to it. The process is the work."
