[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karen Hodgkinson was hit by a full beer can thrown by one of a gang of youths in Mold, Flintshire.
A 17-year-old pleaded guilty to wounding at Mold Crown Court on Friday.
He and six others, aged 13 to 19, admitted violent disorder following disturbances at Ms Hodgkinson's house and a McDonald's in the town. They will be sentenced at a later date.
Ms Hodgkinson suffered a fractured eye socket and lost her sight following violence of "startling proportions", the court heard.
As well as the 17-year-old; Christian Gentile, 18, Samuel Dodd, 18, Sam Rodger, all of Mold, and boys aged 13, 16 and 17 were bailed until their sentencing in June.
Prosecutor David Mainstone told the hearing Ms Hodgkinson and her family had suffered a great deal of trouble from youths congregating outside their home.
Judge Geraint Walters said it appeared, because the victim and her family told police about the trouble, they had to put up with "groups of yobbos" making their lives a misery.
The public disorder that night was of "startling proportions ", he said.
