[SN]TITLE[SN]
Atlético Madrid 7-1 Granada

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yannick Carrasco scored a hat-trick as Atletico Madrid came from behind to overwhelm bottom club Granada and reclaim top spot in La Liga.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sevilla briefly replaced Atletico at the top with a 3-2 win at Leganes and Granada threatened an upset thanks to Isaac Cuenca's superb early strike.
But Atletico responded superbly with Carrasco making it 3-1 after an hour.
Substitute Nicolas Gaitan added two more and late goals from Angel Correa and Tiago completed the rout.
Diego Simeone's Atletico are unbeaten this season and could not have been more ruthless in brushing aside Granada before turning their attention back to the Champions League.
Last season's beaten finalists have won both their opening group games and play Russian side Rostov on Wednesday.
Simeone was able to withdraw Koke and forwards Antoine Griezmann and Kevin Gameiro in the second half against Granada in preparation for the trip to Russia.
Griezmann did not get on the scoresheet but Belgium international Carrasco, 23, made up for it with his first La Liga goals of the season.
He struck twice before the break to make it 2-1 before completing his first hat-trick for the club when converting a cross from Griezmann.
Gaitan added the fourth almost immediately after coming on before a late flurry of three goals in the final eight minutes.
