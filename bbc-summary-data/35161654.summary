Colchester Winter Wonderland and Ice Rink, which opened last month, said it had become "financially impossible" to continue after the warm temperatures left people skating through water.
Customers had said it was like a "huge puddle" and "too dangerous" to use.
All remaining events have been cancelled.
On a statement on its Facebook page, the company said: "This decision has been taken with deep regret as it will have a major impact of (sic) its staff, partners and customers."
The ice rink, in Castle Park, was forced to close on six occasions since it opened on 27 November. It was due to run until 3 January.
On Tuesday morning Reflective Ice, which runs the rink, posted a message saying "the constant wind now on site and warmer temperatures have destroyed the ice pad again".
Angie Bailey, 36, who lives in Colchester, took her children to the rink on Saturday afternoon but said it was "too dangerous" for Jack, aged 10, and Sommer aged 5, to skate.
"My children had just got over colds and for them to skate and fall over in cold icy water isn't on," Ms Bailey said. "I paid for ice skating not water skating.
"The amount of people falling over due to catching their blades was crazy, the water was deep enough it covered the blades of the skates."
Some customers had praised the experience. A woman called Emma Barnes said her daughter "had a fantastic time...  she did fall over and get completely soaked but we brought a spare set of clothes".
But other customers described the rink as "one huge puddle" and a "swimming pool ice rink."
Reflective Ice previously replied to say that the situation was "totally out of our control".
"All our equipment is working perfectly, it's just too warm," it said.
