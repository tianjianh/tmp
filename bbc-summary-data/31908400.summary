The three teenagers arrested on Saturday after attempting to travel to Syria have now been bailed.

It's thought police were tipped off by the young men's parents who were worried when they didn't come home after Friday prayers.
In the last year 22 women and girls have been reported missing by families who fear they have travelled to Syria.
They include Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana who are thought to have joined Islamic State militants.
The east London schoolgirls vanished last month.
Earlier an 18-year-old man was arrested at his home in Birmingham, on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria.
Newsbeat has spoken to Kalsoom Bashir from Inspire, a group which supports women to challenge extremism, about what friends and families can do to stop their loved ones from attempting to go to Syria.
"It's really important that families actually sit down and talk to each other about what's happening in the news, what's happening in Syria," Kalsoom says.
"Talk about how extremist groups are targeting our children to believe in their argument and deconstruct that argument at home."
She says the earlier you have these conversations, the less likely it is young people will believe in the messages being shared online by Islamic State.
"They're using a very corrupt form of theology," Kalsoom explains. "You've got to discredit their narrative."
The National Police Counter Terrorism Network is launching a new campaign later to help raise awareness and prevent young people from travelling abroad.
Families are also encouraged to reach specially-trained officers for help and advice by calling 101 or visiting the Prevent Tragedies website.
She says that everyone in the community can have a role in stopping teenagers from becoming involved with extremists.
"Teachers now are, across the country, being trained in recognising the potential threat and they will know what the referral pathways are," says Kalsoom.
"You can talk to people in the mosque.
"Talk to other family members if [you're] worried about somebody."
She says that if it's spotted at a "very early stage" it may be that the police don't need to get involved, however it may be important to report the problems.
"If you felt that you weren't getting through to that person and they still haven't changed their mind then you would ask the police for help," Kalsoom says.
"They wouldn't necessarily arrest them, if they hadn't broken the law.
"But the police then would be able to identify, after talking with members of the family and perhaps school teachers and maybe even social workers, what the best support would be to offer that person and they can then keep an eye on that person to make sure that they don't do anything that they would later regret."
She says some parents in her community have hidden passports belonging to their children, and monitored their spending patterns, to prevent them from running away.
And, if you're worried that someone is about to leave for Syria soon, her advice is: "If you think that somebody has gone so far that they may have bought a ticket or have got their passport, it's really really important to talk to the police at that stage so they can put steps in place to stop that person from travelling or going further."
