Steve Pankhurst, a founder of the website, said the platform was still used by "a handful of members" but that it was "no longer used for the purpose it was built for".
The term "Friends Reunited" has been among the top trending topics in the UK on Twitter.
Here, people who have been Friends Reunited users share their stories on how the website has affected their lives.
Emma Hetherington [pictured above with husband John] said it was a "sad day" for Friends Reunited.
"It was thanks to this early social media platform that my husband John and I saw each other again, 18 years after we'd split up in our early 20s," she said.  "Over that time he'd married, had two kids and was in the process of divorcing.  I had been widowed for five years with a young daughter.
"John looked me up on Friends Reunited in 2002 and got in touch. We've been together ever since and married in 2014 in Cuba."
On Facebook, Rachel Hughes recounts being found on Friends Reunited by an old boyfriend:
