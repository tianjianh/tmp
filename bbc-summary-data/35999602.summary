He said the order followed allegations of unethical conduct. The bankers have not commented.
Two are from Chase Bank and six from the state-owned National Bank, which recently recorded unexpected losses.
Three Kenyan banks have gone into receivership recently, highlighting concerns with the banking sector.
Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Patrick Njoroge ordered Chase Bank to shut its doors on Thursday after "inaccurate" rumours on social media led to a run on the bank.

In a statement, the CBK said it would appoint a team to run the bank.

Chase had recently released two conflicting financial statements, the BBC's Ferdinand Omondi in the capital, Nairobi, says.
A subsequent audit showed it had hidden loans to its directors, he adds.
National Bank has also run into problems with its accounts, recording a loss of $13m (Â£9m).
The central bank governor has tried to reassure Kenyans that the country's banking system is stable, but he has criticised some poor lending practices and mismanagement.
The police chief also warned Kenyans against spreading malicious rumours on social media and the police have arrested one man for "peddling falsehoods" about Chase Bank.
