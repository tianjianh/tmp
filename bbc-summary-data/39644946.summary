Members of a gang which blew up cash machines at banks and supermarkets have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven men stole £550,000 in a crime spree across England and Scotland in 2015 and 2016.
Some machines were blown up using "powerful explosives" as they caused £160,000 of damage.
At Liverpool Crown Court they were convicted of conspiracy to cause an explosion and burglary. They were given terms of between 10 years and life.
How the gang that blew up cash machines was caught
The gang members mostly came from Merseyside and were caught following a covert police operation.
The court heard they carried out 13 raids between February 2015 and February 2016.
The attacks happened in Sonning Common and Woodstock in Oxfordshire; Alsager and Culcheth in Cheshire;  Huyton in Merseyside; Hucclecote in Gloucestershire; Swindon in Wiltshire; Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk; Carnoustie in Angus and Perth; and Aberdeen.
An investigation by Titan, the Northwest Regional Organised Crime Unit, found the gang stole high-powered vehicles to carry out the raids, which they concealed in a special trailer attached to a lorry.
The men slept in hammocks inside the trailer which also had fuel containers to reduce the number of times they had to use petrol stations or motorway services, Merseyside Police said.
In their last raid on a Co-op in Angus in February 2016, the audacious gang sawed through the roller-shutter doors before dragging the ATM out using a Land Rover Defender and straps to steal £16,000.
