The home side were dominating Algeria and had chances to further increase that lead.
But Algeria's Islam Slimani prevented his team from falling to a humiliating defeat to a country lying 109 places below them in the Fifa rankings.
He brought the North Africans back into the game with a goal in the 72nd minute, and made it 2-2 with a second just three minutes later.
