The 65-year-old star of Apollo 13 and The Truman Show will act alongside his wife, Amy Madigan, in Shepard's 1978 portrait of a dysfunctional family.
They will play farming couple Dodge and Halie, roles they played earlier this year in New York.
Buried Child runs at Trafalgar Studios in London from 14 November to 18 February.
Harris and Madigan wed after appearing in 1984 film Places in the Heart and have since featured in a number of films together, including Harris's directorial debut Pollock.
Madigan, also 65, was nominated for an Oscar for her role in 1985's Twice in a Lifetime and was also seen as Doctor Katharine Wyatt in TV show Grey's Anatomy.
Buried Child is described as "a dark, macabre and painfully funny family drama" that casts "a brutal light on disenfranchised Americans".
The play, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979, was first seen in London at the Hampstead Theatre in 1980.
