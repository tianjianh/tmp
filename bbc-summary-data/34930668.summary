The attackers shot at worshippers in the mosque in the Bogra district during evening prayers, police said.
The incident comes a month after a grenade attack on a Shia shrine in the capital Dhaka killed one and hurt 80.
Bangladesh has seen several violent incidents in recent months, including attacks on foreigners and secular bloggers.
Thursday's gunfire came a day after police said they killed a militant leader named Al Bani, who was a key suspect in the 24 October grenade attack.
Police said that Al Bani headed the military wing of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen (JMB), and that he died in an exchange of fire as they tried to arrest him.
The so-called Islamic State group had claimed it carried out the October attack - but the government says IS is not active in Bangladesh, and blamed local militant groups including the JMB.
Bangladesh is predominantly a Sunni Muslim nation, but attacks on Shia Muslims are extremely rare.
Who is behind the Bangladesh killings?
Behind the Bangladesh blogger murders
The country has seen a rise in Islamist attacks on foreigners and bloggers.
An Italian aid worker was killed in September and a Japanese citizen in October.
Both attacks were claimed by IS but the government blamed the killings on local militants.
Last week, gunmen wounded an Italian priest in north-west Dinajpur district. No group said it carried out the attack.
Extremists have carried out a series of high-profile attacks on secular writers, hacking to death four bloggers - one a US citizen - so far this year.
