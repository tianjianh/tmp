Fifteen firefighters tackled the blaze, which began in Remembrance Road at about 03:40 BST.
Police said it was too early to confirm if it would be investigated as a hate crime.
Shop owner Norbert Krupan, who has lived in the area for 11 years and opened the premises a year ago, said he was "devastated".

"We've had it confirmed that we've been targeted and someone's done this deliberately," he said.
"The police ask me if it was maybe a racial background, or maybe the competition, I really don't know."
