A member of the public saw the injured bird "struggling" at Lakeside Holiday Village in Burnham-on-Sea on Friday.
A wildlife expert was taken by BARB Search and Rescue's inshore boat and was able to "safely retrieve the bird".
The swan is being cared for at the Secret World Wildlife Rescue centre in East Huntspill.
Secret World said the bird was "recovering well, having had the fishing line and lead weights removed".
