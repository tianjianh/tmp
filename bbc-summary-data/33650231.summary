Rachel Booth, from New Milton, Hampshire, lost the rings in the water at Avon Beach, Christchurch, on Sunday.
Following a failed search using a snorkel, mask and rakes, she enlisted the help of two metal detectorists.
The rings were eventually discovered two days later at low tide. They were buried under four inches (10cm) of sand.
Mrs Booth, who will have been married to Stephen Booth for three years in September, said she felt "extremely lucky".
"I couldn't believe it - I was very emotional just to have them back," she said.
Gary Smith, who helped find the rings with Shaun Trotman, said the search had been made easier because Mrs Booth had used the location of nearby beach huts and bollards as markers for where she had lost them.
