Wunderkammer contains items gathered from hospitals now run by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg university health board (ABMU).
The pop-up "museum" aims to give a snapshot of the area's healthcare history.
ABMU chairman Andrew Davies said it was a "fascinating glimpse" into the past.
Wunderkammer - a 12-drawer wooden chest - will be displayed in Morriston Hospital's outpatients department waiting room from Monday.
Items on display include:
Creator of the project Martin Thomas, head of the board's heritage project, said the pop-up museum allowed patients to see collections which had been hidden away.
He said: "I love the excitement of being presented with a dusty old box, not knowing what gruesome old medical oddment I am going to see next.
"The interest sparked goes right across the board - I have had calls from the public, retired staff, secretaries, consultants and board members, all absolutely passionate about protecting their fragment of our heritage and sharing it."
The cabinet will go on tour around ABMU sites with the heritage team changing the contents to make them relevant to the local area.
The team are also preparing to submit a bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund to protect artefacts it has been collecting for future generations and expand their research.
Chairman of ABMU Mr Davies said: "I hope our public and staff enjoy taking the opportunity to have a good look at the items inside and find out a bit more about their weird and wonderful history."
