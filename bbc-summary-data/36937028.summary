The Belfast man became the first fighter from Northern Ireland to win a world title in two weight divisions after beating Leo Santa Cruz in New York in the the early hours of Sunday.
He met some of his fans in a packed Annie Moore's pub on Sunday.
"Win, lose or draw I was always going to do something for them," he said.
Before meeting his followers, he said it would be "nice for them to get a couple of pints and maybe get a few pictures as well" as a thanks for making the trip to Brooklyn for the fight.
Thousands of people, including golfer Rory McIlroy, watched the Jackal defeat his Mexican opponent, with many of them making the trip across the Atlantic from Northern Ireland.
Frampton said their support was "amazing".
"I thanked them straight away after the fight," the 29-year-old said.
"It's hard for people to [travel to fights] and people aren't flush with cash at the minute, so to come out and support me is great.
"I'd say most of the guys who were at the fight had a trip to the [Euro 2016 football tournament] as well.
"Obviously McIlroy's alright for a few quid, but its great to have [his] support to!"
Frampton said he hopes to reward his followers with a fight in his home city before the end of the year.
"I don't want the people to have to pay top money to come out and support me in the States all the time," he added.
"I'd like to fight in Belfast at least once a year.
"I love fighting at home and I feel like I haven't done it enough, but it's just because of the fights - I'm chasing titles.
"But I'm in the driving seat now and I want to bring [fighters] to Belfast."
