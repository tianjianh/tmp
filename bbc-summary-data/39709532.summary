Worcestershire opened their One-Day Cup campaign with a rain-affected five-wicket win over a strong Nottinghamshire side at New Road.

In a Notts side containing two members of England's Champions Trophy squad, Alex Hales and Jake Ball, Michael Lumb hit a fine 104 off 126 balls to help the visitors post 273-6 from 50 overs.
But a two-hour rain break cut the hosts' target to 169 from 22 overs.
Ross Whiteley hit 41 not out to see them to 169-5 with two overs to spare.
The England Lions tourist struck two sixes and four fours in just 19 deliveries, accompanied by captain Joe Leach, who followed his earlier three wickets by hitting 10 in four balls.
England hopeful Joe Clarke weighed in with a useful 40, while Samit Patel earlier made 44 for Notts - and Billy Root, younger brother of England Test captain Joe, made 46 on his one-day debut.
But Ball went for 42 off four overs in this Duckworth-Lewis method-decided contest, and Hales earlier made just 13 with the bat.
Notts' next North Group game is at home to Yorkshire on Saturday, while Worcestershire are back in action the following day at Grace Road, Leicester.
The chasing side have now won the last five meetings between these sides at Worcester - three wins for Notts and two for the hosts.
Worcestershire all-rounder Jack Shantry told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"It was a fantastic win. A good way to start the tournament. The light was fading a little bit and we did really well to get there with a couple of overs to spare.
"Our bowling first up was good on a pitch that was doing a bit early on. Joe Leach and John Hastings bowled really well early on and got us off to a good start.
"Then chasing that big total in 22 overs, Ross Whiteley was fantastic and Joe Clarke's knock was really classy against some high-quality bowling, with their international bowlers like Stuart Broad bowling quick."
Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"It's always tough to get beaten, but credit to Worcestershire. Ross Whiteley played really well.
"I don't think that total was far off par on that pitch. We walked in thinking that was going to be a really competitive score and, without rain, it would have been. When you get a rain-affected game it sometimes hurts you a bit more when you are bowling second.
"Michael Lumb played really well and paced it nicely and Billy Root played really well on his debut, confident to play his own shots from ball one."
