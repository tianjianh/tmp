It said those travelling to the continent should take plenty of food and water and check with travel operators before starting out.
The Port of Dover says roads are clear and it is not expecting severe delays.

Traffic going to the Port of Dover traffic should use the M20/A20, while drivers not planning to cross the channel should consider routes such as the B2011, A256 or A258, which may not be suitable for HGVs, KCC advised.
The Port of Dover said anyone travelling to the port should be "properly prepared".
KCC said it has delivered 52,300 2-litre bottles of water to the Dover coastguard from where it can be distributed to delayed motorists if necessary.
Writing on the Conservative Home website on Thursday, Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, said: "It seems every summer there is travel chaos in Kent.
"If this happened at Heathrow there would be uproar.
"But it's somehow seen as okay for tens of thousands of holidaymakers and truckers to be stuck in the sweltering heat all day long without water, food, information or toilet facilities," he wrote.
"You can't help but get the impression that travelling from the Channel Ports is looked down upon and far less of a priority than the elite jet-set."
