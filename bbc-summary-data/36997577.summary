[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers midfielder Joey Barton made a solid start to his Scottish Premiership career as the Light Blues drew 1-1 with Hamilton at Ibrox in Saturday's lunchtime kick-off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old former Manchester City, Newcastle and Queens Park Rangers player tackled well and was often the instigator of attacking moves, picking the ball up from defenders and spreading passes.
However, he could not guide his team-mates to a win over their Lanarkshire opponents and was wayward with some of his shooting and passing.
Speaking after the match, in which Martyn Waghorn's second-half goal cancelled out a skilful opener by Accies' Ali Crawford, Barton said: "It was tough, Hamilton came here and acquitted themselves really well.
"They scored a great goal on the counter attack and they came for a result and we have to give them a lot of credit. They executed their game plan quite well.
"People maybe just expected us to turn up here and win today and that was not going to be the case.
"You have to earn your right to win any football match but we showed great character to get back into it."
