Looking at the day's news can be a glum business.

If it's not some politician causing a scandal, or a celebrity mouthing off then we're being told there's not enough money, or that everything we eat is going to shorten out lives.
But just occasionally a news item comes to light that puts a smile on our face or even makes us chuckle.
So let's celebrate the stories - and the people - who gave us a laugh in 2014.
A cash machine outside Tesco Express in Aberystwyth promised customers "free erections" after a translation error.
Above the ATM at the new store in west Wales it said "codiad am ddim" which would translate colloquially as "free erections."
The supermarket soon took the sign down and a spokesperson thanked "everyone who pointed out the mistake".
A man had to be rescued by firefighters in Germany after becoming stuck inside a stone vagina.
The man, who was said to be an American exchange student, got wedged in the statue at Tubingen University after climbing in as part of a dare.
According to German newspaper SchwÃ¤bisches Tagblatt, five emergency service vehicles and 22 firemen had to help free the man.
A BBC photo of a men's cubicle with twin toilets at a Sochi Olympics venue caused a Twitter storm in Russia.
The picture from the Biathlon Centre tweeted by Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg caused opposition leader Alexei Navalny to ask how the budget for the games, said to be $50bn (Â£30bn; 1,700bn roubles), had been spent.
Other commentators joked about Russia's controversial law on "gay propaganda", which led to calls from international campaigners to boycott February's games.
An American tourist found himself locked inside a London Waterstones bookshop for two hours after it closed while he was still browsing.
Police were called after David Willis, from Texas, let people know of his situation on Twitter and someone came to let him out.
When he was finally released, he tweeted: "I'm free."
Branch manager Matt Atkins said they were "mortified".
At the 2014 Oscar ceremony, John Travolta appeared to welcome Idina Menzel on stage, but seemed to say the name "Adele Dazeem".
In a later statement, the actor said: "I've been beating myself up all day. Then I thought, 'What would Idina Menzel say?'
"She'd say, 'Let it go, let it go!' Idina is incredibly talented and I am so happy Frozen took home two Oscars Sunday night!"
You would be forgiven for having thought for your entire life that Hello Kitty was a cat.
But in August it became common knowledge that she is, in fact, a British school kid called Kitty White and she lives just outside London (although no-one is saying exactly where).
Christine R Yano, an anthropologist from the University of Hawaii, said a lot of people didn't know Kitty was really a person and that many of her fans who were aware "don't care".
A paralysed groom achieved his goal of walking at his wedding in the US, thanks to a robotic "exoskeleton".
Matt Ficarra was paralysed from the chest down in 2011 after breaking his neck in a boating accident.
After the couple said their vows, he walked down the aisle with his bride, Jordan Basile.
