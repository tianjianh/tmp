The girl was found unconscious at about 04:50 BST at Bakers Park in Newton Abbot, Devon, and died at Torbay Hospital. She was not from the area.
Two other girls were also taken to hospital as a precaution.
Police said they were "confident" local people would know who supplied the drugs to the girl and appealed for them to come forward.
Det Supt Ken Lamont said: "With NPS (New Psychoactive Substances) no-one knows what's in them and that's why they are so dangerous.
"Time and time again we hear of people paying the ultimate price for this.
"It's not worth experimenting with your life."
The girl's next of kin have been informed but police have not yet named her.
Investigations are continuing and a cordon is in place at the scene.
Last year Totnes teenager Nathan Wood died after after taking the psychoactive drug N-Bomb.
Police called on parents to "speak to your children about the dangers of drugs and (formerly known as) legal highs".
"They can cause death even if taken just once."
