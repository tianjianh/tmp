Talking about his charity work, Shearer added: "I had to give something back. Footballers get a lot of criticism for not giving enough back.

"For some reason I just knew straight away what it was going to be," he told BBC Sport.
"It's a real honour to receive it and I'm really proud of what we've achieved over the past year, especially the Davis Cup. It was a huge thing for the team and the country."
