Tight-head Rae, 22, has committed himself to the Warriors until May 2019, having joined in 2013.
Fellow Scot Bhatti, 23, has agreed professional terms with Glasgow for next season.
The loose-head has spent most of this season playing for Premiership side Melrose but has featured three times for the Warriors.
"It has always been a dream of mine to be a professional rugby player, so I'm really happy to have signed a contract with Glasgow," he told Glasgow's website.
Rae previously had spells on loan at London Scottish and Benetton Treviso and has been capped up to Scotland Under-20 level.
"Glasgow is my home club and all my family are here and I'm enjoying it," he said.
"I want to play well for my club and if I got the opportunity to play for Scotland one day, that would be a bonus."
Sixth in the Pro12, Glasgow visit third-placed Ospreys on Sunday.
