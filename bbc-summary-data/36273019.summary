Army and police officers used tear gas and blocked roads leading to the building in Caracas.
Earlier this month, the opposition presented a petition with 1.85 million signatures calling for a referendum on Nicolas Maduro's presidency.
It wants to put pressure on the authorities to speed the process up.
The march was organised by the opposition MUD (Democratic Unity Roundtable) party.
It is demanding that the authorities verify the signatures and go ahead with the process.
Senior opposition politicians were caught up in the scuffle.
Former presidential candidate and governor of Miranda state Henrique Capriles said he had tear gas sprayed in his eyes.
"Police fired rubber bullets and blocked the road," said the speaker of the National Assembly, Henry Ramos Allup.
"We are pulling out because we don't want anyone to get injured," he said.
Venezuela is facing a major economic crisis, which the opposition blames on the socialist polices of Mr Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.
Under Venezuela's constitution, presidents can be removed from office by means of a referendum once they have served half their term.
Mr Maduro took office in April 2013, after defeating Mr Capriles in a closely-fought election.
