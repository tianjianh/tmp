[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 1-1 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool were denied victory by one of their own as Yeovil earned a draw against Dave Jones' side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glovers midfielder Matty Dolan was born in Hartlepool and has spent two loan spells at the club.
But, presented with a second-half penalty to level the scores, he made no mistake, sending keeper Adam Bartlett the wrong way from 12 yards on 69 minutes.
The penalty came after Andrew Nelson, making his Pools debut after signing from Sunderland on loan, needlessly felled Francois Zoko in the area.
Hartlepool also gave a debut to Louis Rooney, signed from Plymouth, and he was lively up front, sending Padraig Amond clear early on to lob just over.
Rooney then skirted around keeper Artur Krysiak, but his angled finish was blocked by covering defender Darren Ward.
Pools took the lead on 64 minutes when Nelson's deep cross picked out Amond and he looped home a header from 16 yards for his 11th of the season.
After Dolan's leveller, he almost won it with a curling free-kick from 22 yards which Bartlett dived full-stretch to keep out.
