Folly Farm wants to add 56 themed lodges, touring caravans and glamping facilities, including yurts, to the north of its Kilgetty site.
Existing farm buildings would also be turned into a cafe, games rooms and reception area.
If planners give the go-ahead, building work would begin in September with caravan sites ready for summer 2017.
Director Chris Ebsworth said: "By bringing another dimension to our offer, we aim to extend our trading seasons beyond the traditional May to September window."
