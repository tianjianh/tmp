The 27-year-old played in 112 Ospreys games since his debut in 2008 but made only 15 appearances in the past two campaigns because of a groin problem.
He had signed a one-year contract extension with the Welsh club in April.
"Ryan is in the prime of his career and has played at the highest level," Bristol director of rugby Andy Robinson told the club website.
Bevington said: "I'm excited about the opportunity to represent Bristol and to play in the top flight of English rugby."
