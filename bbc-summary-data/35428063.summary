Keith Hill: Rochdale have to be a 'selling club' for success

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rochdale manager Keith Hill has conceded they have to be a club that sells players in order to compete in League One.

Scott Hogan and Matt Done both left last season for fees, while players such as West Brom's Craig Dawson and Bournemouth's Glenn Murray also brought in money when they left.
"We are a selling club," Hill, 46, told BBC Radio Manchester.
"It's part of our business and it's part of our philosophy."
The former Barnsley boss added: "It's what we've done in the past that has given the success on the pitch, and financially.
"We're one of the only few clubs who breaks even, or makes profit, most seasons and gets success on the pitch - and we're determined to continue in that vain.
"The key players of our squad will definitely stay this transfer window - that's why we've done our best to secure Ian Henderson, Peter Vincenti, Matty Lund, Jamie Allan etc."
This season is Rochdale's second recent stint in the third tier after their promotion from League Two in 2014.
Hill, in his second spell as boss at Spotland, also guided Dale up in 2010 only for them to be relegated after two seasons following his departure.
"History will tell you we don't spend time in League One and that's my next biggest challenge and achievement," he said.
"Will there be champagne drunk at the end of the season if we retain our League One status? 100% and why shouldn't it be.
"I expect for four seasons now a little bit of normality, and normality for me would be establishing ourselves and remaining a League One team."
