The 24-year-old from Edinburgh is in a six-strong GB shooting squad and will line up in the 50m 3 positions event.
"I just want to do myself proud and do the very best I can," she said.
"I know if I do that my opportunities will be the same as everybody else to make finals, win medals. As long as I'm happy at the end of the day. I can't really control the result."
McIntosh competed at London 2012 as Team GB were granted extra places, finishing 36th in 10m air rifle qualifying and 42nd in the 50m 3 positions.
"This feels different, it's more special because I've earned my place," she explained to BBC Sport.
"The experience from London will help immeasurably when it comes to Rio. That environment is like no other, so it's good to know what to expect."
McIntosh collected silver and bronze at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, having won two golds and a bronze in Delhi four years earlier.
No British woman has ever won an Olympic gold in shooting.
"That would be pretty cool," said McIntosh.
"Obviously I dream about it but sometimes you need to stop dreaming and focus on the here and now."
