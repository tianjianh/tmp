Francois Gissy used a home-made rocket-propelled bicycle to reach 207 miles per hour on a racetrack.
It took him just 4.8 seconds to reach the record speed.
Francois believes he can achieve 250mph on his next run on the vehicle.
"It's extremely intense," he told the BBC following Sunday's ride.
"At the moment [of riding] it's very scary - there's no pleasure like you would get from a motorcycle.
"But when you stop, you think - yes, that was amazing."
