A community recycling site in Powys is due to close next month.

Powys council has been reviewing sites across the county and said banks from Berriew Street car park in Welshpool will be removed.
The facility is said to be attracting fly tipping and vermin.
The council said with the rollout of the kerbside recycling scheme to all areas of Powys now complete, there is a need to reduce a number of community recycling sites.
Residents are being asked to use alternative sites in the town.
The council's Cabinet Member for Environment and Sustainability, John Powell, said: "This site has experienced a large level of fly-tipping over recent years.  It has now reached such a level that it is attracting vermin to the area.
"We have discussed options with the town council and it was decided to close the site."
Last month the council ended a bulky waste collection service in Machynlleth.
It was introduced following the closure of the Potters Yard recycling centre in January 2015, but Powys council's cabinet made the decision to withdraw it due to its "high running costs".
