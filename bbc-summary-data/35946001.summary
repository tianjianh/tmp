[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dyfed-Powys Police officer has had an assault conviction overturned on appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Simon Reynolds, 38, was found guilty after a trial of assaulting a 27-year-old man outside a nightclub in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, in November, 2014.
He was handed an eight-week suspended sentence at Swansea Magistrates' Court in September.
However, on Friday, a judge quashed his conviction at Swansea Crown Court.
An inquiry into PC Reynolds' conduct was launched after a referral to police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
It related to the alleged assault of a man arrested outside Bar Luna in the town centre.
The IPCC confirmed PC Reynolds, who always denied any wrongdoing, was successful in his appeal.
