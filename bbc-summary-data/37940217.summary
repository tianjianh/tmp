The 34-year-old, along with fellow Olympian Savannah Marshall, has taken a break from full-time training.
The flyweight told the BBC in October that a professional move would "definitely break boundaries".
Britain will be represented by four boxers when the Championship begins on 14 November in Bulgaria
The 2014 World Championship silver medallists Lisa Whiteside and Sandy Ryan will compete at flyweight and lightweight respectively, with light-welterweight Chantelle Cameron and middleweight Natasha Gale completing the squad.
"It is an opportunity for me to really establish myself as the number one lightweight in the GB squad," Ryan said.
