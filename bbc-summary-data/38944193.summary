[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mariusz Krezolek, 36, died of a heart attack in January 2016 at Full Sutton prison in Yorkshire after complaining of chest pains but refusing help.
He was given a life sentence in 2013 after being convicted of murdering Daniel in Coventry.
Daniel's mother, Magdalena Luczak, was found hanged in her cell in July 2015.
She was also found guilty of Daniel's murder and the pair were ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years each.
Krezolek also tried twice to kill himself after Luczak's suicide at HMP Foston Hall, the report by the Prisons Ombudsman into his death found.
It said he had been treated for a fistula and inflammatory bowel disease but refused to go to hospital as he was afraid he would be recognised.
He also refused to be admitted to the prison's inpatient unit.
On 27 January last year he complained of chest paints but again refused to go to the healthcare unit. He was found unresponsive in his cell the next morning and confirmed dead a little while later.
The cause of death was given as a heart attack.
The report also reveals Krezolek twice tried to kill himself after Luczak killed herself at HMP Foston Hall.
Daniel Pelka weighed just over a stone and a half at the time of his death in March 2012.
He had been denied food, poisoned with salt, locked in a small room, forced to perform punishment exercises and subjected to water torture.
The trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard experts said Daniel's emaciation was "unprecedented" in Britain.
The trial judge said his mother and stepfather had acted with "incomprehensible brutality" towards him, causing the boy "severe physical and mental suffering".
