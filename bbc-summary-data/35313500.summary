Teenage wicketkeeper Harvey Hosein has signed a one-year contract extension with Derbyshire.

Hosein, 19, who took a club-record 11 catches in his first two days of first-class cricket in 2014, has extended his stay until the end of the 2017 season.
The seven catches that the then 18-year-old claimed in the first innings against Surrey was a joint world record for a keeper on first-class debut.
"Harvey is an exciting talent," elite performance director Graeme Welch said.
"Since making his debut, Harvey has performed well with the gloves and continues to show improvements with the bat.
"His challenge now is to score runs on a consistent basis and contribute to winning games for the county."
Hosein, who took 33 catches in 12 first-class matches last season, scored his maiden first-class half-century against Gloucestershire in 2015, hitting 61 in the win at Bristol.
