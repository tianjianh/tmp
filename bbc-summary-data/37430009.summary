OK, we're only five matches into the Premier League season but let's not let that get in the way of some fun.
Before any balls had been kicked, our chief football writer Phil McNulty predicted Manchester City would win the title, with Manchester United runners-up and Watford among those to be relegated.
As City are yet to drop a point, he is on track with one forecast but would he still back Stoke for a top-10 finish having seen them pick up just one point so far?
