Hatton Garden raiders 'must have had detailed inside information'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A security guard has told Woolwich Crown Court whoever was behind the Â£14m Hatton Garden jewel heist must have had "detailed inside information".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eight men are accused of drilling into a concrete vault beneath the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit company in London over the Easter weekend.
The guard said he was alerted about alarms going off on 3 April, but found everything in order when he visited.
Three men deny conspiracy to commit burglary.
A fourth denies conspiracy to conceal or transfer criminal property.
Kelvin Stockwell, a security guard who worked in the building for more than 20 years, agreed with defence lawyer Nick Corsellis's suggestion of burglars having "inside information".
Mr Corsellis, who is representing Carl Wood, 58, asked the guard: "But it is plain to you, is it not, having worked there for as many years as you have, appreciating the complexities of the security system, where things are located, how things were bypassed, what area of the vault was drilled into, that the people who were involved in this crime must have had detailed inside information to commit this crime."
Mr Stockwell said Alok Bavishi, son of the building's owner, called him about the alarm being activated and was told police were at the scene.
But when the guard arrived at about 12.40am, after the alleged break-in, he found no police officers but instead saw "a young boy and his girlfriend".
"I went to the front of the building and pushed against the front doors, they were secure. I went around into Greville Street to check the fire exit and I looked through the letterbox," he said.
"I called Alok, he said he was about five minutes away in the car. I told him the place was secure, he said 'go home'."
The burglary was discovered on 7 April and Mr Stockwell said he called police after being informed by a colleague.
He said: "I looked and there was a lock on the door and that had been popped, there was a hole through the wall and I saw that we had been burgled.
"On the floor there was drills, cutting material, the lights were on and the second floor (lift) barriers were left open. I went into the yard to get a signal and dialled 999."
Jurors heard the alarm system was monitored remotely by a security firm. The jury also saw photos of the alarm's damaged keypad and the transmitter, which had been removed. The cover to the control unit had also been removed.
Mr Stockwell said the basement and vault were covered by an alarm system but: "You wouldn't hear it from the street".
The burglars took jewels, gold bullion and cash, but boxes containing sentimental pieces or personal effects, and even a taped confession were ignored, the court heard.
The trial continues.
