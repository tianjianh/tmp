United have not confirmed the injury, nor the length of time the 26-year-old could be sidelined for.
It is not known when the defender suffered the injury but it is believed to have occurred in training.
After the win at Swansea, United boss Jose Mourinho said Smalling "doesn't feel he can play 100% with his pain".
England interim manager Gareth Southgate subsequently left Smalling out of his squad for Friday's World Cup qualifier against Scotland at Wembley (19:45 GMT kick-off) and the friendly against Spain on Tuesday (20:00 GMT kick-off).
Smalling has played 11 times for United this season but has missed their past four games. Mourinho said the former Fulham player missed the EFL Cup win over Manchester City on 26 November with a minor ankle injury.
