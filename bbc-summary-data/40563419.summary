Willis, 26, and Clarke, 18, had beaten 2016 champions Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut in the second round.
However, their run ended with a 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-3) loss to Marach and Pavic.
In the men's singles tournament last year, Willis battled through the qualifying tournament before losing to Roger Federer in round two.
