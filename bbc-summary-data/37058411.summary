Nawras and Moaz, who are joined at the chest with protruding intestines, were born in the city of Douma in July.
They have now been safely transferred by ambulance to a children's hospital in nearby Damascus.
Syrian doctors had appealed for help from the World Health Organization, saying the twins would die if they were unable to undergo surgery.
The twins travelled with their mother and aunt and are said to be in good health.
People have have offered their prayers on a Syrian Red Crescent Facebook post, with one saying "God bless you and protect you".
Douma is just north of Damascus and has seen heavy fighting and prolonged shelling since the war began, making it hard for humanitarian aid to reach it.
The local branch of Syrian Arab Red Crescent (one of 82 across the country) however, has continued working in the area and managed in the last 18 months to get supplies through to needy people.
They also provide an ambulance service, general first aid, social support and even food for the residents of the area.
They shared these images on their Twitter and Facebook accounts to raise awareness of the ongoing war in Syria and their appeal to raise funds to continue their work there.
