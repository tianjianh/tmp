Funding of £4.2m to improve bus services across Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bus services are to be improved with £4.2m in funding, Transport Minister Keith Brown has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Transport Scotland's bus investment fund is to be split among 13 projects over three years.
Successful bids include a better park and ride at Kingswells in Aberdeen, bus stop timetables in Fife, and extensions to a southern Highland rural service.
Improvements are planned for the A81 in East Dunbartonshire, as well as rural services in Dumfries and Galloway.
Mr Brown said: "This fund provides local authorities, regional transport partnerships and bus operators with the opportunity to apply for grants which will help to increase the standard of bus services and patronage."
