Jackson made headlines across Canada and the U.S. after the Toronto Public Library shared the note he had tucked into the pages of a comic book he had damaged.
The note said: "I am sorry that a page ripped when it fell out of my bunk when I fell asleep reading. It won't happen again. I'm sorry, from Jackson."
A library worker found the note and shared it on social media.
