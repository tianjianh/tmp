[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cells inside the redundant Gloucester Prison have been opened as part of a consultation on its future use.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The site's new owners, City & Country Group, have invited people to share their thoughts on what should happen to the 220-year-old building.
Some 320 inmates were held inside until March 2013 when it closed.
Helen Moore, from City & Country, said they wanted to deliver a new scheme which would play "a significant role in the greater regeneration" of the area.
Previous suggestions for the site, which is in the heart of the city and adjacent to Gloucester Docks, have included housing, a museum and a hotel complex.
