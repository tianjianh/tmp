It gave the Reds a 3-1 aggregate victory over the Luxembourg side with David McDaid's early strike followed by a second-half Jay Donnelly goal.
Differange had Tom Siebenaler sent-off nine minutes before Donnelly made it 2-0 with 15 minutes remaining.
Gerard Lyttle's side booked a meeting with AEK Larnaca of Cyprus.
McDaid gave Cliftonville the perfect start, latching on to Donnelly's flick and bursting past two defenders before firing into the bottom corner in the second minute.
It was a high temp opening from the hosts and Donnelly's acrobatic volley flew just over.

Differdange went close from a corner when Omar Er Rafik saw his header saved by new Reds keeper Jason Mooney.
Devijvid Sinani dragged a shot wide for Differange early in the second half and the visitors were reduced to 10 men when Siebenaler was dismissed for a last-man foul on Donnelly.
Chris Curran created the second goal, reaching the byeline before crossing low for Donnelly to slot in at the backpost.
Differdange remained a threat and it required a good save from Mooney to keep out Antonio Luisi's strike.
Daniel Hughes should have added a third late on but after weaving his way clear the substitute failed to beat keeper Andre Almeida Rodrigues.
