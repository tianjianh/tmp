Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike star in David Fincher's film, which tells of a husband suspected of killing his wife after she mysteriously vanishes.
Fincher previously launched the annual festival in 2010 with his Oscar-winning Facebook drama The Social Network.
The 52nd New York Film Festival runs from 26 September to 12 October at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
Last year's event kicked off with Captain Phillips, Paul Greengrass's fact-based film about the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking.
Gone Girl will be released in the UK and Ireland on 3 October.
