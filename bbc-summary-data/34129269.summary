New Burnley midfielder Joey Barton says he regrets sending a tweet mocking the town while at QPR last season.

Barton tweeted a Clarets fan: "We may well be really overrated but at least we don't have to live in Burnley".
The 33-year-old joined Sean Dyche's side in August, after West Ham pulled out of a deal to sign the former Manchester City and Newcastle player.
"I wish I hadn't done it in a social media space because it was taken out of context," he told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"They're passionate fans, I'm a passionate player and we had a disagreement where they targeted me and I stood and fought my ground, and I think most people see it for that.
"If it was taken in a derogatory manner by some people it wasn't meant that way - it was me sort of poking fun and having a little fun with it.
"My early impressions of Burnley are very, very positive and I think in time Burnley fans will get to appreciate me as much as I get to appreciate Burnley."
