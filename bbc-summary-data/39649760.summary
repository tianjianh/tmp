Barca failed to score over two legs as Juve advanced 3-0 on aggregate after a goalless draw at the Nou Camp.
"Barcelona not scoring over two legs is almost unheard of," said Allegri.
"They had more chances in Turin than they did tonight. The team defended very solidly."
Juventus join Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Monaco in Friday's last-four draw (from 11:00 BST).
Trailing 3-0 from the first leg, Barca managed only one shot on target as they failed to repeat their last-16 heroics when they overturned a 4-0 deficit to beat Paris St-Germain.
Juventus join Manchester United (2007-08) and Bayern Munich (2012-13) as one of only three teams that have stopped the Catalans scoring in both legs of a Champions League tie.
"It's a step forward, we deserved qualification against a top level team," added 49-year-old Italian Allegri.
"We did very well defensively, less in attack because we failed to make the most of some very promising counter-attacks by missing some simple passes.
"However, it was a decisive step on the road to Cardiff."
Barcelona, who have gone out at the quarter-final stage in successive seasons, face La liga leaders Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday (19:45 BST).
Real are three points ahead of Barca with a game in hand.
"We tried with all our might, but we couldn't find the route to goal," said Barca boss Luis Enrique, who has announced he is leaving the club at the end of the season.
"We played a very poor first half in Turin and that has cost us dearly."
