Janet McKay, who had dementia, was found in Clydebank on 24 September.
She had last been seen by neighbours in Knightswood eight days before.
West Dunbartonshire Council said it hoped the image of the 150ft-high crane at Clydebank would raise awareness of Alzheimer's.
Provost Douglas McAllister said: "We were incredibly saddened to hear of Mrs McKay's passing. The whole community has been shocked and saddened by this news.
"I agreed that the lighting of the Titan Crane in Mrs McKay's memory was a fitting tribute, and was happy to agree to the suggestion from one of our residents.
"Nothing can alleviate what Mrs McKay's family must be going through, but we hope this gesture shows we are thinking of them."
Alzheimer Scotland community fundraiser Bronwyn O'Riordan said: "It's lovely to see the level of community support for West Dunbartonshire Council's gesture.
"It is an incredibly sad situation and our thoughts are with Mrs McKay's family."
The Titan Crane will be lit purple until dawn on Monday.
The Assistant Chief Constable of Police Scotland has apologised to the McKay family, after information about a possible sighting of her from a member of the public was not passed on to investigators.
Mrs McKay's son George has said her family has no criticisms to make of the police.
