Police have released CCTV images of a man they want to trace over a "violent attack" in the Gorbals area of Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 20-year-old man was with a male friend in Old Rutherglen Road when another man attacked him with a weapon at about 13:05 on 22 September.
The victim was treated in hospital for a leg injury.
Detectives believe the man in the images may be able to help with their inquiry. He is described as white, aged about 20, with short brown hair.
At the time of the incident, he was wearing a tracksuit top that was white at the front and light blue at the back, dark tracksuit trousers and dark trainers.
He was last seen walking on Caledonia Road towards Cathcart Road.
Det Con Nicol McPherson said: "This was a violent attack that took place in broad daylight which left this man with a serious leg injury.
"I would urge anyone who recognises the man in the images, or who has information that may assist the investigation to contact Cathcart Police Office."
