Life on the Lion Farm estate 25 years ago

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In 1990, Robert Clayton stumbled upon the Lion Farm estate in the West Midlands and set about documenting the lives of those living there.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The estate was built on the site of old mine workings in the 1960s, when the need to construct public housing was central to government policy.
By the time Clayton was on the scene, policy had changed and all but three of the nine tower blocks had been scheduled for demolition, with the residents in the process of being moved.
