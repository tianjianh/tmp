Woods and Elin Nordegren split in 2009 after he admitted to a number of affairs and the pair's six-year marriage came to an end in 2010.
The pair have two children, daughter Sam, eight, and son Charlie, six.
"I want it to come from me so that when they come of age, I'll just tell them the real story," said Woods.
"I've taken the initiative with the kids and told them up front, 'guys, the reason why we're not in the same house, why we don't live under the same roof is because daddy made some mistakes'.
"I just want them to understand before they get to internet age and they log on to something or have their friends tell them something."
Former world number one Woods, who won the last of his 14 major titles in 2008, has not played golf since undergoing back surgery in September and October.
He will be 40 at the end of December and in an interview with Time magazine, revealed how his relationship with his former wife has changed following the events that led to their divorce.
Woods said: "In hindsight, it's not how I would change 2009 and how it all came about.
"It would be having a more open, honest relationship with my ex-wife. Having the relationship that I have now with her is fantastic.
"She's one of my best friends. We're able to pick up the phone and we talk to each other all the time. We both know that the most important things in our lives are our kids. I wish I would have known that back then."
Woods admits he is unable to put a timescale on a possible return to golf, having played only seven tournaments in 2014.
Woods added: "I've had a good run. I've done a lot more in the game than I ever thought I could. And to be in my 30s, and to have done this much, I never would have foreseen that.
"With all my heart, I do not want to stop playing golf.
"It's not what I want to have happen, and it's not what I'm planning on having happen. But if it does, it does. I've reconciled myself to it.
"It's more important for me to be with my kids. I don't know how I could live with myself not being able to participate in my kids' lives like that. That to me is special."
