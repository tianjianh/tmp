The 20-year-old, who can play in defence or midfield, began his career as an MK Dons trainee but did not play a senior game for the League One club.
He joins National League Forest Green after loan spells at clubs including Torquay and Dagenham & Redbridge.
"Harry is a big, mobile lad who can play anywhere at across the back or midfield," said manager Mark Cooper.
"He's a very good player and just because he didn't break into MK Dons' first team at 19, while they were in the Championship, it doesn't mean he's not a very good player.
"Rather than go out and sign loan players to make up the squad through the season, we decided we should develop our own players, who will get their chance within the first-team squad."
