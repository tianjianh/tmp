[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a tense first half, Coulson sparked the game into life with two goals in three minutes just after the break.
The 22-year-old was perfectly placed to collect a squared ball and slot home to break the deadlock, before getting on the end of a similar pass second two minutes later.
Ross Stearn gave the visitors hope with a superb strike from distance with nine minutes remaining.
Bedsente Gomis spurned a golden chance to equalise from the penalty spot as he was denied by Eastleigh goalkeeper Ryan Clarke.
