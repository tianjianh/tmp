Chris Robshaw: Australian taunts will motivate us to win

England flanker Chris Robshaw says he is using jibes from the Australian media as motivation for a historic Test series win in Melbourne on Saturday.

The former skipper is prominent in a promotional video by host broadcaster Fox Sports which mocked England's early exit from last year's World Cup.
England beat the Wallabies for only the fourth time in Australia last Saturday.
"It's tough to see things like that, so we want to go out and prove people wrong," Robshaw told BBC Sport.
"With stuff like that, you use it as motivation. We want to come down here as an England team and make history along the way."
England have never won a Test series in Australia but can clinch the three-Test series with victory in Melbourne.
Robshaw wins his 50th cap at AAMI Park on Saturday, but admits he was worried his international career was over following the World Cup.
"Of course I was unsure what to expect, not really sure who was coming in, and how you would be viewed," he said. "So I was extremely glad I had another opportunity."
Robshaw's time in an England shirt has been far from plain-sailing, with some exhilarating highs mixed in with some demoralising lows.
But despite stripping him of the captaincy earlier this year, coach Eddie Jones kept faith with Robshaw as a player, and the Harlequins forward proceeded to play a leading role in England's first Grand Slam in 13 years, before putting in an 80-minute shift in the 39-28 first-Test win in Brisbane.
"In life and in sport you do have setbacks and things don't always go to plan. It's about how you respond," Robshaw added.
"You are always trying to reach the top. If it doesn't happen, you dust yourself off and you have to go again. It's as simple as that."
