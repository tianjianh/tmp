County Championship: Glamorgan seamers edge the first day in Bristol

Glamorgan just had the edge of the first day at Bristol despite a ninth-wicket stand of 90 between Craig Miles and David Payne lifting Gloucestershire to a semi-respectable 262.

Glamorgan's seamers bowled tightly, with Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten claiming three wickets apiece.
Gloucestershire teenager George Hankins (56) made the only real contribution from the top order.
Jacques Rudolph and Will Bragg then put on 81 for Glamorgan's second wicket.
In only his third Championship match, Hankins made his maiden half century, improving his career-best on the 45 he got against Kent last week.
Glamorgan's Timm van der Gugten told BBC Wales Sport:
"It went pretty well, better than the other games we've played. We bowled really well as a unit, made them play a lot and just asked questions.
"We were umming and ahhing about whether to bowl or bat first. We thought if the pitch was going to do anything it was going to be in the morning.
"I'm getting used to county cricket. Getting used to the ball has been the biggest difference because we use a Kookaburra in Australia and it doesn't swing as much."
Gloucestershire's George Hankins told BBC Sport:
"I got close last week against Kent, so it was nice to get over the line. Things are going well for me at the moment.
"They bowled well in the morning but we got through that tough period and it was good that Craig Miles and David Payne put on runs.
"We would have liked a few more runs. It didn't go to plan for the batsmen at the top."
