A "Vision for 2016" has been published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH).
It outlines the RCPCH's vision of how child health in Scotland could become comparable to the best in the world.
It claimed the country's record on child health is currently among the poorest in Western Europe.
In the run up to the 2016 Scottish election, the RCPCH said politicians should back a 20mph speed limit in built-up areas.
It claimed this would promote "safe play" and encourage children to walk, scoot or cycle to school.
Other policies promoted in the document include:
Dr Peter Fowlie, of the RCPCH, said: "Whilst our nation has much to be proud of when it comes to improving children's health, it still has some of the poorest health outcomes in Western Europe, particularly relating to child obesity and child mortality levels.
"Deprivation is often at the root of the problem with children living in poverty more likely to be overweight or obese, be born with low birth weight and have parents that smoke heavily or drink alcohol.
"It's clear we need to take action to reduce child health inequalities and a child health strategy which cuts across all government departments could do that. We call on government to work with us to develop this.
"In addition, we have today launched our Vision for Scotland and call on the next Scottish government to be bold and use its devolved powers to implement a minimum price for alcohol and develop education programmes for parents on the dangers of alcohol and drug use during pregnancy.
"I want Scotland to be the best place in the world to grow up. Only by targeting interventions at those most in need will we begin to achieve this."
The RCPCH argued that doctors can make a difference but only when supported by government.
Dr Fowlie added: "Clearly healthcare professionals have a key role to play in tackling some of these challenges but we will not be able to make inroads without political will and leadership."
A Scottish government spokesman said it had published guidance for local authorities to help reduce speeds in residential areas.
"The Good Practice Guide on 20mph speed restrictions produced in partnership with the Society of Chief Officers for Transportation in Scotland and published earlier this year - aims to ensure greater consistency on setting 20mph speed restrictions throughout Scotland, " the spokesman said.
"It encourages local authorities to introduce them near schools, in residential areas and in other areas of our towns and cities where there is a significant volume of pedestrian or cyclist activity."
