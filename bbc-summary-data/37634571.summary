[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A zip wire on Brighton seafront has been granted permanent planning permission by councillors.

The 300m (984ft) long attraction will be built on the former site of the Brighton Wheel, which closed in May.
It will cost Â£1.7m to build, and have a 22m (72ft) high starting tower with two cables. It is expected to attract about 32,000 visitors a year.
A cafe seating up to 140 people, with an open glass-fronted terrace, was approved as part of the application.
A landing area shaped like the hull of a boat will be on the beach opposite Lower Rock Gardens and Atlingworth Street.

The attraction will be open year round between 10:00 and 23:00.
The equivalent of just over 30 full-time jobs will be created by the investment, the council said.
Local residents had opposed the plans, saying "excessive screaming" from thrill-seeking customers using the wire would be intolerable.
One opponent, Trevor Scoble, said its purpose was "to excite people, to make them scream".
Councillor Julie Cattell, planning committee chair, said: "This fits well with the council strategy to bring new life to the seafront, particularly to the section between the pier and the marina.
"This should complement other businesses in the area, such as the pier and the Volks Railway, without affecting people's enjoyment of the beach."
The zip wire will be operated by the same company, Paramount Entertainment, that ran the Wheel.
