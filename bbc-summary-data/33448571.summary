Aberdeen men set for Dundee football disorder trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five men from Aberdeen are to stand trial accused of trying to incite violence prior to a football match in Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Steppie, Euan Stevenson, David Gowans, Kennedy Miskimmons and Scott Steppie all appeared at Dundee Sheriff Court accused of attempting to "engage in violence with rival fans" prior to the match at Tannadice on 13 December.
They all deny the charges against them.
Three men from Dundee earlier admitted similar charges from the same day.
Anthony Steppie, 49, Stevenson, 20, Gowans, 21, Miskimmons, 39, and Scott Steppie, 21, all deny charges under the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act.
They are all charged with engaging behaviour likely to incite public disorder by forming part of a disorderly crowd and repeatedly attempting to engage in violence with rival fans prior to the Scottish Premiership clash between Dundee United and Aberdeen.
The offences are said to have taken place in Main Street and Church Street.
Stevenson faces a further charge of assaulting an unknown male by kicking him on the body, on Church Street, while Scott Steppie is accused of punching an unknown male on the head on Caldrum Street.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael set a trial date in August and released the men on bail, on the condition they do not attend any Aberdeen FC matches in the meantime.
