Brendan Rodgers remains "super ambitious", with the Celtic manager aiming for further success after clinching the title.

Celtic beat Hearts 5-0 on Sunday to wrap up the Premiership with eight games to spare.
"I said when I came that, when I move on from here, whether the club move me on or I decide to go, I want this club to be in a better place," said Rodgers.
"I'm nowhere near that stage - I've got a lot left to fulfil here."
Rodgers is unbeaten in 37 domestic matches as Celtic chase a possible treble in his debut campaign.
The only blemish came in Europe, with the club failing to register a win in a tough Champions League group.
The former Liverpool and Swansea City boss has spoken often about his desire to turn Celtic into Champions League regulars, but his success in Scotland has already led to speculation about a move back south.
"I'm super ambitious and I told the players that when I came, but I have ambition for myself and for them to be the very best that we can," added the 44-year-old.
"All I can say is that I'm very, very happy in every aspect of my life - I'm in my dream job. That's the reality of it.
"I signed a four-year contract with Liverpool and 18 months later I was fired. I'm at the stage now where I probably appreciate more what I have.
"I've worked with many clubs in the past, but it's got a different feeling here."
Celtic's success was underlined last month when Scotland head coach Gordon Strachan chose six players from his former club to start in the World Cup qualifying win over Slovenia.
Craig Gordon, Kieran Tierney, Scott Brown, Stuart Armstrong, James Forrest and Leigh Griffiths all played in the 1-0 victory at Hampden and Rodgers thinks Callum McGregor could join them in future.
"Callum McGregor never gets a mention," he said of the uncapped 23-year-old.
"We have all the stars, all the goals; this was a boy who was absolutely brilliant yesterday.
"I have absolutely no doubt that if Gordon is looking for someone who is technically gifted, who can keep the ball, who understands football tactically, a player who never wavers in mentality - he is seven or eight out of 10 every game he plays - who has got Champions League experience then you wouldn't go too far wrong with Callum in your squad.
"He played in five position for me this season. Wide on the right against Barcelona, centre of midfield, the side of a diamond, he has played left-back and is one of those under-rated, under-valued players, but not by myself and the coaching team.
"I had a similar player at Liverpool in Joe Allen and it wasn't probably until he went to the European Championships and got voted into the team of the tournament that people began to sit up and take a bit of notice of him.
"These guys that are honest guys, they don't look for glory, they are very efficient, effective in the team.
"Callum has this unbelievable habit where he rarely gives the ball away and, in my teams, that is critical. This guy is a proper young footballer."
