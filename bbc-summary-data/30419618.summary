Pop stars Pixie Lott, Geri Halliwell and Professor Green were among the famous names at the annual party hosted by the Starlight charity.
EastEnders actor Jake Wood and pop group McBusted also joined in.
Starlight grants wishes for ill children and provides entertainment for them when they are in hospital.
Its website says its work is "aimed at distracting children from the pain, fear and isolation they can often feel as a result of their illnesses".
