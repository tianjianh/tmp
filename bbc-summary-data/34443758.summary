Work will begin next week to demolish a structurally unsafe footbridge over the River Clyde in Glasgow.

Polmadie footbridge, which connects Glasgow Green with Oatlands and Richmond Park, opened in 1955.
It was closed to pedestrians, cyclists and river users earlier this year following concerns over safety.
Work to remove the bridge deck, leaving the concrete piers in place, will begin on 12 October. Restrictions on river users will be lifted when complete.
The process is expected to take about five months, after which access to footpaths along the riverbanks will also be restored.
Glasgow City Council has appointed demolition contractors, JCJ Group, to carry out the work.
Councillor Alistair Watson, executive member for Sustainability and Transport, said: "This is good news.  It's a popular and busy bridge, used by the local community and residents from both sides and I know its closure is having quite an impact on the area.
"Obviously there is a lot of preparation work required before the main removal work can begin, however, I'm sure the local residents, cyclists and river users appreciate the work is required to ensure public safety.
"The bridge deck is in such a poor condition that repairing or strengthening it is not an options.  By removing the deck we can lift the restrictions on river users and the walkway below."
The council said it was investigating funding options to replace the bridge deck.
