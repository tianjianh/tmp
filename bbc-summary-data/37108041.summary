[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vikki Lane, 34, was pinned between a van and a car when her mother, Alison, accidentally sped up while parking in York in January.
Mrs Lane, who was 36-weeks pregnant, broke both her legs and pelvis.
She eventually gave birth to a healthy son Samuel.
The accident happened in Clifford's Tower car park in January.
She was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary where her son was safely delivered before she underwent a 12-hour operation.
She was left in a wheelchair for six-months and is still only able to walk short distances with a crutch.
Alison, 59, said of the accident: "I was just in a complete state of shock. I could not believe what had happened and I still can't really."
Her daughter, from Riccall, said her son was born at 17:45 GMT but "I did not meet him until 11am the next day".
She added: "He is our little miracle, and we've been having a joke about who will be walking properly first."
Her husband, Ray, is leading the fundraising bid and is planning to cycle the 153-mile Coast to Coast path with a party of 14 people.
They hope to raise Â£25,000 for Yorkshire Air Ambulance and the Day One trauma care charity, based at Leeds General Infirmary.
He said: "I felt compelled to do something because of what Vikki has been through. We can't thank the Air Ambulance crew and hospital teams enough for all they did and continue to do."
