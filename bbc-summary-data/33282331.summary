The duo are the first additions made by new boss Paul Cox and are the first players to sign since Torquay was taken over by a new consortium.
Marsh, 21, was at Oxford United before moving to Ebbsfleet in December.
Hurst, 23, is a former West Bromwich Albion academy player who has also had loans at Blackpool, Birmingham City, Shrewsbury Town and Northampton Town.
"We've brought a player to the football club who is an immense raw talent," Cox told Torquay's website with regard to Marsh. "I've watched him a number of times and watched him evolve as a young player.
"He scored 10 goals in 20 appearances for Welling last year and, while he still needs work, there is unbelievable talent there and the club can enjoy a very good signing."
Hurst can also play on the right of midfield and is a former England youth international.
"For a 23-year-old, James has already had an excellent career," Cox said. "He has perhaps fallen from grace after the potential he had as a young player but we're hoping to put him back on track.
"He brings immense experience for the level he's played at and a fantastic athlete. He's also a technically gifted footballer and he brings a lot of attributes to the club."
