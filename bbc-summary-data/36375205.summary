Captain Paul Collingwood and centurion Keaton Jennings helped Durham to a four-wicket win over Warwickshire.

The visitors began day four requiring 84 more runs to win at Edgbaston.
Opener Jennings, who resumed on 88 not out, reached his third Championship hundred of the season before being bowled by Jeetan Patel for 113.
His fifth-wicket stand of 111 with Collingwood (44) was key to Durham's run chase as they reached their victory target of 238 before lunch.
Their second straight victory takes them up to second in Division One, above the Bears and champions Yorkshire and 10 points behind new leaders Lancashire.
Warwickshire would have gone top of the table if they had won, but now lie third, having suffered their first Championship defeat of 2016.
They had looked well placed to register their second win of the season when Chris Woakes took a career-best 9-36 on Monday to give the Bears a first-innings lead of 123 runs, and then again on day three when Chris Wright's four wickets reduced Durham to 87-4.
But, with Woakes having been called away on England duty, Durham maintained their unbeaten start to the summer.
Jennings reached his century off 197 balls, while skipper Collingwood, the day before his 40th birthday, was trapped lbw by off-spinner Patel with 11 runs still needed.
Warwickshire captain Ian Bell told BBC WM:
"We have given that one away, to be honest. We were so on top after day two but I said to the guys we still then had to go out and bat well. I don't know if we were complacent or not but we let Durham back in.
"We have only ourselves to blame for that. They came out with a good attitude and bowled well and then batted well to knock the runs off but we have to look at ourselves - we let them off the hook.
"We wanted to set them the highest score of the game to win. Anything over 300 would have been hard and a lot different in terms of confidence in their dressing room.
"In this game there was a brilliant hundred from Andy Umeed and a special nine-for from Chris Woakes but we didn't back that up. We still haven't really hit our straps this season and put in a big performance."
Durham captain Paul Collingwood told BBC Newcastle:
"At one stage we were well behind the eight-ball so to have scrapped our way out of it was very pleasing.
"Woakesie's nine-for was literally international class. It was like facing 90 miles-per-hour leg-breaks. Many teams would have crumbled under that.
"But we kept fighting and kept punching and to come out with a win is an incredible feeling because we haven't had many good times at Edgbaston in recent years.
"To have three seamers with only a handful of games between them and get 20 wickets against that batting line-up is an incredible effort. James Weighell deserves to be on the winning side."
