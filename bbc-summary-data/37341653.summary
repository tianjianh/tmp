The Lionesses - who have already qualified - fell from top spot when Belgium beat Serbia earlier in the day.
Arsenal's Carter drilled in a low finish early on and Jill Scott's header four minutes later offered control.
Carter finished a good Nikita Parris cross and pounced to slam in her third before Karen Carney's late penalty.
Carney had been instrumental in much of England's good play and deserved her goal, placing her spot-kick down the middle after winning the penalty.
It ensured proceedings ended on a high in front of 7,052 fans at Notts County's Meadow Lane and England will hope to take their momentum in to Tuesday's final group match in Belgium, where a draw will ensure they top Group Seven.
A Belgium win in Leuven will see England drop to second but they now have four wins in a row and 20 unanswered goals since the sides drew 1-1 earlier in qualifying.
As it happened - how England beat Estonia at Meadow Lane
Six of those 20 goals have come from Carter, who looked primed from an early stage to add more to the three she plundered in Estonia last September.
Estonia, managed by former Charlton Ladies boss Keith Boanas, barely held possession in the England half and defended raggedly throughout.
Carter's touch and low skidding finish was of high quality to open the scoring and after converting Parris's low cross before the break, she waited until after the interval to pounce on a goalkeeping blunder and add a third.
Mark Sampson seems to have a real gem on his hands as Carter's link-up play also looked slick, albeit against poor opposition. Her clever flick late on saw Jordan Nobbs volley straight at Estonia's busy goalkeeper.
England success in winning bronze at the 2015 World Cup has not resulted in Sampson resting on his laurels, with high-profile names such as Eniola Aluko and Toni Duggan left out of all of the qualifiers.
It remains to be seen if he will call on such experience for next summer's finals in the Netherlands, where Germany will bid to win the tournament for the seventh time in a row.
Scott offers such experience in midfield and contributed admirably with England's second goal and an energetic display.
In celebrating, she kissed her black armband in memory of the late England Under-19 player Zoe Tynan and Sylvia Gore - the scorer of England's first ever official goal in the women's game.
Carney's late flurry was another nod to experience, something England will need to call on in Belgium if they are to arrive at next summer's showpiece as group winners.
England striker Danielle Carter: "I couldn't have imagined it.
"The first time I did it, it was just a dream come true. This time, it actually feels surreal - it feels like I'm dreaming.
"I'm just happy to get more caps and more goals. I was hoping we could get more and more, like the first time we played them."
England manager Mark Sampson: "She [Carter] is the one who'll get the plaudits. [It was] a really good performance from Dan, but the team were good today.
"We were solid defensively again, aggressive at times to get the ball back and open up some good passing lines to the forwards and the wide players.
"But I still felt we left some goals out there tonight, which is frustrating in a way but also pleasing because it shows we're creating lots of chances."
