Australia seeks to stop green groups challenging developments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Australia's government is seeking changes to environmental laws which could make it harder for green groups to challenge development projects.

The Coalition said legal challenges to projects such as coal mines were putting jobs and the economy at risk.
It wants to change the law so only people directly affected by a potential development can appeal against them in court.
But green groups said the changes could increase the risk of corruption.
Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the law currently gave green groups too much power.
He told reporters on Wednesday that major projects "shouldn't be subject to endless legal sabotage because the law gives green groups an unusual level of access to the courts".

Mr Abbott's comments follow a recent federal court case that overturned government approval for Indian company Adani's proposed giant coal mine in Queensland on environmental grounds.
The court challenge was made by a small environment organisation, the Mackay Conservation Group.
The law currently allows third parties to challenge government approval of major developments.
Attorney-General George Brandis on Tuesday said section 487 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act provided "a red carpet for radical activists" to use "aggressive litigation tactics to disrupt and sabotage important projects".
The government's proposed changes could increase the risk of corruption by removing checks and balances in government decision-making, said WWF Chief Executive Dermot O'Gorman.
"Far from damaging the economy, merit appeals promote good government decision-making and transparency and therefore a stronger economy," Mr O'Gorman said.
The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) said Senator Brandis's proposal was "nothing short of an attempt to strip communities of their right to a healthy environment".
"We want to make sure approvals for projects, such as Adani's proposed Carmichael coal mine, are above board and consistent with people's right to a safe environment," said ACF's Chief Executive Kelly O'Shanassy.
The government said the legislation would be introduced to parliament later this week.
