Burnley's title hopes suffered a setback as they were held to a goalless draw by play-off hopefuls Cardiff City.

Cardiff keeper David Marshall denied Andre Gray and George Boyd on a frustrating night for the leaders.
The Scotland stopper also saved from Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes late on as Burnley's lead at the Championship's summit was cut to one point.
Russell Slade's side deserved their draw, although they are now four points behind the play-off places in seventh.
Substitute Kenneth Zahore struck the crossbar late in the game for the Bluebirds, who have not lost to Burnley in nine years.
The Clarets extended their unbeaten run to 17 games but second-placed Middlesbrough are only a point behind them after a 3-0 win over Huddersfield.
Cardiff showed early intent with Tom Lawrence's curling shot deflected wide for a corner while former Cardiff keeper Tom Heaton saved Stuart O'Keefe's effort.
Burnley grew into the game with David Jones forcing a save from Marshall while Boyd was denied by Sean Morrison's well executed last-gasp tackle.
Top scorer Gray had Burnley's best chance of the half when his first-time shot was smartly saved by Marshall, who also denied Boyd before the break.
Cardiff continued to frustrate Burnley after the interval with Wales striker Vokes heading over the bar from Joey Barton's cross.
Matthew Lowton's dangerous low cross into the six-yard box was stabbed away by Marshall before Vokes could pounce.
At the other end, Lex Immers fired wide before substitute Zahore's lob over Heaton struck the crossbar. Burnley could have secured victory in stoppage time but Vokes and substitute Ashley Barnes were denied by Marshall.
Burnley boss Sean Dyche:
"It's another clean sheet, I think that's 16 this season, it's rare that we don't score a goal.
"We're the highest scorers in the division. If you keep making chances like that, you are going to score some goals.
"The one thing we can do is focus on ourselves, we cannot define what everyone else is going to do."
Cardiff manager Russell Slade told BBC Wales:
"I didn't think it would end 0-0. It was a typical Championship match.
"Who knows how many points it will take to nick one of those play-off spots."
