In the first, a Citation jet with two people on board was involved in an alert at about 13:15. It landed safely.
Shortly afterwards at 13:54 police and fire crews were called back to the airport after the pilot of a small plane reported an engine problem.
Police said the pilot was able to resolve the problem and had flown to Kinloss or Lossiemouth in Moray.
Inverness Airport said the crew of the Citation jet had reported a technical fault as it approached. However, it landed safely and taxied to the stand as normal.
"As a precaution, and in line with standard procedures, the airport fire service and other emergency service personnel were called to the scene but were not required," added the airport.
The incidents come days after a full emergency was declared at the airport after an aircraft reported a bird strike after taking off.
The mail flight from Inverness to Stornoway was forced to turn back after the incident last Friday morning.
The Loganair aircraft, with a pilot and co-pilot on board, landed safely a short time later.
