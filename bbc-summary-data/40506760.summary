Beverley Finney was struck by Henry Rigby's car as he drove at 40 mph in a 30 mph zone in St Helens, Merseyside.
Liverpool Crown Court heard that along with facial injuries, she been forced to move house, as living near a busy road caused her to have panic attacks.
Rigby was found guilty of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and given a 15-month suspended jail term.
CCTV footage captured the moment Rigby, 19 and of Harris Street in Dentons Green, St Helens, struck Ms Finney and another pedestrian in his Vauxhall Corsa on Haresfinch Road in May 2016.
Merseyside Police said both victims suffered life-threatening injuries.
In a statement to the court, Ms Finney said she still suffered "bad headaches", a "lot of back pain" and "a numbness to the side of the face" as a result of what happened.
She said she had scars around her eye socket and hairline and "may consider" plastic surgery in the future.
"In terms of mentality, I have been affected badly," she said.
"We have had to move house to a property away from a busy road [as] I just couldn't relax with the noise of traffic.
"I would get so distressed with the noise of skidding cars or revving engines."
Rigby was also handed a three-year driving ban, given an order to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work and told to pay £750 compensation to each victim, as well as £500 court costs.
Speaking after sentencing, Insp Mike McFall said what happened was "totally avoidable and shows the very real consequences of motorists who exceed the speed limit".
