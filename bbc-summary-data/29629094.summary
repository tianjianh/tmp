Sheffield City Council wants to revamp the Graves Tennis and Leisure Centre in Norton.
The plans include a swimming pool and gymnastics and trampolining facilities.
The centre would also host one of three hubs that will form the National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine  (NCSEM).
The hubs will promote exercise and fitness and treat injuries caused by exercise and conditions caused by lack of exercise.
Isobel Bowler, the council's cabinet member for culture, sport and leisure said that, if approved, the centre would be "the biggest facility to be built in Sheffield in a generation".
The council said if planning permission was granted, work would start early next year and was expected to be completed within 12 months.
The project is being jointly funded by Sheffield City Council, the NCSEM, the Lawn Tennis Association and British Gymnastics.
The NCSEM is a 2012 Olympic Legacy Project funded by the Department of Health.
The London hub - The Institute of Sport Exercise & Health - opened in June 2013, while the East Midlands hub at Loughborough University is due to open next year.
