[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tammy Abraham scored his 19th goal this season to end Bristol City's eight-game losing run in the Championship with a draw against Sheffield Wednesday.

Fernando Forestieri converted Adam Reach's cross to put the Owls in front, before Lee Tomlin equalised from the spot after he was fouled in the area.
Ross Wallace curled play-off hopefuls Wednesday back ahead after half-time.
But Abraham deflected Joe Bryan's shot in to level for City, who paraded new signing Matty Taylor during the break.
Striker Taylor joined the Robins from local rivals Bristol Rovers earlier on transfer deadline day - but it was Chelsea loanee Abraham who stole the show, again finding the net during an impressive debut season in senior football.
The 19-year-old had already twice been denied by Keiren Westwood before Bryan's shot from the edge of the area cannoned off his midriff to wrong-foot the Owls goalkeeper.
Wednesday looked the more likely to snatch victory in the closing stages, with Tom Lees heading their best opportunity over the crossbar.
But Carlos Carvalhal's side drop to seventh in the table, without a win in their last two matches, while Bristol City move up a place to 20th, three points clear of the relegation places.
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson: "We've shown great character to come from behind twice. The players obviously wanted to get a win, but given the circumstances, it's not a bad point.
"The fans stuck with us and they were brilliant, roaring us on. We had some great chances at 1-1.
"We stood strong though, and earned a point in the end, but the draw means nothing if we don't get a win on Saturday."
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal: "We have taken a point, but I cannot say that we achieved it because it should have been more.
"Bristol's second goal was rude. There is no place for it on the training ground and how can you defend against it?
"We wanted three points, but we take one and move on. They didn't create much, but nor did we. It was a game of few chances."
