A man has been jailed for two years after he deliberately drove his car towards a police officer and knocked her over in west London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Femi Adenibi, 22, from Hackney, was sentenced for actual bodily harm and dangerous driving at Isleworth Crown Court.
PC Sue Thomson was tossed two metres into the air after being hit by the car in Hammersmith on 2 October.
She said she was "terrified" when she saw the vehicle approaching.
An unmarked police car blocked the path of Adenibi's vehicle on Shepherd's Bush Road, but when the officers got out Adenibi drove onto the pavement, hitting PC Thomson and knocking her unconscious.
She was off work for more than two months. In a victim impact statement, she said: "I couldn't hear anything or see anything, and all I could hear was a loud ringing in my ears. I was terrified. I thought that I had died."
Adenibi, of Pembury Close, Pembury Road, was arrested at the scene and was found to be driving without a valid licence and without vehicle insurance.
He had previously pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and was later found guilty of actual bodily harm.
