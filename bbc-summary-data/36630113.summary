The Skyslide spans 45 ft from the 70th to the 69th floor of the US Bank Tower in the city.
Despite being made of glass just one inch thick, it is built to withstand hurricane-force winds and earthquakes.
Tickets cost $25 (Â£18) each. It is part of the Skyspace renovation that also includes an observation deck.
Some visitors got a preview earlier in the week.
"I thought it was nerve-wracking and exciting and daring," said Keri Freeman.
"I went a lot faster than I thought I would," said Rebecca Fitzgerald.
"And you kind of like hit the side as you're coming around the curve, so you're really pressed up against the glass, so you see the whole world below you, but it's not really that scary."
