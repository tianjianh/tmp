[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 2-2 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Taylor volleyed a spectacular 49th-minute equaliser to earn Bristol Rovers a draw at home to 10-man Rochdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors went in front after 17 minutes when Callum Camps ran on to an Ian Henderson pass and rounded goalkeeper Kelle Roos before shooting into an empty net.
The lead lasted only four minutes before Peter Hartley headed a Chris Lines corner across goal for Taylor to get the final touch inside the six-yard box.
Before the celebrations of the home fans had died down, Rochdale struck again as the dangerous Joe Bunney collected a long ball from the left and crossed for Henderson to net a simple tap-in.
Rochdale could have been further ahead at the break with Peter Vincenti heading wide early on and Henderson seeing a 35th-minute shot from close range saved by Roos.
Taylor levelled again with a scissor-kick from Hartley's header soon after the break and Rochdale's task was made tougher when centre-back Niall Canavan was dismissed for a second yellow card in the 72nd minute, but they held on.
