[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flock of sheep has come to the aid of New Zealand police, stopping a car-load of fugitives who had led officers on a high-speed chase across Central Otago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The driver, initially pulled over for speeding and having no licence plates, evaded capture for 90 minutes.
The fugitives even managed to continue after road spikes deployed by officers destroyed one of their vehicle's tyres.
They were finally halted by the sheep, which blocked the road entirely as they were being moved to new pasture.
In a coincidence, the sheep were reported to be owned by a local police officer from Queenstown.
All four fugitives were arrested.
