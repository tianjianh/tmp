Charlie Webster, 33, who has worked for Sky and ITV, became unwell after watching the Olympic opening ceremony.
She was taken to hospital where she was diagnosed with a rare strain of the disease.
Webster, from Sheffield, is in a stable but serious condition at St James's Hospital in Leeds.
In a statement she thanked the public for their support and said doctors in Brazil had saved her life.
She added: "The last few weeks have been hell and I'm just so thankful to be here."
The presenter was admitted to hospital after becoming unwell while watching the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on 6 August.
Doctors initially believed she was dehydrated after completing a 3,000-mile charity cycle ride to the Brazilian city.
But her condition deteriorated and she fell unconscious before being placed in a coma.
Specialists are now trying to find out where she may have caught the disease.
Who is Charlie Webster?
