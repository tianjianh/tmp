[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old has denied knowingly taking cocaine after it was found in his system after a game between Celtic and Thistle in December 2014, and has fought to clear his name.
His two-year playing suspension was due to expire in December this year.
But it has now been reduced by the National Anti-Doping Panel.
The NADP's formal ruling, following an appeal by McMillan, is expected to be officially announced later this week.
McMillan, who began his senior career with Rangers, joined Thistle in 2013 after being released by Dunfermline Athletic following the club's move into administration.
