Darren Carter put the visitors ahead but Blaine Hudson struck twice after the break to put the hosts on the brink of victory.
But in a dramatic end, Rovers' Sam Wedgbury was sent off for a second yellow card before Williams levelled.
Wrexham remain 12th while the end of Rovers' six-match winning streak saw them drop to second behind Cheltenham.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "We've had a couple of cruel, cruel Saturdays - last minute things. A penalty last week and a late equaliser today is tough on us.
"And it's just those thin dividing lines making the difference of whether you achieve what you want to achieve.
"And we could be four points better off than we are, but we're not.
"What can I say after what my players have given me today - unbelievable - and I'm absolutely delighted with them."
Forest Green boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"It's a point won - when you go down to ten-men and you've only got another minute to go, it's a point gained.
"I'm just disappointed with the two goals. The build-up and the free-kick - it's all our own fault, we were a bit na√Øve I thought on both of the goals.
"We should have been a little bit more ruthless in front of goal in the first half, we played some lovely football in the conditions.
"But I'm really pleased, this is a big club, we knew it was going to be a tough place to come and it ticks the board over with another point for us."
