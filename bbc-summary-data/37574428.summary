Bland, 43, has qualified for November's season-ending Dubai World Tour Championship for the first time.
Three top 10 finishes during September ensured Bland gained valuable points on the lucrative Race to Dubai list.
"My game's been in really good shape and I've been playing aggressively and confidently," he told BBC Radio Solent.
Bland, from Southampton, has already doubled his prize money earnings from his previous best tour year and booked himself a place in The Final Series of the European Tour for a first time, which starts with the Turkish Open on 3 November.

"I'm focused on getting as high up the order of merit as I can," Bland added after finishing tied 18th in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship on Sunday.
"I'm just outside the top 100 (ranked 127) in the world currently and I would love to get higher. I'm trying to stick the accelerator down even more between now and the end of the season.
"To do that, I've got to play and it's a massive incentive for me. I've just got to keep playing as well as I have been lately and it will give me every chance."
