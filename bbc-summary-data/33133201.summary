[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A social worker for a 14-year-old girl found hanged had not been told she was having suicidal thoughts highlighted in a health report, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seren Bernard, who was in the care of Pembrokeshire council at the time, died in Milford Haven in April 2012.
Social work expert Prof Neil Thompson said the information from the mental health assessment in September 2011 should have been shared.
The hearing was told Seren had also admitted self harm in the report.
Prof Thompson told the inquest that in assessing risk to young people, "past behaviour is a strong indicator of future behaviour".
The inquest has heard Seren had made an earlier suicide attempt before she was found dead.
Prof Thompson said the assessment findings should have been shared as part of a child protection conference process which brings together those trying to safeguard a child's welfare.
He also said he was surprised Seren's social worker had only found out about her suicidal thoughts while giving evidence at the inquest.
"All professionals should be sharing information in a spirit of partnership," he said.
The inquest continues.
