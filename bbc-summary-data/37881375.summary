[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge United scored three times in one match for the first time this season as they battled back to beat Crawley Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crawley made a strong start, as Chris Arthur's cross was headed down by Enzio Boldewijn for leading scorer James Collins to fire home his sixth league goal of the season.
United equalised on 19 minutes when skipper Leon Legge crossed for defender Greg Taylor, who fired his first league goal for the club.
Striker Uche Ikpeazu extended the visitors' advantage in the 28th minute, coolly lobbing keeper Glenn Morris after a long ball by Max Clark.
Midfielder Luke Berry made the points safe six minutes after the interval by curling in a free-kick from 25 yards.
In response, Billy Clifford twice went close for Crawley, who are now winless in League Two games.
Report supplied by the Press Association.
Cambridge manager Shaun Derry told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "I'm disappointed with the way we conceded the goal, but the response was exactly what I wanted it to be.
"It came from the players, which is even more important, because at certain times this season it's been driven from the sides (of the pitch).
"I've always wanted the players to drive themselves internally, and collectively they've done that this afternoon.
"The team has been full of character. Even when things haven't been going well, they've always responded and for the players today, it's a fantastic achievement."
