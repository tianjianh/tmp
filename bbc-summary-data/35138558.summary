The 30-year-old was shot on the doorstep of his home in November 2004.
A Freedom of Information request  by the Press and Journal also reveals that officers have spent almost Â£15,000 on overtime, hotels, travel and food since April last year.
However, Police Scotland has refused to disclose the number of officers who have been involved in the inquiry.
The force will also not reveal how many officer hours have been spent on the investigation.
The father-of-two was shot with a German-made handgun by a stocky man in a baseball cap who had handed him an envelope. He died later in hospital.
A massive police investigation was launched but the murder remains unsolved.
The gun involved was found on 8 December 2004 in a drain on Seabank Road, Nairn, by council workers carrying out gully cleaning.
Forensic analysis identified it as the murder weapon but tests on the gun failed to extract any DNA.
Mr Wilson was shot with a German-made handgun by a stocky man in a baseball cap.
The Haenel Suhl Model 1 Schmeisser was manufactured between 1920 and 1945 at a Schmeisser factory in Germany.
The ammunition used was .25 calibre made by Sellier and Bellot in the Czech Republic between 1983 and 1993.
About 40,000 of the guns were produced in Germany and police suspect the weapon may have been brought back to the UK either as a war trophy, for legitimate export or on the black market.
Police have been holding a homicide governance review which looks at previous investigations to ascertain if all possible lines of inquiry have been thoroughly exhausted.
In November last year the father-of-two's family said they feared the murderer could kill again.
The family said the motive for the shooting was a mystery and it was difficult for his wife and sons to achieve closure.
Crimestoppers offered a reward of up to Â£5,000 for information leading to a conviction.
