A school bus, a shopping mall and a park are all places that are generally regarded as safe.

But as an exhibition of photographs currently on in the capital, Delhi, shows, these are also locations where women have been raped in India.
The Rape in India Project is a crowd-sourced platform of photos documenting locations and spaces where sexual assaults have occurred.
"The story of rape in India is truly horrific," says photographer and the project co-founder Poulomi Basu.
"With this project, we want to initiate a dialogue around the subject of rape and sexual assault. The banality of the locations where many rapes have taken place is chilling. Perhaps, we are not as safe as we think in such places," she adds.
The exhibition, conceived by PROOF: Media for Social Justice, is on at the India Habitat Centre until 23 December.
