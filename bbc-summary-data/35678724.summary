She moved up from fourth to second in the final, double points medal race.
With the Rio Games fewer than six months away, it was a consecutive silver World Championships medal for the world number one.
Shaw, 32, said: "I was so pleased to cross that finish line. It's been a really tough week in terms of nerves."
Meanwhile, fellow Brit Nick Dempsey failed to make the podium after finishing fourth. He had been in second place ahead of the final day's racing.
He said: "Although I'm gutted to finish fourth, I genuinely feel ready to win again. Six months out from the Games, things are coming together."
