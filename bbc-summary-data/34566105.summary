Stormont crisis: NI Assembly to debate DUP's 'in-out' ministers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) policy of pulling its ministers in and out of the Northern Ireland Executive is to be debated at Stormont later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last month, DUP leader Peter Robinson stepped aside as first minister and took all but one of his party's ministers out of the executive.
Since then, ministers have repeatedly resigned and been reappointed due to a row over the status of the IRA.
The Alliance Party has called a debate on whether that is damaging Stormont.
The party has asked the Northern Ireland Assembly to note that some DUP ministers have "resigned and resumed office more than 20 times since 10 September 2015".
Alliance has asked MLAs to vote on whether the "practice of rolling resignations has had a significant and detrimental effect on the governance of Northern Ireland and on the public's faith in the political institutions".
The motion has been proposed by Alliance MLAs Stewart Dickson, Chris Lyttle and Trevor Lunn.
The DUP introduced its resignations policy five-and-a-half weeks ago as a form of protest after police said some IRA members had been involved in the murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr.
Mr McGuigan Sr, a former IRA man, was shot dead near his east Belfast home in August.
Mr Lyttle said the debate was an opportunity to show people that there were MLAs and ministers working to deliver effective government.
"We fail to see how the Ulster Unionist Party resignation and in particular the rolling resignations of the DUP - we think over 20 in the last month - are achieving anything other that to damage public confidence further in the institutions, to imperil our public services and indeed to bring the assembly into disrepute," he said.
"They may also be in breach of the ministerial code which requires you to take office in good faith, to discharge your duties, to fully participate in the executive and to be accountable to the assembly, none of which is happening for those ministers."
The DUP said that because of Sinn FÃ©in's links to the IRA it could not do "business as usual" at Stormont until the issue of paramilitary activity was addressed.
Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland's Sunday Politics programme, DUP MLA Peter Weir conceded that the resignations policy was "clearly seen as being messy".
But he added: "We're more interested in achieving an outcome rather than in the process.
"Let's remember why we are here.
"We're here because there was a man murdered on the streets and the chief constable indicated that the murder was carried out by individuals who are connected up with an organisation [the IRA] which was connected up with a party in government [Sinn FÃ©in]."
Sinn FÃ©in has repeatedly condemned the murder of Mr McGuigan Sr and said the IRA no longer exists.
