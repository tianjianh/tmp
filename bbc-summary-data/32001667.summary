Officers were called to Salford Royal Hospital at about 23:45 GMT on Friday by staff who reported a 28-year-old had been admitted with stab wounds to his neck, shoulder and chest.
He had been helped to the hospital by friends after being attacked on Edward Street.
Det Sgt Julie Connor said it was a "brutal attack" with an unknown motive.
"What we do know from the doctors is that the victim is lucky to by alive and if his friends had not intervened, he would probably have died from blood loss," she said.
The man's attacker was described as being white, in his early 20s, and of average height and slim build, with brown hair cut in a 1960s style and a scruffy beard or moustache.
He was said to be wearing a blue top with a circle emblem on the front and blue jeans, and was carrying a large carving knife.
Det Sgt Connor said anyone with information about the attack should contact police.
