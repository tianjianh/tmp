Pooches and dragons: Working in the pet business

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The pet industry is worth about Â£5bn to the UK economy and insiders say there is room for more growth. Business Scotland has been talking to Scottish companies in the sector - from a pet hotel, to a man whose dog inspired a new business.

About 40% of Scottish households have a pet and it seems that we are prepared to go to great lengths to treat them - whatever else is going on in our lives.
Walking down the corridor of the Bellslea Hills Pet Hotel and Spa in Ayr, you can see the light from television screens flickering from inside some of the suites. At this time of day, though, most of the guests are having a snooze or watching the world go by in their personal outside run.
From a bone-shaped splash pool to hair conditioner, to a webcam to check on your pooch while you are away - this is about a luxury experience.
"We initially thought it would be upper class people, maybe going on holiday three or four times a year with the money to spend," says Bellslea Hills managing director Will Aitken.
"We do have a lot of clients like that," he continues, "but we also have clients that are maybe going to a caravan park for the weekend. The caravan doesn't accept dogs and they're bringing their dog in here."
Although the business has only been open since March and is very much at the growing stage, they have had a lot of interest from clients going to weddings.
"Normally the family would look after the dog, but because the family are all going to the wedding they feel that if they're getting luxury for the weekend, why shouldn't their dog too," adds Mr Aitken.
There's potentially a lot of business out there for pet services providers like Bellslea Hills.
In the UK there are an estimated nine million dogs and seven million cats, while the number of reptiles, such as bearded dragons, has risen to about three million.
That's not even counting the "small furries", like rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters, which stand at two million.
For many people, their first venture into pet owning is not a dog but a small furry animal, a bird or a fish - something you might well buy in a pet shop.
Eight years ago Mabel Lau drove past Pets-cetera in Glasgow's west end, which had a business for sale sign on it. Along with a friend, she decided to go for it.
She enjoys being part of a neighbourhood which she feels is keen to support local businesses.
"They bring their dogs into the shop and sometimes they select things with the help of the dog," she explains.
But a shop still means higher overheads.
"Obviously the last eight years it's been quite tumultuous with all the different economic problems, but I think people still generally want to spend money on pets."
She says they still want the comfort factor of something at home they can look after.
Across the UK about 46% of households have pets. But contrast that with the United States, where the figure is 68%.
Industry body, The Pet Industry Federation, sees possibilities for growth here.
"There are more opportunities for people to have more pets," says federation chief executive Nigel Baker, "and we think people are healthier and happier with pets, provided you get the right pet.
"So if you live in a high-rise flat, don't get a Great Dane."
In a holding area at a busy vets' practice, one of the canine patients is enthusiastically eating everything but the bowl that the food came in. Nothing wrong with his appetite anyway.
"I've been in theatre, dealing with a cruciate ligament injury in a dog, then I did some neutering," explains vet Ross Allan. In the evening he is consulting.
Mr Allan is a partner at the Pets'N'Vets Family, a group of practices across eight sites in Glasgow and the surrounding area.
"Being entrepreneurial is part of providing good customer service," he continues.
"We recognised that we had to grow the business, not only to treat more animals and to justify the expenditure on up-to-date equipment, up-to-date training and facilities and so on, but in a way that also fitted with what we felt the business needed to survive in the future."
Part of their plan is to open a so-called "super-practice" which would allow them to offer a range of services in one place.
It will include separate rooms for dogs and cats, and in one of the cat consulting rooms there will be an artificial tree to allow better diagnosis of lameness.
Across the country in Edinburgh, Harry, a black labrador, is having a snooze on a rug in his home.
Although he may be unaware of it, Harry's sensitive stomach was the inspiration for a business and a brand.
"I worked for a big franchise company which unfortunately went into liquidation," says his owner, Paul Marsden. "While I was looking for a job, we got Harry."
Mr Marsden began experimenting with treats for Harry and - combined with some help to start up a small business - it was a lightbulb moment.
Three years ago Harry's Treats was born and has since developed at events such as farmers' markets. Its products are also now stocked in a number of retail outlets.
Production is undertaken at Mr Marsden's home using domestic mixers, and that can make life difficult - they only hold 15 portions and most shop orders are for at least 150 bags.
In order to grow, the business needs a production unit, but cash flow is an issue.
"It's extremely frustrating. The business opportunities are there, we just cannot take it forward at the moment," he says.
"We need to try and make as much money as we can this year. to take it to the next level. I'd love a day off but I really enjoy it."
