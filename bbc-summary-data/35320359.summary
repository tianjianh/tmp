Insp Gen Tito Karnavian was speaking a day after a gun and bomb assault on the capital, Jakarta, which left two civilians and five attackers dead. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State militant group.
He told the BBC's Ali Moore than some 350 people were known to have travelled to fight with IS in Syria and about 40 had returned to Indonesia.
