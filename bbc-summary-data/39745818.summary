Dean Elgar struck an unbeaten 131 to help Somerset beat Sussex by nine runs in a rain-affected One-Day Cup game.

Sussex started well, reducing Somerset to 59-3 with all-rounder David Wiese (2-51) dismissing danger men Steven Davies and Peter Trego (20) cheaply.
However, Elgar and Adam Hose (76) took control, putting on 151 runs in 20.1 overs to see the away side to 303-5.
After two delays, Sussex were set 165 to win from 20 overs, but wickets saw them fall narrowly short on 155-9.
Although Somerset went into the match following a win over Surrey, their top three failed once again, with Davies falling fourth ball before Trego was caught behind and Jim Allenby (23) was bowled by George Garton (2-66).
But Elgar continued his excellent form, striking 10 fours and four sixes in his 127-ball innings to anchor the innings alongside Hose, who scored freely at the other end, launching Garton for two sixes before he was caught by Laurie Evans.
Rain in Hove meant Sussex were originally set 185 to win from 25 overs, but at 85-4 after Harry Finch (27) and Luke Wright (28) had fallen and another interruption came, the target was further reduced under the Duckworth-Lewis calculations.
Despite five sixes from Evans (40) and three fours in the final over by Danny Briggs, the asking rate of nearly 14 runs per over proved to much as they came up marginally short, with Craig Overton claiming figures of 3-21.
