Chaminda Vaas believes Ireland have a "well- balanced" bowling attack heading into the World Twenty20 in India.

The former Sri Lanka bowler has been part of Ireland's coaching staff for the last month and is happy with their preparations ahead of the tournament.
"They are happy bowling with the new ball and have played a lot of T20 games," said Vaas.
Ireland face Oman in Wednesday's opener and will also play group favourites Bangladesh and Netherlands in Group A.
Vaas joined the Irish for a week's training camp in Abu Dhabi, the squad completing their build-up by beating Hong Kong before a six-wicket defeat by Zimbabwe in a final warm-up game on Saturday.
"Preparation has been fantastic and the guys are in good shape," Vaas said.
"The guys are professionals and are playing county cricket.
"The attack is well balanced with good bowlers like (Boyd) Rankin, Tim (Murtagh) and (Craig) Young.
"It's about experience, they have experience, so they need to perform in the middle."
Ireland need to top the group to qualify for the Super 10 stage, a feat they have not achieved since 2009.
Glamour fixtures against hosts India, Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan could follow if they qualify, and new coach John Bracewell is optimistic they can realise their goal.
"In T20 if you take your chances, you've got a chance," said the former New Zealand spin bowler.
"We'll give it our best shot and if we get through, our aim will be to upset somebody else."
