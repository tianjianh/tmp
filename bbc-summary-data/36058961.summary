The annual event has been staged at Liverpool's stadium since the tragedy in Sheffield on 15 April 1989.
The Hillsborough Family Support Group released 96 white doves at the conclusion of the service, in memory of those fans who died as a result of the disaster.
The crowd sang Wind Beneath My Wings as doves were released towards the conclusion of the service.
