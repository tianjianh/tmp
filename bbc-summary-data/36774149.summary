[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield moved up to sixth in Super League after edging a thrilling topsy-turvy encounter with Catalans Dragons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Max Jowitt crossed early on after good work by Craig Hall, but three quick tries by Tony Gigot, Dave Taylor and Justin Horo put the hosts in control.
Wakefield drew level at 18-18 at the break when Jonny Molloy powered over and Hall touched down.
The teams both scored two further tries but Pat Richards missed a late kick with his side trailing by two at 30-28.
And Wakefield, who were already assured of their place in the top eight, held on for a victory which ends a three-match losing run.
The Wildcats had regained the lead after an even first period when Bill Tupou made the most of some quick thinking by Hall to go over.
Catalans responded again when Morgan Escare ran onto a Lucas Albert kick.
Mikey Sio then crossed for the visitors and the reliable boot of Liam Finn made it 30-24, but although Fouad Yayha scored in the corner, Richards' missed conversion proved costly for Catalans.
