Mr Johnson says he will discuss a "wide range of issues and deepen the strength of our bilateral relationship" when he meets President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry.
"We are Egypt's top economic partner and strong allies against terrorism and extremist ideas," he added.
The Foreign Office said Mr Johnson would meet human rights activists.
He will also host a reception with British investors and Egyptian entrepreneurs.
A former armed forces chief, President Sisi was elected to power in 2014, a year after removing his predecessor, Mohammed Morsi, from office in a popularly-backed coup. But some Egyptians worry he represents a return to the authoritarian security state that prevailed under President Hosni Mubarak.
Mr Johnson said: "The UK is a champion of a renewed Egypt, because stability, peace and growth in this region are the bedrock of opportunity and security for British people and people in the region."
