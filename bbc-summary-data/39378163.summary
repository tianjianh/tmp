The city-centre building, formerly the Dock Offices, tells the history of Hull's mariners.
The site has been chosen to highlight sacrifices made by the Merchant and Royal Navies.

The building in Queen Victoria Square witnessed many of the defining events of the First World War in Hull.
Weeping Window is part of the poppy installation Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, which was created to mark the centenary of World War One and was originally at the Tower of London in 2014.
Each poppy in the original display represented one death in the British forces during the 1914-18 war, a total of 888,246.
The poppies will end a UK tour in 2018 and have a permanent home at the Imperial War Museum.
Artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper will officially open Weeping Window on Saturday.
It will be on display until May.
