Victorious Davis Cup captain Leon Smith says Britain needs to capitalise on his team's historic triumph to inspire a future generation of tennis players.

Britain won the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years with victory over Belgium in Ghent over the weekend.
Smith said the sport's governing body, the Lawn Tennis Association, needed to quickly create a long-term strategy.
In praising Judy Murray's tennis programmes, Smith said: "She can't keep doing it on her own."
Smith said Judy Murray, the mother of British number one Andy and doubles specialist Jamie, "needs a lot of help".
Murray leads the LTA's Miss-Hits programme - an introductory course for girls aged between five and eight - and a Scottish-based scheme, Tennis on the Road.

Smith, who became Davis Cup captain five years ago with the team a play-off away from relegation to the event's lowest tier, added: "At the end of the day, we all care about British tennis a lot.
"What we want to see is more people playing, so there should be a bigger talent pool in years to come.
"It really is an important time to get strategies rolled out as quickly as possible, not only to get people on the court but to keep them on the court.  We need to offer them good clubs and good coaches that turn up in all weather and bang out great sessions.  Let's hope it has a positive influence, because it should do."
The LTA was criticised for failing to capitalise on Andy Murray's Wimbledon victory in 2013 with participation levels remaining an issue.
But LTA chief Michael Downey described the successful weekend in Belgium as "very, very special and emotional moments that can drive interest in our sport".
World number two Andy Murray was the dominant force for the fourth Davis Cup tie running as he became only the third man after John McEnroe and Mats Wilander to end a campaign with an 8-0 singles record.
He also matched American great Pete Sampras 20 years ago, the last man to win three live rubbers in a final.
The former Wimbledon and US Open champion said winning the Davis Cup was a more emotional experience than winning Grand Slam titles or Olympic gold.
The Scot also said the Davis Cup campaign had affected him physically, adding: "I'm 28 but my body feels a lot older right now. I still hope to play for the next five or six years."
