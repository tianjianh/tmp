Thames Valley policeman accused of 'bullying' woman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police constable is facing a misconduct hearing into claims he "bullied" a woman whose car he seized on private land.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Neil Bevan's behaviour to the woman was described was "abrupt, rude [and] bullying" after the incident on 11 August 2016.
It is alleged he stopped her and took her keys, instructed another officer to move the vehicle, and issued her with a traffic offence report.
The hearing takes place on 7 June.
A Thames Valley Police spokesman said PC Bevan may have carried out his actions "without considering if he had a proper basis for doing so" and without explaining the reason for doing so.
He added: "The officer gave Ms Hanrahan the impression that he would report her to the DVLA and/or take further regulatory action against her.
"The officer did not inform her when he decided against taking such action and his manner when interacting with Ms Hanrahan was abrupt, rude, bullying and/or lacking in respect and courtesy."
The hearing will take place at the force's headquarters in Kidlington.
