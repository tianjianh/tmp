[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stallholders at Wrexham's People's Market have relocated to allow work to get under way on a Â£4.5m redevelopment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wrexham council is incorporating an arts centre into the market.
Some traders have temporarily moved to the Butchers Market, with contractors expected to finish the project by 2018.
The initial plan was for contractors to work around traders but a senior councillor said so few decided to remain that it was no longer viable to remain open.
The building refurbishment involves adding two galleries, performance areas, a gallery shop and market stalls.
The present gallery, Oriel Wrecsam, is situated next to the market.
Hugh Jones, Wrexham's lead member for communities and partnerships, said a number of traders had "decided voluntarily that they wanted to relocate to the Butchers Market".
He added: "We supported them in that move and that left a critical mass in the People's Market that was too small to support the footfall needed to keep them in business.
"It's a temporary move. All the people [traders] who want to come into the exciting new arts, cultural market project will be located."
Janette Partington, who ran a baby and children's clothing stall in the People's Market, said traders were told the work could be completed eight weeks early if they all moved out.
Four other traders, including a confectionery shop, a haberdashery and a bric-a-brac stall, are now trading from the Butchers Market.
The south mall at the People's Market, including a cafe and newsagents, will remain open during the construction.
