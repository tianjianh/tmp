Arthur Simpson-Kent, 48, appeared at Kaneshie Magistrates' Court in Accra. He has been remanded for two weeks.
He left the UK on 19 December following the deaths of his former partner Ms Blake, 43, and their two young sons, Zachary, eight, and four year-old Amon.
The British government is yet to submit the request for his extradition.
The Met Police launched a murder investigation after Ms Blake, who was last seen in public on 13 December, was found buried in the garden of her family home in Erith, Kent, along with her two children on 5 January.
Mr Simpson-Kent was arrested on Saturday at a Ghanaian beach resort after locals who had seen his photo on social media tipped off police.
Two Met Police officers flew out to the African country and located Mr Simpson-Kent on Busua beach with help from local police and officers from Interpol.
Ms Blake, who had motor neurone disease, and her sons died from neck and head injuries, post-mortem tests found.
She played Frankie Pierre in 56 episodes of EastEnders between 1996 and 1997.
The Met has been criticised over delays in its investigation after it emerged officers spoke to Mr Simpson-Kent at the family home on 16 December.
Their handling of the case is being investigated by police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Speaking in Accra on Saturday, Met Police Det Ch Insp Graeme Gwyn said he was satisfied "there was nothing we or the Ghanaians could have done any quicker".
