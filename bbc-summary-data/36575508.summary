Rival camps in the EU referendum have claimed they have momentum on their side as campaigning in Wales resumes.

Former Labour Welsh Secretary Lord Murphy said there was a trend towards Remain as voters began to make up their minds.
He was one of several senior Labour figures pushing the pro-EU cause in Pontypridd on Monday.
But UKIP Wales' Nathan Gill said there is a growing trend towards Leave that "hasn't changed".
Campaigning for Thursday's referendum had been put on hold for more than two days following the killing of Labour MP Jo Cox.
Lord Murphy joined another former Welsh Secretary, Lord Hain, and past and present First Ministers Rhodri Morgan and Carwyn Jones on the streets of Pontypridd amid claims that undecided voters in the south Wales valleys were leaning towards Brexit.
"The campaign has been difficult," Lord Murphy admitted.
"There's no question about that, particularly in the south Wales valleys seats where there has been quite a support for Leave."
However, he claimed there was "a definite change in mood" and "a trend towards Remain".
"Because people are starting to think that the big decision day is coming on Thursday, they have to make their mind up, and as a consequence of that they're thinking carefully now," he said.
Lord Murphy said voters were not just considering immigration, "which clearly has been an issue, but also about the economic factors that could actually affect their communities and their selves".
However, UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill claimed momentum was with the Leave side, and denied any change of mood following the death of Ms Cox.
"In recent weeks we have seen a growing trend towards a vote to leave the EU, and that doesn't appear to have changed in light of the tragic events of last week," he said.
"As we approach polling day I am sensing a shift in mood, particularly on economic issues, and I believe that voters have grown wary of the shock and awe tactics deployed by Remain campaigners.
"This is also a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put power back in the hands of locally accountable lawmakers - not unelected Eurocrats.
"That's a positive message that continues to resonate, even in areas viewed as being most in favour of remaining in the EU."
