[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrenpoint Town could move off the foot of the table for the first time this season with victory over Carrick Rangers at Seaview on Friday night.

A seven-game unbeaten run, which ended with a 1-0 loss at Dungannon on Monday, has helped Warrenpoint close to within a point of their opponents.
Carrick have two games in hand but Warrenpoint manager Barry Gray hopes they can put the pressure on.
"Psychologically it would be massive if we could go ahead of them," said Gray.
"Games in hand are one thing, but I'd rather have points on the board and even if we could get off the bottom of the table for a week or two, or a game or two, it would give everyone a massive lift."
Warrenpoint defender Liam Bagnall is available after a two-game suspension to face Carrick, who were 1-0 winners over Crumlin Star in Monday's Irish Cup sixth round tie.
Despite seeing their unbeaten streak come to an end with a 1-0 defeat to Dungannon Swifts, Gray is happy with how his team played.
"It wasn't a setback because we performed quite well," he said.
