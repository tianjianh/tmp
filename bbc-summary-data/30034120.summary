Russell Brand 'worst political celebrity'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russell Brand is the celebrity seen as having the most "negative influence" on political debate, according to a YouGov poll of 2,000 people.

The comedian - who's recently thrown himself into political activism - was viewed "negatively" by 46% of those polled.
However, 13% valued his contribution - a higher figure than George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio or Bono.
The St Trinian's star has been energetically spreading his message.
He's appeared on Newsnight, sparring with both Jeremy Paxman and Evan Davis. He also joined social housing protests in London, as well as the anti-austerity Million Mask March in London on 5 November.
Brand's latest book, Revolution, explains his ideas about the economy, inequality and democracy. Buzzfeed asked an expert on politics, Professor Chandran Kukathas, to look at some of those theories.
"I'm sure Mr Brand's heart is in the right place. I'm now less confident about his head," said the professor. "That is a pity, because artists can do more than entertain if they are genuinely thoughtful."
Most recently Brand was mocked on social media for sounding like Phil Daniels from Blur's 1994 hit, Parklife.
He later released his own version of the song, tackling income inequality, corporations not paying taxes and the "ineffective media".
In it he hit back at his critics, speak-singing: "You can't be polysyllabic or talk about important things unless you went to school in a top hat and tails... Eton!"
The YouGov poll, which surveyed 2,143 UK adults between 10 and 11 November, saw Angelina Jolie and Bob Geldof rank top in terms of "positive" political influence.
Full plans for Band Aid 30 were announced on 10 November, with One Direction, Ed Sheeran and Emeli Sande collaborating with Geldof for the fourth version of Do They Know its Christmas? All money raised will go to combat the Ebola crisis in west Africa.
Angelina Jolie is a special envoy for refugee issues for the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). She also co-chaired the End Sexual Violence in Conflict global summit earlier this year.
