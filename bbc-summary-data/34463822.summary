Scottish property market activity 'picking up'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
House sales picked up across Scotland last month following a "modest" rise in the number of properties coming on to the market, according to a report.

Agreed sales rose throughout Scotland in September, with 32% more chartered surveyors reporting an increase.
Scotland posted one of the sharpest rises in activity in the UK last month as the British market saw sales growth hit a 16-month high.
The report was compiled by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Its latest UK residential market survey suggested the stronger sales trend was broadly reflective of an upturn in demand, which has been visible in the Scottish market for much of the year.
The number of new buyer inquiries rose in September, with 23% more chartered surveyors reporting a rise in demand.
In addition to activity picking up, September also saw a net balance of 16% more respondents in Scotland reporting an increase in properties being put on the market.
However, the survey indicated supply was still falling behind demand and Scottish house prices continued to rise.
Sarah Speirs, director of Rics in Scotland, said: "Activity is now picking up which is encouraging and we are seeing slight improvements in stock coming on to the market, although this is still falling short of demand.
"Against this backdrop, we expect prices to move higher over the coming months."
