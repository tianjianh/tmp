It's been the five live semi-finals this week and, for the first time in the show's history, the judges didn't have the power to vote!
The grand final is on Saturday night. It was moved from Sunday, so it wouldn't clash with Ariana Grande's Manchester benefit concert.
Let's take a look at the finalists...
Comedian Daliso Chaponda made judge Amanda Holden laugh so much in his first audition that she just had to press the Golden Buzzer.
He's had a standing ovation from the judges and Simon Cowell thinks he's one of the funniest people BGT's ever had on!
The choir is formed of friends and families who have experienced someone they love going missing, as well as staff and volunteers from the Missing People charity.
In the semi-final the choir gave an emotional rendition of the song Wings, with pictures of those missing on the screen.
There wasn't a dry eye in the house as the choir delivered their message of hope.
The Pensionalities are Henry, 84, and Malcolm, 75. They come from Doncaster.
The friends have been singing together for the past five years, and say they've never had a cross word with each other!
The duo sang a big band version of One Direction's History in their semi-final - and topped the public vote.
After their performance, they joked to Ant and Dec that they had all this to come. Henry advised them: "Keep your good looks as long as you can - like we have!"
Dance act MerseyGirls have gone through after coming second in the fourth semi-final.
They're all aged 14-17 and are best friends who've grown up together.
Julia has a condition called scoliosis, which means her spine is curved. She needs surgery and she's worried she may not be able to dance afterwards.
But their audition impressed Alesha Dixon so much, she pressed her golden buzzer for them!
Thirty-two-year-old pianist Tokio received the most votes from the public in semi-final three.
He said he'd like to work with singer Sarah Ikumu, who was Simon Cowell's golden buzzer act, in the future.
He's previously supported artists like Kanye West.
Look out for some different song choices from Tokio in the final.
Nine-year-old Ned is known for making quite harsh jokes!
He says the easiest judge to think of jokes about is Amanda Holden.
Ned's been trying to make people laugh since he was six years old.
Eight-year-old magician Issy got the most votes from the public in the second semi-final.
She sometimes practises on her grandpa, who's a professional magician.
Issy says she's going to get her brother involved in her final performance.
We can't wait to see what she's got up her sleeve!
Magician Matt is 34 years old and from Suffolk.
He got the golden buzzer from Ant and Dec, which took him straight to the live semi-finals.
Matt performs at places like holiday camps, and has previously worked with last year's BGT winner Richard Jones and Brendan Sheerin from Coach Trip.
Fifteen-year-old Kyle from Sheffield auditioned for Britain's Got Talent three years ago and was rejected by judge David Walliams.
Kyle got some singing lessons and, this time, David used the last golden buzzer of the series to send him straight through to the semi-finals.
The judges and audience gave him a standing ovation after his latest performance of Adele's When We Were Young.
He says he thinks he'll sing Christina Perri's A Thousand Years in the final.
The magic double act DNA are made up of friends Andrew, aged 43, and Darren, aged 29, from Essex.
They worked as solo magicians before getting together.
In their audition act, they appeared to work out exactly what Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell were thinking!
After the semi-finals are over, judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams will be able to pick one more act to send through as a wildcard!
