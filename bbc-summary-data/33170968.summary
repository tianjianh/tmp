[SN]TITLE[SN]
American bulldog breeder Stephen Potts admits pet attack responsibility

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A breeder of American bulldogs who lost an arm after one of his pets attacked him has admitted responsibility for his animals mauling another dog walker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Potts had denied seven charges relating to the attack on Lindsay Edwards and his dog Zuma in October.
But on the second day of a Durham Crown Court trial, Potts, 48, of Low Pittington, admitted six reviewed counts.
Mr Edwards, 63, was bitten on his calf and head, and Zuma "heavily mauled".
Potts had denied seven charges of owning dangerously out of control dogs - but has now pleaded guilty to six lesser charges of being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control in a public place.
Potts' friend Patricia Ayre, 66, from Sedgefield, has been acquitted on all counts.
The attack happened three weeks after Potts was attacked by two of his own dogs and as a result his right arm had to be amputated.
Those animals were later destroyed.
Potts is due to be sentenced next month.
