I got backstage at Miley Cyrus' show dressed as a cleaner

You're probably imagining mingling with celebrities, free food and drink and generally being treated like an A-lister.
What about wearing a hi-vis jacket, work boots and pushing a wheelie bin with your clothes in it?
Well, that's the length Australian fan Anthony Skinner went to to get close to the Wrecking Ball singer.
The 23-year-old club promoter told Newsbeat he went to the loading bay of Sydney's All Phones Arena after the concert had finished.
He said it was "crazy" and "was just filled with fans".
"Then I thought 'I wonder if you can see something from a different angle'," he added.
Anthony then went to the arena's car park where he noticed the cleaner's storeroom had been left open.
"I looked around and on the floor there's a pair of boots, and on the couch there's this hi-vis vest.
"My mindset was 'See how far you can take this'. It wasn't planned at all. Everything just fell into place so perfectly."
He put his belongings in a wheelie bin, which he then pushed back down the ramp in the loading bay, walking past security who Anthony claimed "didn't even look at me".
"I had that realisation that I was in. I just thought 'Play this cool, play this cool'," he said.
"It was such tight security, they weren't letting anyone in and they let me in because I was pushing a bin."
Anthony said he saw "50 to 100 staff" deconstructing the stage before heading for the venue's green room.
"There was music blaring from there, I could hear it down the end of the hallway.
He said he saw Miley Cyrus' support DJs, The Faders, and other celebrities including comedian Chris Lilley outside the room so waited outside.
"I just started emptying bins, sweeping up the floor and stuff. I'm cleaning up for about 40 minutes to an hour. Not pretending to clean up, actually cleaning."
Eventually, a security guard told Anthony to stand in the doorway of the dressing room opposite the green room as they "surrounded" Miley so she could leave.
"My whole brain just emptied. I saw her and froze. All I could get out was 'Hey'. She looked at me, smiled and just kept walking."
"If I did actually meet her I wouldn't have anything left to do. I'd have to come up with a whole new goal."
Earlier on, Anthony told a member of Miley's team he was a fashion designer and gave them "pretty much my favourite jacket of all time", who assured him he'd pass it on to the 21-year-old.
"I wrote this letter. I was going to hand it to her if I got close enough during the show. Didn't happen that way."
Despite including his contact details in the note, Anthony is yet to hear from the singer.
"I probably wouldn't call me," he said.
Following the show, the venue sent out an automated feedback survey, which Anthony was happy to fill in.
Listing the questions on the form, he laughed: "Ease of access? Very satisfied. Overall cleanliness? Very satisfied, I did half of it myself.
"Security and safety precautions during the event? Very satisfied as well."
He said he hasn't been contacted directly by All Phones arena. Newsbeat has contacted the venue but they are yet to respond.
