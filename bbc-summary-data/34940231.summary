Black Friday shoppers 'move online'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was little sign of a Black Friday shopping frenzy on the high streets after Scots appeared to turn to the internet for bargains.

Online data specialist PCA Predict said e-commerce activity surged north of the border, particularly in the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas.
Many Scottish stores had opened their doors early on Black Friday in order to draw in bargain hunters.
But reports indicated that fewer people turned up than expected.
Black Friday is a US tradition in which goods are discounted following the Thanksgiving holiday.
It has become increasingly popular in the UK.
PCA Predict chief technical officer Jamie Turner said: "In Scotland there has been up to four times as much (e-commerce) traffic as we would normally see, so the Scots are really keen for a bargain."
Mr Turner added that at one point, Scottish towns and cities accounted for the top ten spending hotspots in the UK.
On the high streets, patient customers and minimal queuing contrasted with scenes of chaos seen in some Scottish shops on the same day last year.
About 60 bargain hunters, some in pyjamas and dressing gowns, queued for more than an hour at Tesco Extra in Silverburn, Glasgow, which had closed between midnight and 05:00 in preparation for Black Friday.
Staff gave out tickets on arrival and only allowed 10 people in at a time to avoid any disturbances.
In 2014 hundreds of shoppers descended on the same store, which had to be closed amid chaotic scenes.
Glasgow shopping centre Intu Braehead reported "plenty of customers coming out in the wee small hours", after its Game store opened at midnight.
By mid-afternoon, there had been no reports of disturbances at any major Scottish stores.
Police Scotland had issued a warning to shoppers about anti-social behaviour, after minor incidents of disorder were reported in some stores during last year's sales.
In a statement, police said: "By all means grab a bargain, just don't grab each other."
Representatives of Scotland's retailers had said appropriate security measures would be put in place to ensure the safety and security of staff and customers.
