The Death Row Records founder, accompanied by his lawyer, handed himself into police on Friday morning.
He was arrested on suspicion of murder after his pick-up truck hit two men, leaving one of them dead, on Thursday.
He is being held in West Hollywood on bail of $2m (Â£1.3m). His lawyer claims it was an accident and that Knight is an "innocent victim".
James Blatt added that he will get to see the video footage in the next 24 hours.
Suge Knight's friend, Terry Carter, 55,  was killed and Cle "Bone" Sloan, 51, injured.
Sheriff spokeswoman Nicole Nishida confirmed police had seen the video but "they have made no such arrangements with the attorney".
Suge Knight, whose real name is Marion Hugh Knight Jr, is due in court on Tuesday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
Mr Blatt seemed to confirm Knight had been driving at the time, but claimed it was an accident and that he was running away from attackers.
"He was in the process of being physically assaulted by two men and in an effort to escape he unfortunately hit two (other) individuals," Blatt said.
"He was in his car trying to escape."
Knight founded Death Row Records in the 1990s, but later declared bankruptcy and the company was sold at auction.
He helped launch the careers of artists including Dr Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg.
Last August he was shot six times at a nightclub in Los Angeles. No arrests have ever been made.
In November, he pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in Beverly Hills.
He could face up to 30 years in prison because of previous convictions.
The music boss has previously been convicted of armed robbery and assault with a gun.
He has also served time for violating probation.
