Eagles vs Drones: The birds who grab drones from the sky

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dutch police are training eagles to grab illegal drones out of the sky.

In this video (which is in Dutch) an eagle is seen swooping towards a hovering drone, grabbing hold of the machine with its talons and flying off.
The birds are taught to treat the drones as if they were a small animal they would hunt to eat.
"The bird sees the drone as prey and takes it to a safe area, a place where he does not suffer from other birds or humans," says a statement from the police.
The Dutch National Police force says it's trying to limit how often members of the public are using drones.
Drones have been a big problem, sometimes they are flown too close to aeroplanes.
Obviously there's the chance that an eagle could get hurt by the blades on a drone.
That's why the police are apparently looking into some sort of protective clothing for the birds.
