[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adrian Greenwood, 42, was discovered in the hallway of his four-storey house on Thursday. He had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and neck.
Michael Danaher, of Hadrians Court, Peterborough, appeared at Banbury Magistrates' Court earlier.
The 50-year-old was remanded in custody and will appear at Oxford Crown Court on Friday.
A 26-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder on Thursday was released without charge.
Mr Greenwood was an Oxford graduate who had written two historical biographies and traded rare and antiquarian books as well as art.
In 2011, he spoke to the BBC ahead of an auction of Banksy artworks in Oxford, where he sold a locked 1970s safe stencilled by the artist.
Mr Greenwood was also in the news in 2010 when his limited first edition of a Harry Potter book was stolen from an art gallery in Woodstock.
