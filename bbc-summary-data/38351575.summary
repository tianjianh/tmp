Durham fast bowler Wood is working on his fitness after three ankle operations in the past 12 months.
Durham's Keaton Jennings will captain the North, while Hampshire's James Vince will skipper the South.
England selector James Whitaker says the series is "a platform for players to make an impression".
"We see it as an important addition to our selection process in 50-over cricket, ahead of the two major global events we are staging over the next three summers - the Champions Trophy next year, and the World Cup in 2019," Whitaker said.
Wood impressed for England during the ODI series with Pakistan at the end of the summer, but Finn has not featured for his country in limited-overs cricket since September 2015.
Jennings was a late call-up to the England Test squad in India this winter, while Vince played in the ODI series in Bangladesh in October.
Ben Duckett, who made his senior England debut in both Test and ODI cricket against Bangladesh this winter, Liam Dawson, Tim Bresnan and Harry Gurney are the other England players named in the two 13-man squads.
Four members of each squad won their places through the Professional Cricketers' Association's Most Valuable Player ranking system, with the remaining squad members picked by selectors.
England assistant coach Paul Farbrace will coach the South, while England bowling coach Ottis Gibson is in charge of the North.
The first two games of the three-match series take place at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on 17 and 19 March, while the Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi will host the third game on 21 March.
