A goal from police officer Lee Casciaro in Tuesday's Champions League qualifier condemned Celtic to arguably their worst ever defeat.
The Imps also included a fireman, a customs officer and a taxi driver.
"I'm not really [shocked]. I know these results can happen," said Rodgers.
"We stay calm. We need a performance next week."
Celtic will welcome the champions of Gibraltar to Glasgow next Wednesday for the second leg of their second qualifying round tie.
Rodgers feels he saw enough from the Scottish champions to believe they will still get through.
"We dominated and had enough chances, but sometimes it can happen like that... one ball up the pitch and they're in," said the former Liverpool manager.
"You let the local team have their night, we press on, another week's training and be better for it.
"We've given ourselves a bit of work to do, but there's no panic. It's a two-legged affair and our objective is to get through."
Rodgers said fans should stay calm, adding: "I always felt this qualification phase would be based on the second legs at home and we'll need their support."
Before the match, Lincoln Red Imps captain Roy Chipolina claimed beating Celtic - who won the European Cup in 1967 - would be European football's biggest shock.
The customs officer saw no reason to revise that option in the aftermath.
"When you look at the history of both clubs, nothing has changed," he said.
"Celtic are still a massive club and they are still favourites in the tie, but I don't think anyone expected us to be going over to Glasgow with a 1-0 lead.
"We will be going over there more confident than we thought and, if miracles can happen again, we will knock Celtic out of the Champions League."
Goalscorer Lee Casciaro, said his side benefited from the artificial pitch, weather conditions and that they have been training for almost two months.
"The manager set us up to get them on the counter attack. It was really, really a dream for us, to score and win 1-0 against the mighty Celtic.
"Just walking out and have Celtic supporters singing You'll Never Walk Alone, and it's a historic pitch, we have to enjoy ourselves this doesn't happen very often for us. We've only been in Uefa last three years."
Liam McLeod, BBC Scotland commentator
"Celtic's reputation has taken a battering. One of their worst results ever? I would say it's the worst result ever. This has probably superseded anything that has gone before. It is that bad for the club, it's that bad for this team and I think Brendan Rodgers realises the size of the task he now has here.
"It's inexplicable to think that Celtic are having to come back from a deficit in the second leg of a Champions League qualifier against a side from the overseas British territory of Gibraltar. It's quite incredible."
Speaking to the Gibraltar Chronicle before the game, Lincoln captain Chipolina, a customs officer, said it was hard to have a full-time job and play football.
"We have found it very difficult - all of us have our day jobs," Lincoln director Ian Payas told the paper. "If we would have had an away game it would have been easier for us."
Naturally, social media users had plenty of fun, with a spoof profile of Lincoln Red Imps doing the rounds claiming the club had "an average home crowd of 28".
It was also pointed out the population of Gibraltar is 30,000 - Celtic Park holds 60,832 people.
