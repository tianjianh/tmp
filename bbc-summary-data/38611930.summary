[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saturday night's Dr McKenna Cup game between Tyrone and Ulster University has been postponed and will now be played on Sunday in Carrickmore.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Healy Park was covered by snow on Friday and a decision to put back the Section C match was taken following a pitch inspection on Saturday morning.
The game will be played on Sunday at Carrickmore, with a 14:00 GMT throw-in.
Mickey Harte has made seven changes for the game with Justin McMahon, Cathal McCarron and Colm McCavanagh included.
Mickey O'Neill replaces Niall Morgan in goal, while Padraig Hampsey, McMahon and McCarron come into the defence.
Cavanagh is named at midfield, and up front, Niall McKenna and Ronan McHugh, who makes his first start, are called up.
Mattie Donnelly is ruled out by suspension, while Connor McAliskey is out for the rest of the season, and injury also prevents Rory Brennan, Michael Cassidy and Ronan O'Neill from playing.
Holders Tyrone must win to keep alive their chances of reaching the semi-finals.
The Red Hands began their bid for a sixth straight success in the competition with a disappointing four-point defeat by Cavan last weekend.
UUJ beat Donegal in their opener and a victory at Healy Park would leave them well placed to top the group.
Tyrone have not been knocked out before the semi-final stage since 2008.
Harte's side may also need other results to go their way if they are to progress to the last four of the season-opening tournament.
Midfielder Niall McKeever is rated "very doubtful" for Martin McHugh's Ulster University side after suffering an ankle knock against Tyrone.
The students are also expected to be without Frank Burns, who scored 0-4 after replacing McKeever on Sunday.
Sunday's Section A games see Down and Derry hope to build on their opening day wins when they clash at Pairc Esler, while Armagh and Queen's chase their first points at the Athletic Grounds.
In Section B, Antrim play Monaghan at Corrigan Park and St Mary's face Fermanagh at Brewster Park.
Donegal play Cavan in the remaining Section C fixture at Ballybofey.
Tyrone: M O'Neill, P Hampsey, J McMahon, C McCarron, R McNabb, T McCann, J Munrroe, C Cavanagh, P McNulty, P Harte, N Sludden, C McCullagh, L Brennan, N McKenna, R McHugh.
