The engineering giant said 187 posts would be lost from its Inchinnan plant in Renfrewshire and a further 31 jobs from its facility in East Kilbride.
The cuts are the latest in a wave of redundancies at Rolls-Royce plants in Scotland, as part of restructuring.
In November, Rolls-Royce said it planned to shed 2,600 jobs worldwide over a period of 18 months.
Staff were informed of the latest planned job losses on Thursday.
Rolls-Royce currently employs about 700 people at its Inchinnan manufacturing facility and about 630 at East Kilbride.
The company has already announced plans to transfer East Kilbride employees to Inchinnan by the end of 2015.
A Rolls-Royce spokeswoman said: "In November last year we announced a restructuring of our Aerospace division as part of an intensified programme to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost across the group.
"As part of that process we continually review current workload and assess future customer demand to remain competitive.
"We have identified a requirement to reduce the headcount at our Inchinnan manufacturing facilities by approximately 90 during 2015 and 97 during 2016.
"We have also identified a requirement to reduce the headcount at our East Kilbride facility by 31 during 2015.
She added: "It is never an easy decision to propose reductions in our workforce and we will look to meet this requirement by voluntary means wherever possible.
"We will also explore all mitigation including redeployment to other sites and are offering full support to employees who are impacted by the changes."
