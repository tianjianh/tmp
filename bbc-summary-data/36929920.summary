Rochdale 2-3 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A howler from Rochdale goalkeeper Josh Lillis handed Peterborough a 3-2 victory late on at the Crown Oil Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lillis made a hash of collecting Paul Taylor's cross in the 89th minute, spilling the ball and allowing substitute Gwion Edwards to head home.
Rochdale took the lead twice in the first half only for Peterborough to peg them back.
Andy Cannon volleyed the opener eight minutes in, firing through a crowded penalty area to beat Ben Alnwick in the Posh goal.
Shaquile Coulthirst threatened the Dale goal on a couple of occasions before Marcus Maddison raced onto Hayden White's pass down the right flank and fired wide of Lillis for the equaliser.
Dale were back in front in the 31st minute when Jermaine Anderson clipped Joe Rafferty's heels and Ian Henderson slammed the resulting spot-kick straight down the middle of Alnwick's goal.
But the visitors were quick to restore parity, Chris Forrester blasting a fierce drive past Lillis from 25 yards.
After an evenly contested second period Posh won it late when Lillis spilled Taylor's cross and Edwards headed into the unguarded net.
