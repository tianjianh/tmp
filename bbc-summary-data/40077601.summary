Solihull Moors have made their third signing in as many days by bringing in versatile full-back Kalern Thomas from Boston United.

Thomas, 23, moves up a level, having joined the National League club from Lincolnshire side Boston who play in National League North.
He follows the arrival of strikers Luke Benbow and Chris Lait from Stourbridge.
Leicester-based former Corby Town player Thomas is capable of operating in either full-back role.
Solihull finished 16th last season in their first season at fifth-tier level, while Boston came 15th in National League North.
