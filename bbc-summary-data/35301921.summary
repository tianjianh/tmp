Subah Amini, from the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association, was one of 350 volunteers who helped in Cumbria and Yorkshire.
Mr Amini spent 10 months in hospital in London, Wakefield and China after the fall in 2014.
He said he was "thankful to God" that he was alive and had decided to devote his life to helping others.
Volunteers went from Cumbria to Yorkshire, driving people around, organising sandbags and offering emotional support and motivation, Mr Amini said.
"It brought the community together and for us, it made us feel more part of Christmas than we have ever before."
Parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire were hit by flooding on 26 December.
