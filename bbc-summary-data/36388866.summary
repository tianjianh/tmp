An archive of historical images of Ipswich docks, including one of the oldest photographs of the town, is being put online.

One of the photos dates from 1846 and is part of a collection compiled by the Ipswich Maritime Trust (IMT).
Stuart Grimwade, director of the IMT, said: "The wet docks were completed in 1842, which coincides with the birth of photography in the late 1830s.
"Ipswich is extremely fortunate to be on of some of the earliest photos."
A photograph of the Old Custom House was taken by local chemist and pioneering photographer John Wiggin.
It can be dated to 1846 because the clock had not yet been added to the clock tower.
Mr Grimwade said: "The Fox-Talbot National Museum of Photography in Wiltshire confirm it is the oldest photograph from a wax-paper negative to survive as well as being the one of the oldest photographs of Suffolk."
The archive project began in 2000 and has involved digitising postcards and printed photos.
Some of the photos will feature on hoardings around the waterfront area as part of the PhotoEast festival, while Mr Grimwade is giving a talk on the subject on Saturday morning at University Campus Suffolk.
"It's a fascinating archive and the trust's aim is to go on collecting as many images we can find and the online archive will help people see what we've already got," he said.
