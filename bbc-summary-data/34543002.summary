Howe, 37, has overseen three of the club's six promotions since he was first appointed manager in 2008-09.
The new deal is believed to take Howe through until 2020. He had two-and-a-half years left on his previous contract with the Cherries.
"We've been in discussions since gaining promotion. I'm very pleased to have committed my future to here," he told the club's website.
Following a short spell as manager of Burnley, Howe returned to manage the club at the end of 2012, leading them to promotions from League One and the Championship within three seasons.
"I'm delighted Eddie has committed his future to the club," owner Maxim Demin said.
