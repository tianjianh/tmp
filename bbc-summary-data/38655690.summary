Stable-mates Lewis and Harris are named after neighbouring islands in the Western Isles.
Harris, whose name was chosen by the public in an online vote last week, has been joined this week at Police Scotland's mounted unit by Lewis.
The force described Lewis as "lovely and quiet" and also its smallest horse at about 16.2 hands high.
