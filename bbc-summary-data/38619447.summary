[SN]TITLE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town 1-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Freddie Ladapo was Shrewsbury's match-winner for the second successive game as his goal proved enough to beat fellow League One strugglers Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The on-loan Crystal Palace striker - who spent the first half of the season on loan at Oldham - headed home from close range midway through the second half to lift Shrewsbury out of the relegation zone.
Shrewsbury made much of the early running, with Joe Riley volleying Gary Deegan's corner over the bar and Alex Rodman also trying his luck with an effort for the hosts which was too high.
Shrewsbury thought they had made the breakthrough after 31 minutes when Ladapo turned in a cross from the right from Shaun Whalley, but the home side's joy was cut short when the effort was eventually disallowed by referee Mark Haywood.
Deegan's 25-yard drive was then held by visiting keeper Connor Ripley before Whalley drilled a shot from the edge of the penalty area narrowly over.
Oldham found first-half chances in short supply, although Ryan Flynn did see an early run end with an effort which was blocked.
The Latics had a fine chance just past the hour but Billy McKay hooked narrowly wide from close range from Aaron Amadi-Holloway's knockdown.
Shrewsbury grabbed the winner in the 68th minute when Ladapo looped in a header from close range after impressive defender Aristote Nsiala headed on a Riley corner.
