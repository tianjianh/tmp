[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teaching union has promised another 11 days of strike action in its protest over schedule changes made by a school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) have walked out of Alfreton Grange Arts College in Derbyshire for the last five days.
The school's interim management decided to change the school day from five periods to nine this term.
Alfreton Grange, which has spent the last two years in special measures, is still rated as "inadequate" by Ofsted.
The Torch Academy Trust were asked to take interim control earlier this year in a bid to improve standards before it becomes a sponsored academy.
It said the the new timetable was designed to provide more pupil support time in order to secure higher achievement".
But Nick Raine, from NUT Midlands, believes the changes are actually damaging pupils' education.
"We're facing crisis in terms of pupils leaving and parents withdrawing them," he said.
Some parents said they supported the strike.
"The way it's running with the nine lessons, it's too much for the children," said Christine Gdula.
"They are not having time to get into their lesson, take their coats off, settle down before the lesson's finished. "
