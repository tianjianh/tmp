Notts County: League Two side face HMRC winding-up petition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County are to face their second winding-up petition of the year brought by HM Revenue and Customs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case against the League Two side is to be heard on 19 December, having had a separate order dismissed in May.
Notts, who are 15th in the fourth tier after 18 games, were also put under a temporary transfer embargo in May for money owed to football creditors.
The club, which was put up for sale by owner Ray Trew in February, declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.
Trew met potential buyers from the United States and China in March and, with no deal struck, he later approached local businessman Alan Hardy about a potential takeover in October.
