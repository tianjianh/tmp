Welshman Hughes played 531 top flight games with Manchester United, Chelsea and Southampton.
Wednesday's league game is his 400th as a Premier League manager.
"It's a good thing to stick around for so long is a good thing - some would say it's a bad thing," joked Hughes, who also managed Wales.
"You don't stick around this long at this level unless you understand what's required and what it takes to win games at this level and I think I've proved that over a long period now.
"It's great the support I get from everyone I've been involved with, not least the close coaching group I've got here and the support I've had since I've come here (Stoke).
"That's really vital if you want to be successful as a Premier League manager."
Hughes has also had spells in charge of Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers.
The other men who have played and managed in 400 top-flight games are Bobby Robson, Joe Mercer, Joe Smith and Clem Stephenson.
