Tom Brady returned from the 'deflate-gate' scandal to lead defending champions New England Patriots to a 28-21 win over Pittsburgh Steelers.

The 38-year-old led his team onto the field before throwing four touchdown passes in the season-opening game.
Brady had a four-game NFL ban - imposed after he was alleged to have colluded in the deflation of match balls - overturned by a judge last week.
"It was a pretty special night so I was excited," said quarterback Brady.
"It is always fun getting out there and getting the opportunity to play and we took advantage of it. It was a good win."
The NFL had banned Brady after investigating claims the Patriots had deflated balls to gain an advantage in January's 45-7 play-off victory over Indianapolis Colts.
That decision was last week overturned by US District Judge Richard M. Berman, who found "several significant legal deficiencies".
