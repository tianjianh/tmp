[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rowallane credit union placed into liquidation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Down credit union with around 700 members has been placed into liquidation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All the savers in Rowallane credit union will get their money back under the government's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).
The credit union, which was based in Saintfield Orange Hall, holds savings of around £1.4m.
The FSCS said the overwhelming majority of savers will get their money back within seven days.
People with less than £1,000 saved will receive a letter to get cash over the counter at the post office.
Anyone with savings of more than £1,000 will receive a cheque.
FSCS's head of communications, Mark Oakes, said: "FSCS protects people when authorised financial services firms cease trading.
"So I'm pleased to confirm FSCS payments have now been made to members of Rowallane credit union. It is good news for those members."
The last published accounts for the credit union for 2014 show that it made a £133,000 loan to the Rowallane Community Hub in contravention of rules laid down by the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA).
Under the rules a credit union is only allowed to lend money to its members or to other credit unions.
The accounts add that no information was available about the ability of Rowallane Community Hub to repay £120,000 of the loan balance.
As a result, the auditors said the credit union had not maintained "a satisfactory system of control over transactions".
