Crystal Palace 4-1 Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crystal Palace inflicted further misery on the Premier League's bottom side Stoke City with a thumping home win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Palace were 2-0 up inside 12 minutes thanks to goals at set pieces from defenders James Tomkins and Scott Dann.
Stoke improved after the break but nearly went 3-0 down when Bojan Krkic cleared a Dann header off the line.
James McArthur's deflected strike was followed by a fine Andros Townsend goal before Marko Arnautovic scored a consolation with the game's final play.
Townsend's first goal for the Eagles came from a super low shot after he drove at the Stoke defence and cut the ball on to his right foot.

This is the third time this season that Stoke have conceded four goals.
Since goalkeeper Jack Butland suffered an ankle injury in England's friendly win over Germany in March, Stoke have failed to record a single clean sheet in the Premier League.
Worse than that, the Potters have won just one of the 12 league games the former Birmingham man has missed.
Their hopes of collecting a first Premier League win of the season on Sunday were all but over inside 15 minutes at Selhurst Park.
First Tomkins bundled in from a matter of inches out after Jonathan Walters flicked Andros Townsend's free-kick towards his own goal.
Then, just two minutes and 14 seconds later, it was 2-0 when Dann attacked Jason Puncheon's corner with real intent and headed home his second league goal of the season.
There was little veteran keeper Shay Given could do about any of the four goals but the 40-year-old has now conceded 26 times in his 10 Premier League appearances for the Potters.
A setback in his recovery means Butland could now be out until November, and if Stoke's poor run of form has not improved by then, manager Mark Hughes could find his tenure at the Britannia Stadium under increasing threat.
Townsend's excellent individual strike capped an impressive performance by the England international.
The former Tottenham man also claimed an assist and the visitors had no answers to his direct running.
A petulant challenge by Arnautovic - the Austrian barging into Townsend after he had crossed the ball - led to the Eagles' third, when Jason Puncheon's free-kick found its way to McArthur, who scored via heavy deflection off Geoff Cameron.
Townsend, wing partner Wilfried Zaha and Puncheon all enjoyed a profitable afternoon as they exploited Stoke with their quick passing and movement.
It was a tough day for all of Stoke's players after the concession of two early goals.
The shell-shocked visitors looked desperately disjointed as they tried to play their way back into the match.
New signing Wilfried Bony played as a lone front man for much of the game but received very little support from his team-mates and failed to hold the ball up when it did come his way.
The Manchester City loanee's day was summed up when he slipped after Mame Biram Diouf's low cross left him with a straightforward opportunity.
Bony was not the only Stoke forward to look off-colour, with Jonathan Walters miscuing in front of goal and Arnautovic cutting a frustrated figure throughout before scoring with a well-placed 20-yarder with the last kick of the game.
With his side looking so frail defensively, manager Hughes desperately needs his strikers to find some scoring form.

Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew told Sky Sports: "We looked solid, we are a powerful team and we looked like that today, and it was that power that won us the game.
"I thought Andros was sensational, he's been threatening to do that and I hope Big Sam [Allardyce, England manager] was watching because he was outstanding.
"I thought it was a solid performance, it was a shame they scored because they didn't deserve that."
Stoke boss Mark Hughes: "The start didn't help our situation, it has been happening in almost every game. We're too open and teams capitalise on that. We are not giving ourselves a chance to win Premier League games.
"It's key we stay in games - at the moment we are just chasing games too much.
"This is not the start we expected, it's a case of getting together and what we are doing, the game plan needs to be at a better level. The dressing room is full of good talent, but that talent needs to ally it to sensible play, which we're not doing."
Palace face a trip to Southampton in the EFL Cup on Wednesday, while Stoke also have Premier League opposition in the Cup, hosting Hull.
The Eagles are back on the road on Saturday with a visit to Sunderland and Stoke will be looking for a first three points against West Brom at the Britannia on the same day.
