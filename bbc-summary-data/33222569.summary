All-night weekend services are set to begin on 12 September on sections of the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines.
However, the union Aslef has already announced its members will strike for 24 hours on 8 July from 21:30 BST over pay and conditions for the service.
District organiser Finn Brennan said drivers would have to work unlimited night shifts for no extra pay.
'It's easy enough to produce a map, but if London Underground management want to have an all-night service in September, then they need to sit down and negotiate a fair deal for the staff they expect to provide it," he said.
2015 Night Tube services
"Aslef aren't opposed to all-night services but they have to be introduced in a way that is fair and protects the work-life balance of the hard working staff."
The RMT and TSSA unions are also balloting their members for industrial action over the same issue.
Gareth Powell, from London Underground, said: "As well as making life easier for people, the night Tube will also boost London's night-time economy - supporting thousands of jobs and stimulating hundreds of millions of pounds in economic growth."
The hope is that all-night services will be extended to the London Overground in 2017 as well as the Metropolitan, Circle, District and Hammersmith and City lines.
A round-the-clock service is planned for the Docklands Light Railway by 2021.
