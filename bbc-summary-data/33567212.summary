Most Powys bus services safe despite £500,000 cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most of the under threat bus services in Powys will be protected despite a £500,000 cut in spending.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Powys council currently spends £2.3m annually, subsidising 27 of the 29 routes in the area.
It held a public consultation over plans to provide just seven or eight services connecting major towns and cities like Abergavenny, Aberystwyth, Cardiff and Swansea.
But the authority has a new plan which will see 22 of the services saved.
