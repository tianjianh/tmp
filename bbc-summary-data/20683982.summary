[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Philip Pullman's novel The Firework-Maker's Daughter is to be turned into an opera for children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five singers and two puppeteers will tell the tale of Lila, a girl who wants to make fireworks like her father.
Pullman, a former teacher, originally wrote the story for a school play and published it in book form in 1995.
The opera will be directed by John Fulljames, associate director of opera at the Royal Opera House, and will receive its premiere in Hull in March.
It will then go on tour, taking in the Royal Opera House in London and the New Victory Theater in New York as well as Huddersfield, Watford, Bury St Edmunds, Buxton, Oxford and Newcastle.
The music will be written by award-winning composer David Bruce, working with librettist Glyn Maxwell.
Opera North's education director Rebecca Walsh said it "promises to be an explosive introduction to opera for families".
Frederic Wake-Walker, artistic director of The Opera Group, said: "The Firework-Maker's Daughter continues The Opera Group's commitment to giving people, and especially young people, their first experience of opera.
"It promises to be a wonderful show full of colour, humour and emotion."
The show will be co-produced by Opera North and The Opera Group in association with the Royal Opera House and Watford Palace Theatre.
