Dundee and Kilmarnock joined holders Ross County as Premiership sides taking an early exit.
Rangers, Hamilton Academical, Partick Thistle, St Johnstone, Greenock Morton also progress as group winners.
Ayr Utd, Queen of the South and Motherwell are through as runners-up, with the two qualifiers from Group C to be decided on Sunday at Tannadice.
Dundee United entertain Dunfermline Athletic needing to win by at least seven goals to oust Inverness Caledonian Thistle from top spot after the Highland side thumped Arbroath 7-0.
The Pars could overtake their hosts and qualify as runners-up with a victory.
Thanks to winning their groups with the highest number of points, Alloa, Morton, Thistle and Rangers will all be seeded in Sunday's draw, which takes place after the game at Tannadice.
Joining them among the seeds are Aberdeen, Celtic, Hearts and Hibernian after Scotland's representatives in European competition received byes into the last 16.
Peterhead pipped East Fife to top place after a thrilling fightback and penalty shoot-out victory away to Dumbarton.
Kevin Dzierzawski had given the League One side an early lead, but the Sons hit back through Robert Thomson, David Smith and, after the break, a penalty from Ryan Stevenson.
However, Leighton McIntosh and Rory McAllister's 69th-minute penalty sent the match into penalties to decide who gained the bonus point.
Peterhead edged it 6-5 on penalties to finish level on points with the Fifers and send their League One rivals out of the competition on goal difference.
It meant that Dundee finished third despite the Premiership side thrashing Forfar Athletic of League Two 7-0 at Dens Park.
St Johnstone's 4-0 win over League Two part-timers Stirling Albion, which meant the Premiership side cruised into the last 16, was overshadowed by an injury to visiting goalkeeper Chris Smith.
He landed awkwardly on his neck handling an 80th-minute Paul Paton corner.
The former St Mirren and Dunfermline Athletic goalkeeper was stretchered off with his neck in a brace.
Stirling, who needed a win themselves to qualify, announced soon after the match on their Twitter account that Smith had been taken to hospital for precautionary checks after being knocked out on the pitch.
The club added that the 30-year-old was conscious and alert and said "the immediate concern of a serious neck injury has dissipated".
Steven Anderson, Steven MacLean and Liam Craig had all scored before the break for Saints and substitute David Wotherspoon added a late fourth.
Meanwhile, Championship outfit Falkirk finished their campaign with a 2-0 win over Brechin City of League One following second-half goals from Luca Gasparotto and Nathan Austin.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle will almost certainly progress as group winners after their 7-0 hammering of League Two visitors Arbroath.
They lead Dundee United by three points and only an unlikely collapse by Dunfermline Athletic at Tannadice on Sunday would allow the Terrors to overhaul the Premiership side on goal difference.
The Pars travel to Tayside one point behind United and will progress as runners-up should they win.
Brian Graham plundered a hat-trick as holders Ross County ended their disappointing campaign with a 7-0 hammering of Highland League champions Cove Rangers.
Alex Schalk's powerful finish was all that separated the sides until Mitch Megginson was sent off for a reckless tackle on the striker.
County added six more after the break, with Graham scored with an angled drive and header either side of Schalk's close-range finish.
A Craig Curran lob and tap-in had County easing to victory before Graham headed another.
Meanwhile, Alloa secured top spot with another impressive victory - their fourth in a row - away to Raith Rovers, the 1-0 defeat meaning the Championship side failed to qualify despite finishing runners-up.
Partick Thistle comfortably progressed to the last 16 with a 100% record after beating League One newcomers Queen's Park 2-0 in the Glasgow derby at Firhill.
Chris Erskine set the Premiership side on their way with a looping header after only seven minutes and then set up Liam Lindsay to seal a commanding victory for the Jags.
Queen of the South joined Thistle in the last 16 after the Championship side beat League One outfit Stenhousemuir thanks to a Jamie Hamill goal 12 minutes from time.
With Rangers having already won the group after playing their four games, Motherwell cruised into the last 16 as runners-up with a convincing 3-0 win away to Stranraer.
The League One side, who started level on points with the Premiership side, created the better chances despite Well dominating the early play and it took until the second half before Chris Cadden's excellent strike broke the deadlock.
Cadden set up Marvin Johnson for the second and Scott McDonald headed the killer third to ensure progress for Mark McGhee's side.
In the group's other game, League Two outfit Annan Athletic secured their first points with a 2-0 win away to Lowland League outfit East Stirlingshire.
Meanwhile, group winners Rangers were suffering in a 3-1 defeat by Burnley in a friendly at Ibrox.
Striker Andre Gray's hat-trick had the visitors on their way to victory before Ben Mee's own goal in a disappointing day for Joey Barton, the midfielder who rejected a new deal with the Clarets to join Rangers after helping them win promotion to the Premier League.
Hamilton Academical edged nervously through as group winners on goal difference after a 2-1 win over Livingston.
Accies finished level on points with Ayr United and St Mirren, with the Paisley side exiting the tournament despite finishing on nine points after a 3-0 win over Edinburgh City.
Alex D'Acol's excellent strike put Accies ahead, but the Premiership side's League One opponents struck back when Sean Crighton's looped over Remi Matthews, struck the crossbar and hit the back of the goalkeeper before going over the line.
However, Louie Longridge fired the ball into the bottom-right corner for the winner.
On-loan pair Lawrence Shankland, the Aberdeen striker, and Tom Walsh, the Rangers midfielder, plus Jack Baird had St Mirren three up before the break at home to SPFL newcomers City.
Jamie Lindsay scored within two minutes of his Morton debut as the Greenock side finished off their fine group campaign by beating Berwick Rangers 2-0 to top the group.
The opener from the 20-year-old, who arrived on loan from Celtic in midweek, was added to after 16 minutes by Jai Quitongo - the 18-year-old winger's second goal in two games.
It meant Morton finished three points ahead of Kilmarnock, with the Premiership side exiting the competition after a disappointing 0-0 draw with Albion Rovers, with the League One side taking the bonus point after a penalty shoot-out.
