The incidents happened on Thursday - the first one near the WH Smiths shop on the town's High Street.
The second theft happened somewhere between the bottom of Bank Street and the back entrance to the Barbour's store on Brewery Street.
Anyone with information has been asked to contact police.
PC Alistair Hope said police were keen to speak to a woman in relation to the thefts.
She was described as in her 30s or 40s, of average height, slender build and well-groomed appearance with brown hair, possibly curly, and dark, tanned skin.
Police said she did not speak good English.
"She was wearing a dark coloured jerkin or fleece, navy/black shoes with white soles and a navy/black handbag which had a silver trim," said PC Hope.
"She was carrying a copper coloured shopping bag.
"At present we are alerting businesses in Dumfries town centre about these thefts, and the presence of this mystery female."
Last month police received reports of an elderly man having had a large sum of cash stolen by a "not dissimilar" female while he sat in his car in Queensberry Street.
