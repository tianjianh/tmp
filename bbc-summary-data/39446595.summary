The man ended up in the water when a car and van collided near Swarkestone in Derbyshire on Wednesday afternoon.
The car plunged into the canal and its driver, described by police as an elderly woman, was pulled to safety by passers-by along with the pedestrian.
Police have not released any further details about the man's injuries but say he is critically ill.
The car driver was treated in hospital for minor injuries and has since been discharged. The van driver was unhurt.
Jane MacArthur, who lives nearby and witnessed the aftermath, said: "There were people running around on mobile phones, calling emergency services.
"There was a car in the canal and a gentleman just dove in and rescued the lady."
No arrests have been made. Police have appealed for witnesses.
