Super League Magic Weekend: Hull FC 0-45 St Helens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Helens thrashed off-colour Hull FC at Magic Weekend to give watching new boss Justin Holbrook a perfect exhibition of their talents.

Alex Walmsley plunged over from close range for the opening score before Ryan Morgan met a towering kick to cross.
Morgan Knowles pounced on a Hull error to make it 19-0 at half-time.
Walmsley's second-half dive was followed by Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook and Tommy Makinson tries, before Regan Grace's double finished the scoring.
Makinson's was particularly special, coming on his 150th Saints appearance.
Saints were being overseen by new head coach Holbrook for the first time and they gave the former Sydney Roosters assistant cause for optimism.
In-form Hull pasted city rivals Hull KR at St James' Park last season but wearing their comic-book inspired strip were more Bruce Banner than Incredible Hulk in 2017.
The in-form Airlie Birds had won their past five games and were roared on by a huge travelling support, but found a James Roby-inspired St Helens too tough to break down.
They lacked rhythm in attack - not even Albert Kelly could give them the necessary spark - as Saints dominated and even kept Hull pointless on a one-sided afternoon.
Holbrook's smile told a story as Grace bundled over, and a new era at Saints began with a blow-out.
St Helens coach Justin Holbrook: "I obviously came in at a good time. The boys were hurting a lot, getting bundled out of the Challenge Cup last week, but all the credit goes to them for putting in a performance like that.
"I've been watching the games across the other side of the world in Australia and I could feel they were frustrated. My job was just to try and take the pressure off them, stop trying so hard which is what they were guilty of last week.
"They're a good bunch of guys, they want success and they were hurting. I just wanted to try and let them let go of all of that and just get back to enjoying it again. They had to work hard which they did; there was some great defence there.
"I was confident that we could clear all that up, there was nothing majorly wrong there, we just had to find our way.
"While it was a great performance we still only get the two points and we're still a fair way off the leading pack so we'll keep performing."
Hull head coach Lee Radford: "We threw jabs and they threw bombs and I think that's probably the best way I can describe it.
"Alex Walmsley looked like Superman out there, we had the Marvel shirts on he should have had the Superman one on.
"We were planning to go top of the table, if only for a short period. That was a good reason to turn up and perform but their reason to perform obviously meant a lot more than that one."
