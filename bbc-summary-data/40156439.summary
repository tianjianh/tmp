Newspaper review: Horror and defiance in face of attacks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One story fills the front covers of all of Monday's papers as the dailies get their first chance to reflect on the latest attacks on London.

Seven members of the public were killed when a van drove into pedestrians on London Bridge, and then its occupants got out and stabbed victims at random.
A photo of the three suspects - after they has been shot dead by police - is the stark image on front of the Daily Mirror and the News Letter.
The Mirror condemns them as "monsters".
It compares the actions of the three suspects with the bravery of unarmed police and members of the public who tried to fight back against the attackers.
The paper reports how a British Transport Police officer was stabbed in the head and leg after he "took on the killers" with only a baton to defend himself from 10-in (25-cm) knives.
"Enough is enough," says the News Letter's front page, quoting Prime Minister Theresa May after the third attack in England in as many months.
It reports how Mrs May has vowed to crack down on "tolerance of extremism" by forcing internet companies to do more to prevent the spread of propaganda.
The News Letter also comments on the strength of the police response, noting how officers fired an "unprecedented" 50 bullets in a public place to kill the suspects.
The Irish News dedicates its first seven pages to the recent attacks in England, including Sunday's star-studded benefit concert for victims of the Manchester bombing.
It says US singer Ariana Grande changed her set list for the One Love Manchester concert, after the mother of one of the teenage victims told the pop star her late daughter would have "wanted to hear the hits".
The Belfast Telegraph opts for a dual image on its front page - showing the singer trying to comfort Manchester's victims as a casualty from the London attack is taken to hospital.
"Bloodied... but unbowed," is the paper's headline and in a small show of solidarity, it notes how police officers and security guards could be seen dancing with the crowd at the benefit gig.
Closer to home, the dailies report the sudden death of Prof Patrick Johnston, Vice Chancellor of Queen's University, Belfast.
The Irish News carries a statement from Queen's conveying staff's "deep sense of shock" over the unexpected death of the 58-year-old "visionary".
The paper says he is a "real loss to cancer research" as he was one of the driving forces behind QUB's Centre for Cancer Research.
The Mirror and others report how more than 1,300 health workers in Northern Ireland are being paid less than the National Living Wage.
The Department of Health has admitted staff still have not received the rise they were due in April, but has promised to rectify their pay packets by next month.
Gossipers beware - your own "rail life" story could be turned into a best seller and you many not even know it.
Novelist Emma Heatherington has admitted to the Belfast Telegraph that she eavesdrops on her fellow passengers' conversations while travelling on buses and trains in Northern Ireland.
The enterprising young writer revealed how a train trip from Belfast to Dublin provided inspiration for her latest novel.
You never know who is listening...
The Belfast Telegraph also carries a true tale of a picture perfect romance, kindled in the days long before Tinder and internet dating were even imagined.
In the early 1950s, Tom Darcy caught sight of a photograph of his future wife, Pam, and was so impressed, he began writing to her.
Within eight short months of meeting face to face, the pen pals got married and this week they celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary.
Old romantic Tom still has the best lines, telling the paper: "It's been nothing but nice all the way."
