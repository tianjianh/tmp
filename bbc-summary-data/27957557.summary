Hull City have signed Tottenham midfielder Jake Livermore for a club-record fee, thought to be about £8m.

The 24-year-old has signed a three-year contract, with the club holding an option for a further 12 months.
"I'm delighted to be joining Hull City on a permanent basis," said Livermore, who made 41 appearances while on loan at the KC Stadium last season.
The deal for Livermore eclipses the reported £7m Hull paid to sign Shane Long from West Brom in January.
Livermore is the first signing of the summer for Hull, who finished 16th in the Premier League last season and reached their first FA Cup final.
"I thoroughly enjoyed my season here on loan and I firmly believe this club will keep on going from strength to strength," Livermore said.
"I made my feelings known that I wanted to come here permanently and once the two clubs had agreed the fee, it was very straightforward."
Tom Huddlestone became the club's record signing when he joined from Tottenham for £5.25m last summer, before owner Assam Allam sanctioned bigger deals for strikers Long and Nikica Jelavic in January.
Hull, who will make their debut in the Europa League next season, have also been linked with Norwich midfielder Robert Snodgrass.
