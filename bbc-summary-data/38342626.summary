[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man, 81, with dementia must register as sex offender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man with undiagnosed dementia who exposed himself and sexually touched two women must register as a sex offender for five years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Longmate, 81, was in a home in Llangollen, Denbighshire, and had "had little grasp of reality" a court heard.
His diagnosis was only made when he was assessed after his arrest, barrister Oliver King told Mold Crown Court.
A jury previously decided he committed the acts, but he was not convicted as he was unfit to plead.
Mr King told the court Mr Longmate was now properly diagnosed and living in an all-male home in Liverpool where he was not allowed out alone and was happy, settled and safe.
Mr Longmate was said to have stood on a landing while naked and said "touch this" to a woman in January.
He sexually touched her over her clothing in March.
The defendant was moved to another home in Rhyl, but touched a woman there in similar circumstances two months later.
Judge Gaynor Lloyd made a 22-month supervision order, to be administered by a social worker from Wrexham council, and Mr Longmate must register as a sex offender.
She refused a request for a sexual harm prevention order, saying it was not necessary to protect the public.
A report showed he "had little grasp of reality" and his behaviour was down to his medical issues, particularly dementia. He had no previous convictions.
The court heard Mr Longmate's wife had died, he was unable to look after himself and he was moved to a care home. Dementia had set in but was not diagnosed.
Mr King said it was only when his instructing solicitors had him seen by a psychiatrist that a formal diagnosis was made.
"That is regrettable. If it had been done sooner, then all this could have been avoided," he said.
