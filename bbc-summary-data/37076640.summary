A salvage team is expected to spend the night on the stricken oil rig Transocean Winner after successfully boarding the structure.

The rig ran aground off Lewis on Monday and has lost more than 12,000 gallons (56,000 litres) of diesel oil from fuel tanks.
Eight experts scaled the rig with ropes on Sunday in order to begin a full assessment of damage.
Earlier attempts to board the structure had been hampered by bad weather.
So far, salvors have only been able to make a short assessment of its condition.
On Sunday, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said rope technicians had created "a safe alternative access" to the rig.
Work was also being done to provide a supply line so the team could get equipment and supplies on board.
The salvors will examine how fuel might be transferred from the rig's diesel oil tanks to other unbreached tanks before any operation to refloat it begins.
Survey work will also be carried out to identify the safest route to move the rig when the time comes.
The MCA said a full assessment would help salvors draw up a more detailed salvage plan.
A 300m (328 yards) exclusion zone remains in place around the rig covering both sea and air, which means no drones will be permitted in the area, although another aircraft has been brought in to help with the work.
The Transocean Winner was being towed from Norway to Malta from where it was to be moved to a yard in Turkey to be broken up.
A tow line between the rig and a tug broke during stormy weather and the structure ran aground at Dalmore at about 07:30 BST on 8 August.
