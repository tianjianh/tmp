A health board has defended its record on teenage pregnancies after it was identified as having the highest rate in under 16s in mainland Scotland.

NHS Borders issued a joint statement on the issue along with Scottish Borders Council.
It said figures for the region were "consistently low" and relatively small increases could see rates rise sharply.
The health board said all agencies were committed to providing information, education and sexual health services.
Figures from 2013 were released earlier this week showing NHS Borders had the highest rate in mainland Scotland in the under 16 age group.
However, the health board said the increase was from just eight pregnancies to 11 showing that figures in the region remained low.
Interim joint director of public health Dr Tim Patterson said: "All local agencies are committed to reducing early sexual activity by improving the self-esteem, motivation and achievement of young people.
"We will continue to support and improve access to local sexual health services and work to address the inequalities which are closely linked to teenage pregnancies to ensure that young people have the best opportunities in life."
Councillor Catriona Bhatia, executive member for health service at SBC, said figures had been low in the under 16 age group for "a number of years".
"This is proof of the hard work carried out by local sexual health and education professionals," she said.
"However we will continue to make this a high priority for local partnership working.
"In particular we are looking to prevent teenage pregnancy in children from deprived backgrounds."
Neighbouring NHS Dumfries and Galloway was also singled out in the report as having the lowest rate of teenage pregnancy in the under 18 age group.
A spokesman for the health board said it had traditionally had high teenage pregnancy rates but a lot of work had been done with partner organisations to address that.
"The reduction in numbers is not due to one factor but there is little doubt that strong multi agency relationships will have made a significant contribution," said the spokesman
"Examples of the kind of work we are doing includes the provision of sexual health services to young people incorporating youth clinics provided by school nurses and Sexual Health Dumfries and Galloway near or in schools."
The board said one strand of its work was targeting vulnerable young people to give them additional support.
