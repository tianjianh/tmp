St Helens South and Whiston MP Marie Rimmer, 69, faced two charges following an incident outside Shettleston Community Centre on 18 September 2014.
On Tuesday she was cleared of a charge of abusive or threatening behaviour.
She has now been cleared of assaulting a woman by kicking her, after a sheriff found the case against her not proven.
The trial, at Glasgow Sheriff Court, in front of Sheriff Kenneth Hogg, started in April and concluded on Wednesday after a number of adjournments.
Sheriff Hogg said he was "astonished" by some of the evidence in the case, describing it as a "storm in a tea cup".
He said a lack discretion available to the police on the day of the referendum was "very disappointing", suggesting a "yellow card would have been preferable to a red" in the matter.
He said: "I am not clear any party in this case, apart from the lady police officer, has told me what really happened on that day.
"I have unease with the whole evidence and am still unable to form a clear picture."
The sheriff said he found the case not proven and told Ms Rimmer she was free to go.
Speaking outside court following her acquittal, Ms Rimmer said: "I know what happened that day. I'm clear what happened that day.
"I've been acquitted today. I just want to get on with life now. I've answered the charges."
Ms Rimmer was elected to Westminster in 2015 with a majority of more than 20,000, and had previously served as a local councillor for decades.
