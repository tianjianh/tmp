Starting and ending at the Town Hall in the city centre, the route took in views of the Peak District and a climb up to the village of Ringinglow.
The event saw shorter routes for junior runners, with the main 13.1-mile event won by Steven Bayton and Sarah Lowery.
Among the runners were retired rugby league players Barrie McDermott and Keith Senior.
Lowery, the first woman to finish the circuit, said: "I had not done this race before so it's nice to do your local half marathon.
"There were loads of people in the crowd all the way round, even in the really remote parts of the course, so I really enjoyed the race."
Councillor Mary Lea, from Sheffield City Council, said: "Although the route is undoubtedly a challenging one, the view from the top of Ringinglow Road across the Peak District is surely one of the best rewards any weary runner could hope for.
"I would go as far as to say that Sheffield is surely the most picturesque of almost any city half marathon, when you consider the blend of the beautiful rural landscape and the vibrant city centre finish."
