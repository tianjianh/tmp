Andy Murray already looking ahead to January's Australian Open

You might think winning the ATP World Tour Finals and finishing a remarkable season as the year-end world number one dominate Andy Murray's thoughts in London at the moment.

But you would be wrong, at least according to the man himself.
As far as Murray is concerned, the next "big goal" lies Down Under.
Winning January's Australian Open is now the top target for a man who has lifted most of the sport's other major prizes, winning his second Wimbledon and retaining his Olympic title in 2016 alone.
"The Australian Open is obviously the next big goal that comes along," said Murray.
"It's less than three months away now. Obviously we've got a break between now and then, so I'll have some time off, but I've been in the final there five times. I'd love to win there.
"It's a tournament I've really enjoyed playing at. I love the conditions. I love Australia. I love playing in Melbourne.
"I've been close, but it's just not quite happened for me, so it's a big goal and I'll be working towards that in December when I'm over in Miami training."
Before the long flight to Melbourne, however, Murray could cap the best season of his life by winning the World Tour Finals, something he's never done, thereby clinching another career milestone: the year-end world number one spot.
Neither of those two achievements seem uppermost in his thoughts at the moment, despite the fact he concedes the event at London's 02 arena is huge for exactly those reasons.
"I never expected to finish the year at number one, so I'm not putting any added pressure on myself this week to do it," said the two-time Wimbledon champion.
"The last few months have been the best of my career. I want to keep that going this week if possible, but if not then I just want to play well."
The chances of that are significantly improved by Murray's status as tennis's new top dog.
He boasts 19 straight wins and four titles in a row, which has helped him get there, but the Scot is phlegmatic about the effect finally reaching world number one has had on him.
"I feel the same, I don't feel different," he said. "I mean, it's just how it is. I don't feel much different to how I felt last week.
"I think maybe when you step on the court or are playing matches then maybe you have a little extra edge, a little more confidence maybe than in the past, but this week I've not felt any different really."
One thing is different about the boy from Dunblane these days. Modes of transport.
As we walked from the TV compound in the back of the O2 Arena back round to the players' lounge and the main court, I reminded Murray that, when he broke into the top 100 as a youngster, he sent his mother a simple text message: "We did it, Mum."
There was a serious upgrade after he became world number one. He and Judy celebrated the achievement with a glass of champagne aboard a private jet from Paris to London.
"It was the only way to get back that night to be at home with the family, so I managed to get out of Paris nice and quickly which was good," he explained.
He'll see plenty of young daughter Sophia and wife Kim this week instead of staying in a central London hotel as he has in previous years.
Murray is commuting into the World Tour Finals from his home in Surrey.
Time with the family has helped him put tennis into perspective. It's also brought out the very best in him and his game. That could be underlined come next weekend.
If he at least matches Novak Djokovic's progress at the O2, a truly spectacular season will finish with Murray's status as this year's best player made official as the year-end world number one.
