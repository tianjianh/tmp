[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Employment growth in Northern Ireland's private sector eased off in June, according to the latest snapshot of the economy provided by the Ulster Bank.

The bank said firms were hiring at their weakest rate in six months, especially in the services sector.
But its chief economist Richard Ramsey said the private sector had "more momentum going into the second half of the year than it had a few months ago."
The bank conducts a monthly survey of companies' economic activity.
It tracks things such as new orders, employment and exports.
Mr Ramsey said the manufacturing, services and retail sectors "all reported robust rates of orders growth".
The export picture was also improving for the first time this year, even though the euro remains weak against sterling.
Ulster Bank said the Northern Ireland economy still faces challenges.
The chancellor's autumn spending revenue will have big implications for public sector spending.
"Looking ahead, the economic recovery is likely to experience more headwinds than tailwinds," Mr Ramsey said.
