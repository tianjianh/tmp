Social services and health minister Rebecca Evans said it was a "neutral act" following "matters which have emerged in recent days".
A review of Sports Wales seen by BBC Wales Sport has warned it must undergo a major overhaul.
However, Wednesday's decision is not directly linked to today's leaked review, BBC Wales understands.
The decision to suspend the activities of the board was taken in agreement with the Sports Wales chair Paul Thomas and vice-chair Adele Baumgardt.
Mr Thomas replaced Laura McAllister as chair in March and has been overseeing a review of the organisation.
Sport Wales, a Welsh Government-sponsored body, advise ministers on sporting matters.
They also distribute National Lottery funding in Wales.
A statement from Ms Evans added: "The decision has not been taken lightly, but I am satisfied it is a necessary move while my officials conduct a rapid review of these events, which has already commenced.
"I am unable to give any further details at this stage but I will update (assembly) members further as soon as I am in a position to do so.
"My expectation is that the board's activities will remain suspended until at least the end of the year, depending on the outcome of the review.
"Sport plays a vital part at the heart of our national life, both at the elite and grassroots level. It is equally vital, therefore, that we have a well-functioning and cohesive body charged with promoting this.
"Today's action is solely aimed at ensuring that Sport Wales is properly placed to deliver this in the future. In the meantime, its day-to-day operational activities will continue as normal."
Responding, a Sports Wales spokesperson added: "We have no further comment other than to say we will continue to work with Welsh Government on this matter."
