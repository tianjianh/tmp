Six Nations 2016: Wales 'can't just beat England up'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales must produce more variety in attack if they are to beat England at Twickenham on 12 March and close in on a fifth Six Nations title since 2005, says former captain Gareth Thomas.

Both sides are unbeaten after three games and meet in what is being viewed as the tournament decider.
Thomas said: "Wales are going to have do something different because I don't think we can just beat England up.
"We'll have to bring something out that we haven't expected or seen yet."
Thomas believes centre Jamie Roberts will be crucial if Wales are to repeat their 28-25 victory over England at Twickenham in the 2015 World Cup.
Roberts is renowned for using his power to make ground, rather than for his ability to work team-mates into space.
But having played alongside his fellow British and Irish Lion, Thomas "would love to see" the 29-year-old surprise fans, critics and opponents alike.
"What Jamie does for Wales, he does it very well, but do you know what? The kid can pass," Thomas told Scrum V.
"Everybody is expecting him to go down there (into England's midfield).
"But maybe give him a bit of a rein; give him a reason to play, a reason to pass, a reason to have a go rather than just be this battering ram, which he does well - but there is more to him."

On Friday Wales beat France 19-10 in a game captain Sam Warburton described as "boring" and coach Warren Gatland viewed as brilliant.
The following day, Eddie Jones' England ended Ireland's hopes of a third successive title in a 21-10 triumph at Twickenham.
Thomas said: "Part of me was glad they (England) won because it does build up for the Wales-England game to be a very interesting game, especially now with England going for the Grand Slam.
"They've kind of gone back to a bit of a basic and they're playing a very powerful game. They're very strong."
Wales and England are playing a second game in the same season at Twickenham for the first time and Gatland's side will hope to replicate last autumn's victory.

Wales are also hoping to complete their first back-to-back wins over England at Twickenham since 1978.
They won their first game at Twickenham in 20 years in Warren Gatland's first game in charge in 2008 before winning the 2012 Triple Crown at English rugby's home in 2012.
Wales captain Sam Warburton wants a "10% improvement", on the performance against France but they might be without the nation's most-capped player in prop Gethin Jenkins.
England beat Scotland and Italy before seeing off Ireland while Wales drew in their opener against Ireland before beating Scotland ahead of a fifth successive win over France.
