Ipswich Town have signed midfielder Toumani Diagouraga on loan from Leeds United for the rest of the season.

The 29-year-old Frenchman joined Leeds from Brentford a year ago, but has only played once this season, in a 3-0 defeat by QPR in August.
Diagouraga has made more than 350 career league appearances in England, having also featured for Hereford and Peterborough among others.
He could make his Ipswich debut at Preston North End on Saturday.
Following last weekend's defeat by Huddersfield, Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy confirmed former Newcastle United defender Steven Taylor will train with Town as cover for injured Adam Webster.
"We have lost Adam Webster for the season, so we're short on numbers and Steven Taylor would add that experience," McCarthy said.
"It's good to bring in new faces. It can revitalise the place."
