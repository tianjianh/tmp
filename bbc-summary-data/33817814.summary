Chris Brown promoter denies defrauding Philippine Sect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Brown's promoter has refuted claims he defrauded an influential religious sect in the Philippines.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Michael Pio Roda denied receiving over $1m (Â£645,000) from the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ) for a 31 December concert hosted by the sect for which Brown failed to show up.
Mr Roda has been held at the capital's Bureau of Immigration detention facility for nearly two weeks.
His legal counsel described his arrest as "Gestapo-like."
Brown failed to attend the show in question due to a lost passport.
Iglesia-linked local concert producers Maligaya Development Corp. have asked the justice department to file criminal fraud charges against Brown and Mr Roda, saying they had been advanced their million-dollar fee.
Mr Roda's lawyers said in a statement: "To hold Mr Pio Roda accountable for the entire one million dollars... is not only without legal or factual basis but is a travesty of justice and a continued violation of human rights."
They said Mr Roda, in fact, received $45,000 (Â£29,000) and that he and Brown received another $578,750 (Â£372,737) in advance from another company.
Brown was stopped from leaving the Philippines by the immigration bureau for three days in July over the row, having returned to play another show.
"Can somebody please tell me what... is going on? I don't know. I'm reading headline after headline," Brown said in a video that has since been removed from his Instagram account.
"I didn't do nothing," he said in a second video post, while raising both hands in the air.
He got down on his knees and begged the authorities, saying "Please, please, let us leave, please."
Although Brown was later allowed to the leave the country, the fraud complaint hearings against the R&B singer will proceed.
