The-23-year-old former Dundee United and West Brom player moved to Easter Road in summer and has helped them to finish second, ahead of Rangers.
The League One player of the year award went to Morton's Declan McManus, who has scored 23 goals for the champions while on loan from Aberdeen.
Arbroath striker Bobby Linn took the League Two player of the year award.
"When I came back up this season I was just looking to get games," Allan told BBC Scotland. "I've loved every minute of it.
"With my experiences down south I've learned a lot and used that this season. I just want to kick on next season and hopefully add more goals to my game."
Allan also praised Hibs boss Alan Stubbs ahead of the Scottish Premiership play-offs, where Hibernian will face either Rangers or Queen of the South in the semi-final.
He said: "He's been brilliant for me. He's gave me a platform and a freedom to play my own game.
"I needed a manager to see what my strengths are instead of my weaknesses. He's worked with me and it's worked well for me and him."
McManus, whose Morton side won the League One title on Saturday, says he is still unsure where he will be playing next season.
The 20-year-old, who is out of contract at Pittodrie in the summer, said: "I'm in the dark as much as anybody else about it.
"I spoke to the gaffer up in Aberdeen a couple of weeks ago and we agreed to not speak about next year until the end of the season.
"It would be heartbreaking to leave  - it's been part of my life for the past 12 years. But I've had the best year of my life at the club [Morton].
"Everyone has embraced me. The club will be in my heart for the rest of my life."
