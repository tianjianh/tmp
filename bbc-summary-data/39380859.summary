A device that exploded in Strabane in County Tyrone, was "a roadside bomb with a command wire attached", police say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The explosion, which is being treated as an attempt to kill police officers, happened at 20:30 GMT on Tuesday.
A 20-year-old man was arrested in Newtownstewart in connection with the bombing.
The PSNI said it was "incredibly lucky" that no-one was killed. The security alert has now ended.
Liskey Road and Townsend Street have been reopened and local residents who had to leave the area during the alert have been allowed to return to their homes.
"I would like to thank the local community for their patience and understanding during the course of this prolonged policing operation," Ch Insp Ivor Morton said.
"The security operation caused significant disruption to the people of the area, but was necessary to allow for a careful examination of the scene in order to keep people safe."
He said the bomb was left in a built up area where it could "quite easily have killed or maimed members of the public".
