The 43-year-old, who is the first British Asian to be appointed CEO of a county cricket club, is to take up his position at Grace Road in January 2015.
Khan scored 2,835 first-class runs during an 11-year professional career, including a career-best score of 181.
"I am looking forward to working with the staff and board because I know they are terrific people," said Khan.
"It is a tremendous honour and an exciting opportunity for me."
After retiring from first-class cricket in 2001, Khan embarked on a career in business and cricket administration.
Most recently he has been working as chief executive officer of the Cricket Foundation, which helps encourage children to play cricket through the Chance to Shine and StreetChance programmes.
Leicestershire have had a disastrous time on and off the pitch recently. They have seen numerous changes in their management structure, have failed to win a County Championship game in the past two seasons and have seen many of their top players leave.
Chairman Paul Haywood said: "Wasim impressed the interview panel with his vision, his passion for the game, and his track record both in cricket and cricket administration.
"Wasim has tremendous experience and knowledge of cricket from his days as a player and an administrator and has a track record in building successful teams. We know that he will do a tremendous job."
