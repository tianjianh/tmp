Cardiff-Bridgend rail delays as woman hit by train dies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All lines between Cardiff and Bridgend have reopened after an earlier closure following the death of a woman hit by a train at Llanharan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the woman was pronounced dead at the scene and her death was not being treated as suspicious.
Some services were cancelled or diverted through other stations with warnings of delays of up to an hour.
Some delays followed when services resumed but the disruption has since eased.
