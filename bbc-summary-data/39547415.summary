Four RNLI vessels and crews have taken part in a ceremony to honour the memory of former Rhyl coxswain Gerald Hughes who died last month aged 87.

RNLI volunteers from nearby stations joined Mr Hughes' family for a service. He had been based at Rhyl Lifeboat Station for nearly 60 years.
His ashes were scattered in the sea from Rhyl Lifeboat.
RNLI boats from nearby Llandudno and Hoylake, Wirral, took part in the ceremony.
Rhyl RNLI coxswain Martin Jones said: "It just shows what great respect Gerald had in the community for all these people to be here to pay their respects."
