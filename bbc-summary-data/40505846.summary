The right-back, 22, joins on a two-year deal following his release from Waalwijk in his native Netherlands.
He spoke to his famous uncle - a Champions League winner with three different clubs - before the move.
"We had a little chat a couple of weeks ago and I told him I was thinking of a new adventure. He said 'if it feels good, just go'," Seedorf said.
"If we get promotion, maybe I can arrange something and he can come and enjoy the party."
In a club interview via Facebook, he added: "I like the vision of this club and the manager and I want to help take them to back to where they belong."
He is the fourth new arrival at the Highland club since they were relegated from the Premiership.
Seedorf made his Eerste Divisie debut in 2014 and scored twice in the Dutch second tier - both goals coming against the B team of Ajax.
He made 11 appearances last season, five of them starts, as Waalwijk finished 10th last season.
Clarence, 41, rose to prominence with Ajax and also played for both Milan clubs and Botafogo in Brazil.
