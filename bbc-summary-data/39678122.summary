[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Graham Allen has announced he is to step down as Labour MP for Nottingham North after 30 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 64-year-old said he had recently suffered "extended periods" of ill health and did not feel he could serve for a further five years.
Several well-known MPs, including Sir Eric Pickles and Alan Johnson, have said they are standing down ahead of the snap general election on 8 June.
Mr Allen said it had been "the hardest decision of my life".
The former warehouse worker won the Nottingham North seat in 1987 and successfully defended it in six further general elections.
Mr Allen has served as a senior whip and earlier this decade chaired a select committee on political and constitutional reform.
In a letter to constituents he wrote: "I have suffered extended periods of ill health this year with more expected.
"I would have enthusiastically completed the rest of the Parliament to 2020.
"However, the certainty of continuing at the pace and standards that I set myself for a further full five-year term cannot be guaranteed."
