Iain Provan, 64; Elizabeth Allan, 63; and Len Stern, 71, died at the Jim Clark Rally in the Borders last month.
After the accident, near Coldstream, Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill ordered a safety review.
The Scottish government has now confirmed that Sir Jackie has agreed to take on a role in the study.
The review will focus on safety, in particular spectator safety, at all types of motorsport races, events and competitions that take place in Scotland, including bike races, kart and car rallies.
Sir Jackie will provide "expert input based on his decades of expertise of improving motorsport safety around the world".
Ministers have asked for interim recommendations prior to the Isle of Mull rally in October, with final recommendations by December 2014.
Sports Minister Shona Robison said: "The review of motorsport event safety is critical to make sure we learn lessons and never again have to witness the tragic events of last month, where three spectators sadly lost their lives.
"Sir Jackie Stewart has a distinguished record of improving safety for drivers in Formula 1, so I am very pleased that he has agreed to share his experience to ensure that all those who want to enjoy motorsport events in Scotland are as safe as possible."
Organisers of the Jim Clark Rally have also been informed that, as part of conditions for next year's rally, they must demonstrate to the satisfaction of Scottish ministers how any recommendations made by the review will be implemented.
