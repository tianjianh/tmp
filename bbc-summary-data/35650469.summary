Wakefield Trinity Wildcats 'set up like the insect on the windscreen'

Wakefield coach Brian Smith says he feels his side are "being set up to be like the insect on the windscreen" after being given five days to prepare for Friday's trip to Warrington.

By contrast, the Wire go into the game having not played since 14 February.
The Wildcats picked up their first points of the season with victory at Hull KR on Sunday.
"It's a big job for us to go there with five days' preparation when they've had 12," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
"Because Warrington have the Thursday game next week they've scheduled this game for Friday so that they have a full break before the game next - because the Rugby Football League say they can.
"All that's great for Warrington but not great at all for us."
He added: "It's like we're being set up to be like the insect on the windscreen. We aren't going to be that on Friday night, I can assure you."
Smith will be coaching against his brother Tony, who has led his side to successive wins this year, for the second time.
The former Hull FC and Bradford Bulls coach feels that poor scheduling from the RFL is partly to blame for English sides losing the World Club Series 3-0 for the second year running.
"English rugby league just does not generate the same level of intensity as NRL because it is too lopsided and the scheduling is a serious factor in that," he said.
"Someone in power needs to recognise you can't keep having lopsided contests and get players to develop.
"You can't expect English clubs to do well when there are so many inequalities in the planning."
