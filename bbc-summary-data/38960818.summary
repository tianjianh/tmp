Prison for Bracton mental health centre patient after stabbing attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A patient who stabbed two people at a mental health centre 23 times has been handed a 19-year prison sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Myha Grant, 31, hid outside a kitchen door before launching the frenzied knife attack on members of staff.
Grant was being treated at the Bracton Centre, Dartford, for previously attacking a person at random with a champagne bottle.
He entered guilty pleas for his latest offences at Maidstone Crown Court.
He was charged with two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and one count of arson on 17 July 2016.
The court heard how Grant, of no fixed address, burst into the centre's kitchen, throwing one employee backwards and causing his head to hit the floor.
Grant grabbed a knife used to prepare food and stabbed the worker repeatedly in his chest, stomach and arms.
When a second member of staff hit his panic alarm Grant turned on him too, stabbing him across his body including his arm, leg, chest, groin and stomach.
Grant started a fire in the building, then fled into the courtyard and stacked plant pots on top of one another, trying to climb on to the roof.
But he failed and was arrested on site.
Grant had already admitted the bottle attack the previous month. He was sentenced to 16 in prison and an additional three on an extended licence.
He is currently being detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act but will serve the jail term if his condition improves.
