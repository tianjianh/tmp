Manager Jack Ross is urging his jubilant Alloa Athletic players not to be content with a quarter-final berth in the Scottish League Cup.

The Wasps made it six wins from as many matches this season when they defeated Inverness 1-0 in the cup's last-16.
"There's no reason why it needs to stop now for them," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"Sometimes there's an assumption that we've got to this stage and [so] it doesn't matter what happens tonight. Before the game I said it does."
League One Alloa had already beaten Raith Rovers, Ross County, Cove Rangers and Montrose in their group matches in the competition before hosting Premiership Inverness.
Jason Marr's first-half strike and a disciplined performance ensured that Alloa will be in Wednesday evening's draw for the last eight beside Dundee United, Morton, Queen of the South, Rangers, Celtic or Motherwell, Ayr or Aberdeen and Hearts or St Johnstone.
"I'm hugely proud of the players," said Ross.
"Over the course of the game we restricted Inverness to few clear-cut chances and that was to do with the work rate of the team.
"I've stressed to them that they should really enjoy it. It's 44 years, I think, since the club have been at this stage of the competition so they've put themselves in the history books in that regard.
"When the next stage of the competition comes around, it's about winning that game again, not saying 'we got to the quarter-finals'.
"We deserve to be at this stage of the competition and our record in the competition is fantastic.
"Whoever gets us at that stage will want us because we'll be the underdogs.
"If we continue in this vain we'll approach that game with confidence as well."
Inverness boss Richie Foran said: "We were the better team. We had most of the possession, we had more opportunities to score goals.
"They score with their only real chance of the game. That's the disappointing part, schoolboy defending.
"All credit to Alloa. They're a good strong side but no excuse from us. We should be winning a game like this."
