Bondz N'Gala: Dagenham & Redbridge sign Dover Athletic defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham have signed defender Bondz N'Gala on a two-year deal after he turned down a new contract at National League rivals Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
N'Gala made five league appearances for Dover after joining in February following his release by Eastleigh.
The 27-year-old had been set to join League One side Gillingham before signing for Dover, but Fifa regulations prevented him from completing the deal.
N'Gala is the Daggers' fourth signing since the end of last season.
