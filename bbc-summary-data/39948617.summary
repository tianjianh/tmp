They were made famous by actress Jean Alexander, who played the battleaxe between 1964 and 1987.
She kept hold of the items, which were among a number of personal possessions sold off earlier, after quitting Weatherfield's cobbles.
Film producer Trevor Beattie bought them and said he may use them in a film called Hilda Ogden: The Movie.
Mr Beattie, from Birmingham, said: "It is a really important piece of popular culture.
"It is like Charlie Chaplin's moustache or Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves."
"I'm hoping to open an exhibition of cultural icons and we may be making Hilda Ogden: The Movie so we'll see."
He tweeted: "I just bought Hilda Ogden's headscarf, pinny and rollers. As you do."
Auctioneer Mike Litherland said the "iconic" outfit was "part of media history". "She wore them in nearly every episode," he added.
Alexander's nieces Sonia Hearld and Valerie Thewlis organised the sale after their aunt died last year.
The pinny and curlers were found inside a wardrobe.
Alexander's childhood teddy bear Ambrose, which she received on her fourth birthday, was sold for Â£260 despite missing an eye.
The auction took place at the Royal Clifton Hotel in Southport.
As well as portraying the downtrodden cleaning lady, Alexander had roles in Last of the Summer Wine and Z Cars.
