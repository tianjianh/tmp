[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The managerless Buddies remain bottom of the Championship, without a win in eight league outings.
A huge deflection from a Craig Sibbald a free-kick gave Falkirk an early lead.
The visitors had the best of the few chances created thereafter but could not find a second goal before they were pegged back on 87 minutes.
It looks like Saints will name their new manager by the middle of next week, and more than a few eyes were trained on the directors box to see its there were any obvious candidates watching this one, although rumours of an interest from former French international and Fulham manager Jean Tigana being seen in Paisley earlier in the week were played down.
Falkirk had been looking to go six wins in a row in league and cup matches, and after an early good spell for the Buddies in which Tom Taiwo has cleared a Stevie Mallen corner off the line, Sibbald gave the visitors the lead on nine minutes with a 20 yard free kick which took a wicked deflection and evaded the diving Jamie Langfield.
John Rankin then produced a thundering shot which blasted into Gary Irvine before Ryan Hardie should have levelled for the hosts a minute before the interval but blasted high over the bar from 18 yards.
Falkirk's Bob McHugh had the ball in the net six minutes after the break but was correctly judged offside before John Baird's 82nd-minute cross found substitute James Craigan whose header was well saved by Langfield.
But it was Saints substitute Walsh who brought the biggest cheer from the 2,344 crowd with a thundering 25 yard equaliser for his fourth goal of the season to level matters three minutes from time.
St Mirren play Hibernian and Dundee United in their next two games and many of the home fans will take more than a passing interest when those two meet at Easter Road on Sunday to see if they can spot any managerial candidates doing some "homework" before next week's announcement.
