Police Federation calls for separate funding for Northern Ireland cold cases

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The executive should provide separate funding for investigations into cold cases and the activities of informers, the Police Federation has said.

The federation has said it is unfair to expect legacy matters "to be a burden on the PSNI".
It said the police budget is already inadequate to meet day-to-day policing demands "against the backdrop of a severe terrorist threat".
Federation chairman Mark Lindsay said policing the past was costly.
"If the job is to be done professionally, then the Northern Ireland Executive will have to provide a separate, ring-fenced allocation for that demanding work," he said.
"To expect the task to be done through existing, inadequate funding is grossly unfair."
The comments come after the BBC revealed that the expected cost of investigating the activities of the army's most high-ranking agent within the IRA - Stakeknife - could be more than Â£12.5m over five years.
Mr Lindsay said other inquiries and the failure of politicians to deal with the financial implications of legacy issues in the Fresh Start Agreement will run into many millions of pounds.
"These cases cannot be investigated in isolation as there is a direct financial impact on present-day policing capability," he said.
"The PSNI is to get an additional Â£32m a-year over the next five years in the 'Fresh Start' deal, but that money has to go on recruitment and investment in the future of policing.
"Officers have been doing more with less, but there's nothing more to give."
