Burgess, 21, made a combined 49 appearances in the 2016-17 season while on loan at Oldham and Bury.
The centre-back, who has also had loan spells with Ross County and Cheltenham, has represented both Scotland and Australia at youth level.
He becomes Graham Alexander's first summer signing and replaces David Mirfin, who joined Mansfield on 23 May.
"He's a player who is desperate to kick his career on now. He's been out on loan from Fulham and wants to go out and be his own man, and find the best club to do that," manager Alexander told the club website.
"Cameron ticks a lot of boxes for us, he has great stature and can play."
