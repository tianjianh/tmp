Visitors to six National Museum Wales (NMW) sites have been warned to expect disruption for the third weekend running due to strike action.

Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) members walked out at 13:00 BST and are expected to do the same on Sunday in a row over pay and pensions.
The union said it was particularly concerned at cuts to allowances for weekend and bank holiday working.
NMW said it was "very disappointed" by the action and apologised to visitors.
It said all its sites were likely to face disruption, apart from the National Roman Legion Museum in Caerleon, which would remain fully open.
Geraint Parfitt, vice-chair of the PCS branch for the museums, said: "Museum staff are not only looking after national collections but are also dealing with 600,000 visitors a year, providing a valuable educational service.
"Yet the very people dealing with the public are those hit hardest by the proposed cuts to allowances, which make up a large proportion of their take-home pay."
NMW said National Museum Cardiff, St Fagans National History Museum and the National Waterfront Museum would remain open from 10:00 to 17:00 BST on Saturday and Sunday but may have reduced services.
Big Pit, the National Slate Museum and the National Wool Museum closed at 13:00 BST.
A spokesperson for NMW said: "We have been and are continuing to consult with staff, trade unions and other partners on a number of proposals regarding these allowances.
"At the request of the trade unions, final decisions have been deferred pending the progress of other concurrent reviews.
"We are therefore naturally very disappointed with the planned action and apologise to our visitors for any inconvenience caused."
