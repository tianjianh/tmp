[SN]TITLE[SN]
Calderdale Council to cut 200 jobs with voluntary scheme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A West Yorkshire local authority is to cut up to 200 jobs by 2016 in a bid to save Â£40m, it has been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Staff across all services, including centrally employed teachers, are being offered voluntary redundancy by Calderdale Council.
The authority said it was facing "significant" financial challenges and has made Â£56m in savings since 2010.
Councillor Geraldine Carter said they wanted to "minimise the need for redundancies".
The council is made up of 25 Labour councillors,  19 Conservatives, six Liberal Democrats and one independent but is under Conservative minority control after Labour was ousted in a no confidence vote in July.
