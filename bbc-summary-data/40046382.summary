The 25-year-old British number two beat the Czech 6-4 7-6 (7-3) despite going 4-1 down in the second set and being broken when serving for the match.
Watson will reach the first round if she beats Richel Hogenkamp on Friday.
Dutchwoman Hogenkamp, 25, won their only previous meeting in last year's US Open first round and is 13 places above Watson at 105 in the world rankings.
Watson missed out on direct entry to a Grand Slam for the first time in three years after slipping down the rankings.
But she has qualified successfully three times before for Roland Garros, reaching the second round five times.
Meanwhile, British number four Laura Robson is to work with the academy co-founded by Stan Wawrinka's coach Magnus Norman.
Robson, who has suffered injury problems over the last couple of years, returned to the world's top 200 by winning a tournament in Japan last week.
