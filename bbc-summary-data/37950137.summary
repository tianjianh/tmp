Smith, 22, competed at London 2012, claimed Commonwealth gold at Glasgow 2014 and was the favourite for GB's sole female weightlifting place in Rio.
However, she dislocated her shoulder during the GB trials and selectors opted for rising-star Rebekah Tiler.
"I don't want to ever miss out again," Smith told BBC Sport.
She travelled to out to the 2008 Beijing Games as part of the British Olympic Association's athlete ambition programme for youngsters who have the potential to compete in future Olympics.
Four years later she fulfilled that promise and set a new British record en-route to a 11th-place finish, but her Rio dreams ended after undergoing surgery on her injured shoulder.
"The summer was bitter sweet for me," she said. "It was amazing to see Team GB do so well, but being stuck on a sofa watching it from afar was a little painful.
"My injury rehab is going well, but I've not lifted since June - had surgery in July.
"I'm still very much looking forward to the Commonwealth Games and I'm going to do everything in my power to qualify and try to defend my title."

Smith - a two-time Commonwealth medallist - has been named as one of Commonwealth Games England's (CGE) 25 athlete ambassadors for the 2018 Games in Gold Coast, Australia.
Backed by Â£4m of Sport England funding CGE are planning to send the largest and best-prepared team to an overseas Commonwealth Games ever.
As part of the package offered to each of the sport will be access to their Brisbane-based for 10 days in the build-up to the Games in April 2018.
"The support we receive is amazing and there was a big difference between 2010 to 2014 as they listen to athletes," said Smith.
"The village [in Glasgow] had all the facilities we need, as it will in Australia and I owe a lot a lot of the success I've had in the Games to that."
