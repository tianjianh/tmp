The 10-mile (16km) race through the streets of Portsmouth has been held in the city since 1991, and passes landmarks including HMS Victory.
Britain's Chris Thompson, who lives in Fleet, won the men's elite race with a time of 47 minutes and 23 seconds.
Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba clocked 51 minutes and 49 seconds to win the women's elite race.
Thompson turned the tables on fellow elite runner Andy Vernon who beat him at the Great Birmingham Run half marathon event last weekend.
Vernon came second at Portsmouth with a time of 49 minutes and nine seconds.
Among the entrants this year was Olympic champion sailor Hannah Mills, who was running in aid of the Andrew Simpson Sailing Foundation.
Mills was also an honorary starter at the event, along with fellow Olympic champion and team-mate Saskia Clark.
A Great South Run 5k (3 mile) and junior and mini run were held on Saturday as part of the weekend event.
