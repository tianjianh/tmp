Tracey Woodford murder trial: Head hidden in storm drain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former butcher accused of murdering a woman in a sexually motivated attack carried her head through Pontypridd and hid it in a storm drain, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tracey Woodford, 47, was found dead in the Rhondda Cynon Taff town in April after being reported missing.
Christopher Nathan May, 50, from the Graig area of the town, denies murder.
Cardiff Crown Court heard on Wednesday he may have used his butchery skills to dismember Ms Woodford's body.
Her severed head was found on a ledge in an "underground chamber" 138m (453ft) inside a storm drain near Pontypridd Rugby Club.
Part of her lower torso was also discovered in the drain.
"The defendant carried a body part and the head from his flat, through part of Pontypridd, entering a dark tunnel and walking into it for 138m - a significant distance," Roger Thomas QC, prosecuting, told the jury.
"You may want to ask: What is going on in this man's mind?"
"What's the purpose of displaying the head in that manner?" he added. "It's a very strange thing to have done with it."
An expert said the way the body had been dismembered showed whoever had done it, had some "skill and knowledge".
The prosecution claimed a witness said Mr May instructed him on how to cut and bone animal carcasses when he had worked in a butcher's shop 30 years ago.
"It seems that his experience in butcher shops has been put to use on a human body," Mr Thomas said.
He said the cause of Ms Woodford's death was pressure to her neck.
However, she suffered many of her injuries while putting up a "desperate but ultimately unsuccessful struggle to save her life", he added.
The jury has been told some of the evidence during the two-week case would be "distressing", after hearing how police found remains of Ms Woodford in a bathroom at the flat where the accused lived.
She had been reported missing for three days by her family, after last being seen drinking at the Skinny Dog pub in Pontypridd.
The jury was told there was a "sexual motivation" for the killing and the dismemberment.
It also heard claims Mr May had mentioned in the pub that he "loved redheads" in the days before the killing, and that his affection stemmed from his sincere love for his daughter.
Skinny Dog barmaid Rebecca Williams told the court she knew Mr May and had often given him lifts home from the pub.
Ms Williams said: "He was a polite gentleman. I never had to say bad words to him at the pub. I never had to stop his drink."
She said those at the pub used to call Mr May "little legs" due to his short height.
Mr Thomas told the jury earlier in the trial the defendant claimed he either acted in self-defence, it was an accident or he lost self-control.
But addressing the court on Wednesday, he said there could only be one conclusion about the killing, and that it was "a perverted sexual desire that manifested itself violently that night".
The trial is continuing.
