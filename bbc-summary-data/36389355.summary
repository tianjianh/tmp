Having topped the Championship in four of the past six seasons and failed to go up, Bristol beat Doncaster on aggregate despite a second-leg defeat.
The club have been out of the top flight since being relegated in 2009.
"The thing for us is we believe as a side that, when we go up, the Premiership will enjoy coming to Ashton Gate," Robinson told BBC Radio 5 live.
"We look forward to Bath coming next year, Gloucester, Exeter and we believe we can sell-out at 27,000, which will be great for the Premiership.
"We'll bring a lot to the Premiership next year."
Bristol will go into the league without loose-head prop Ellis Genge - the new England squad member has joined Leicester following a spell on loan at Welford Road.

Robinson, a former England player and coach, admits the Championship had tested his resolve during his tenure.
"For the last two years I haven't celebrated winning a game of rugby, and now I'm celebrating a game of rugby that we've lost," he continued.
"It's a funny feeling that you get because it's all or nothing, as was shown last year against Worcester."
Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol he added: "The players have put in an incredible effort, the team management have put incredible effort in, all for this, to make sure that we got promoted.
"The hard work starts - we want to perform well in the Premiership and there are a lot of improvements we've got to make."
