The 26-year-old said his knee was "normal" and the treatment was part of his usual routine.
"I often ice different parts of my body or jump in an ice bath. It's just normal recovery process," he said.
England meet Russia in Group B in Marseille on Saturday.
They face Wales on 16 June and Slovakia on 20 June.
Manchester United centre-back Smalling is expected to start in Roy Hodgson's side alongside Chelsea's Gary Cahill or Everton's John Stones.
