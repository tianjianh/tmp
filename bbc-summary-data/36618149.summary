Lucy Frazer, Conservative MP for South East Cambridgeshire, backed the Remain campaign and said she was "disappointed" with David Cameron's  decision to resign as prime minister.
She said: "He offered the people a referendum because our relationship with Europe has changed since the last vote, and he honoured that decision."
Nick Clarke, UKIP member of Cambridgeshire County Council, said: "Politicians must listen to the fact that a significant proportion and a majority of those that voted want us to leave the EU.
"What we have to do is make sure we continue trading with all our European colleagues and put the right processes in place to do that."
