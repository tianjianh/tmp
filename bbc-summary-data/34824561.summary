[SN]TITLE[SN]
Elite League: Cardiff Devils 6-3 Belfast Giants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Belfast Giants had their lead at the top of the Elite League reduced to one point as they fell to defeat away to the Cardiff Devils on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff, along with Nottingham Panthers who beat Coventry Blaze, are right on the heels of the Giants with a number of games in hand.
The Giants had come from behind to lead 2-1 in the first period with the goals scored by Mike Wilson and Mike Radja.
Cardiff dominated after that and ran out comfortable winners.
Their goals were netted by Andrew Hotham, Joey Martin (2), Tomas Kurka (2) and Joey Haddad.
Radja scored the third goal for the Belfast Giants who host Dundee Stars in a Challenge Cup on Sunday at 17:00 GMT.
The Giants could well be toppled from top spot in the Elite table on Sunday as Cardiff and Nottingham have league matches.
