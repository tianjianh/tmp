An army spokesman said one flare shot through an upper window of the building at Bovington Camp in Dorset on Friday, setting fire to a room and corridor.
The spokesman said the flare was fired from the area of an outdoor swimming pool, where the officers were reported to be duelling on kayaks.
The fire took two hours to extinguish.
The fire started after a dinner to mark the completion of training for prospective tank troop commanders.
Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service said it was called at around midnight to a fire on the top floor of a seven-storey residential building.
Ten fire engines managed to put out the blaze by 02:00 BST and no one was injured.
Details were first revealed by the Forces TV channel which said the duelling officers fired flare guns at each other from kayaks in the pool outside Allenby Barracks.
The Royal Military Police is investigating.
