[SN]TITLE[SN]
Trafford Centre Metrolink plans to be discussed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major public consultation has begun on Â£350m plans to build a new Metrolink line to Greater Manchester's largest shopping centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) plans a 5.5km (three miles) line, running from the existing Pomona stop through to the Trafford Centre.
People can voice their opinions over the following 12 weeks, at 14 staffed drop-in events along the route.
The new line could be built as early as 2019/20 subject to funding.
Peter Cushing, Metrolink director at TfGM, said: "The feedback we get over the coming three months will help us finalise a scheme that works well for everybody before we apply to government statutory powers to construct and run services on the new line."
The proposed route runs from the Pomona stop along the Manchester Ship Canal, following Trafford Wharf Road and Warren Bruce Road before running through the Village area of Trafford Park.
It would continue through the Parkway Circle area, where a nearby park and ride is proposed, and crosses the Bridgewater Canal before terminating at the Trafford Centre.
