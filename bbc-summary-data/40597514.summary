Liu Xiaobo: China's most prominent dissident dies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, who was China's most prominent human rights and democracy advocate, has died aged 61.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The activist had been serving an 11-year prison term for "subversion" and was recently moved to a hospital for treatment for terminal liver cancer.
A university professor turned tireless rights campaigner, Mr Liu was branded a criminal by authorities.
The Nobel Committee said the Chinese government bore a "heavy responsibility for his premature death".
The campaigner was repeatedly jailed throughout his life. When not in prison, he was subject to severe restrictions while his wife, Liu Xia, was placed under house arrest.
Mr Liu died "peacefully", surrounded by his wife and other relatives, a doctor who treated him said. His final words to Liu Xia were: "Live on well," the South China Morning Post reported.
Liu Xiaobo played a significant role in the Tiananmen Square student protests of June 1989, which ended in bloodshed when they were quashed by government troops.
He and other activists negotiated the safe exit of several hundred demonstrators, and have been credited with saving their lives.
He was subsequently placed in a detention centre and released in 1991.
Mr Liu's campaign to free those detained during the Tiananmen Square protests landed him in a labour camp in north-eastern China for three years, but he was permitted to marry poet Liu Xia there in 1996.
He was later freed, and continued to campaign for democracy.
The 11-year jail term was handed down in 2009 after he compiled, with other intellectuals, the Charter 08 manifesto. It called for an end to one-party rule and the introduction of multi-party democracy.
Mr Liu was found guilty of trying to overthrow the state.
He was a pro-democracy figurehead for activists outside mainland China, although many of his compatriots were unaware of his struggles because the authorities rigorously censored news about him.
Who was Liu Xiaobo?
The activist in his own words
The dissident won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for his "long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China", but he was not permitted to travel to Norway to accept it.
He was the second person to receive the award while in prison - the other was the German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, who won in 1935 while incarcerated in a Nazi concentration camp.
China media silent on Liu Xiaobo death

Chinese authorities refused Liu Xiaobo's dying request to be allowed to travel abroad for treatment. Instead he died as he had lived, under the close watch of the one-party state.
The life and death of this Nobel laureate underline the cost of political defiance in China. Liu Xiaobo had enjoyed a comfortable early career as a university professor, but the massacre which followed the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests was the fork in his path.
Where many gave up demanding democracy, he stood firm and was jailed repeatedly. When he won the Nobel, he was serving a prison sentence for subversion. A furious Beijing subsequently placed his wife under house arrest.
Only in a hospital ward in the last days of his life have this suffering couple been reunited, to be parted again by his death.

In the weeks leading up to his death, Mr Liu's case became mired in international controversy. Several Western countries urged China to allow Mr Liu to leave the country to seek palliative care elsewhere.
A German and an American doctor who recently visited and examined him in a hospital in the north-eastern city of Shenyang said he would be able to travel abroad. But Chinese medical experts insisted that he was too ill to travel.
Mr Liu's condition deteriorated shortly after he was admitted to hospital, according to Shenyang's First Hospital of China Medical University.
In a brief statement, Shenyang local officials said that Mr Liu had suffered multiple organ failure, and that efforts to save the activist had failed.
At a press conference, Teng Yue'e, the doctor who led the team treating Mr Liu, said: "He was not in any pain at that moment, he was very much at peace, because all of his relatives said their goodbyes beforehand."
Liu Xiaobo memorialised in social art
Coverage on mainland China has been muted - with only a few short reports in English.
Xinhua and CCTV news have issued short statements on their English sites stating that Liu Xiaobo, "convicted of subversion of state power", has died.
Communist Party mouthpiece Global Times said Mr Liu was "a victim led astray" by the West.
"The Chinese side has been focusing on Liu's treatment, but some Western forces are always attempting to steer the issue in a political direction, hyping the treatment as a 'human rights' issue," the Global Times added.
Official Chinese-language news sites on the mainland appear to have steered clear of reporting the story altogether.
Social media users have also noticed attempts from government censors to mute reaction online.
Many comments appear to have been deleted, including messages with "RIP" or candle emojis, popular when commemorating someone who has died.
