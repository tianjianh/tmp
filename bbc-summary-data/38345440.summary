[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County silent on Notts County Ladies' future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County Football Club have refused to comment on a document which has appeared at Companies House which suggests Notts County Ladies Football Club Limited will be dissolved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Notts owner Ray Trew, who wants to sell the League Two club, also owns Women's Super League team Notts County Ladies.
The document says Notts County Ladies Limited will be dissolved two months from 13 December.
But the club would not say what this means for the women's team.
Notts Ladies, who play their home matches at the club's Meadow Lane ground, were formed in 2013 when Lincoln Ladies relocated to Nottingham.
The current squad includes England internationals Laura Bassett, Jess Clarke, Carly Telford, Jade Moore, Rachel Williams and Ellen White.
They finished sixth in the nine-team WSL1 last season and were Women's FA Cup runners-up in 2015.
The men's team face their second winding-up petition of the year brought by HM Revenue and Customs on 19 December, having had a separate order dismissed in May.
The club were also put under a temporary transfer embargo in May for money owed to football creditors.
Trew put Notts up for sale in February, but no buyer has yet been found.
