[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry driver who attempted to blackmail a Lincolnshire pumpkin farmer by telling him he had poisoned his crops has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Young demanded Â£50,000 from Spalding grower David Bowman warning that he had injected his pumpkins with deadly potassium cyanide.
Young, of Alfred Street, Boston, admitted a charge of blackmail between 1 and 5 September.
He was sentenced to eight years in jail at Lincoln Crown Court on Friday.
The court heard the 53-year-old issued his threat just a week before Mr Bowman, one of the largest pumpkin producers in Europe, was about to harvest.
He was forced to plough up a field losing Â£120,000 worth of crops, but tests later revealed Young had injected some of the vegetables with water.
Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said: "There is no evidence whatsoever that cyanide was ever used.
"The defendant sent photographs of pumpkins being injected with a substance and articles about potassium cyanide obtained from the internet.
"A letter said that the pumpkin crop had been selectively poisoned and warned Mr Bowman not to attempt to harvest or sell a single pumpkin until the blackmailer's demands were fully met."
Young demanded payment within seven days.
Mr Lody said: "Mr Bowman's immediate reaction was to call the police. One inquiry led to another and that led to the defendant."
In sentencing, Judge Michael Heath, said: "Let anyone who is minded to do the sort of thing that you did realise the sort of sentence that will follow."
Michael Cranmer-Brown, in mitigation, told the court that Young, who was in "dire financial straights", was "extremely sorry".
