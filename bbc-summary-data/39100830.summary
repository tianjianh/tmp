Munster had ended the Ospreys' 13-game unbeaten run with a late 25-23 victory on 18 February to go top of the Pro12.
In their first game since the defeat, Tandy's side sealed a bonus-point win against Glasgow to move up to second.
"We were more stressed than we would have liked to have been, but it's five points," Tandy told BBC Wales.
He continued: "Bouncing back from Munster and losing the lead [against Glasgow], I think the boys responded defensively.
"We put a huge shift in, but there was probably a little too much defending than we'd like to because I think we were a little bit loose with our possession but ultimately it was a good five points."
Tandy has been forced to use his squad depth as captain Alun Wyn Jones and fly-halves Sam Davies and Dan Biggar are on Wales duty, but is pleased with his side's resolve.
Ospreys were forced into a late change when Dafydd Howells replaced Hanno Dirksen on the wing while former South Africa international Brian Mujati made his debut after joining earlier in February.
"There are some bruised bodies from Munster but we've found a way and it's great to see those young guys coming through," he said.
"Five points against Glasgow and Ifan [Phillips] coming on has done really well and we've got Brian [Mujati] making his debut which is really pleasing.
"On the flip side you look at Rory [Thornton], such a young man, making his fiftieth appearance so we had a bit of experience out there."
