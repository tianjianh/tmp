The use of food banks in Wales "remains at record levels" despite a slight drop, a charity has said.

Trussell Trust figures showed 85,656 three-day food packages were given out in the 2015/16 financial year, compared to 85,875 the year before.
It also said benefit delays and changes remained the biggest causes of Welsh food bank use, at 43% of all referrals.
Wales manager Tony Graham said 85,000 supplies given out in Wales is "85,000 too many".
Of those, 31,267 three-day food packages went to children, figures showed.
But the charity said it was not clear exactly how many people received help because some visited more than once.
"Hunger is clearly an issue that continues to have a real impact on people in this nation," Mr Graham said.
Meanwhile, the charity has partnered with Rhondda Cynon Taf council to see Â£20,000 go towards rolling out debt and money advice and budget cookery courses in food banks in the area.
