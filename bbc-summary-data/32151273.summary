The 20-year-old would have started the 2-0 defeat by Shrewsbury, but was left out of the squad entirely after arriving late to the ground.
"He's been disciplined internally," Awford told BBC Radio Solent.
"We've dealt with the situation with the full backing of Fulham [Passley's parent club]."
Awford confirmed the player would be available for Friday's game against Carlisle after he said sorry to the squad.
"He has apologised to the group so we draw a line under it and move on," added Awford. "He is available for Friday.
"It's not the first time it has happened. I'm all for giving people an opportunity and a chance and I've spoken to Josh."
