The body of Sonita Nijhawan, 38, was discovered at a house in the St George's Hill area of Weybridge on Saturday morning.
Preliminary post-mortem tests revealed she died from head and neck injuries, Surrey Police said.
Detectives are continuing to question a 46-year-old man arrested on suspicion of her murder.
Officers were called to the property in Crossfield Place, near Weybridge railway station, where they also found a man with serious injuries.
He was taken to hospital for treatment.
Police went to the house after being alerted by an ambulance crew.
The property is around the corner from a private estate, which has a golf club and tennis club and where six-bedroom homes are listed for about Â£14m.
The location is described by the St George's Hill Residents' Association as having been "designed for driven, motivated and successful high achievers".
One resident told BBC Surrey: "This is leafy Surrey. Everybody here commutes to London on the train.
"The station is a 10-minute walk from these houses, so there are a lot of commuters here. [It's] upper-middle class, very comfortable. No murders in our memory which goes [back] about 20 years."
