Two people were seriously hurt and 31 others injured in the blast in New Ferry, Wirral on Saturday evening.
More than 100 people were evacuated from their homes, but those living further away from the blast can now return, Wirral Borough Council said.
More residents should be allowed access to their homes over the next 24 hours.
The cordon around the immediate scene remains in place as the council, Merseyside Police, Merseyside Fire & Rescue Service, the Health and Safety Inspectorate and National Grid continue to jointly investigate the cause of the explosion.
Police are using sniffer dogs to search the debris.
On Wednesday, Wirral South MP Alison McGovern asked the prime minister for government help to assist the "devastated" area around the blast site.
A community hub opened at New Ferry village hall has been giving support and advice to people and businesses affected by the explosion.
