Ninety one 'surplus' courts face closure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government is consulting on plans to close 91 courts and tribunals in England and Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The aim is to reduce what Justice Secretary Michael Gove has identified as "surplus capacity".
Courts under threat include 57 magistrates' courts, 19 county courts, two crown courts, four tribunal hearing centres and nine combined courts.
Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service operates 460 courts and tribunal hearing centres.
The government has also announced it is "integrating" a further 31 tribunals in England and Wales.
In a written statement, the parliamentary under-secretary of state for courts and legal aid, Shailesh Vara, said the service's estate was "underused"  and cost the taxpayer about Â£500m every year.
He said better access to justice could only be provided if "difficult decisions" were taken to reduce the cost of the estate and reinvest the savings.
"Last year over a third of all courts and tribunals were empty for more than 50% of their available hearing time," he said.
"The buildings being consulted on represent 16% of hearing rooms across the estate which are, on average, used for only a third of their available time.
"That is equivalent to fewer than two out of five days in a week."
Technology such as video, telephone and online conferencing would reduce the need for face-to-face hearings, which should be reserved for "the most sensitive or complex cases", Mr Vara said.
In rural locations, public buildings, such as town halls, could be used for hearings instead of "underused, poorly-maintained permanent courts", he suggested.
He said that after the changes, more than 95% of citizens would still be able to reach their required court within an hour by car.
The Public and Commercial Services union, which represents many court workers, said the proposals would restrict access to justice. It promised to challenge the Ministry of Justice's method for calculating underuse of courtrooms.
General Secretary Mark Serwotka said: "With courts closures and cuts to legal aid, access to justice has been significantly restricted by the previous government and now this one.
"We do not believe it is in the interests of justice to leave our communities without easy access to courthouses and tribunals."
Lucy Hastings, of the independent charity Victim Support, said the government needed to make the court process more efficient.
She said the Crown Court system was taking longer than at any point in the past 15 years to process cases, and the backlog of outstanding cases now stood at over 54,000.
"Action is required to reduce the long waits faced by victims and witnesses in seeing offenders brought to justice," she said.
The consultation will run for 12 weeks until 8 October.
