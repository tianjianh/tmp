[SN]TITLE[SN]
Temporary bridge to reopen 'vital' County Durham route

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A temporary crossing is to be installed above a bridge in County Durham which closed after inspectors identified "issues with its structural integrity".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Traffic and pedestrians were banned from Deerness Bridge, between Ushaw Moor and New Brancepeth, on 13 April.
Durham County Council is to install a replacement Bailey bridge so people can cross the river while a permanent solution is developed.
The council said the "vital route" is expected to open by the end of May.
