The McIlvanney Prize - previously known as the Scottish Crime Book of the year - was presented at the Bloody Scotland festival in Stirling.
Brookmyre took the Â£1,000 prize for his novel Black Widow.
The other short-listed authors were Doug Johnston, Val McDermid and ES Thomson.
Judges described Brookmyre's novel as being "like watching Olympic diving", adding: "Just when you think the plot can't twist again, it takes a new turn. Even the twists have twists."
William Mcilvanney, who died last year, is regarded by many as the founder of tartan noir, a particularly Scottish style of gritty crime writing.
His brother, renowned sports journalist Hugh McIlvanney, presented Brookmyre with the inaugural award.
