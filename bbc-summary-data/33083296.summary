St Gemma's Hospice in Garforth said on its Facebook page it is desperate to find the "true gent" who gave his wife's dress to charity.
The message attached to the 1950s dress reads: "I wish any lady who takes this dress to have a life with her loved one 56 years like I did."
Photographs of the item on social media have received more than 1,000 likes.
Due to interest in the dress from as far afield as the United States, the charity said it had decided to auction it on eBay.
