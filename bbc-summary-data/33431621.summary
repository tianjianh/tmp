[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has raised concerns with a football club after a player died after sliding into its clubhouse while making a tackle.

Ben Hiscox, 30, was playing for Stoke Gifford Utd in March when he hit the building, near Bristol.
He was rushed to hospital but died days later.
Recording a verdict of accidental death, Deputy Avon Coroner Terence Moore described it as a tragedy which should not be repeated.
The inquest heard that Mr Hiscox, from Stoke Gifford, was a "much loved son, brother, partner and step-father".
He was playing at his club's home ground against Mangotsfield Sports in the Bristol and Suburban Association Football League on 28 March when, 10 minutes into the second half, he made a tackle, stumbled and fell backwards into the club house, banging his head, causing serious injuries.
Although no-one was blamed for Mr Hiscox's death, Mr Moore said he would write to the FA, Stoke Gifford United and the parish council, which owns the ground, about the size of the "run-off" around the pitch.
The clubhouse was about two metres from the edge of the pitch - the FA recommends a minimum of three metres for lower league clubs.
Mr Hiscox's father Clive said his son's death had been "an awful freak accident".
He added: "My main concern really is seeing where the actual pitch is sited and the clubhouse. I would just hate anybody to have to experience the pain and suffering we have since Ben's death."
A spokesman for the club, Ben Bennett, who was also a friend of Mr Hiscox, said they would make changes, possibly using crash mats, to avoid a repeat of the accident.
