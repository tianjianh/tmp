Groves, 28, has won his last four bouts since losing three world title fights - two to Carl Froch and one against Badou Jack.
"Confirmed. I fight Chudinov for the WBA super-middleweight championship of the world," Groves said on Twitter.
No date has been arranged for a fight against the Russian, who has lost just one of 15 contests.
Chudinov was beaten by Felix Sturm in February but the German vacated the belt in October because of an elbow injury.
Last month, Groves retained his WBA International super-middleweight title after a unanimous points win over Eduard Gutknecht.
The German fell ill in his changing room and was taken to hospital for surgery, and according to Groves, was still in a coma 12 days later.
