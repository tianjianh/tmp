Lily Partridge, 22, collapsed at the side of the pitch after getting hurt during a tackle in December.
Lead singer Chris Martin, who knew the family, donated the instrument along with some signed drumsticks and records.
The auction, held in Topsham, Devon, on Saturday, raised more than £20,000.
A memorial game between Ms Partridge's Exonian Ladies club and Newton Abbot Ladies also took place and was the first game the side had played since her death.
Lily's parents, Jeff and Liz Partridge, said: "The whole day and evening was beyond our wildest dreams and we are still buzzing.
"We just want to thank everybody who was involved and the girls from both teams, its sums up the atmosphere and camaraderie of the club.
"We cannot thank everyone enough for what they have done in Lily's memory."
It was revealed at her funeral at Exeter Cathedral that Ms Partridge saved the lives of at least four people as she was an organ donor.
The money raised from the auction will be donated to the Devon Air Ambulance, Exeter Intensive Care Unit and Shaldon Zoo, where she worked.
