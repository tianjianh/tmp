Dundee site takes over Inverness fire control room calls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) has shut its operations control room in Inverness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency calls for the Highlands and Islands will now be handled by staff based in Dundee.
SFRS said they were working from "hi-spec modular accommodation" near to where a new North Control building is being constructed at MacAlpine Road.
Dundee already handles calls for north east Scotland following the closure of Aberdeen's control room last month.
SFRS said the public would see no difference in how calls were handled.
The fire service said it had "worked closely" with staff at Inverness "to accommodate their needs" throughout the process to close the Highland site and shift call handling to Dundee.
Staff who have decided to take voluntary severance, or early retirement, will continue to work to ensure "the smooth transition of operations for a period afterwards", said SFRS.
Two members of staff from Inverness have decided to take up jobs at the control room in Dundee.
Construction of North Control is expected to be completed in March next year.
The control room closures were approved in 2014.
