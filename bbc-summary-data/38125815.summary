[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Rangers oldco administrators raise legal action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two former Rangers oldco administrators have raised legal action against Police Scotland and the lord advocate after charges linked to their time at Ibrox were dropped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Proceedings over the alleged fraudulent acquisition of the club were dropped against Paul Clark and David Whitehouse earlier this year.
They became joint administrators of Rangers in February 2012.
The action is against Chief Constable Phil Gormley and senior legal figures.
A statement from Livingston Brown, the solicitors for Mr Whitehouse, said: "We can confirm that David Whitehouse and Paul Clark have initiated legal proceedings against the Chief Constable of Police Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal and the Lord Advocate.
"As these proceedings are under way it would be inappropriate for us to say anything more at this time."
The Crown Office confirmed in June that proceedings were no longer live against Mr Clark and Mr Whitehouse but have not commented on the latest development.
