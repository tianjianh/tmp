[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sospan Skips, Llanelli, dumped tonnes of waste on farmland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staff at a skip hire firm have been sentenced for illegally dumping thousands of tonnes of waste.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Charles, Bruce Charles and Susan Charles of Llanelli's Sospan Skips admitted environmental charges.
Waste and asbestos was dumped on farmland in Carmarthenshire.
William Charles got a 26-week sentence, suspended for two years, Bruce Charles got a two-year community order and Susan Charles was given a conditional discharge at Swansea Crown Court.
The court heard several thousand tonnes of industrial and general waste was dumped and William Charles also disposed of asbestos on land at Caemawr Farm in Furnace, Llanelli.
All three admitted offences relating to the operation of regulated facilities for the storage, reclamation and disposal of waste, without any permits, at Caemawr Farm and Berwick Farm between April 2009 and May 2014.
The company itself also faced charges and guilty pleas were entered for these offences.
William and Bruce Charles will also have to complete 200 hours of unpaid work.
William Charles was the sole company director of Sospan Skips while Susan Charles was the company secretary.
Bruce Charles, who also owned Berwick Farm in Bynea, Llanelli, played a part in the dumping without the necessary permits.
Judge Paul Thomas described Bruce Charles's behaviour as "reckless" and said his brother's methods were "cynical".
