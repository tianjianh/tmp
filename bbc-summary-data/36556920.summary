[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Dame Laura Davies shared the lead after carding her best round of the year on day one of the Meijer LPGA Classic in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The 52-year-old shot a six-under-par 65 to sit alongside four other players, including American defending champion Lexi Thompson.
Davies has not won an event on the LPGA Tour since 2001.
Spain's Carlota Ciganda, See Young Kim of South Korea and South African Paula Reto are also six under par.
Former world number one Davies has fallen to 275th in the rankings and has not finished higher than 54th in an event this year.
She was three under after eight holes and, though she dropped a shot just before the turn, four more birdies on the back nine left her well placed.
Thompson, who started at the 10th, had nine pars in her opening nine holes before an eagle at the par-five first, three successive birdies from the third and another at the eighth.
World number one Lydia Ko is one of seven players on four under.
