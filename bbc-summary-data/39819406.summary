The pair played a combined 628 games for the club, helping them stay in National League South this season.
Keeper Martin Rice, in his fourth spell at Truro, will also leave along with ex-Plymouth defender Aaron Bentley.
Ryan Brett, Ben Adelsbury and Ollie Knowles complete the exodus from the Cornish side, led by Lee Hodges.
A club statement said: "We have to acknowledge that last season's performances were not of the standard that we and the supporters expect.
"Changes in the playing staff are therefore essential and Lee and Chris [Todd, assistant manager] will be rebuilding over the close season."
Speaking after their final game of the campaign, Hodges told BBC Radio Cornwall his side had underachieved by a "country mile" by finishing 19th.
