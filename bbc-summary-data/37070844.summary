The eight medals - three golds, four silvers and one bronze - represented Britain's most successful day of the Games so far and kept GB third in the medal table on 30 - one more than at the same stage of London 2012.

Trott, 24, is the first female GB competitor to win a third gold, having triumphed alongside Joanna Rowsell-Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald.
Another medal in the velodrome came via Becky James, who claimed a silver in the keirin.
The evening athletics action had been billed as a chance for Britain to replicate Super Saturday in London when Farah, Rutherford and Ennis-Hill all won golds.
But Ennis-Hill had to settle for silver after a thrilling finish to the heptathlon won by Belgian Nafi Thiam, with GB's Katarina Johnson-Thompson sixth after poor throws in the javelin.
Tearful Ennis-Hill, 30, said afterwards this was her last Olympics and hinted she could retire from the sport altogether.

Jamaica's Usain Bolt began his quest for a third successive Olympic 100m title by cruising through the opening heats.
The reigning Olympic champion at 100m, 200m and the 4x100m relay clocked 10.07 seconds despite easing up 50 metres from the finish line.

Asked about American swimmer Lilly King's comments that people who have been caught doping "shouldn't be on the team", Gatlin, twice been caught using banned substances, responded: "I don't even know who Lilly King is."

"Hopefully this will work," said a Rio 2016 spokesman, who said it was important the synchronised swimmers had crystal clear water to compete in so they can see each another and the judges can see them perform.
