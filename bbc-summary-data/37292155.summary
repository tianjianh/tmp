[SN]TITLE[SN]
Flooded Gloucester City Football Club stadium approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been approved that will enable a new football stadium for Gloucester City to be built, nine years after the club's ground was flooded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Vanarama National League North side have been without a permanent home since their Meadow Park ground was destroyed in the summer of 2007.
The Tigers have ground-shared with Cheltenham Town, Forest Green Rovers and Cirencester Town ever since.
It means work on the 4,000 capacity stadium project can finally begin.
Outline planning permission was granted for the project in September last year, but the club asked for permission to carry out work in phases, rather than all at once.
At a meeting on Tuesday evening Gloucester City Council planners approved variations to conditions of the planning permission, meaning work can now begin before a footpath is widened and bicycle parking is built.
