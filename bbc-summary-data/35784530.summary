Bristol City have signed striker Peter Odemwingie on loan from Stoke for the remainder of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 34-year-old Nigeria international has failed to score in eight appearances for the Potters this term.
Odemwingie moved to Stoke in January 2014 as part of a player-exchange with Kenwyne Jones going in the opposite direction to Cardiff City.
"I'm looking forward to working with him," Robins head coach Lee Johnson told the club website.
"I'm delighted we've been able to bring someone of Peter's quality in; he'll provide us with experience and hopefully goals in one form or another."
Odemwingie, who goes into City's squad for Saturday's game against Fulham, enjoyed his most prolific spell in England at West Brom - where he netted 31 goals in 90 appearances.
