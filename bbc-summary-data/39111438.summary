[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United v Brighton & Hove Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham captain Lee Frecklington (ankle) is likely to start after making his return from injury as a sub in the defeat by Aston Villa on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell remains out with a hand injury.
Brighton centre-back Shane Duffy (metatarsal) is out for six weeks, with Uwe Hunemeier in line to replace him.
Left-backs Gaetan Bong (knee) and Sebastien Pocognoli (groin) are still sidelined, while centre-back Connor Goldson (heart) is out for the season.
On-loan striker Chuba Akpom will be assessed.
Despite having to deal with a host of defensive injuries, Albion boss Chris Hughton saw Liam Rosenior return to first-team action during Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest following six months out with ankle trouble.
The reverse at the City Ground meant Brighton suffered back-to-back league defeats for the first time since September, and the Seagulls are six points ahead of third-placed Huddersfield in the table, having played a game more than the Terriers.
The Millers have won just one of their last 12 games in the Championship.
