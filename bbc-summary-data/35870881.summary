Police on A303 deplore speeding motorists caught doing 100mph

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three drivers were caught doing speeds of more than 100mph in a 30-minute period as police carried out roadside checks in Wiltshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers recorded one man doing 114mph on the dual carriageway section of the A303 between Mere and Wylye on Saturday.
Five more drivers were stopped during Sunday for doing more than 100mph.
All face prosecution for speeding on the A303, part of one of the main routes between London and Cornwall.
The road is 92 miles (148km) in length and runs through five counties - the main route between Basingstoke, Hampshire and Honiton in Devon.
PC Will Ayres said this group of drivers were "vastly over the speed limit".
"These people do not think about the devastation that they could cause in a split second which is sadly something we see all too often on our roads."
