Danny Cipriani ready for England, says Sale Sharks chief

Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani's form this season is edging him into England's Six Nations squad, says Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond.

Cipriani kicked all of Sale's points - four penalties and a drop-goal - as they beat Wasps 15-9 on Saturday.
The 28 year old missed out to Saracens' Owen Farrell and Bath's George Ford for a place at last year's World Cup.
"He's playing really well. I think he's pushing himself into that potential England squad," said Diamond.
"Certainly with Bath in the doldrums, you learn more playing for a club like Sale when it doesn't always go well and you have to learn how to develop as a player.
"Danny's done that over the past two or three years, hence why he said last week that he wants to stay around for the next couple of years."
Ford, who started the World Cup as England's first choice fly-half, is part of a Bath side that sit eighth in the Premiership, while Farrell's Saracens are unbeaten so far this season.
Cipriani, who signed a new two-year contract at Sale last February, will hope to be included in new England head coach Eddie Jones' first squad.
"He understands what he's got to do," added Diamond. "He's had a rough time goal-kicking and he's put the hours in.
"We virtually open the stadium here every day for him to practice.
"It's just been his maturity as a player. As a bloke, he's grown out of all of his shenanigans when he came, and we're three or four years down the line now."
