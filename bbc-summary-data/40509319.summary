Planning officials have advised refusal for a wind farm the Mountaineering Council of Scotland said would form a "ring of steel" around a Galloway hill.

Developer Burcote Wind has voiced disappointment at the recommendation for its 10-turbine Longburn project.
It said it had worked closely with communities over five years to make it suitable for the site near Carsphairn.
However, Dumfries and Galloway Council is being advised to reject the scheme due to cumulative landscape impact.
Last year the MCS raised its concerns about the project's impact on Cairnsmore of Carsphairn.
The organisation said the project would "close the circle" around the peak.
Now the scheme is to be discussed by the planning committee of the local authority in Dumfries and Galloway.
It is being advised to turn it down.
Planning officers said it would have "significant adverse cumulative impacts" on the landscape and visual amenity of the site surroundings and wider area.
They also found it would have an effect on "cultural heritage assets" in the site.
Burcote Energy said it was disappointed by the recommendation for the scheme which could put about Â£2.5m into a community benefit fund over its operational lifetime.
Operations director Fraser Campbell said: "While the recommendation is based on landscape and visual and cultural heritage impacts, we have had no objections from either SNH or Historic Environment Scotland.
"We have been working on the site for over five years now and worked closely with the communities over the years to ensure that our application is well designed and suited to the site."
He said they respected the planners' position but did not agree with it.
The company also cited support from Dumfries and Galloway Chamber of Commerce and local logistics firm Currie European.
