Carmarthenshire adult education classes axed after budget cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Language, IT and arts classes are to be cut in Carmarthenshire after councillors voted to end some adult education courses due to budget cuts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The executive board has agreed to focus on courses including adult basic education and English classes for speakers of other languages.
Other subjects affected will include humanities and crafts.
The council's Adult Community Learning Service would be restructured and 46 jobs could be affected, said a report.
It said the non-statutory service had seen a Â£289,000 cut in funds.
Management and running costs for Ammanford's Cennen Centre and Felinfoel Community Education Centre will also cease at the end of March.
Responsibility for Glanamman Community Centre will be transferred to Cwmamman Town Council.
After the meeting, Councillor Gareth Jones, cabinet member for education, said the authority had hoped to set up a partnership with Coleg Sir Gar to take on some of the courses but that it was facing an "horrendous" problem with its own budget cuts.
