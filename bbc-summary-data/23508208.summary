Behind the scenes at the Mormon British Pageant, Chorley

There are 190,000 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the UK, and it feels like most of them have descended on a Lancashire town.

Mormons from across the country have been preparing for the start of a religious pageant marking the 175th anniversary of the church in Britain.
It's a hive of activity as over 1,000 volunteers work behind the scenes at a temple close to the town of Chorley.
The idea to organise a British Pageant started four years ago.
Pageants take place annually in the United States, but the organisers said this is the first to be held in Europe.
The Preston Temple site was chosen for its connections to the faith.
The first Mormon missionaries were sent from New York to Liverpool in 1837, led by the Apostle Heber C Kimball.
They first preached in Preston in July of that year, and baptised their first nine converts the same month in the River Ribble.
The pageant tells their story, with an original script that includes extracts from their journals.
