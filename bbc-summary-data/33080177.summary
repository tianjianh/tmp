Husband of Derry and Strabane mayor charged with assaulting couple

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 34-year-old man, who is the husband of the mayor of Derry and Strabane, has been charged with assaulting a couple in their 50s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Declan Aaron McCallion, from Elaghmore Park in the Galliagh area of Londonderry, is the husband of Sinn Mayor Elisha McCallion.
He has been charged with physically assaulting a man.
He is also charged with assaulting the man's wife by placing her in fear of immediate violence.
He was released on bail and ordered not to be intoxicated in public.
Mr McCallion has been further charged with disorderly behaviour and with resisting a police officer in the due execution of his duty.
The four offences are alleged to have happened before midnight on 19 May at Academy Road.
A police officer told district judge Barney McElholm that he could connect the defendant to each of the four charges.
A defence solicitor said he had no questions for the officer and added that the case should not trouble the court.
The solicitor applied for the case to be adjourned until 17 June to allow him to receive information on other matters.
His application was granted by the district judge.
As part of his bail conditions Mr McCallion must submit to a preliminary breath test if he is ever asked to do so by the police.
The judge also ordered the defendant not to have any direct or indirect contact with the injured parties or with any prosecution witnesses in the case.
