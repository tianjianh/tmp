The Cumbrians have also agreed a one-year deal with 23-year-old Greenock Morton midfielder Joe McKee.
Adams, 29, joined the Cobblers from Bury at the end of the 2014-15 season and made 45 appearances in his one year at Sixfields, scoring three goals.
"We wish Nicky well," said Northampton manager Rob Page.
"He had already requested the opportunity to move back nearer to his family before my arrival, and after further discussion we felt it was the right thing."
United boss Keith Curle told the club website: "Nicky's a player we first looked at bringing through the door in January and it's good that we've been able to follow it up.
"He is an excellent player with a lot of good attributes and we are very much looking forward to working with him."
Wales Under-21 representative Adams, who lists Leicester, Rochdale and Crawley among his former clubs, has won back-to-back promotions with Bury and then Northampton in the past two seasons.
Fellow signing McKee will move to Brunton Park after a three-season spell with Morton at Cappielow Park, during which time he helped the club into the Scottish Championship in 2014-15.
The Scotland Under-19 international, a former Burnley and Bolton player in the English league, has an option of an extended deal.
Meanwhile, Northampton have signed midfielder Shaun McWilliams on a two-year professional contract. The 17-year-old has been with the club since he was 14.
