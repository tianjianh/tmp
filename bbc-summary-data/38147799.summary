A toy company's vintage plastic carrier bag has gone under the hammer for £240.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bag from the Palitoy factory shop featured brand logos including Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Play-Doh and Strawberry Shortcake.
It was described as in "good condition" and coming from "Palitoy's Staff Shop over on Baker Street in Coalville", Leicestershire.
A collector paid more than eight times the £20 to £30 estimate at Vectis Auction House in Thornaby, Teesside.
No date of manufacture was given for the bag but Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980.
