The 31-year-old, who can also play in midfield, scored 48 goals in 227 appearances for the Dons, helping them reach the Championship in 2014-15.
He joins winger Daniel Powell in making the move from Stadium:MK to Justin Edinburgh's Cobblers this summer.
"We are really pleased to bring Dean to the club," said Edinburgh.
"He is a versatile attacking player, he can play as a striker, as a midfielder or in the hole and he gives us options.
"We have spoken a lot about putting together a well-balanced attacking unit with options and Dean fits in with that policy."
