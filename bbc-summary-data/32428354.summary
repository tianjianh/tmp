The expected chilly conditions follow a period of warm, dry and sunny weather.
Temperatures reached 20C in places including Inverness, Aboyne, Aviemore, Tyndrum and Glasgow on Wednesday.
Some of the wintriest weather has been forecast for Aviemore where there could be light snow and temperatures falling to -1C.
The recent spell of dry and warm weather has been a factor behind a number of wildfires in the Highlands and Western Isles.
On Wednesday, firefighters tackled a blaze at Daviot Wood near Inverness and a larger fire on a hillside above the A82 near Fort Augustus.
Firefighters from Fort Augustus, Drumnadrochit, Foyers, Spean Bridge and Cannich prevented the hillside wildfire from reaching nearby properties.
Crews remained at the scene until 07:00 on Thursday.
