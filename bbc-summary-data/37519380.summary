Officers converged on the Robroyston area of the city at about 10:55. They later cordoned off Robroyston Road.
Police have now confirmed that "vehicle tyre deflation rounds were discharged directly into vehicle tyres".
The nature of the operation has yet to be disclosed but the use of the shotgun rounds will be referred to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner.
In a statement, Police Scotland said: "Around 1055 hours on Friday 30 September 2016, Police Scotland officers carried out an intelligence-led operation in the Robroyston area of Glasgow.
"As part of the operation, vehicle tyre deflation rounds were discharged directly into vehicle tyres.
"This is a recognised and practiced tactic which is used specifically to disable a vehicle and was deployed in order to reduce any potential wider impact to the public and to maximise their safety."
The statement added: "As a result, and in line with the routine procedure, this incident will be referred to PIRC for review."
A spokesman for the PIRC said: "Police Scotland has notified the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner of an incident in Robroyston, Glasgow, on 30 September 2016, where officers fired tyre deflation rounds (TDR) at a vehicle as part of an ongoing police operation.
"The PIRC will assess the circumstances of the police use of TDRs before determining whether there is a need to investigate further."
