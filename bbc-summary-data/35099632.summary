[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three young chihuahuas have been stolen during a break-in at a house near Falkirk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prince, Princess and Coco are all under a year old and were taken from the home in Hallglen between 19:15 and 23:45 on Saturday.
Owner Victoria Black returned from a night out to find the dogs gone, along with a three-figure sum of money and Christmas presents.
Police Scotland said they were worried the thieves might try to sell the dogs.
Prince is described as mainly black with tan and white patches on his stomach, Coco has short ginger hair and Princess has a long ginger coat.
Appeals and pictures of the chihuahuas have been posted on dog websites and social media and their owner is offering a reward for their return.
Ms Black posted on Facebook: "These dogs are my babies and I'm asking that if anyone can help with information in the recovery of my dogs there is a reward. Please help."
Sgt Lyne Rushford said: "We are obviously concerned for the dogs' welfare and would be keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time, or who has information that can help us trace those responsible.
"We would also ask anyone offered these dogs for sale to get in touch with us straight away."
