[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrea Barzagli scored in the first half and Mario Lemina in the second as Juventus went clear of Napoli.
Juventus restored their advantage with 10 games remaining after Napoli had moved level on points with a 3-1 home win against Chievo on Saturday.
Atalanta remain in mid-table and are without a win in 13 games.
Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has now gone 836 minutes of league action without conceding a goal - a new record for Serie A since three points were awarded for a win in 1994.
Another clean sheet edged him closer to the overall record of 929 minutes, set by AC Milan's Sebastiano Rossi in 1993/94.
Juventus went ahead in the 24th minute when Barzagli seized on a header from Mario Mandzukic and finished from close range.
The visitors held on in the second half despite late pressure from the hosts before doubling their lead with four minutes remaining when substitute Lemina produced a weaving run and cool finish.
Fifth-placed Inter Milan maintained their pursuit of Champions League qualification by seeing off Palermo 3-1 to win for just the fourth time in 2016.
The win saw Inter extend their lead over sixth-placed AC Milan to four points after their local rivals lost 2-0 at Sassuolo.
