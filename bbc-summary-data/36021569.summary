[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 1-3 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jake Jervis scored twice to defeat Leyton Orient and keep Plymouth's hopes of automatic promotion alive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Hartley ghosted in unmarked at the back post to direct the impressive Graham Carey's free-kick into the net.
Jervis doubled Plymouth's lead after the break, heading home Carey's free-kick before Orient received a lifeline with Lloyd James scoring from the spot.
But Mathieu Baudry's ill-judged back pass found Jervis, who slotted into an empty net to make sure of the win.
Leyton Orient head coach Andy Hessenthaler told BBC Radio London:

"It's so crucial that you're good in both boxes, and certainly set plays, we didn't defend them.
"Two set plays and a mistake at the end has cost us the game.
"The one just before half-time was a bit of a kick in the teeth because there was nothing really in the game in the first half."
