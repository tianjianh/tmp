Stormont: Máirtín Ó Muilleoir keen on one-year budget

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The executive could be set to scrap plans for a multi-year budget because of uncertainty around UK public spending after the Brexit vote.

Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir has told executive colleagues he would like to produce a one-year plan for all day-to-spending in 2017/18.
"There is too much uncertainty in the air," he told BBC Radio Ulster's Inside Business programme.
He added a one-year budget was "the prudent way forward".
The budget cannot be put together until Chancellor Philip Hammond's Autumn Statement, with its likely knock-on consequences for the Stormont block grant.
The executive had been working towards a multi-year budget which would cover the entire period up until the next Stormont election in 2021.
While he has proposed a one-year budget, Mr Ó Muilleoir said he also intended to produce a separate four-year budget for capital spending that will cover projects, including the A5 and A6 roads.
He said he was also firming up details of a "stimulus package," promising "plenty of actions to build up the economy."
"It's very important we don't fall into the trap of focussing on where the [Brexit] negotiations will bring us and forget about the here and now," he added. "And the here and now is getting young people into work".
