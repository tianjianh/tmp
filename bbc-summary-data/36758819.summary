The fire damaged the Wan Chai Corner's basement kitchen, and the roof was also badly damaged.
Ten people left the building before fire crews arrived at midday and there were no reports of any injuries.
Six fire engines and 35 firefighters tackled the blaze, which sent thick smoke billowing around Gerrard Place and nearby Soho and Chinatown.
Station Manager Lisa Hicks later said crews had extinguished a fire in the basement kitchen, bringing the fire under control.
Shaftesbury Avenue was closed each way between Wardour Street and Cambridge Circus following the fire.
