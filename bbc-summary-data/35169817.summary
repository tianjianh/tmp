[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Foden and Christian Day are among four players to have agreed new deals with Northampton Saints.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Full-back Foden, 30, has played 174 times for the Premiership side and been capped 34 times by England.
Second-row Day, 32, has made 175 Saints appearances and is also chairman of the Rugby Players' Association.
Saints academy graduate hooker Mikey Haywood, 24, and wing Jamie Elliott, 23, who have both played over 100 games, have also signed new deals.
Director of rugby Jim Mallinder said: "Having players like Mikey and Jamie come through the academy system to become important members of the first-team squad is very pleasing, and a good indicator of the outstanding work that is being done by our coaches across the region."
Both Foden and Day arrived at Franklin's Gardens in 2008, and have helped Northampton win one Premiership title, two European Challenge Cups and one LV= Cup, as well as playing in a Heineken Cup final.
Foden told BBC Radio Northampton: "I spoke to Jim early doors and he asked me 'what are your thoughts?' There's nowhere else I'd rather be than Northampton.
"Since coming back to the Premiership I've been part of the whole building process. I think we're one of the top teams in England and Europe.
"I've still got plans on winning major silverware and hopefully I can do that at Northampton."
The lengths of the deals have not been disclosed.
