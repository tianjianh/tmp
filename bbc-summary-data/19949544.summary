Visit Suffolk considers 'The Curious County' slogan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A proposal to promote Suffolk as 'The Curious County' is being criticised by politicians.

The slogan is being considered by Visit Suffolk for a tourism campaign in 2013.
Peter Aldous, MP for Waveney, said: "It could mean interesting and unusual, but it also means odd and it doesn't stand out as the right branding."
The advertising agency behind it said it was meant to describe the range of attractions on offer and generate conversation and reaction.
Mr Aldous said: "To my mind it doesn't seem the most obvious way of marketing the county and getting people to come here."
Guy McGregor, a Suffolk Country Councillor, said: "Are the coast, Constable Country or the Waveney Valley curious?
"It's certainly an attractive place to visit, but will the slogan make it a more attractive place to visit?
"There's got to be a grain of truth, but I'm not sure the idea of Suffolk as a curious county will resonate with people."
James Kindred, from the agency Condiment, said: "We wanted to get people's interest piqued a little bit from outside Suffolk in a way that would generate conversation and a reaction, which is one of the most important things in marketing."
Chris Waters, from Condiment, said: "It's very difficult to describe a quintessential Suffolk scene - is it the coast, the countryside or the coastal towns which, even when they're next to each other such as Lowestoft and Southwold, are very different?
"Ultimately, we think we've created something that's good and we stand by our idea."
Amanda Bond, brand manager for Visit Suffolk, said: "The crux of the concept is simple and unlike anything that's been done before, which is why there's naturally trepidation.
"We want holidaymakers to visit our curious assets for themselves."
