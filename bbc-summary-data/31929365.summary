[SN]TITLE[SN]
RMT union to ballot over offshore action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RMT union is to ballot offshore members over industrial action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union said it was as a result of concern about a range of issues including staffing levels, shift patterns and pay.
General secretary Mick Cash said the RMT would be working with sister unions.
Last month, GMB Scotland announced that a consultative ballot on possible strike action by North Sea contract workers was to be held.
The Offshore Contractors Association previously said it was a challenging time for the North Sea oil and gas industry.
