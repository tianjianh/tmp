Brazil prosecutor seeks removal of Congress speaker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brazil's prosecutor general has called for the lower house of Congress speaker, Eduardo Cunha, to be sacked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rodrigo Janot, told the Supreme Court Mr Cunha was using his political position to avoid investigation for alleged corruption.
Mr Cunha is being investigated over a massive kick-back scandal at the state-run oil company, Petrobras.
He is also the driving force behind impeachment proceedings against Brazil's President, Dilma Rousseff.
She faces accusations of breaking budget laws last year.
The Supreme Court has yet to rule on Mr Janot's request over Mr Cunha.
Mr Cunha is facing mounting pressure to resign. State prosecutors accuse him of lying about owning Swiss bank accounts and about having allegedly receiving bribes.
On Tuesday two of his properties, his official residence in Brasilia and a property in Rio de Janeiro were raided by federal police searching for evidence.
BBC Brazil correspondent Julia Carneiro quotes local reports as saying prosecutors have evidence that Mr Cunha received 52 million reais ($13m, Â£8.5m ) in bribes from companies paid into accounts in Switzerland and Israel.
Mr Cunha has responded by saying the investigation against him is an attempt to divert attention from the impeachment proceedings.
The Congressional ethics committee has also tried for months to begin investigations against Mr Cunha which he has blocked.
On Wednesday, the committee voted again to initiate its inquiry - an initiative, our correspondent says,  that may now gain some impetus with the prosecutor general's request to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court is meanwhile due to vote on Friday on whether to allow impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff to begin.
The move comes as rallies in 23 cities across Brazil began to show support for President Rousseff.
