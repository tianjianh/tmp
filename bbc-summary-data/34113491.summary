Another six people were being treated in hospital and two had serious injuries, officials said.
The cause of the explosion at the Pirotecnia Zaragozana plant was not yet clear to investigators.
The city is observing a day of mourning for the victims on Tuesday.
Five bodies were found late on Monday and the sixth was discovered on a farm next to the factory in Garrapinillos early on Tuesday, sources told Spanish media.
Officials in the northern Aragon region said one of the injured, a woman, was in a very serious condition.
At least 40 people work at the factory, but Spanish media said some 20 of them were at the site at the time of the explosion, which destroyed part of the building on Monday afternoon.
Pirotecnia Zaragozana, founded in 1860, exports fireworks to markets across Europe as well as to Canada.
The plant has seen disasters in the past, according to Spanish reports. Five workers died there in 1967 and another was killed in 1994, El Mundo said.
