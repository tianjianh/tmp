He reached three figures off 137 balls, after scoring the single to take the total to 250 and give them the second batting point they needed.
The home side were in trouble on 85-5, as Craig Meschede took three wickets.
But Adam Wheater (59) helped add 100 with Ten Doeschate (109*) as Essex closed on 275-6, just 11 behind.

Having begun the game requiring six points to secure promotion, that came down to five when title rivals Sussex failed to achieve maximum bonus points against Worcestershire at Hove.
Glamorgan only managed to add 30 to their overnight 256-7, as David Masters (2-58) took two of their final three wickets, including teenager Kiran Carlson, who was caught behind for 119.
Bowling out the Welsh county gave Essex three points, but they were soon in trouble in reply when Meschede produced a destructive spell with the new ball.
Ravi Bopara was stumped off spinner Owen Morgan, but the arrival of Ten Doeschate to join Wheater provided the stability the innings needed.
Wheater, in his first innings since rejoining the county from Hampshire, struck eight fours before he too fell to Morgan and it was former captain James Foster (33 not out) who kept Ten Doeschate company to the close in an unbroken stand of 90.
Essex captain Ryan ten Doeschate told BBC Essex:
"Job done. It would have been nicer to fly past the winning post, but as much as we tried to avoid it, this game was really about getting those bonus points.
"It's a bit weird winning it on day two, the game's not won and there's obviously a lot of work to do.
"But I think it's great to achieve what we set out to do at the start of the year.
"It's a massive clich√©, but everyone has chipped in. That's what you need to have a successful season."
Glamorgan all-rounder Craig Meschede told BBC Wales Sport:
"Credit to them, they've played very well all season so well done to them - but there's still a game of cricket to be played and won.
"It was pretty much the same situation (after his three early wickets in the Essex innings) that we were in, that once the ball gets softer, it didn't move around so much and it's easier to score runs.
"It's crucial we come back and get a few wickets, we've got the new ball early so we've got to make the most of that and bowl them over.
"It's definitely one of the hotter days I've played cricket in, even considering playing in South Africa, but you can't complain, it's meant to be a sunny sport."
