Street's wife says he died on 27 February at a hospital in Las Vegas after a short illness.
He sang with Temptations members Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin in the 1950s but didn't join the group until 1971.
As part of the group, Street had number of hits including the Grammy award-winning song, Papa Was a Rollin' Stone.
Born in Detroit, Michigan, he was the first member of the band to be born in the city with which they became synonymous.
His death comes only 10 days after his band mate, Otis 'Damon' Harris, who died on 18 February aged 62, after a 14 year battle with prostate cancer.
Cindy Street, told CNN: "They're dancing up there in heaven, him and Damon."
He performed with the band until 1993 when he left due to alleged personal tensions with Williams.
Street went to hospital five days before he died, suffering from back pain and breathing difficulties. Doctors found he had a clot in a lung.
He is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.
