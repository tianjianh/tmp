Police carried out searches across the county and on the rail network after a suspicious death was reported at a property in Benenden on Thursday.
Kent Police named the woman as Caroline Andrews, 52, and said they were now treating her death as a murder.
Officers said the detained man, 54, was found in the London area and taken to hospital for treatment to injuries.
"A post-mortem examination of Mrs Andrews took place earlier today and the death is now being treated as a murder enquiry," a Kent Police spokeswoman said.
A police cordon remains in place outside the property, which is off the village's main street.
Mrs Andrews worked as a supply teacher at Benenden CE School in the village.
Head teacher Gill Knox said staff had been left shocked and saddened.
She said: "Caroline and her family live in the village and are well known to the school.
"Caroline has been a loved and well-respected supply teacher here for a number of years, who has enriched the lives of the many children she has taught.
"At the present time, we cannot comment on what has happened but our thoughts and prayers are with her family, and all who knew her and will miss her."
Neighbour Derek Catlin described Mrs Andrews and her family as "normal, very pleasant people".
He said Thursday was quiet in the village but police arrived at about 16:30 GMT with "an accumulation of police vehicles - probably three police cars".
Another Benenden resident, Karen Callaghan, said: "It's very sad for the village. Everyone knows everyone round here. The locals have been here a long time."
During the search, armed officers boarded a train in Gillingham.
Armed police held a train at Gillingham station for more than 90 minutes from about 21:00 GMT on Thursday.
Footage showed officers walking down the carriage holding guns, with one distressed passenger demanding to be let off.
