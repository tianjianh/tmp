Shane Long doubtful for Republic of Ireland Euro 2016 play-off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Republic of Ireland striker Shane Long faces a race to be fit for his country's Euro 2016 play-off next month because of injured ankle ligaments.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Long was injured in the Republic's 2-1 defeat by Poland last Sunday and carried off on a stretcher.
Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has revealed that the Tipperary man will be ruled out for two to four weeks.
The draw for the play-offs takes place on Sunday, with the two-legged ties taking place from 12-17 November.
The Republic are among the four unseeded nations for the draw, so will face Bosnia-Herzegovina, Hungary, Ukraine or Sweden home and away.
Long scored a memorable winner in Ireland's 1-0 victory over world champions Germany last week.
Captain John O'Shea and striker Jon Walters will miss the first leg of the play-off through suspension.
The first-leg ties are scheduled to take place on 12/13/14 November with the second leg games on 15/16/17 November.
There will be no preferential treatment for the seeded teams when determining the home and away legs. The first side drawn will play the first leg at home.
