Albert Anthony Smith McDonald, 58, was found with head injuries on Cumbernauld Road, Riddrie, at 21:25 on Monday. He died on his way to hospital.
Officers said the car driver is assisting with their inquiries.
Police said Mr McDonald's family were "completely devastated" by his death and appealed for information.
Senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Laura McLuckie said earlier: "We are following up several lines of inquiry, including speaking to local residents and accessing CCTV from around Cumbernauld Road and the surrounding area."
She added that "Mr McDonald had significant injuries" when he was found and the investigating team was "trying to establish just how he sustained them".
She said officers were trying to piece together his last known movements.
"Understandably his family and friends are completely devastated, and specialist officers are providing them with support at this tragic time," she said.
"It is imperative we find who is responsible for Albert's death.
"I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of Cumbernauld Road around 21:30 or earlier, and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward to police."
Det Ch Insp McLuckie added: "You may think that the information you have is insignificant however it may be the piece of information we are looking for."
