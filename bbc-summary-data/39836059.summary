Hundreds of parents in West Sussex have rallied at a public meeting to campaign against school funding cuts.

More than 300 parents, teachers and campaigners gathered in Worthing to call for a protected education budget.
The National Union of Teachers said cuts would have "a devastating impact".
In April the government said school funding was at its highest level on record. Labour said the Tories could not hide the cuts. The Lib Dems said they would protect school funding.
Save Our Schools (SOS) West Sussex, which organised Saturday's meeting, said current funding arrangements translated to a reduction of 6.5% funding per pupil by 2019.
Last month, head teachers from 14 local council areas, including West Sussex, wrote to MPs to say a new national funding formula, which should give underfunded schools more cash, ignored inflationary cost pressures faced by all schools.
SOS spokeswoman Mel Pickett said: "We're seeing huge cuts. In West Sussex alone, it's the equivalent of 944 teaching posts."
Philippa Harvey, from the NUT union, said: "We know that over 98% of schools are going to be affected by the funding cuts. And that's going to have a devastating impact."
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Theresa May can try to distract the public with grammar schools all she likes, but she cannot hide from the fact that her government is cutting school budgets."
The Liberal Democrats said: "The Conservatives must re-think their deeply flawed funding formula, which would see savage cuts to schools across West Sussex. Their proposals are utterly cynical, taking with one hand and giving with the other."
The Conservative Party, Green Party and UKIP have not yet commented to the BBC.
