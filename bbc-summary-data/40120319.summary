The details from South Wales Police showed there were 1,373 thefts in 2016 - up from 872 in 2012.
Cardiff is aiming to become one of the UK's leading cycling cities over the next 10 years.
While cycling charities called for safer storage, Cardiff council said its new Transport Interchange would have 500 secure cycle parking spaces.
According to the figures, obtained via a Freedom of Information request, most thefts were reported in the city centre - 1,736 in total over the five years.
The ward with the second highest number of stolen bikes was Cathays with 1,003 thefts, followed by Cardiff Bay with 664.
In January, the council's cabinet backed a strategy to get half of commuters in Cardiff out of their cars by 2021 and 60% by 2026.
The plans include creating the 500 new spaces at the new bus station at Central Square but charities said security is an issue.
Kevin Rhaman-Daultery, of charity Cardiff Pedal Power, praised the council's plans to improve the city's cycling infrastructure but said thefts could deter people from cycling in the first place.
"For a lot of people, cars are more convenient than bikes and people could be put off from cycling if there's a risk of their bike being nicked," he said.
"In terms of safe storage, it's something Cardiff council hasn't really discussed in their planning.
"They should look into how businesses and residential developments can provide safe storage, for staff and residents in the city - there are ways Cardiff council don't have to spend a penny."
The local authority said the rise in thefts came at a time when rates of cycling were also growing quickly.
In response to the charity's comments, a spokesman said: "The provision of cycle parking is a requirement of all new developments in the city and in the case of flats and workplaces, where bikes are likely to be parked for longer periods of time, this will be under cover and secure.
"Five hundred publicly accessible, secure cycle parking spaces will also be included in the new Transport Interchange planned for Central Square and we currently provide free Sheffield bike stands to businesses via the Park Your Bike scheme which can be mounted in secure locations."
The spokesman added that the council could do little to prevent thefts in areas such as residential houses and urged cyclists to ensure they are securely locked and registered.
South Wales Police was also contacted for comment.
