Ian Davies: Cornish Pirates boss unhappy with commitment in final match

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cornish Pirates boss Ian Davies says he was disappointed by the lack of commitment of some of his players in his final game in charge of the club.

The Pirates went down 55-33 at Nottingham to finish the season in ninth place in the Championship.
Davies is leaving the club because of cost-cutting measures.
"There was a bit of body preservation - some players were not going not contact as they should have and there were soft tries for both sides," he said.
"We've relaxed since being knocked out of the British and Irish Cup as the season has ended."
During his time as part of the coaching staff, Davies has seen the Pirates win the British and Irish Cup and reach two more semi-finals, as well as twice making the Championship play-off final.
But he says the move to the planned new Stadium for Cornwall must go ahead if they are to survive in the long term:
"I'm disappointed not to have been part of the Pirates playing in the new stadium in that first game, a lot of people behind the scenes have worked very hard," Davies told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"As a club it has to survive, but it'll only survive with the stadium."
