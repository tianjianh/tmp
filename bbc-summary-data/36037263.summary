Leicester City's Riyad Mahrez admitted on Wednesday failing to give information to Northamptonshire Police on 16 October last year.
It followed an incident involving his Mercedes Benz on the M1 on 11 May 2015.
Mahrez was fined £900 and had six points put on his licence by Northampton magistrates, as first reported in the Northampton Chronicle.

Magistrates also ordered the 25-year-old, who was not in court for sentencing, to pay £150 in costs and a £90 victim surcharge.
Police said, the player, who lives in Leicester, failed to respond to three requests to inform them of the identity of the driver of his car after it was caught speeding on the M1 at 77mph in a 50mph zone.
Mahrez is one of the Premier League's top scorers this season with a 16-goal tally for the league leaders.
It was announced on Wednesday he had been nominated, alongside his Leicester team-mates Jamie Vardy and N'Golo Kante, for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award.
