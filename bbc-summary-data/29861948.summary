The X Factor winner confirmed she is suffering from the illness a week ago, tweeting that she was "feeling very sorry" for herself.
The NHS says the condition "causes temporary weakness or paralysis of the muscles in one side of the face".
However, Sam has told BBC 1's Saturday Kitchen that it is not stopping her living her life to the full.
She joked: "I went out trick-or-treating for Halloween, I didn't have to wear a mask cause obviously my face is a bit frightening."
Sam has been keeping her 370,000 Twitter followers updated on how she has been coping throughout the week.
She said the left side of her face was "numb" when she posted a make-up free picture of herself with her baby girl on Monday.
Sam tweeted on Friday that she felt like her condition was improving.
The  mum-of-three said she has had a busy time, nearly a year on since winning The X Factor.
She secured a record deal and was lined up to support Beyonce during her UK arena tour dates
Sam never got to actually meet the singer though and said in the past she was "gutted". She told Saturday Kitchen it was still an "amazing experience".
Things could have been very different for Sam who originally wanted to be a professional footballer.
"I played football for many clubs when I was younger," she explained. "Singing was my passion and I had to make a choice and I think I made the right one."
The former prison officer insists "the fame thing" has not changed her.
"I just wear a bit more make-up and nicer clothes. I still go out shopping, I still do the school run. I still live in my little house," she said.
"All that's different is everyone knows who I am."
