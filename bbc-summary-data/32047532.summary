The city hosted part of the Tour de France in 1994 and it is hoped the race would return in 2018.
Conservative leader Donna Jones said putting a bid together was "expensive and complex" but securing the race for the area would be "fantastic".
Ms Jones said it would be a joint bid with French city Caen with support from a ferry company.
She said: "Before we can embark on it we need to make sure the risk we are taking with public money is a sensible and calculated risk.
"That's why we need key people on board."
She said work was being done to calculate the cost and logistics of a bid.
She said: "If we are successful in this bid the boost to Portsmouth, the Solent and the UK would be fantastic."
A stage of the Tour De France was held in Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex and London last year.
