The independent drama, which stars Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams, tells the story of a working-class family dealing with multiple tragedies.
It also won best screenplay for Kenneth Lonergan, best actor for Affleck and best supporting actor for Lucas Hedges.
Elsewhere, Moonlight was awarded best director for Barry Jenkins and best supporting actress for Naomie Harris.
The film, which is about a boy growing up gay, black and poor in Miami, swept the board at the Gotham Independent film awards earlier this week.
The National Board of Review was founded in 1909 and is made up of a collection of film enthusiasts and academics.
Other winners this year included Amy Adams, who was named best actress for her performance in sci-fi drama Arrival.
Arrival, Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea are all likely to be strong Oscar contenders.
However, none of the National Board's past three best film winners - Mad Max: Fury Road, A Most Violent Year and Her - have gone on to win best picture at the Oscars.
