[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Warren Feeney hopes Newport County will have a permanent training base next season as he is frustrated with their current pitches.

The League Two club have been using up to four grounds, including Llanwern High School, this season.
Feeney says the County board is supportive of plans to train at Spytty Park, County's home ground before moving to Rodney Parade.
"We need a training ground definitely and I just get sick of it," he said.
"The players get frustrated and quality of training just goes.
"The board have been brilliant and we are looking at things and hopefully we can get something done for next season.
"I think Spytty will play a big part in that, it will be fantastic for us.
"It's great that the school gave us the opportunity for it for the year but the pitch hasn't been looked after, and the training grounds are massive, massive things."
"It is frustrating because we need a base and we need to be where we want to be. It is difficult. It is not excuses, just frustrations."
Newport face Stevenage on Saturday in League Two and, if they win and York lose, the Welsh club will be safe from relegation.
"It's a massive game. We have got to worry about ourselves and I said to the boys that we have got to get off this 41 points," Feeney added.
"It is a great game we are away from home and the pressure is off us that bit. So I have every confidence we can get it right."
Defenders Scott Barrow and Danny Holmes are doubtful to to face Stevenage after picking up hamstring injuries after the loss against Cambridge.
Darren Jones has been sick but is expected to feature, while fellow centre-back Matt Partridge is available again after missing the Cambridge match due to a family bereavement.
