Forensic officers used DNA evidence to identify the bodies of a married couple found dead at their home, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Builder Stephen Muncaster, 47, was found dead in the front garden of a property in Magdalen, near King's Lynn, on 12 July.
His wife Allison, 48, was found inside the house.
Assistant coroner Johanna Thompson, at Norfolk Coroner's Court, said they died from gunshot wounds to the head.
At the hearings in Norwich, she said she requested forensic officers to identify their bodies by using DNA evidence.
She said: "Mrs Muncaster was found at her home property by police, having suffered what appeared to be a gunshot injury to the head.
"A post-mortem report confirmed the cause as being due to a shotgun wound to the head.
"Mr Muncaster was found in the front garden of the property, having suffered what appeared to be a gunshot injury to the head."
She added that a post-mortem report confirmed that as the cause of his death.
As previously reported, shots had been heard and a gun was found at the scene.
Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
Mr Muncaster was the uncle of so-called "Lotto lout" Michael Carroll, who made headlines in 2002 by winning Â£9.7m in the National Lottery.
The former binman blew all of his winnings before taking a job in a biscuit factory.
Ms Thompson adjourned the hearings for a full inquest on 5 January 2017 at Norfolk Coroner's Court.
