[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow's Gurdwara will officially open its doors later, after 10 years of planning and a further six years of construction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sikh place of worship is the largest in Scotland - and is thought to be one of the largest faith buildings of any kind in the country.
There are 20,000 Sikhs in Scotland, most of them in the Glasgow area.
Among those attending the official opening will be First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
Almost all the materials used in construction were imported from India and the project cost about Â£8m.
The building accommodates classrooms, a library, office and a ceremonial pool.
It will be made available to the general public when it is not needed for worship.
