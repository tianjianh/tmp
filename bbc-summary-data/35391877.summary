The 45-year-old reported a swollen left calf to medical staff and had a scan before the one-day international against India in Sydney on Saturday.
His condition is described as "stable" and he will be kept in hospital overnight for observation.
A Cricket Australia statement said he will require "a lay-off before he can return to coaching".
The Australia players were told about Lehman's condition after Saturday's six-wicket defeat in the fifth and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Batting coach Michael Di Venuto will take charge of the side for Australia's three-match T20 series against India this month.
