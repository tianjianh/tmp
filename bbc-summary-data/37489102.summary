Fly-half Alex Lozowski scored a try in either half, while Chris Wyles and Jamie George made sure of a bonus point with two more for Mark McCall's side.
England second row George Kruis added a fifth score before full-time on his return to action.
Bristol failed to put a point on the board and have now lost all five of their opening Premiership matches.
Saracens returned to the top of the Premiership with victory, following a shock 17-10 defeat by London neighbours Harlequins last weekend.
Last year's domestic and European champions were not at their best at Ashton Gate, but made their class tell against a Bristol side starved of possession.
Lozowski, called up to England's 45-man elite player squad on Friday, crossed for the only try of a scrappy first half and was able to touch down for a second after the break when he charged down Adrian Jarvis' attempted clearance.
United States international Wyles powered through a series of missed tackles for the third try before some forward power brought their last two scores of the night from George and Kruis.
Jordan Crane and Jack Wallace came closest to forcing any points on the board for Bristol, before a pass from three metres out floated out into touch in the corner.
Bristol director of rugby Andy Robinson:
"I am disappointed in the result. We started a lot better, but again, we haven't performed for 80 minutes.
"One of the things we talked about was to build pressure on the opposition, but we turned over possession in our first two attacks, and we are not going to be able to build pressure on the opposition if we do that.
"We made some courageous tackles and worked very hard, but Saracens kept their accuracy and throughout the game put us under massive pressure."
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall:
"I thought it was a really good professional performance by us. It wasn't perfect, but I thought we dominated the game and dominated field position.
"We put them under a lot of pressure, and 10-0 didn't feel a satisfactory lead at half-time, but I think all of that hard work paid off in the second half and we were able to get the bonus point that we wanted.
"I was pleased with our energy, and when we had to defend we defended with real intent. The pressure eventually told, and we got what we wanted from the game, which was pleasing."
