Ella McCain, from Cholmondeley in Cheshire, was riding in her debut race on Friday night at Carlisle racecourse.
The 16-year-old won a seven-furlong flat race on 7-1 shot Dark Confidant.
"It was brilliant. It doesn't get much better than this, winning your first race. I've just done my GCSEs and this was far more enjoyable," she said.
Her dad Donald McCain Jr, who trained 2011 National winner Ballabriggs, saw his other daughter Abbie ride her first winner earlier this month at Wolverhampton.
He said: "Both Ella and Abbie have been pony racing for a number of years. They have plenty of experience under their belts and they were always going to get races when they turned 16.
"Success and winning the big races is something we strive for and this [Ella's win] is just hugely satisfying," he added.
Both are aiming to race on 'Amazing Monday' at Carlisle on 7 August - the UK's only all-female jockey card of races. Victory there, then in the Betfred Ladies' Trophy Handicap Stakes at Haydock Park five days later, can lead to a Â£20,000 Jockey Club development award for young female jockeys.
'Ginger' McCain, who died in 2011, trained Red Rum to three National wins in the 1970s and Amberleigh House to victory in the 2004 National.
