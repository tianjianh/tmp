Thomas Young was worried about Connor Ripley's return to Middlesbrough so he wrote to the club offering his services in goal.
Latics chairman Simon Corney replied by inviting Thomas to try out before their match against Rochdale on Saturday.
He said it was his "dream come true" to have a go in goal.
Oldham's goalkeeper coach Carlo Nash gave Thomas - who was dressed in full kit - an introductory training session and then goalkeepers Ripley and Chris Kettings put him through his paces all in front of the Rochdale fans.
His father, Matt Young, said: "It was a lovely reply... and a great thing the club did.
"It is what dreams are made of. He has not stopped talking about it."
Thomas watched the match from the directors' box but "remained in full kit in case he was needed," Mr Young said.
After his side drew 1-1 with Rochdale in the League One match, Thomas said he wished he had been picked because he would have kept a clean sheet, adding "I'm a fabulous goalkeeper".
Nash tweeted it was "a pleasure" and he hoped Thomas had enjoyed the experience.
