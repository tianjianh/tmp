England v India: Six-wicket win puts tourists 2-0 up in ODI series

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England suffered another demoralising defeat as India moved 2-0 ahead with two games left in the one-day series courtesy of a six-wicket triumph.

Put in, England's Alastair Cook (44) and Alex Hales (42) reached 82-0 after 18 overs before 3-15 fell in 28 balls.
It needed 42 from Jos Buttler and 30 in 18 balls from James Tredwell to take England to a modest 227, with spinner Ravichandran Ashwin claiming 3-39.
Ambati Rayudu struck an unbeaten 64 as India won with seven overs to spare.
Cook's quest to combat Graeme Swann's recent criticism of England's one-day cricket was scuppered by more frailties from his team as India expertly exploited some turn on a slow Trent Bridge pitch.
Having lost the Test series 3-1 with three successive defeats, India can secure the ODIs with a third consecutive win of their own in the next match at Edgbaston on Tuesday.
After a sketchy opening five overs in which only 11 were scored, Cook and Hales struck three fours apiece and took the score to 48 by the end of the first 10.
But as in the 133-run defeat in the previous match at Cardiff, the introduction of spin proved England's undoing and there were to be only five more boundaries in the next 36 overs.
Hales had struck some stylishly authentic strokes through the off side in his 55-ball innings but was first to fall when he top-edged a sweep at Suresh Raina into his shoulder and it looped gently to wicketkeeper Mahendra Dhoni.
Striving to be assertive by stepping down the pitch, Cook was stumped down the leg side, a maiden international wicket for occasional wicketkeeper Rayudu's unorthodox off-spin.
Eoin Morgan departed to sharp turn from Ashwin and now averages only 17 from his last eight ODI innings, while Ian Bell, who looked relatively composed in his 28 from 38 balls, was run out by Mohit Sharma's direct hit from the boundary.
Sharma earlier left the field, having only been able to bowl three overs of seam, but a greater percentage of spin proved more beneficial for India.
England needed something spectacular in the field, and though Chris Woakes had Shakhar Dhawan caught at backward point for 16 in the eighth over, spinner Tredwell (1-46) was hit for six by Virat Kohli (40) in his second over as they were unable to sustain any genuine pressure.
Steven Finn, bowling second change in his first international match since September 2013, ended Ajinkya Rahane's fluent 45 in the 18th over to leave India 85-2.
But he went for 50 from eight overs as Rayudu, 28, displayed great poise in his highest ODI score.
