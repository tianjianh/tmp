The work of Ernest Gimson, an arts and crafts architect and designer from Leicester, Stoneywell was a holiday home to his family for many years before being left to the trust by Ernest's great-nephew Donald.
Riannon Simpson, assistant house manager at the cottage, takes us on a tour of the house and describes the difficulties of bringing the house to life for the public.
The house is now available to visit by appointment.
