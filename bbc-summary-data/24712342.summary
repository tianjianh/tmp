Hill's 1996 season was by far his most successful. He managed eight race wins and was never off the front row of the grid in qualifying on his way to his first World Championship, ahead of team-mate Jacques Villeneuve.
Along with fellow racing driver Nigel Mansell and boxer Sir Henry Cooper, Hill became the third person to win Sports Personality of the Year twice.
He retired from competitive racing after the 1999 season.
BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2015 is broadcast live from Belfast on Sunday, 20 December from 19:00 GMT on BBC One. Further coverage on BBC Sport's online platforms and Radio 5 live.
