Partick Thistle: Alan Archibald hopes for fewer exits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald is confident he will have less of a rebuilding job to do this summer.

The Premiership club lost a large number of regular starters last year.
"The quicker you get your work done the better," he said. "I think we are in a better position this year than last year.
"We have guys signed up already and hopefully we will not lose as many key players as we did - and it gives us a chance to make a better start."
Scott Fox, Stephen O'Donnell, Conrad Balatoni, James Craigen, Kallum Higginbotham and Lyle Taylor all departed last summer.
But Archibald already has the likes of Tomas Cerny, Mustapha Dumbuya, Callum Booth, Kris Doolan and Mathias Pogba secured on contract extensions.
And he will work on tying up other players, including Steven Lawless, the midfielder who has been approached by relegation-threatened Dundee United.
However, finishing higher up the league will give Archibald more money for his playing budget next season.
"We know the ones we want to keep and we will be speaking to more of them in the coming weeks," he said.
"When we know which place we will be, it gives us a clearer picture of what we can offer them."
Midfielder Stuart Bannigan could also stay on after looking like he has ready to depart in the summer before being ruled out for the season with a knee injury.
"It depends on his injury," added Archibald. "It's quite strange, it has dragged on a wee bit.
"He recovered a little bit and the surgeon wanted to give him another week or two and see whether he needs surgery or not.
"We are hoping to get a bit of clarity towards the start of next week."
