The footage appears to have been recorded on Wednesday.
The incident is believed to be in connection with the recent death of veteran republican Peggy O'Hara.
Police say enquiries are ongoing.
East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell condemned the show of strength.
"Police must investigate the events and of course the funeral is yet to come," he said.
"Police need to be prepared for what might happen at the funeral."
Derry and Strabane independent republican councillor Gary Donnelly was there when the shots were fired.
"A number of armed and masked men paid tribute to Peggy by firing shots over her coffin," he said.
"They were fired into the air and there was nothing hostile about it."
