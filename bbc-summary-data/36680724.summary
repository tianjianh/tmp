Votes cast at this year's Australia election will come from as far away as Antarctica.

More than 70 researchers based in the frozen continent were able to cast early ballots.
Australia's electoral office organised polling booths at each of the country's three Antarctic stations.
Opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will beat Opposition Leader Bill Shorten when the official poll is held on Saturday.
The bases stay connected to the outside world mainly through a low-bandwidth internet connection.
Temperatures can drop to as low as minus 40C and casting a vote surrounded by snow and ice proved a  novelty.
"They spend about six months of the year cut off from the outside world," said a spokeswoman for the Australian Antarctic Division.
"It's a bit of fun for them this time of year."
