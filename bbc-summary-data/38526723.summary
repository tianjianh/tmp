[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leeds United 1-0 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Wood's header was enough to give an impressive Leeds United victory over fellow Championship promotion hopefuls Derby County, sending the Whites third.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leeds had already squandered numerous opportunities by the time Wood headed Pablo Hernandez's corner past Scott Carson on the stroke of half-time.
Defender Kyle Bartley was most guilty, bundling wide from inside the six-yard box with the goal at his mercy.
Derby had Bradley Johnson sent off in the closing stages for two bookings.
