Saves from goalkeeper Beth Davies kept Bees in the first half, until Kirsty Linnett's low header from Emily Westwood's cross opened the scoring.
After the break, Kerys Harrop headed in a second before Charlie Wellings' long-range strike added the Blues' third.
An own goal from Davies made it 4-0 late on as she diverted Andrine Hegerberg's curling corner goalwards.
The Bees, who knocked out Chelsea Ladies in the first round and were the first Women's Super League Two side to reach the semi-finals, lost captain Ashleigh Goddard to a suspected shoulder injury in the second half.
Birmingham will play in the final for the third time in six years, after losing the 2011 and 2012 finals to Arsenal Ladies.
Holders Arsenal travel to Manchester City on Sunday in the second semi-final, with the final taking place on Sunday, 2 October at Manchester City's Academy Stadium.
