The 59-year-old actor and presenter has launched a petition to prevent buildings being demolished to make way for a new station.
A planned Crossrail 2 connection at Tottenham Court Road will see two new access points built in Soho.
Fry, who is chairman of Save Soho, warned the area "could change dramatically".
He said the group did not oppose Crossrail 2.
But he said: "Soho is not just a metropolitan enclave... it is a focus, a magnet for the young, creative and open-minded around the country.
"The new threat to Soho's authentic soul coming from Crossrail 2 is a real and urgent issue."
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that London's transport network will grind to a halt due to overcrowding unless the government backs Crossrail 2.
Construction could start in the early 2020s and the railway could be open by 2033.
A preferred route for a proposed Â£20bn Crossrail 2 scheme, running north-south through London was approved in 2014.
Crossrail 2 bosses say improvements will reduce crowding on the busiest part of the Northern line during peak periods by approximately 30%.
