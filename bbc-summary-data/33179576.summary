The precautionary measure was put in place following concern over the taste and smell of their mains supply.
The alert affects about 2,000 homes and businesses in parts of Carfin, Newarthill, Chapelhall, New Stevenston and Dalziel Park.
Scottish Water said it was investigating the issue.
It has advised people not to use boiled tap water, and to only mains water to flush toilets.
Bottled water was distributed to the affected properties overnight.
A Scottish Water spokeswoman said: "After receiving contacts from customers about the taste and smell of tap water, we investigated thoroughly and examined our network.
"We have advised customers in Carfin, Newarthill, Chapelhall, New Stevenston and Dalziel Park not to use their water for any purpose - other than flushing toilets - as a precautionary measure.
"We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and we have been distributing bottled water to affected properties during the night."
She said teams had been out in the affected areas all night helping customers, with extra support also being given to elderly or disabled people, care homes and hospitals.
Scottish Water said further updates would be issued when more information becomes available, and affected residents will be told when their water is back to normal.
