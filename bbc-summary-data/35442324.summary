Wales manager Chris Coleman says he already knows most of the squad he will be taking to France for Euro 2016.

The 45-year-old is unconcerned that some key players are not being selected regularly for their clubs.
Defender James Chester and midfielders Joe Ledley and Joe Allen have made only 21 Premier League appearances between them this term.
"If I am honest, most of my squad, I know who will be going," Coleman told BBC Wales Sport.
"We are all excited and all looking forward to what is coming."
Coleman used the example of Palace midfielder Ledley, who he admits has already done enough to secure a spot in his 23 despite featuring infrequently for the Eagles.
"One or two need to wait a bit longer and will find out, but some of the lads, like Joe Ledley at Crystal Palace, who isn't playing, it's a different situation for him," said Coleman.
"I'd be lying if I said he's not playing at Palace and I'm worried I may not take him in the squad. That's not the case.
"He's been a great servant, Joe, and he's been a huge part of us qualifying and on and off the pitch, he's a good character.
"It would be nice if Joe got a few more minutes on the pitch, but he's not in any danger of not going to France, there are certain other players in that category, they've already done enough."
However, Coleman admits some of his younger players do need to ensure they are playing regularly.
"There are one or two others, great young players like Jonny and George Williams, and they do need some more minutes, same as Tom Lawrence at Blackburn," he added.
"I think the lads will be looking at it, they'll want game time, they want to be on the pitch.
"But it works both ways, because I think sometimes the lads who come with us who haven't had any game time are fresh and desperate to get on the pitch. And that can work in your favour sometimes."
Wales have confirmed two March friendlies against Ukraine and Northern Ireland with Coleman revealing it is likely they will also face Sweden in Stockholm.
"Preparations are going brilliantly and I've met with [captain] Ashley Williams recently who is chomping at the bit," he revealed.
"Our strength is our togetherness. Having good players doesn't win you anything, you need the mentality."
