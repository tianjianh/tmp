Italy local election threatens PM Renzi's reforms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Local elections in Italy have delivered gains to right-wing parties in the north - a setback for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's economic reform plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
However, in central and southern Italy Mr Renzi's centre-left Democratic Party (PD) fared better and ousted a right-wing governor in Campania.
The PD is trying to overhaul the labour market, education and the constitution, to galvanise the struggling economy.
Before the vote ex-PM Silvio Berlusconi became caught up in an election gaffe.
At a rally in Segrate, a town outside Milan, the centre-right Forza Italia leader asked someone for the name of the candidate, and then told people "vote Paolo," only to find out that Paolo Micheli was a leftist standing against his party and backed by the PD.
Sunday's elections involved seven of Italy's 20 regions, and there were mayoral contests in more than 700 municipalities.
The anti-immigration Northern League made gains beyond its Venice power base. The PD lost the Liguria region in the north-west to Giovanni Toti, who was backed by the League and Forza Italia.
Northern League candidate Luca Zaia secured a solid win in Veneto region.
The PD's performance was well down on the 41% it won in last year's European elections.
But in Campania, south of Rome, the PD's Vincenzo De Luca got nearly 40%, ahead of the incumbent centre-right governor.
The PD also won in Tuscany, Umbria, Marche and Puglia.
Italy's Rai News reports that PD took 23.7% of the vote in total, with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement second on 18.4%, then Northern League on 12.5% and Forza Italia on 10.7%.
Mr Berlusconi, 78, was prime minister three times between 1994 and 2011.
He announced plans for a political comeback earlier this year, after the country's highest court upheld his acquittal on charges of underage sex and abuse of office in March.
