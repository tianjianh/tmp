Firefighters were called at about 11:50 BST to Swan Road in Banbury after the car partially crashed through the wall of Laser Sailboats Ltd.
The driver was taken to Horton General Hospital with non-life threatening injuries and one person was treated at the scene by paramedics.
Emergency services personnel stayed on the scene to make the building safe.
Station manager Mark Ames said: "When we arrived the powerful BMW was embedded in the wall of the factory, and our immediate concerns were for the driver of the car and the workers inside of the factory.
"Once we were assured that everyone was in safe hands we focused on the stability of the building structure.
"Our colleagues in the district council have specially-trained building surveyors that can give advice on the safety of the building."
