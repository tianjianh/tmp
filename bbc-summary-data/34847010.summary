Muirhead has led Scotland to five consecutive medal finishes at the tournament, taking bronze last year.
The 25-year-old's previous win at the event came in 2011 and she has finished runner-up on three occasions.
"It's about time we made our way up that podium again and there's nothing stopping us this year," Muirhead told BBC Scotland.
"There's a lot of great teams there, every game will be really tough, but I know when we play well it's tough to beat us.
"So far, we've had a really good season and I'm really excited about these championships."
The Muirhead family will be well represented in Esbjerg, with brothers Thomas, 20, and Glen, 26, in the Scotland men's team.
"It feels weird going to a major championships along with my two brothers but, at the same time, it's really special," said the Olympic bronze medallist from 2014 and 2013 world champion.
"Thomas has had a great season with Kyle Smith's team and they've had such a successful junior career.
"Mum is going to come out and support us but poor dad has to stay at home and feed the animals [at the family farm].
"It will be great to have us all there cheering each other on, if we don't all fall out!"
Thomas is vice skip in Smith's rink, while Glen is the alternate.
"We've played at three world juniors but this is our first senior competition at this level, so it's something we can get experience from," said Thomas.
"We want to play as well as we can and see how far that gets us. We'll dig deep and give it everything we've got."
The tournament runs from 20-28 November.
