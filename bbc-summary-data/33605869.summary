The incident happened on Monday afternoon with the drone coming within 300ft (100m) of the plane from Munich, Germany, an airport spokesman said.
The crew of the Lufthansa Embraer ERJ-195 reported the near collision with the drone at 2,500ft (760m).
Police are investigating the incident, the spokesman said.
Mikolaj Karpinski, of the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency, told Polish television that the pilots immediately reported the drone to air traffic controllers, who redirected the plane's path.
According to the Aviation Herald website, the crew told Warsaw air traffic control that they "should take care of your airspace". They also said "it is really dangerous", with the tower responding apologetically.
The Embraer went on to make a safe landing about three minutes later.
