Craig Reid, 30, denied attacking 27-year-old Natasha Munro at his flat in Glasgow on 21 December 2014.
It was alleged that he had struck her on the head and pulled her hair.
The former Motherwell and Dunfermline player, who now plays with Icelandic team Keflavik, was cleared of the charge against him following a trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Alan Miller said: "There are a number of significant unanswered questions about what did or did not happen."
