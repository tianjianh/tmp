A third-minute goal from Lucie Vonkova and a second by Klara Cahynova left the visitors trailing 2-0 at half time in Stadion Strelnice on Tuesday night.
Eva Bartonova scored from a corner after 65 minutes to seal victory for the Czechs who moved clear in third.
Switzerland and Italy, who set the pace in Group 6, will be Northern Ireland's final opponents in September.
Northern Ireland's women defeated bottom-placed Georgia 4-0 at Solitude on Friday and travelled to the Czech Republic targeting at least a third-place finish.
However they were comprehensively beaten, with the home side managing nine shots on target compared to Northern Ireland's one.
