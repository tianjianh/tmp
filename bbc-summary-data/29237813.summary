Police Scotland said the "cowardly, brutal" attack in the early hours was being treated as attempted murder.
The attack happened at a property in Lothian Street, Bathgate,  at around 03:20 on Tuesday.
The man is being treated at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary where his condition is described as "serious".
Det Insp Martin MacLean said: "This was a cowardly, brutal attack on a defenceless, elderly man in his own home in the middle of the night.
"He was stabbed repeatedly and sustained life-threatening injuries.
"My team and I are keeping an open mind on the motive for this attack, and whilst items of property would appear to have been stolen, this is an attempted murder investigation.
"The enquiry is at an early stage but I would reiterate our appeal to members of the local community, neighbours or anyone else who was in the area of Lothian Street, Avon Road, Cochrane Street or other nearby streets and who saw anything or anyone suspicious to contact the police."
Police are keen to identify two men who were seen together in the area.
They are described as white,  about 5ft 10in tall, aged between 20 and 40.
Both wore hooded tops, one blue, the other grey. Both may also have been wearing jogging bottoms.
