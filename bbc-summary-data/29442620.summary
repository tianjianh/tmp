More than 300 of the posts are aimed at qualified accountants, as well as graduates, in the company's new financial advisory service.
The other 500 jobs be graduates recruited for "staff augmentation" teams in PwC's global client businesses.
The average salary is £21,000.
The jobs represent an investment of over £40m, including an Invest NI grant of more than £4m.
It is the latest in a series of major investments by professional services firms in Belfast.
In September, Deloitte said it would create 338 jobs at its 'digital hub', currently based in the city's Gas Works.
Earlier this year, EY said it was adding almost 500 jobs to its Belfast operation.
PwC in Northern Ireland already employs over 1,000 people, and has increased by more than 300 over the past two years.
The Belfast office has a number of centres of excellence which support the wider global business in areas such as data analytics and cyber security.
Paul Terrington, PwC regional chairman, said the decision to locate two new projects in Northern Ireland "reflects our confidence in the high standard of the local graduate pool".
"Over the years we've benefited from strong local talent, recruiting both accountancy graduates and graduates from other disciplines," he said.
First Minister Peter Robinson said the investment was "a tremendous boost to the Northern Ireland economy and is another significant vote of confidence in Northern Ireland's talent".
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said local graduates would be  "the foundation" for PwC's business activities worldwide.
