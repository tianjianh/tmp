The 21-year-old will help cover the loss of James Clare, who has a serious knee injury, and the release of Lee Smith from his contract.
Naughton came through the academy at Bradford, and spent a year at Sydney Roosters before joining Hull in 2015.
"Bringing in Curtis gives him an opportunity to catapult his career at the top level," said coach Neil Jukes.
