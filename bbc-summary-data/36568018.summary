Royal Ascot 2016: Queen has winner with Dartmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dartmouth, owned by the Queen, won the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot despite a stewards' inquiry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 10-1 chance, ridden by Olivier Peslier for trainer Sir Michael Stoute, was her first winner at the meeting for three years.
An inquiry was held after Dartmouth and Highland Reel came close together but the placings were unaltered.
It was a record-equalling 75th triumph at the meeting for Stoute, and a 23rd win for the Queen.
All the results from Royal Ascot
Nearly £130,000 in prize money goes to the winner, with the majority of this for the victorious owner.
The Queen's racing advisor John Warren said: "It's been a long week and there have been a few ups and downs.
"This is the Olympics (of racing) and even to have a runner here is huge. To end up with a winner is so fantastic."
Meanwhile, jockey Ryan Moore sealed a Saturday treble when Twilight Son won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes after earlier victories on Churchill and Sir Isaac Newton.
Dartmouth won by a head from Highland Reel, with Almodovar third.
Victory brought a high for the Queen, a week after her official 90th birthday, following the low of losing her runner Guy Fawkes, who suffered a fatal injury at Ascot on Thursday.
Her last triumph at the fixture came when Estimate, also trained by Stoute, won the Gold Cup in 2013.
The Newmarket trainer, who equalled the mark of 75 Royal Ascot wins set by the late Sir Henry Cecil, said: "That's a great mark to reach. I hope it doesn't stop there.
"He's a lovely, quality horse. Everybody in the yard is very fond of him."
The Queen got such a thrill out of him sticking his neck out
"This may prove to have been a significant moment for British racing because of who was alongside the Queen in the winners' enclosure.
"The Prince of Wales has often been characterised as being ambivalent towards the sport about which his mother is passionate. But there he was, clearly taking an interest and joking with the Queen about her trophies. And the heir to the throne has been here much more than usual this week, even owning two runners.
"The Royal support for the 'Sport of Kings' is a massive thing, and, with the future in mind, it's clear that he's taking an active part in being moulded to perhaps one day take over a baton that Her Majesty has held for so long."
Moore's treble meant he was the meeting's leading jockey for the sixth time in seven years.
He racked up the hat-trick after a difficult few days when he found trouble in running on more than one occasion.
Asked by Channel Four racing what the three winners in one day meant to him, the taciturn jockey replied: "It would mean more if I won four."
Twilight Son was ending a long wait for trainer Henry Candy - his first Royal Ascot winner since 1979.
Robert Cowell took the Wokingham Handicap with Outback Traveller, ridden by Martin Harley.
New father Adam Kirby celebrated a third victory of the week when guiding home Commissioned in the concluding Queen Alexandra Stakes.
The triumph at flat racing's showpiece meeting marked quite a double for Irish trainer Gordon Elliott, who won the Cheltenham Gold Cup over the jumps with Don Cossack in March.
