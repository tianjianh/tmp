A new primary school is to be built in the Maryhill area of Glasgow to meet a projected rise in the school roll.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The non-denominational school with community sports facilities is to be built on the site of the former North Kelvinside Secondary School at the top of Queen Margaret Drive.
Last year, Glasgow City Glasgow held a consultation and now the proposal has been agreed by councillors.
Changes to the surrounding schools' catchment areas were also approved.
Primary schools included in the changes are Cadder, Caldercuilt, Kelvindale, Parkview, Highpark, Dunard, Saracen, Oakgrove and Royston.
The council's children and young people spokeswoman Liz Cameron said the school would be a great asset to the local community.
"It's wonderful to be witnessing the resurgence and regeneration of Maryhill and as a result the need for additional primary school places," she said.
