[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 1-1 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matty Kennedy's stunning strike rescued a point for promotion-chasing Plymouth at Hartlepool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kennedy curled the ball home from outside the area with 14 minutes remaining to cancel out Rhys Oates' strike as second-placed Argyle, three points off leaders Doncaster going into the game, took a share of the spoils.
Plymouth began like a side pushing for the title, with Ryan Taylor and Jake Jervis testing young goalkeeper Joe Fryer in the opening exchanges.
Yet Pools grew into the game and took the lead midway through the opening period, Oates powering the ball into an empty net after Luke McCormick had denied Nathan Thomas.
The hosts controlled proceedings thereafter, with Plymouth growing increasingly frustrated.
Kennedy was Argyle's biggest threat, jinking his way past Kenton Richardson and firing over as the game entered the last 15 minutes.
But he made no mistake moments later as he cut inside from the left and curled a stunning 20-yard effort past Fryer.
Plymouth almost snatched a winner, only for makeshift defender Brad Walker to block Taylor's goal-bound strike.
