Wa-ays Dhaye, 18, died from multiple stab wounds after being attacked in Thurston Street on 31 August.
Khianni Gordon has been convicted of murder and his accomplices Kaneel Huggins and Antwon Clarke were each found guilty of manslaughter.
The men, who are aged 18 and come from High Wycombe, will be sentenced at Reading Crown Court on Wednesday.
Gordon was also convicted of perverting the course of justice.
Mr Dhaye, who was born in Holland, was attacked while walking home in Slough, where he had lived for 10 years, after spending the day at the Notting Hill Carnival.
He was found by members of the public who called the emergency services.
He died on 1 September at Wexham Park Hospital. The cause of death was found to be multiple stab wounds including one wound which penetrated his abdomen and severed his aorta.
Det Ch Insp Kevin Brown from Thames Valley Police said the group travelled from Notting Hill to Slough as a result of a minimal altercation at the carnival.
He added: "They then hunted Wa-ays down, away from his friends, before stalking him through the streets of Slough and brutally attacking him close to his home, inflicting fatal injuries."
In a statement, Mr Dhaye's family described him as "the light of our lives".
"We are all heartbroken and devastated by his killing, which happened around the corner from our home. The pain is unimaginable," they said.
"He had great aspirations and had been accepted to study computer science at Hertfordshire University, which he was due to begin in September 2015.
"We were so proud of him - the child of a refugee - pursuing higher education, an opportunity his parents never had."
