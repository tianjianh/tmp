The 24-year-old spent last season on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt, where he made 11 appearances.
He was suspended by the German club in May when he suffered an infection after getting a tattoo against orders.
Varela became the first player to sign under David Moyes' reign at Old Trafford, when he joined on a five-year deal in 2013.
He went on loan to Real Madrid Castilla in Spain the following summer, having failed to make an appearance for United.
On his return, in 2015-16, he featured just four times in the Premier League.
He scored an injury-time winner to help United clinch the Under-21 Premier League title in April 2016.
