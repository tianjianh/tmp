Kieran Hope, 33, taught at a school in Chelmsford, Essex, when he arranged meetings with the girls via text messages, phone calls and emails.
At Chelmsford Crown Court, Hope was found guilty of seven counts of sexual activity with a child, said the court.
The court heard Hope abused his position of trust to target three teenage girls between 2012 and 2014.
His offences ranged from inappropriate touching to engaging in a full sexual relationship with a 13-year-old girl.
Hope, of Keith Avenue, Wickford, bombarded one of his victims with more than 3,000 text messages in a single month.
Det Con Jeanine Atkins-Calver said: "Kieran Hope used his position as a teacher to strike up inappropriate relationships with vulnerable female students.
"He abused his position of trust to become a sexual predator, flattering the girls with compliments and persuading them that engaging in sexual activity with him would help build their confidence.
"I would like to thank the girls who came forward to give evidence against him. Their bravery may well have stopped other young girls being abused."
Police launched an investigation into Hope in May 2014 after one of his victims confided in a friend who encouraged her to come forward.
He was charged with sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust and appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court.
Following his appearance in court, two other victims came forward and he was later charged with further offences.
