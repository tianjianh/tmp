[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leeds United 2-0 Reading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading lost for the second successive away game as Leeds moved up to fifth in the Championship play-off places with a goal in each half at Elland Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Wood struck his 11th league goal of the season to put the hosts ahead in the first half before a hamstring strain forced him off soon after.
Garry Monk's side only made sure of the points in injury-time when Souleymane Doukara converted a penalty.
Chris Gunter was adjudged to have pushed Charlie Taylor inside the area.
Reading's best chance of the game came right at the end when Yakou Meite's goal-bound effort was blocked by Pontus Jansson on the Leeds line.
Leeds, who responded from losing 2-0 at Brighton on Friday, had to send on Liam Bridcutt when New Zealand international Wood was withdrawn after his opening goal.
A rifled right-foot shot into the roof of the net produced his 14th strike in all competitions this season after Hadi Sacko dragged the ball back across the penalty area.
Leeds had little trouble containing a Reading side, who despite enjoying 77% possession, produced just two shots on target all game.
Leeds head coach Garry Monk:
"Chris Wood's just got hamstring tightness, we won't know for another 24 hours. It didn't look like a bad one where I was, but we will have to wait.
"You can see already we can't afford to lose any more but credit to those players, they're digging in.
"Physically it's hard for them but we don't want to lose Woody, who has been integral to what we're doing."
Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"I thought we played very, very well tonight, I think that was one of our best games.
"In how you play, you're not going to get 10 chances to score, but a couple during the game.
"We spoke about being patient and in the second half in the final third we could've done better in terms of decision-making.
"We should've scored before they got their first goal and then we needed to be sharper in terms of defending. Late on, we tried to force it for the equaliser and after that they got a late penalty."
