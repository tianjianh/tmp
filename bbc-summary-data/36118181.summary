Bolton Wanderers 1-0 Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stephen Dobbie's goal ensured relegated Bolton ended a 14-match winless run with victory over play-off-bound Hull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Substitute Dobbie found the net with a neat finish from close range after the visitors failed to clear a cross.
Earlier, keeper Eldin Jakupovic denied Bolton captain Darren Pratley from six yards and debutant Brian Lenihan blocked Zach Clough's follow-up effort.
Hull hit the woodwork twice through Robert Snodgrass and Chuba Akpom, who also sent a first-half header wide.
Snodgrass clipped the bar with a free-kick before half-time, while Akpom thundered an effort against the frame of the goal from 12 yards shortly before Dobbie's winner on 65 minutes.
A Hull win would have given them a six-point advantage over fifth-placed Derby, but their defeat means even beating Rotherham on the final day of the regular season may not be enough to secure a home second leg in the play-offs.
Bolton, despite achieving only their fifth league victory of a disappointing campaign, are guaranteed to finish bottom of the table but they will not end the season with the lowest-ever points tally in the second tier.
That unwanted record is shared by Stockport (2001-02) and Blackpool (2014-15), who both accumulated only 26 points - four fewer than Bolton's total of 30.
Bolton interim manager Jimmy Phillips: "We all know it has been a wretched season, but what was most pleasing was the unity between the players on the pitch and the people in the stands.
"We were into the 92nd minute and Hull were throwing everything at us and the fans were willing us to see the game out and that bodes well for the future.
"It will send everyone home with hope for the future which is key. We came up against a good team and made it as difficult as we could for them to play against us."
Hull manager Steve Bruce: "Too often we throw in a performance like that. That's why we are in the position we are.
"We didn't do the basics well enough to win the game. We were so slow in possession and so slow without it.
"At times it was like a friendly and we played like it was a friendly. All of them played within themselves."
