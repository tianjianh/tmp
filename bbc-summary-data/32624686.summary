Mendip District Council confirms postal vote problem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some voters who have registered for postal votes for Thursday's elections in Somerset have not received them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mendip District and South Somerset councils confirmed problems but were unable to say how many were affected.
If papers are received on polling day they can be used at the local polling station instead, the councils say.
For those who registered for a postal vote but are without papers, the district council offices can issue them but ID and proof of address are needed.
Mendip District Council runs the Wells election, while South Somerset District Council runs the Somerton and Frome election.
A spokesman for Mendip District Council said: "We apologise for the inconvenience caused by the late delivery of postal votes in Mendip and the Wells constituency.
"The last batch of postal votes were picked up by Royal Mail on Friday 24 April to be delivered by first class post and the majority had been delivered by the beginning of last week.
"However we understand some households have yet to receive theirs and the council have been reissuing postal votes to those households."
Polling stations are open until 22:00 BST.
