The 23-year-old has played 29 one-day internationals and 14 Twenty20 internationals for the Black Caps, taking 18 wickets at an average of 20.83 in the shortest form.
Milne took 3-8 against Pakistan last week and will join at the end of June.
"He is exactly what we were looking for from an overseas player," said Essex head coach Chris Silverwood.
"We believe Adam can help us push on at the end of the group stage as we look to secure our place in the latter stages of the competition."
