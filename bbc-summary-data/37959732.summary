[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Millar is also out while Keith Watson and Ally Gilchrist are not quite ready to return.
Ross County defender Paul Quinn will be given a week off after playing against Rangers with a knock.
Michael Gardyne and Martin Woods return after missing the draw with the Ibrox side while Erik Cikos has recovered from a dead leg.
St Johnstone's Ricky Foster: "It was good getting a win up there earlier in the season and I'm hoping for more of the same.
"You always want to do well against an old team. You have a point to prove and want to come out on top.
"These are good games to play in, as long as you win."
Ross County's Alex Schalk: "We have a massive opportunity on Saturday to narrow the gap with St Johnstone as well but you can't keep saying that.
"You have to grab these opportunities. We are going to go on a run now that will help us back into the top six, I am confident of that.
"The manager wants us to be an established top-six side, that has worked well so far but we have had a bad start.
"We can look up to St Johnstone and how well they are doing but I think with the ability we have in this group, we should be there as well."
