Helicopter crash report warning on cutting costs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An oil company's report into an offshore helicopter crash which killed 13 people has warned industry cost-cutting must not compromise safety.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iain Stuart, 41, from Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, was among those killed in the crash off Norway in April.
An investigation into the cause is continuing.
An internal Statoil investigation into the company's approach to helicopter safety has said a clearer strategy needs to be developed.
The Airbus Super Puma helicopter was flying to Bergen from the Statoil-operated Gullfaks field.
Air accident investigators found a fatigue crack was the "most likely" cause of gearbox failure.
The Statoil report suggested the organisation of helicopter safety efforts within the company appeared to be complicated and said more staff should be recruited to its flight safety department.
It also recommended Statoil should consider ways of better information sharing between the helicopter operators and manufacturers.
Mr Stuart worked for the oil field services company Halliburton.
