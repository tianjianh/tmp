Police said they were called to the Costcutter shop in Great Hampton Row on Saturday afternoon.
Three men remain in hospital for treatment for their injuries, which are not thought to be life-threatening.
West Midlands Police refused to speculate on any motive for the attack. There were no arrests and no direct appeal for witnesses.
Det Sgt Reg Collett said extra patrols were in the area "to provide reassurance".
"Urgent police enquiries in to the incident and what led up to it are continuing," he said.
"The scene was cordoned off yesterday to allow forensic examinations to take place."
The BBC tried to reach Costcutter for a comment.
