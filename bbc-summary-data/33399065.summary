Belfast is the home port for the start of the Tall Ships Races, which begin off the County Antrim coast on Monday.
The ships were making their way towards Bangor, County Down, before finishing at Whitehead in County Antrim.
Before they set off, crowds were treated to a spectacular aerobatic display by the Red Arrows.
The event featured 50 vessels from 15 different countries.
The Tall Ships will go on to visit six ports in five countries over the course of the competition.
Police had estimated as many as 300,000 people would turn out along the Antrim and north Down shorelines to catch a final glimpse of the boats.
Belfast previously hosted the Tall Ships event in 2009.
The actual race begins five miles off the coast of Portrush, County Antrim, at 10:00 BST on Monday.
After leaving Northern Ireland, the ships will visit Aalesund and Kristiansand in Norway and then Aalborg in Denmark.
