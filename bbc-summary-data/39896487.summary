Cliffs Of Moher wins Dee Stakes at Chester for Aidan O'Brien

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cliffs Of Moher justified his favourite status with victory on his return to action in the Dee Stakes at Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Moore positioned the Galileo colt, priced at 4-5, just behind the pace-setting Max Zorin before moving through in the final furlong.
Cliffs Of Moher, in his first race for 195 days, finished a length and half ahead of Bay Of Poets, with Max Zorin third and Mirage Dancer fourth.
The victory was trainer Aidan O'Brien's sixth in the Dee Stakes.
It continued a fantastic run for O'Brien, as his horses filled the first three places in the Chester Vase on Thursday after saddling Winter to victory in Sunday's 1,000 Guineas and Churchill in Saturday's 2,000 Guineas.
Cliffs Of Moher was immediately cut to a best-priced 7-1 for the Epsom Derby on 3 June.
