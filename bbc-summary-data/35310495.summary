Liverpool student society barred over 'drug-rape comedy'

A university has withdrawn official recognition from a student society after a play script culminated in a character being drugged and raped.

The 2014 script, proposed by medical students for a concert at the University of Liverpool, mocked the anti-rape slogan "no means no".
The university and its student guild investigated following complaints.
They said Liverpool Medical Students' Society (LMSS) could no longer use university or guild services.
The script, which also included characters James Bondage and Mrs Sluttypenny, caused outrage on social media after it was pitched by a group of fourth-year medical students for the annual concert, known as Smoker.
Among the comments, one student tweeted: "What have I just read? Gross below the line comments, rape jokes and general idiocy."
In an email, the university and guild said they would not allow their "good names to be jeopardised by the activities of a society which has failed to keep pace with the views and expectations of the modern world".
A spokesperson said LMSS was invited to "draw up an action plan" with the guild "to address some recommendations".
In a separate email, the university and guild said: "Unfortunately, a full and completed action plan has not been forthcoming and the LMSS officers refused to engage with the chair of the investigation panel."
The society has now been "de-ratified", which means it will not be able to use university or guild services from 1 February.
The LMSS, which has yet to respond to the BBC, says on its website it is one of the oldest and largest societies for medical students in the UK.
The university said the guild and staff at the medical school would help support the establishment of a new society for medical students.
