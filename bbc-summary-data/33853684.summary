New grave memento rules after Torfaen personalisation row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Grave mementoes which light up, move and make noise will be banned from cemeteries in Torfaen following a dispute over the personalisation of plots.

Last year parents were left angered when personal items were removed from children's graves and sent to landfill.
The council held a consultation on the rules and concluded "nuisance" items such as windmills and lights must go.
One councillor said it was a shame a better compromise could not be reached.
Under the rules, stone chippings and glass items are prohibited over safety fears and new fencing, which prevents cemetery maintenance, is also banned.
The council said the rules aimed to maintain the sanctity of cemeteries.
Torfaen cabinet member John Cunningham said the new process would address campaigners' main concern that the rules were not being applied consistently.
But independent councillor Elizabeth Haynes said not everyone was happy.
"I think that a better compromise could have been reached," she said.
"Possibly some low-level lighting to be included because there were a number of parents that said that leaving their children's graves with lights on gave them a little bit of comfort."
She added many parents felt it was unfair the rules differed depending on council area and had hoped a Wales-wide law outlining what could be placed on graves would be introduced.
The idea was rejected last year by ministers who said the matter should be down to each local authority.
