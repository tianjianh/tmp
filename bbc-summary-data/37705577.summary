Foley, 42, was found dead in his Paris hotel room on Sunday morning, hours before Munster's scheduled Champions Cup match against Racing 92.
"Talking to a lot people who know him better, he would never want us to say the game is secondary," said Munster director of rugby Rassie Erasmus, who added the decision was "not easy".
"We don't want to miss this opportunity for him. It has been quite overwhelming and a testament to Axel himself that we are hearing from all over the world."

Post-mortem tests in France revealed Foley died of a build-up of fluid in the lungs caused by a heart condition.
Munster players, staff and fans staged an emotional homecoming for the former Ireland star on Wednesday evening after his remains were flown to Shannon Airport from France.
Those present as the cortege passed Thomond Park applauded and burst into song as the hearse made a slow journey to Foley's home town of Killaloe, where he will be laid to rest on Friday.
Ulster director of rugby Les Kiss said Ireland captain Rory Best and a number of other players and officials from the province will attend the funeral "to honour a man, and to pay respects to the family of Axel".
Foley, whose father Brendan also played for Munster and Ireland, represented the Irish province on 201 occasions and captained them to their first European Cup triumph in 2006.
The number eight also won 62 Ireland caps and skippered his country on three occasions.
After joining Munster's coaching staff following his retirement in 2008, Foley became the Irish province's forwards coach in 2011 - a role he briefly undertook with Ireland during the 2012 Six Nations - before graduating to head coach in 2014 after the departure of Rob Penney.
Munster appointed South African Erasmus as the club's director of rugby in July, but Foley's job title remained head coach.
Speaking alongside Erasmus, Munster captain Peter O'Mahony broke down as he described Foley's contribution to the club as "incalculable".
"I'm not going to do him justice here. Personally, he meant a huge amount," said the Ireland international.
"I haven't supported a Munster team that he wasn't involved in. The amount he's given the club, it can't be calculated."
O'Mahony recalled Foley being as happy with the narrow win in his first game as a 60-point victory.
"He was a man that wanted a Munster jersey win," he said.
Sunday's scheduled match in Paris was postponed following Foley's death.
