[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was diving for scallops between the islands of Stronsay and Eday when he failed to return to his boat on time.
The alarm was raised just after 14:00 and shipping in the area was asked to assist in the search.
The offshore support vessel Olympic Challenger - which was in the area - located the man and took him on board.
The condition of the diver was not initially known. It was understood he was taken to hospital in Kirkwall.
