[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 3-1 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Berry scored twice to inspire Cambridge United to victory over League Two strugglers Cheltenham Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uche Ikpeazu gave the Us the perfect start, netting in the seventh minute with a deflected shot that wrong-footed goalkeeper Russell Griffiths.
The forward was central again after 18 minutes, stealing the ball from Aaron Downes and running through before teeing up Berry, whose shot was blocked superbly by Danny Parslow.
Berry did find the net 11 minutes after the interval, planting an unchallenged header past Griffiths after Greg Taylor's cross from the left side of the box.
He then doubled his tally 16 minutes from time with an angled drive following Max Clark's incisive pass.
Only a Griffiths save prevented Ikpeazu from making it 4-0 at the end of a rapid break, before Cheltenham struck a consolation goal five minutes from time when Billy Waters scrambled the ball home from close range after good work by Easah Suliman.
