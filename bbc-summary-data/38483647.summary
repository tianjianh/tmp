An RNLI volunteer retired at midnight on New Year's Eve after 44 years with an Anglesey crew.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian Thomson, 64, of Holyhead, spent 14 years of his service as a coxswain with the town's rescue team.
He was previously awarded an MBE for services to the RNLI.
To mark the occasion, crew members gathered to recreate a 100-year-old photograph of the Duke of Northumberland steam-powered lifeboat at Holyhead's Mackenzie Pier.
The new photo shows the current crew alongside the Holyhead RNLI all weather lifeboat, with Mr Thomson on the bridge and incoming coxswain Tony Price.
Mr Thomson said he was looking forward to spending more time with his wife and family.
