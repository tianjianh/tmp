[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lena Wilson said it had been "a real honour and privilege" to head the national economic development agency.
But she said she wanted to "embark on a fresh set of challenges".
Scottish Enterprise chairman Bob Keiller said she had done "an outstanding job" and driven "a much more international mindset across the whole organisation".
He added: "A plan to appoint a successor is being developed and details of this will be released in due course."
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Ms Wilson had made a "significant difference" to Scottish Enterprise's operations in Scotland and on the international stage.
"She has been a committed leader for Scottish Enterprise, a champion for Scottish business and I wish her the best in her future endeavours," she said.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown also paid tribute to Ms Wilson.
He added: "As we look ahead to developing a new approach to delivering continued economic growth and business support, Lena's decision to move on at this point will enable a new chief executive to be appointed to take the organisation into a new phase of its work."
