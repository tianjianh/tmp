[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Tom, of Beccles, was sentenced to five years and four months after he admitted attacking the woman in her bed in May this year.
When he was detained by police near the property in Beccles, he tried to bite officers, the court heard.
Officers praised the woman, who is in her 30s, for her "honesty, integrity and bravery".
The court heard that Tom went into the home as a trespasser and initially intended to steal her mobile phone, but then forced himself on her.
He admitted rape and resisting a police officer in the execution of their duty.
DC Darren Winchester, of Suffolk Police, said: "[The woman] contacted police straight away, and it was this prompt action that led to officers being able to detain Tom in the area a short time later.
"She told officers she had acted as calmly as possible at the time to get him out of the property as quickly and safely as possible."
