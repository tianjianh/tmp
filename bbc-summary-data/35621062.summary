EU deal is strong and pragmatic, Stephen Crabb says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The EU deal struck by the prime minister has been welcomed by Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb.

The agreement lets the UK limit some EU migrants' benefits and excuses Britain from any "ever closer union".
Mr Crabb said it was "a strong and pragmatic basis to say on balance we should stay in", with a referendum called for 23 June.
Labour said it would campaign to remain in the EU, while Plaid Cymru said the Tory party would "tear itself apart".
Mr Crabb gave his comments on his way to an emergency cabinet meeting on Saturday called by David Cameron, who then announced the referendum date.
The Welsh secretary previously said it would be in Wales' interests to remain in the EU on renegotiated terms, despite him not being "a member of the EU fan club".
Following the prime minister's announcement, Mr Crabb stressed his support for Britain remaining in the EU, saying on Twitter that committing the UK to an "ever closer union" had been ruled out.
A number of cabinet ministers, including Justice Secretary Michael Gove, are set to campaign for the UK to leave the EU.
Key points of the EU deal
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told his party's Welsh conference in Llandudno that it would campaign to keep Britain in the EU, despite the "sideshow" of Mr Cameron's deal.
Mr Corbyn said the union had delivered investment and protection for UK workers, but he wanted "progressive change... to make the EU work for working people".
He said the changes the prime minister had negotiated were "largely irrelevant to the problems most British people face and the decision we must now make".
Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said Mr Cameron's "foolish" decision to give his MPs a free vote in the EU referendum would see the Tory party "tear itself apart".
He also warned against letting the referendum overshadow the "vital" Welsh assembly election in May, urging people to choose the party which had "the best interests of their families and communities at heart".
UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said it was up to his party to "fight for democracy" as there was a "total dearth" of voices in Wales campaigning to leave the EU.
"We can show the people of Wales how EU membership is killing off industry, stagnating the economy, placing farming and fishing in a stranglehold," he said.
"Only by leaving can decision-making be brought closer to the people of Wales as many of those powers could come to the Senedd."
The timing of the EU referendum will have an impact on the Welsh assembly election.
I think we are going to have a flurry around Europe over the next few days, but but 23 June is still a long way away, so I suspect it will die back a bit.
I think all the parties will attempt to put the elections - in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the London mayoral election - front and centre as we move closer to May.
The Europe debate may die back a little bit, but it is going to be there, murmuring in the background.
And that is going to be a problem for all the parties.
