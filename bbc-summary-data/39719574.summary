The blaze started at about 10:35 BST at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute on Wilmslow Road and involves the first floor plant room and roof space.
The centre does not house patients but is attached to the main hospital.
A small number of treatments have been postponed and some patients have been moved due to the smoke.
Five patients who were prepped and ready for medical procedures were taken to other parts of the site so their treatment could continue.
Twelve fire engines are at the scene and two aerial platforms are being used to help tackle the blaze.
Sections of Wilmslow Road and Cotton Lane have been closed and the research building, which houses a number of laboratories, has been cleared.

The Christie is the cancer hospital for most of the North and part of the Midlands and treats about 40,000 patients a year.
Incident commander Jim Hutton, from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said it was a "complex and widespread incident".
"Our main focus is to try and bring the incident under control using our partners' technical knowledge to resolve the incident as soon as we possibly can," he added.
The fire service also asked members of the public to avoid the area and for those living nearby to keep their windows closed.
Nerette Navarro, a student carrying out cancer research at The Christie, was working in the building when the fire broke out.
"Either everything is burnt, smoke damaged or water damaged, so everything is lost," she said.
"I was doing some lab work in a small room and I could smell something bad, but I thought it was just the chemicals we use in that room.
"I left because I couldn't bear the smell and it was making me really dizzy, but then I was told there was a fire and we had to leave."
The centre is funded by Cancer Research UK, which spends about Â£22m a year on research in Manchester.
A spokesperson for Cancer Research UK said they were "awaiting further information from the emergency services about the extent of the damage caused by the fire."
There's black smoke pouring out of the Paterson Building, which is used by Cancer Research UK.
I'm about 200 yards away, close to the fire hydrant crews are using to access water to tackle the blaze.
The building has been evacuated and people have been moved to safety. In the hospital next door, they are making sure everyone is accounted for.
Wilmslow Road has been closed off by police, there are fire tenders across it and an aerial platform has gone up.
It remains to be seen whether The Christie has to put its full evacuation plan into operation.
In a statement, the hospital confirmed the fire was on the roof, adding: "All the associated areas have been evacuated including any patient areas."
"All patients and staff are safe."
It advised any patients attending the hospital for treatment to "attend as normal" and to access the site via the Palatine Road entrance.
