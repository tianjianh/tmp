[SN]TITLE[SN]
Legal fight over Dover white cliffs Farthingloe housing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners have begun legal action against plans to build housing in an area of outstanding natural beauty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
CPRE Kent has lodged a Judicial Review at the High Court into Dover council's decision to approve proposals for more than 500 homes at Western Heights and Farthingloe.
The campaigners have said the scheme would cause irreversible harm to a beautiful and historic landscape.
Dover council said it could not comment while legal proceedings were under way.
When the plans were approved, organisations including Natural England and the National Trust had objected to the scheme, but Dover council said it would help regenerate the area.
The developers behind the scheme have not yet commented.
