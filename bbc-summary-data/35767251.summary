The discovery was made in undergrowth at the Tesco Extra store in North Harbour at about 11:00 GMT.
A Hampshire spokeswoman said a cordon was in place to protect the area.
"At this current time we are unable to confirm any further details as investigations are at a very early stage," she added.
Police said a post-mortem examination of the human remains has been carried out but no further details have been released.
