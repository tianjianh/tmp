Marine Harvest Premiership: Kyles top table on goal difference

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The top of the Marine Harvest Premiership could hardly be closer with Kyles leading Kinlochshiel by a goal difference of one after both sides maintained their 100% records with victories this weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kyles beat Glenurquhart 4-1 away while at Balmacara, Kinlochshiel defeated previous leaders Kingussie 2-0. This leaves the Badenoch now just two further goals behind in third place, but having played two more games.
Lovat thwarted Oban Camanachd's bid to join Kyles, Shiel and Kingussie on eight points when they prevailed 2-1 in Kiltarlity and Glasgow Mid Argyll secured their second win of the season 1-0 at home to Kilmallie.
Meanwhile, Lochaber still seek their first point of the season after four games following their 3-0 defeat at Newtonmore.
Caberfeidh served notice of intent in the first round of the Balliemore Cup with an 11-0 away win over Aberdeen University. The rest of the National Division also progressed against lower league clubs, apart from Strathglass, who were edged 3-1 in their all-National encounter on Skye.
Martin MacFadyen put Kyles ahead before James MacPherson drew Glenurquhart level just before half-time. Sandy MacKenzie, Gordon Whyte and Roddy MacDonald then all scored in the second half to put Kyles to the head of the table.
The game at Balmacara was into its second half and still goalless before John MacRae struck twice in as many minutes to knock Kingussie off the top, and almost put Kinlochshiel there instead.
Matt Rippon opened for Oban Camanachd in the first half and there it stayed for almost an hour of play, until Greg Matheson got two in a minute to snatch the points for Lovat.
Garry Luke scored the only goal for Mid Argyll after just six minutes of a game which Kilmallie finished with 10 men, after red cards for Aaron Sandison and Liam Cameron.
Rory Kennedy and Glen MacKintosh in the first half, and Iain Robinson in the second secured the points for Newtonmore against Lochaber. However, the champions, who had previously dropped three points, are still one point off the top despite having played an extra game.
In the Balliemore Cup - shinty's intermediate championship - Scotland's top international points scorer Kevin Bartlett, just returned to Caberfeidh from Lovat, grabbed five as the Cabers romped to an 11-0 triumph in Aberdeen.
Craig Morrison got four, as did Taynuilt's Willie Lafferty in a 5-2 scoreline against Ballachulish. Jack MacDonald scored a hat-trick as Beauly progressed 6-0 at home to Glenorchy, while Will Cowie matched this in Skye's 3-1 defeat of Strathglass.
Fort William survived the dismissal of Bryan Simpson to defeat Aberdour 2-1 at An Aird and Daniel Madej had a double for Oban Celtic as they eliminated Kilmory 3-0 away. There was also a brace for James Cameron of Inverness, with his side 5-1 away winners over Tayforth.
