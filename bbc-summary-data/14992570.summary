A permanent home for the last Concorde to fly could be set up on the northern edge of Filton Airfield near Bristol, the BBC has learned.

The plan involves a new building to house the Concorde with a museum in two neighbouring World War I hangars.
Plans for a museum at nearby Cribbs Causeway stalled after a bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund was turned down.
Filton Airfield, which is owned by BAE Systems, is due to close in 2012.
BBC Radio Bristol's political reporter Robin Markwell said the new centre would be on land just off a new link road between Filton and Cribbs Causeway - bordering the northern edge of the airfield - which opened in 2010.
He said the plan included a science and technology centre which would train engineers from local universities.
Plans for funding it have not yet been announced. It would also require planning permission from South Gloucestershire Council.
Concorde 216, or Alpha Foxtrot, was the last of the fleet to fly when Concorde was withdrawn from service by British Airways in 2003.
It is currently on the opposite side of the runway at the airfield, where it formed part of an open-air exhibit which closed in 2010.
Andrew Cheeseman, from BAE Systems, said new plans for Concorde would be announced "in the near future".
