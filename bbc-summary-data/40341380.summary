Twenty-two people died and 116 were injured in a suicide bombing at the US singer's concert on 22 May.
The We Love Manchester Emergency Fund charity has raised over £11.7m, with £3m raised at the One Love Manchester concert staged by the singer at Old Trafford on 4 June.
"Ariana Grande exemplified Mancunian spirit," the chair of the charity said.
Councillor Sue Murphy added: "Her fundraising concert raised millions for the appeal and buoyed all our spirits.
"We are grateful to her for agreeing to be patron of this charity, which seeks to help everyone who was affected by the tragedy."
Gift payments from the appeal have already been released to the bereaved families and those who were in hospital for more than seven days following the attack.
Grande is also set to get honorary citizenship of Manchester under plans put forward by the city council.
