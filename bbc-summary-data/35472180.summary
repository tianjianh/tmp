BBC London's Tom Edwards talks to Rachel Aldred at Westminster University, who says between 12 and 14 people die when cycling each year in London. She is calling for better cycling infrastructure.
He also hears from cyclists on the newest cycleway, at Vauxhall Bridge, about how safe they feel.
Steve McNamara at the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, Andrew Gilligan at City Hall and political commentator Martin Hoscik share their views on the progress, and politics, of cycling routes.
