[SN]TITLE[SN]
NIE Networks: Power infrastructure firm changes name

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) is changing its name to NIE Networks in an effort to clarify its role in the Northern Ireland electricity market.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company owns the network of lines, poles and substations that brings electricity from power stations to homes and businesses.
It does not generate electricity, nor does it sell power to consumers.
It makes money by charging suppliers to use the infrastructure and the cost is then passed onto consumers.
Sara McClintock of NIE Networks said: "We know that there is nothing more frustrating than being told: 'We can't deal with your query, you need to speak to someone else.'
"That is why we are trying to clarify the difference between NIE Networks and electricity suppliers.
"If there is a power cut, it's our job at NIE Networks to fix it."
