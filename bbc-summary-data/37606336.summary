The country's football federation announced its decision a day after the Group A match in Kinshasa.
Clemente, 66, had been due to leave at the end of November when his contract would have expired.
Libyan football has suffered from instability in the country and security problems mean they are banned from playing internationals at home.
Their next World Cup qualifier is against Tunisia on 11 November and will be played in Cairo, Egypt.
A spokesman for the Libyan Football Federation said a foreign coach would be in charge for that fixture, which has now become a must-win game for Libya.
Only the winners from the group. which also includes Guinea, will book a place at the  World Cup in Russia.
The highlight of Clemente's time in charge of Libya was the country's first ever senior continental title as they won the 2014 African Nations Championship in South Africa.
Libya won the tournament for locally-based players with a win on penalties over Ghana in the final.
