Arriva Trains Wales strike: Deadlock in talks as action looms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Talks over a train strike which will affect around 60,000 people and see 1,000 services cancelled have hit deadlock as the start time looms.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All Arriva Trains Wales (ATW) services in Wales and parts of England will be cancelled for 48 hours as Rail, Maritime and Transport union and Aslef union members walk out from midnight.
Aslef said no-one from the company had been in contact to resume discussions.
However Arriva claimed it had made four offers to hold talks.
Conservative shadow transport minister William Graham AM said there was the potential for the strike to cause "significant chaos" for all rail users.
The unions argue they are fighting to improve working practices for their drivers, describing conditions for them as "almost Dickensian" in some aspects.
They also say drivers in Wales are paid less than in other parts of the country and want parity with counterparts over the border.
All Arriva Trains Wales services are cancelled, with no replacement bus services. First Great Western services into south Wales as far as Swansea will run as normal, as will Virgin Trains across north Wales to Holyhead. Cross Country services between Cardiff and Nottingham and Derby will also run.
The strike means there will be no services at all west of Swansea, no commuter trains from the south Wales valleys into Cardiff and Newport, no services between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth through mid Wales, between Shrewsbury and Swansea via Llandrindod Wells, between Pwllheli to Machynlleth or between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog. The Holyhead to Cardiff route is also suspended.
The strike is likely to have an impact on travel to the Wales v Netherlands football international at Cardiff City stadium on Friday evening, which kicks off at 19.45 GMT, nearly four hours before the action is scheduled to end.
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Aslef representative Andy Hudd said they would still be willing to meet the company, but added: "They have got to be meaningful negotiations.
"We have delayed putting on strikes for over three months, and the negotiations have been tough. We have moved an awful long way to arriving at a solution."
The RMT said in a statement talks had failed and the strike would go ahead as planned.
General secretary Mick Cash said: "RMT officials have made every effort to resolve this dispute through negotiation, even postponing previous action in good faith so that management could return to the table with an improved offer.
"They have failed to do that and, therefore, we have been left with no alternative other than to regretfully press ahead with the strike action tomorrow."
Gareth Thomas, director of human resources at ATW, told BBC Wales they had been in talks since June and had agreed pay with other grades of workers in the company.
"We are talking about some detailed terms and conditions now where we can't get some agreement with our drivers' union on the minutiae issues which is slightly frustrating because as far as we're concerned the talks are still ongoing, so calling the action this early is a bit of a surprise for us," he said.
The Welsh government said it was being kept updated on the dispute but it was a matter for the train operator to resolve.
Mr Graham said he was also concerned about the impact on travel to the Wales v Netherlands football international at Cardiff City stadium on Friday evening.
"At a time when rail services during the Rugby World Cup are already under the spotlight, the last thing Wales needs is more severe disruption, particularly during another high profile sports event," he added.
