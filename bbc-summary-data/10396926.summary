The trial was told the 38-year-old, from Eskdale Gardens in Belfast, grabbed the woman by her hair and tried to throw her down stairs in September.
The ex-WBU welterweight title holder was given the maximum sentence for the offence, but was released on bail pending an appeal.
He was ordered to stay at an address in Hull pending the appeal.
Magee was also banned from any contact with the victim and banned from taking alcohol.
The victim of the attack, Maria Magill, had been in a relationship with Magee for six years.
She said he attacked her after the couple had been out at a concert and then drinking in a bar last September.
In her evidence to Belfast Magistrates Court, she said they returned to a flat at Glenview Street where Magee asked her to get into bed and then demanded to see her mobile phone to check if another man had been contacting her.
She claimed he grabbed her by the hair, slapped her and trailed out of the room before attempting to throw her down a flight of stairs.
