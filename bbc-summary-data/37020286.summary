The woman suffered serious injuries when the non-emergency vehicle, run by Medical Services Limited (MSL), crashed with a car on the A49.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said the woman was taken to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital but later died.
MSL said a "full and open investigation" into the crash near Strefford on Monday was under way.
"We will work with all agencies to establish the cause," a spokesman said. "Our thoughts are with the relatives at this time."
Four other people were taken to hospital after suffering injuries in the crash which happened just after 19:00 BST.
The ambulance driver suffered chest pain and his female attendant suffered leg and shoulder injuries. Both are believed to be in their 50s.
The 19-year-old driver of the Ford Fiesta involved "had a slightly reduced level of consciousness and back pain" and was taken to hospital with a front-seat passenger who suffered minor injuries, the spokesman said.
