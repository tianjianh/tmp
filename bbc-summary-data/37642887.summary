Ford Kiernan and Greg Hemphill announced last month that the cast will return to the stage in February for a 10-show run of Still Game: Live 2.
Tickets for the shows at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow went on sale last week and five extra dates have now been added.
The first live show in 2014 sold out for 21 nights and entertained more than 210,000 fans.
The popular comedy follows the antics of pensioners Jack Jarvis and Victor McDade in the fictional Craiglang area of Glasgow.
It returned to the BBC last week, after a nine-year absence from TV screens.
The sitcom attracted its highest ever overnight audience for a single episode on Friday, taking a 58% share of the Scottish TV audience with 1.3 million viewers - beating its previous record of 1.2 million.
Airing for the first time on BBC One throughout the UK, it drew a total of audience of 3.2 million.
The comedy grew as a spin-off from Kiernan and Hemphill's Chewin' The Fat sketch show and ran for six series between 2002 and 2007.
The live shows will run from Saturday 4 February to Thursday 16 February, with the cast taking a break each Monday.
