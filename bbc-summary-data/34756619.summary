"Significant damage" has been caused to the Churchfields playing fields in West Bromwich, according to Sandwell council.
The authority said "a number of incidents" have been reported since the travellers arrived on Wednesday.
"They have ruined the football pitches and damaged metal palisade fencing," said Councillor Paul Moore.
In a statement the council said officers were "working to move the travellers on as quickly as possible".
Mr Moore, cabinet member for regeneration and investment, said: "It's completely unacceptable.
"It's also unfair on kids and their parents that these matches have been cancelled. I am sorry for the inconvenience that's been caused.
"Illegal encampments will not be tolerated on council owned land and we will be working to get the pitches back to a decent standard very soon."
