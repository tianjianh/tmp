Wales' education minister has claimed education in England has been mismanaged by the UK government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Speaking at the NASUWT annual conference in Cardiff Bay, Huw Lewis said "ideology has been put before standards".
He claimed millions had been wasted on "vanity projects such as free schools".
The Liberal Democrats accused Mr Lewis as having double standards and the Tories said Labour was letting young people down in Wales.
Plaid Cymru has warned proposed public spending cuts by any future Labour or Conservative UK government would lead to cuts to the Welsh government's future budgets.
