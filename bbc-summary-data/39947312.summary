[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called out to the Burnmouth harbour area at about 20:30 on Tuesday.
The coastguard had received reports the man was missing and Eyemouth inshore and offshore lifeboats were launched and onshore searches also carried out.
Police said the pensioner was found on the shoreline and subsequently pronounced dead at the scene.
His family has been informed and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.
The RNLI said it had been called out after the kayaker was reported as "overdue" having left Burnmouth earlier in the day.
Its inshore lifeboat carried out a thorough search of the coastline from Eyemouth to Burnmouth, while the all-weather lifeboat searched further offshore.
Local coastguard teams also started a shore-based search.
The crew of the inshore lifeboat found the man and his kayak onshore about 400 metres north of Burnmouth.
Attempts were made to revive him and he was transferred to a stretcher and taken by the inshore lifeboat to the harbour where the Scottish Ambulance Service was waiting, but he failed to survive.
The RNLI said the thoughts of everyone at its Eyemouth station were with the family.
