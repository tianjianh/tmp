The Robins, who scored three first-half goals in their opening league win over Barnsley on Saturday, hit the ground running quickly against Argyle too.
Jens Hegeler's strike, Nathan Baker's header, Korey Smith's curler and teenager Freddie Hinds' powerful hit put the hosts 4-0 up at the break.
Winger Jamie Paterson bent in a late fifth to complete the rout.
