[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sean Rigg inquest: Met policeman faces perjury charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An officer with the Metropolitan Police is to be charged with perjury over evidence given at the inquest of a man who died in custody in south London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Rigg, 40, who had schizophrenia, suffered a cardiac arrest at Brixton police station on 21 August 2008.
The inquest in 2012 found police used an unsuitable level of force with him.
Sgt Paul White gave evidence at Mr Rigg's inquest. The CPS said it had reviewed the case at the family's request and would prosecute Mr White.
A second officer was originally referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on suspicion of perjury and perverting the course of justice.
Sue Hemming, head of the Crown Prosecution Service's (CPS) Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said she had considered the evidence against the second officer but concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.
Sgt White, who was based at Lambeth Borough at the time of Mr Rigg's death, is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on 8 September.
In a statement, Scotland Yard said it was aware of the CPS decision to prosecute an officer and the officer concerned was on restricted duties.
It said it was also co-operating with two investigations by the IPCC following the death of Mr Rigg.
The first is a re-investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death and the second is an investigation into the evidence given by Met officers at the inquest into Mr Rigg's death. The musician had been arrested on suspicion of attacking a man in Balham, south London
The statement also said: "The Metropolitan Police Service would again like to emphasis our sympathy to Mr Rigg's family and acknowledge their loss."
