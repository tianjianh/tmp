Luatua, 25, back-rower has won 15 caps for the All Blacks.
"Since bursting onto the scene as a 19 year-old, Steven has been a consistently formidable presence, both at Super Rugby and for the All Blacks," head coach Mark Tainton said.
"He's a hungry, ambitious 25-year-old and a standout performer at the very highest level."
