[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry McCarthy, 51, killed his 50-year-old wife Lorna at the house in Gorleston, Norfolk after she returned after a night out in September.
Norwich Crown Court was told he had discovered she had been using online dating agencies and he objected.
Judge Anthony Bate, sitting at King's Lynn, said McCarthy should serve 16 years before parole is considered.
He had been separated from his wife for four months, sleeping in separate bedrooms, before killing her, the court heard.
She had already agreed to stop using dating websites but during the fatal night out with friends on Saturday 27 September, McCarthy called her and they argued.
After returning home at around 03:00 on Sunday 28 September she sent text messages to friends and family stating McCarthy had smashed up her laptop computer.
She also sent a text to her daughter at 04:15 saying: "I'm out in Norwich tomorrow from midday but if I have not messaged you by then please call the police.
"I'm quite serious as I really don't know what he is capable of these days."
Her daughter never received the text.
At lunchtime on the Sunday McCarthy went to Gorleston police station where he used the public telephone outside to confess killing his wife.
Police found her body at the Sussex Road house in the back bedroom and tests revealed she had died from a stab wound to the heart.
Det Ch Insp Paul Durham said: "The sentence reflects the severity of what was a horrific and brutal attack on a woman in her own home by a man she had spent 25 years of her life with."
