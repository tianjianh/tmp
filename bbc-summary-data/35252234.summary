More than 800 good deeds ranging from feeding a badger everyday to secretly paying a neighbour's vet bill have been recorded in a village in Somerset.

Congresbury, near Bristol, launched its 800 acts of kindness bid in January to mark the church's 800th anniversary.
Since then the 3,500 villagers have recorded 850 good deeds on cards posted into a box at St Andrew's Church.
Becci North, one of the organisers, said: "It just snowballed, absolutely snowballed - everyone's embraced it."
The target of 800 acts of kindness was confirmed on Christmas Day when it was discovered the number of good deeds posted at the church had risen to 817.
Along with painting public benches, picking up litter and washing people's cars, good deeds included giving clothes to someone sleeping rough, sending a card to someone feeling low, helping a stranger carry their shopping and looking after a friend's pet.
One resident gave a ticket away for the midnight showing of Star Wars: The Force Awakens to a friend, while another not only fed a badger everyday but left food for it when they went away.
Ms North said it was a "testament to the whole village" that so many people of "all ages" had got involved in the campaign.
"In a world where there's so much doom and gloom in the news it's easy to miss a nice friendly smile or a stranger giving up their seat for you on a bus," she said.
"We've had three and four year olds putting in good deeds - helping friends put their socks on after gym class or walking a neighbour's dog because they were ill.
"The list just goes on and on.  It's absolutely amazing and so many people have benefitted."
