[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two nephews of Venezuela's first lady have been found guilty of conspiring to import 800kg (1,750lb) of cocaine into the US.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas, 31, and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, 30, were convicted at a court in Manhattan, New York.
Both defendants face up to life in prison when they are sentenced.
They were arrested in Haiti in November 2015, following a sting operation by the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).
Prosecutors said the two men plotted to use a Venezuelan airport's presidential hangar to send the drugs to Honduras and on to the US.
The defendants' lawyers argued that the sting operation was deeply flawed and built around an unreliable informant.
The informant, Jose Santos-Pena, was using and dealing cocaine as he helped the DEA build the case, defence lawyers said.
Mr Santos-Pena had signed a co-operation deal to testify against the defendants, but when the defence produced evidence that he had lied, prosecutors took the unusual step of announcing in court that his deal would be torn up.
"He lied in your face!" defence attorney David Rody said to jurors. "You saw a rare thing, a government co-operator get ripped up in court."
One juror, Robert Lewis, a 69-year-old architect from Westchester County, called the informant "slime".
"Nobody was in love with the witnesses," Mr Lewis said. "We clearly had some bad guys."
Campo Flores and Flores de Freitas are nephews of Cilia Flores, the wife of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Ms Flores is also a deputy in the National Assembly of Venezuela, of which she was president from 2006 to 2011.
She reportedly raised one of the two defendants after his mother died. She has not commented on their arrest and trial.
Assistant US Attorney Brendan Quigley said the men "thought they were above the law".
"They thought they could easily make tons of money sending drugs out of the country because, as defendant Flores said, the DEA is not here and the Americans don't come in here," he said.
"But they were wrong."
