Work to repair a flagship leisure centre in Dumfries which has been closed for more than a year is unlikely to be completed before 2018.

The DG One site was shut in October 2014 for remedial works expected to take about 18 months.
However, an ongoing wrangle with contractors has put the start of those repairs on hold.
It means permission is being sought to keep a temporary replacement swimming pool in place for an extra 22 months.
The council revealed on Thursday that it hoped to agree an out-of-court settlement with contractors "very soon".
A planning application to extend the use of the temporary pool reveals that work is not likely to start before the middle of this year.
It said the council was committed to ensuring there was no "gap in swimming provision" and asked for an extension of permission for the facility in the car park at Dumfries Ice Bowl.
It would allow the pool to stay in place until April 2018 while work on the DG One leisure centre was completed.
