Cake map of East Lindsey on Skegness seafront

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Creators of a giant edible map in Skegness will literally be able to have their cake and eat it later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The baked portrayal of East Lindsey is on show in the seafront's Compass Gardens.
Skegness Cake Fest was organised in a bid to create "a 100 sqm fully-edible map of the area".
Community groups and individuals were invited to create a baked version of their favourite landmark, building or place in the county out of cake.
Organisers SO Festival said: "We are so excited to present Cake Fest, a giant edible map of East Lindsey.
"One more thing, in case you were wondering - yes, when the map has been completed and suitably admired by the crowds, we'll eat the lot."
Similar Cake Fests have been held in Edinburgh and Stirling in Scotland.
