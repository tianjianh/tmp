Thousands of fans from all around the world voted to give Ada, a striker at French team Olympique Lyonnais, the title.
2016 was an incredible year for Ada - she was the top scorer in the French League (with 33 goals) and Women's Champions League (with 13), and saw her French club storm to a treble-win.
With such an impressive scoring record, Ada was the one and only player to clock more goals in Uefa's 2016 competition than Cristiano Ronaldo. She scored 18 to Ronaldo's 17.
Ada said that victory in the Champions League was what meant the most to her - she scored the opener in the final against German side Wolfsburg, and finally lifted the trophy after winning 4-3 on penalties.
She said: "It's the most important thing you can win in football, the highest trophy at club level. Winning it was such a fantastic feeling, a much bigger feeling than I thought it would be,"
"I dreamed of it as a little kid, it's a huge challenge and we showed we were capable of doing it."
Ada was presented with the award by her sister, Andrine, who is also a professional footballer and played alongside her at clubs in Norway and Germany.
