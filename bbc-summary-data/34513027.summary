[SN]TITLE[SN]
Falkirk 0-1 Hibernian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A controversial penalty by Jason Cummings five minutes before half-time was enough to move Hibernian up to second place in the Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John McGinn went to ground as he pushed the ball round Falkirk defender Blair Alston and referee Alan Muir awarded a spot kick to the visitors.
Earlier, Lee Miller had hit the Hibs crossbar with a powerful header.
Falkirk responded well in the second half but they rarely tested Mark Oxley in the Hibernian goal.
That header by Miller came against the run of play as Hibs had been the dominant side in the opening period.
There had been little to excite the fans from that point until, just before the interval, referee Muir penalised Alston when McGinn attempted to play the ball around the outside of him but then appeared to slip.
The Falkirk players looked astonished as Muir pointed to the spot and, despite stern protests, the penalty stood and was duly knocked home by Cummings.
Muir had to be escorted up the tunnel at the break as both Falkirk players and coaches surrounded him to question his decision.
For all Falkirk's improved display in the second half they struggled to fashion many clear chances, though John Baird and Will Vaulks had attempts on target.
The home fans thought they had a fair claim for a penalty when Darren McGregor appeared to handle the ball as he was clearing his area but on this occasion Muir waved play on.
And those same supporters greeted the full-time whistle with a chorus of boos, while the 1,800 travelling fans gave their players a standing ovation as their sixth win from their last seven league games meant they leapfrogged Raith Rovers and into second place in the table.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "I feel a little hard done-by.
"I didn't think it was a penalty kick. The referee said to me that, if it was on the halfway line, he would have given a foul, but I don't think he was in a great position to see it, while the linesman is in a perfect position and didn't give it.
"Considering Hibs' resources and talk of them winning championships, we are not far away from them on that performance."
Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs: "I was surprised, but if you look at the incident before the penalty, maybe that had a bearing on why he has given it.
"The lad pushes David Gray with two hands as he's going for the ball.
"But, to be honest, there were a lot of decisions for both teams that were a bit baffling.
"This is a good three points for us and they thoroughly deserved it."
