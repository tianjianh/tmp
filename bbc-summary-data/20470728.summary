A woman was killed by a falling tree in Exeter on Saturday night, while a 70-year-old man died after his car crashed into a swollen river in Cambridgeshire.
Devon and Cornwall have been among the worst hit areas, with hundreds of homes flooded. One severe flood warning is in place in Helston, Cornwall.
David Cameron has talked of "shocking scenes of flooding".
From the BBC:
Elsewhere:
The prime minister's Twitter message also said the government "will help ensure everything is being done to help".
The Environment Agency confirmed that 816 homes had been flooded as a result of the heavy rain.
Apart from Devon and Cornwall, homes and properties have been flooded in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, Kempsey in Worcestershire, and areas of Gloucestershire. Houses have been evacuated in some areas.
In Kempsey, new Â£1m water pumps intended to protect against flooding failed overnight.
The Environment Agency said an engineer would be stationed at the pumps overnight to manually activate the system, in case it fails again.
There are more than 270 flood alerts - indicating people should prepare for possible flooding - in England and Wales and more than 220 other flood warnings in place across England, which mean people should take action because flooding is expected.
Of these, about 60 are in the South West and around 110 in the Midlands.
The BBC Weather Centre said further heavy rain is expected to affect Wales and south-western parts of England during Sunday afternoon and evening.
Given how saturated the ground is at the moment, people should be aware of the risk of localised flooding, forecasters said.
In developments around the country:
The man who died in Cambridgeshire was driving a car when it left the road shortly before 17:00 GMT on Saturday and went into a river near Earith.
He was pulled from the water by a member of the public and attended to by a paramedic but was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital.
And Devon and Cornwall Police said the dead woman was seriously injured when a tree fell on it in Western Way at about 23:50 GMT. She died after being taken to hospital in Exeter. Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
Inspector Andrew Webber of Devon and Cornwall Police told Sky News the woman was 21 and had been living in a small tent placed next to the wall at the roadside when the spruce tree fell on it.

Environment minister Richard Benyon said: "I am so impressed with how the emergency services and Environment Agency have responded - we have more than 500 houses that have been flooded and it had been a miserable experience for them.
"What we learned for the floods in 2007 has been invaluable and what the local authorities are doing with the emergency services has helped.
"We are better prepared, but no one is taking away from the misery that these floods have causes or the threat of further floods. You can only feel sorry for those people.
"Our estimate is that about 20,000 homes have been protected by flood defences that have built in the past few years."
As well as the severe flood warning and flood warnings across England and Wales, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Sepa, has two flood alerts in place. There are none in Northern Ireland.
The Met Office has been forecasting heavy rain and strong winds across some parts of the country over the weekend and has yellow warnings in place. which advise people to "be aware" of weather conditions.
On Thursday, a man died in floods after he became trapped in his car under a bridge in Chew Stoke near Bath.
