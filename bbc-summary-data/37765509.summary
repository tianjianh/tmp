[SN]TITLE[SN]
Natalie Hemming death: Man admits concealing partner's body

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted concealing the body of his partner 30 miles from their home but has denied her murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalie Hemming, 31, was last seen alive in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, on 1 May. She was found dead on 22 May.
At Luton Crown Court, Paul Hemming, 43, of Milton Keynes, pleaded not guilty to murder but admitted her manslaughter.
But, the prosecution did not accept the guilty manslaughter plea and Mr Hemming will now stand trial for murder.
Mr Hemming also admitted a charge of obstructing a coroner in the execution of his duty by intending to prevent the Coroner of Buckinghamshire from holding an inquest.
He then admitted a charge of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a dead body.
Mr and Miss Hemming lived together at an address in Alderney Avenue, Newton Leys, Milton Keynes.
She was last seen alive as she left her mother's home in Hemel Hempstead.
Her body was found three weeks later, 30 miles away at Toms Hill in Chandlers Cross, Hertfordshire.
Mr Hemming is now due to go on trial on Wednesday accused of her murder.
