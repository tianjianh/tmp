[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paul Robinson appointed deputy Humberside PCC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A councillor has been appointed as the deputy Humberside police and crime commissioner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Humberside Police and Crime Panel had voted against Paul Robinson's appointment at a meeting last week.
It was concerned he would not have time to be able to fulfil both his roles of councillor and deputy commissioner.
Humberside PCC Matthew Grove said he had reflected on the panel's view but decided Mr Robinson was the right person for the Â£45,000-a-year post.
Mr Robinson is a Conservative councillor for the Howdenshire ward for East Riding of Yorkshire Council and worked closely with Mr Grove during his campaign for election as Humberside PCC.
Mr Grove, who was an East Riding of Yorkshire councillor until his election as PCC, said: "As commissioner I need someone who I have total trust and confidence in and who can fit this profile.
"My judgement is that Paul fits this role and can deliver everything I need to be delivered.
"This appointment represents a significant judgment call for me, and I recognise that the members of the panel had only a 12-page report and a 30-minute questioning session with Paul to base their recommendation on.
"I have seriously considered their views but my judgment is based upon significant knowledge of Paul, my personal experience and honest belief in him."
Police and crime panels, which include local councillors, have been set up to scrutinise the actions and decisions of each PCC and make sure information is available for the public, enabling them to hold the PCC to account.
