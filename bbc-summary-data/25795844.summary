Ms Trierweiler left Pitie Salpetriere hospital for the presidential residence at La Lanterne in Versailles.
Ms Trierweiler later tweeted to say she was "very touched" by all the messages of support she had received.
Closer magazine had alleged the liaison between Mr Hollande and Julie Gayet.
It said that the affair had begun during the 2012 presidential race.
Ms Gayet, 41, says she is suing Closer for breach of privacy, seeking 50,000 euros (Â£41,000; $68,000) in damages and 4,000 euros in legal costs.

Ms Trierweiler, 48, works for Paris Match magazine, which said she was planning to rest at La Lanterne.
Mr Hollande has not commented on the latest news.
However, a source at the presidential office told Agence France-Presse news agency that Ms Trierweiler would stay at La Lanterne "for a few days".
Ms Trierweiler later tweeted: "Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all those who have sent messages of support and for my recovery - by Twitter, SMS or email. Very touched."
Ms Trierweiler had been admitted to hospital on 10 January, in a reported state of shock at the allegations.
Mr Hollande visited her for the first time on Thursday evening.
French media have claimed that Ms Trierweiler suffered an anxiety attack last week, but her friends have played down her condition.
At his annual news conference on Tuesday at the Elysee to discuss his political agenda, Mr Hollande was asked questions about the alleged affair.
Mr Hollande, 59, said he was experiencing a "difficult moment" in his private life but refused to answer questions over the report in Closer, saying "private matters should be dealt with privately".
Nor would he clarify whether Ms Trierweiler was still first lady before a February trip to the US.
