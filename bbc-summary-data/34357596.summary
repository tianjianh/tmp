Free parking lessons for Cambridge dodgy drivers offered by former mayor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former mayor of Cambridge is so irritated by inconsiderate parking that he is offering drivers free lessons.

Ian Nimmo-Smith, 70, puts handwritten notes on windscreens of cars blocking pavements and cycle paths in the city.
As reported in the Cambridge News, the notes inform drivers their parking is both "illegal and dangerous". He then offers "free lessons on legal parking" and leaves his mobile phone number.
Mr Nimmo-Smith said as yet no-one had taken him up on his offer.
The keen cyclist, who previously represented the West Chesterton ward as a Liberal Democrat, told the BBC it was "a way of letting off steam".
"If I come across a case of obstruction as I make my way around the city... I will stop, and if the driver isn't there I will leave a note explaining that I don't think the car is well parked, and offering to give lessons or discuss how to improve their behaviour."
Although he has not yet been called upon to conduct a free parking lesson, he said he would "quite like to know how the owners of the cars react when they receive a note like this".
"[Parking like this] is dangerous - it's not just about being in violation of article 'x' of the Highway Code."
Cyclists could be "at risk of being pushed out into busy traffic" which could result in an accident, he said.
"It is quite a frequent occurrence in the various locations I go through in the course of a week."
