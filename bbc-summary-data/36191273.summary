Police were called to the Parkway Sports and Social Club in Plymouth on Sunday after about 15 people were reported to be fighting in a bar.
"A number of people suffered minor injuries following the brawl," police said.
Two men, aged 23 and 29, and 24-year-old woman were arrested for affray and have been bailed to 23 May.
Club managing director Chris Carwithen said the fracas started in the bar after the event.
"There was an altercation that escalated out of control," he said.
"We are holding our own investigation and anyone involved will be banned for life. We don't tolerate that kind of behaviour."
Police said the fight broke out at 19:55 BST at the club in Ernesettle Lane. They are appealing for witnesses.
