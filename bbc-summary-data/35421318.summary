Swansea goalkeeper Tremmel joins Werder Bremen on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel has joined German side Werder Bremen on loan for the rest of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Hannover and Hertha Berlin keeper has been signed to help Bremen avoid relegation from the Bundesliga.
The 37-year-old has not played a Swans game this season as Swedish international Kristoffer Nordfeldt is preferred back-up to Lukasz Fabianski.
Swansea have also confirmed Diego Bortoluzzi will be added to new coach Francesco Guidolin's backroom staff.
Bortoluzzi worked under Guidolin at Palermo, Parma and Udinese and was most recently at Verona.
The 49-year-old becomes the third Italian on the Swansea coaching staff, which also includes former Chelsea midfielder Gabriele Ambrosetti.
Goalkeeper Tremmel first signed for Swansea from Red Bull Salzburg in 2011 and was part of the 2013 League Cup-winning side.
After being released by Swansea in May 2015 he returned at the start of the current season.
But Tremmel hasn't featured this season as Polish international Fabianski has been an ever-present for Swansea in the Premier League with Nordfeldt playing the cup games.
