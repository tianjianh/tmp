The Queen's grand-daughter became the first member of the Royal Family to win an Olympic medal at London 2012.
Tindall also won the Eventing World Championships in 2006 but has been left out of Team GB's eventing long list.
GB have named 10 athletes in the list and will make their final selection by 18 July.
Tindall achieved the Olympic qualification mark aboard High Kingdom last month at the Badminton Horse trials but has been left out of the Rio squad on selection grounds.
The 35-year-old was the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2006 following her World Championship victory.
