Ballot, manifesto, party, pledge, swing...

You'll be hearing words like these pretty often between now and the general election on 7 May.
We're now in the official campaign period, when the different political parties will be working hard to win your vote.
It can be a lot to take in, so Newsbeat's come up with this special jargon buster for you to keep handy!
Ballot box - the sealed box in which you put your ballot paper after you've voted.
Ballot paper - the paper on which you cast your vote, by marking an X in the box next to the name of the person you want to win.
By-election - a one-off election that happens in between general elections, usually when an area's MP has died or resigned.
Candidate - a person who's running in an election, usually representing a political party.
Coalition - when two or more parties join together to make a government (when no party has a majority). This is what the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats did after the last general election.
Constituency - the area that your elected MP represents. There are 650 constituencies in the UK (and, as a result, 650 MPs).
Deficit - the difference between what the government collects in taxes and what it spends. Cutting the country's deficit is a key talking point.
Electoral register - the list of everyone who's registered to vote. You need to be on it to be able to vote on 7 May.
First past the post - is the voting system we use. Despite the name, there is no actual 'post', it just means that the candidate with the most votes wins.
Government - the government runs the country and is usually formed by the party that wins the election, or by a coalition.
House of Commons - the elected bit of Parliament. Our MPs have their own chamber where they sit  on green benches.
House of Lords -  unlike MPs, Lords aren't elected but usually chosen for their experience. They do things like consider new proposed laws and check the work of the government. They sit on a red benches.
Hung parliament - if no party gets a majority (more than 50%) of seats then we have a hung parliament. No one gets hung though!
Kingmaker - if there's a hung parliament then smaller parties might be able to play 'kingmaker' to the bigger parties who need extra MPs to make up a government.
Landslide - a landslide means when a party wins loads more seats than the nearest rival party. Experts think it's unlikely this time.
Majority - this means one party winning more than 50% of seats in the House of Commons (the magic number is 326).
Manifesto - a list of a party's ideas and policies, outlining what it'll do if it wins the election.
MP - stands for Member of Parliament. Each of the 650 UK constituencies has an MP who represents his or her area's interests in the House of Commons.
Opposition - the political parties aren't in the government - they sit opposite the government in the House of Commons. The leader of the opposition party with the most seats is called the "Leader of the Opposition".
Parliament - is where new laws get debated and agreed. Parliament is made up of two 'houses' - the House of Commons and the House of Lords - and also, officially, the Queen but she doesn't get involved in decision-making.
Party - we're talking political party here, which refers to a group that have common political goals. Most MPs belong to a political party.
Pledge - a pledge is a promise from a political party.
Policy - is the posh name for a plan of action from the party.
Polling station - is the place where you go to cast your vote - usually somewhere local to where you live, such as a school.
Prime minister - the person who is leader of the country and moves into 10 Downing Street. It's usually the leader of the biggest political party.
Referendum - a type of vote where voters are given the chance to decide on a major issue, by voting yes or no. One of the big issues this election is whether there should be a referendum on the UK being in the European Union.
Returning officer - the person chosen to make sure the area's vote goes smoothly and is done fairly. He or she will also announce the result.
Seat - when a candidate wins and becomes an MP, they win a 'seat' in the Houses of Parliament.
Spoilt ballot - when a voter hasn't voted properly on their ballot paper, such as by leaving it blank or writing more than one cross. Spoilt votes don't count towards the final result.
Swing - used to describe how much of a change in support there is from one party to another.
Term - a bit like a term at school or university, it means the fixed period of time between general elections. MPs are elected to serve for one term.
Turnout - the number or percentage of people who actually turned out to vote.
