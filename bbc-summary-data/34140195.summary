The first minister said images of Aylan Kurdi being carried from the sea had "touched our hearts".
Ms Sturgeon is to convene a migrant crisis summit on Friday with councils and humanitarian agencies.
Prime Minister David Cameron has come under increasing pressure for Britain to accept more refugees.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson is among those who have urged Mr Cameron to do more to tackle the refugee crisis in Europe.
But Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said accepting more refugees was not the answer.
Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon said: "As first minister I pledge that I will ensure Scotland will do everything possible to help in this refugee crisis.
"I will be far from the only person reduced to tears last night at the picture of a little boy washed up on a beach.
"That wee boy has touched our hearts but his is not an isolated tragedy.
"He and thousands like him whose lives are at risk is not someone else's responsibly; they are the responsibility of all of us.
"So yes I am angry, I am very angry at the walk-on-by attitude of the UK government and I implore David Cameron to change his position and change it today.
"I pledge as first minister of this country that we stand ready to offer sanctuary to refugees that need our help."
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale also criticised Mr Cameron's response to the crisis.
She urged the first minister to "convene an urgent meeting with Scotland's council leaders, party leaders and people in this parliament and other relevant government agencies so that Scotland can speak with one voice and match our compassion with the action we are all willing to take".
Ms Sturgeon said she had already set up a summit, which will bring together humanitarian organisations, including the Scottish Refugee Council, leaders of councils, civic organisations and religious leaders.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said he would accept the invitation to attend the summit.
Ms Davidson said the UK government must act "closer to home" and go beyond donating aid to Syria, adding: "This is not an immigration issue - it's a humanitarian crisis."
She added: "I call on David Cameron to lead our government's response and accept more refugees."
