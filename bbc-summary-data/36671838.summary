The production, which played in Manchester in April, will be put on demand for 30 days from 11 July.
A co-production between Talawa Theatre Company and the Royal Exchange, it also starred Harry Potter actor Alfred Enoch and Holby City's Rakie Ayola.
Talawa artistic director Michael Buffong said it was "exciting" to bring the play to "a wider audience".
"We are always seeking to push ourselves as artists, always trying to go beyond what is expected," he added.
The critically-acclaimed production also featured Philip Whitchurch, who appeared in The Bill and My Hero, and former Emmerdale actor Wil Johnson.
The film has been funded by digital commissioning body The Space and will be made available across a range of platforms including cinema over the next year.
The Space's chief executive Fiona Morris said the move would "ensure that the audience for this powerful production continues to grow".
King Lear: the Film is being included on the BBC iPlayer as part of the corporation's Shakespeare Lives digital festival.
The film will be available on the festival's dedicated site until 30 September.
