'Oxford Eye' among £44.5m of new investment proposed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "Oxford Eye" Ferris Wheel has been proposed as part of a £44.5m tourism plan for the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plan, to be published on Monday, describes the attraction as giving people "a different view of the city and its surroundings".
Alternative ideas include a viewing tower and a tethered hot air balloon.
Other suggestions are for an Oxford Cultural Mile and a new attraction called The Oxfordshire Experience that would use 3D film footage.
Lorraine Lindsay-Gale, Oxfordshire County Council's cabinet member for culture, said the goal was to "reach out to all parts of the world" to promote Oxfordshire.
