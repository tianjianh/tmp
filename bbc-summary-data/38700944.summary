Newport County boss Graham Westley:
"We're three unbeaten now, we haven't had a horrible run of results, the lads have come in and started to settle together.
"They are playing football that is more accustomed to the top end of the league than the bottom end of the league.
"It's a positive run of three. We need to make sure we come back next weekend ready to improve on what we've done this weekend."
