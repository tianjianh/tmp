While out and about in Hereford where we were asked what impact the Old Market complex had on historic High Town.
You were curious to know what the red doors in canal bridges were for.
And you had lots of questions about the West Midlands first 'metro' mayor. Here is a look at how we have been getting on answering your questions.

Some feared the new complex would be the death of the historic high street. Others hoped it would bring a new lease of life.

Have you ever wondered why some bridges have little red doors in them?
They can be spotted in the walls of canal bridges and sometimes over rivers in the West Midlands.
We went to Kings Norton in Birmingham for a demonstration on why they are there.
All this week we have been asking for your questions on the West Midlands 'metro' mayor.
You asked us which areas would be voting in the elections on 4 May and what would happen to Lord and borough mayors.
You wanted to know budgetary powers the successful candidate would have and how much the new role would cost.
