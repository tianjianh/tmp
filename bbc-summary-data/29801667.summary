Newsbeat listeners have got in touch to say that they tend to do the majority of their money management using online accounts.
Many can't remember the last time they actually went into a bank.
They can however remember the last time they went for a pint and it turns out the pub they were in just might have been a bank.
This pub certainly has a lot of history. According to its website at the end of the 19th century the Law Courts' branch of The Bank of England was built on the site.
It traded there until 1975 before the premises were sold to a building society. In 1994 it was refurbished by a London brewers and has been a pub ever since.
On the site they continue with the myth of Sweeney Todd claiming the building lies between the site of his barber shop and the pie shop owned by Mrs Lovett.
"It was in the tunnels and vaults below the present building that his victims were butchered before being cooked and sold in the pies to Mrs Lovett's unsuspecting customers," it says.
The Corinthian Club, home of the The Bootleg Bar, was once home to the Glasgow and Ship Bank and later the Union Bank of Scotland.
Now the bar is made from old bank safes and the floor features a 500,000 piece mosaic which has been shaped in the image of Queen Victoria as she appeared on old banknotes.
The website for this boozer is perhaps less informative than some of the others on the list, simply saying: "Borrowing and lending were once regular activities in this building, which was a bank for many years and is now a Wetherspoon pub."
The plaque you can see on the outside of the building details the history of this pub.
During the 1990s the building, which was formerly a branch of the National Westminster Bank, was converted into a bar.
National Providence Bank had originally commissioned the building in the 1920s.
Described on its website as a rare survivor of World War II bombing raids, The Bank in Plymouth retains some of its original features.
A highlight of its jam-packed weekly schedule is karaoke Wednesdays and Fish Club on Fridays.
