Pompey host Bristol Rovers in League Two on Saturday as they look to climb back into the League Two play-offs.
Cook's side have also slipped seven points off the automatic promotion places after failing to register a win in their past three games.
"The reality of the game is I have a lot of fans to keep happy," Cook told BBC South Today.
The former Accrington and Chesterfield manager took charge at Fratton Park in the summer but, since the start of 2016, his Pompey side have slid from fourth to eighth in League Two.
"It's a fantastic job to have, any manager who manages this club is in a privileged position," he added.
"It's a chain around your neck that should be something of an honour. I find that in football if you don't want to have criticism then you're in the wrong job.
"At the minute, certainly a percentage of them (the supporters) aren't as happy as I would like them to be, but there's a long way to go in this season and I'm sure there's a long way to go in my tenure at the club."
