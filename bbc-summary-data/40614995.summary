Andrew Thomas, known as Tommo, is understood to have made the remarks while addressing crowds at Gwyl Nol a Mlan music festival in Llangrannog, Ceredigion, last weekend.
BBC Radio Cymru confirmed it had received a complaint but said it did not relate to anything said on air.
Mr Thomas and the festival said they did not want to comment.
A spokesman for BBC Wales said: "We have received a complaint and are investigating the matter.
"Whilst the investigation is held, Tommo will not be hosting his show on BBC Radio Cymru."
The Cardigan-born radio presenter, who hosts Radio Cymru's afternoon programme, also works as a stadium announcer at Wales' home football matches and at Parc Y Scarlets rugby ground in Llanelli.
