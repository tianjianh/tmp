Israel lifts restrictions on entry to Ramallah

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Israeli military has lifted the restrictions on access to the West Bank city of Ramallah that were imposed following a shooting on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Non-residents were prevented on Monday from entering the city, where the Palestinian Authority is based.
Checkpoints resumed "normal activity" overnight following a "situational assessment", the Israeli military said.
In Sunday's attack, a Palestinian policeman shot and injured three Israeli soldiers outside Ramallah.
Israel has struggled to halt a wave of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs that have left 28 Israelis dead since October.
More than 155 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israeli officials say - have also been killed in that period.
The assailants who have been killed have either been shot dead by their victims, or security forces as they carried out attacks. Some attackers have been arrested.
Other Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops amid spiralling violence.
