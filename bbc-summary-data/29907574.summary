The Potteries side, in the first round proper for the first time, were a goal down inside 11 minutes when Alex Rodman fired in the opener from close range.
Striker Ramshaw then struck twice in four minutes just before the break, completing his treble late on.
Norton's cup run has still brought in almost Â£50,000 in FA Cup prize money.
The Evo-Stik League Division One side were playing their eighth game since their cup run began in the preliminary round in August.
Along with Warrington Town, conquerors of Exeter City on Friday night, they were one of two teams left in from the eighth tier of English football.
