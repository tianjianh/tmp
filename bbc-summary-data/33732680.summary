School bus fees 'hit Welsh medium education hardest'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charges for school buses hit Welsh-medium sixth-formers harder than English-medium students, the Welsh Language Commissioner has said.

Meri Huws said they usually have to travel further for their lessons, and may be put off by the extra cost.
Eight of the 22 councils told her they charged for school transport for 16-year-olds, up to Â£380 a year.
The Welsh government said councils had a duty to consider access to Welsh-medium education when charging.
Ms Huws said she feared cash-strapped councils may introduce or increase transport charges for post-16 learners, claiming this would have a "disproportionate effect on low-income families".
A Welsh government spokesman said its Learner Travel measure required councils to consider the effect of transport provision on Welsh-medium education, but added that all 16-18-year-olds would get discounted bus fares for school, work or training from September.
