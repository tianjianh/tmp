Kris Doolan's 10th goal of the season looked to have earned Partick Thistle their fourth straight Premiership win.
But Warren nodded home at the far post for the Highlanders, who had a first-half strike from Henri Anier disallowed with Billy Mckay standing offside.
Doolan stabbed home an inviting Ryan Edwards cross to put Partick ahead.
The hosts remain in sixth place while Caley's late rally saw them move to within a point of 11th-placed Hamilton.
The visitors had the first effort of the match when Greg Tansey fired a 25-yard shot wide of Tomas Cerny's right-hand post.
But that was their only real threat in the first quarter as the home side dominated possession.
Edwards, Chris Erskine and Steven Lawless were always on the move, probing and stretching the Caley defence.
Callum Booth and Mustapha Dumbuya were getting forward on the flanks but only the final product was missing as visitors defended well.
Edwards blasted over before Inverness keeper Owain Fon Williams thwarted Erskine and Doolan after neat combination play.
Injuries to Abdul Osman and Lawless forced Partick to alter their strategy. They hadn't had time to replace Lawless, who was off the pitch, when the visitors thought they had opened the scoring four minutes before the interval.
Anier fired in a shot from the edge of the area which beat Cerny, but as the Caley Thistle players headed off to celebrate, the flag went up for offside against his fellow striker Billy Mckay.
The threat of Doolan, Thistle's top scorer, was always evident and early in the second half Fon Williams had to tip the striker's low shot round the post.
But in the 56th minute the Thistle hitman slid in to connect left-footed with Edwards' whipped low cross from the right, his 99th goal for the club.
Fon Williams produced an excellent save to deny Thistle a second. A succession of one-twos between Erskine and Doolan ended with the ball taking a ricochet off Louis Laing.
But just as it looked like producing an own goal, the Caley Thistle keeper dived to his left to turn it round the post.
Doolan donned the captain's armband after Osman went off and led the line well, but it was the Caley Thistle skipper who had the last word.
Two minutes into stoppage time Warren rose at the back post to head in the equaliser from Billy King's cross to earn what could be a vital point in their relegation battle.
