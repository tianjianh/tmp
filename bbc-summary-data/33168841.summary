A police spokeswoman described Souhaur Mouhamad Hassan Khalil al-Abbassi as the "supervisor" of an assault on the busy Jo Goldenberg eatery.
France is requesting his extradition, but prosecutors could not say how long the process would take.
Six people died and 22 were injured in the gun and grenade attack.
Al-Abbassi, 62, is one of main suspects being sought by the authorities in connection with the killings.
In March, French media said arrest warrants had been issued for three men living in Norway, Jordan and the occupied West Bank.
They are believed to have been members of a group led by Palestinian militant Abu Nidal, which was active in the 1970-80s.
The Abu Nidal group was blamed for a series of attacks across the world, which left at least 900 people dead.
Its leader - whose real name was Sabri Banna - died in Iraq in 2002, after reportedly taking his own life.
The Jo Goldenberg restaurant was popular among members of the Jewish community and became famous as a symbol of resistance to anti-semitism.
