Drivers on London's Night Tube have voted to strike in a row over jobs.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union voted 96% in favour of beginning industrial action.
The union said drivers on the new weekend service, which launched in August, were being blocked from applying for full-time jobs.
A London Underground spokesman said the service had been running in line with agreements reached with the unions and urged the RMT to continue talks.
Unions say Night Tube drivers have been prevented from moving into vacant full-time positions for at least 18 months and do not qualify for overtime pay because they only work 16 hours a week.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "It is outrageous that London Underground have decided to discriminate against their Night Tube drivers.
"This is a senseless and damaging policy that picks out one group of staff for negative treatment and of course the drivers are angry and that is why our members have voted overwhelmingly for action."
The drivers' union Aslef is also balloting its members for strikes, with the result due on Thursday.
"Night Tube services have been running since August last year in line with agreements reached with the unions. We've met with the RMT to discuss and resolve the new issues that they have.
"We have invited the RMT to more talks later this week and I encourage them to continue discussions with us rather than threaten industrial action."
Separately, Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) on the Tube are also threatening strike action because of shift pattern changes that could leave them stranded.
British Transport Police (BTP) wants a third of all shifts to end at 01:00 in response to "changing policing needs".
The TSSA union said a late finish meant many PCSOs would have no safe route home on public transport after work.
BTP said it was in talks with the TSSA.
