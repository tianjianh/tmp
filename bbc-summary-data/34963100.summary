Tuesday night's Co Antrim Shield semi-final between Carrick Rangers and Linfield has been postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.

The decision to call off the fixture was made following a morning pitch inspection and the game has been rescheduled for Tuesday, 15 December.
Carrick's planned league game with Dungannon on that date will be moved.
The other semi-final between Larne and Ballymena United goes ahead after the pitch passed a lunchtime inspection.
Carrick have had three home Premiership games postponed in recent weeks - their league fixture against Dungannon Swifts has been called off twice.
Gary Haveron's side were also forced to postpone their match against Cliftonville on Saturday because of a waterlogged pitch.
Larne will be out to cause an upset against the Sky Blues at Inver Park.
"We know we are nowhere near winning the league so it's important to compete for other silverware," said Ballymena manager Glenn Ferguson ahead of the trip to their County Antrim rivals.
"We want to reach as many cup semi-finals and finals as we can."
"We played Larne in pre-season so that gives us some idea what to expect. It will be a tough match as all the teams near the top of the Championship are capable of giving the senior teams a game," he added.
The Sky Blues progressed to the last four by beating league champions and leaders Crusaders 2-0 at Seaview, courtesy of goals from David Cushley and Tony Kane.
Their opponents lie third in Championship One after a 4-4 draw with Armagh City on Saturday.
David McAlinden's side saw off Ards 2-1 to reach the semi-finals and will take heart from their League Cup performance against Portadown earlier in the season, taking the Premiership outfit to extra-time before losing 4-1.
There will be coverage of Larne v Ballymena United on a Sportsound Special on BBC Radio Ulster medium wave and the BBC Sport website on Tuesday night from 19:30 GMT.
