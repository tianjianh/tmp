Chris Beardsley rescued a point for play-off chasers Stevenage in the final minute against 10-man Accrington.

Nicky Hunt was dismissed in the first minute for Accrington before the home side went ahead through Sean Maguire.
Stevenage equalised when Simon Walton converted from the spot after Lloyd Jones handled in the area.
Maguire fired in his second to give Stanley the lead again, but it was heartbreak for Accrington as Beardsley hooked in to level late on.
Accrington sit in 17th, with their place in League Two safe with only two games remaining.
Stevenage are in sixth position, and look likely for a play-off place as eighth-placed Luton are four points behind.
Stevenage boss Graham Westley told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"I think our front six were better than their back six. I think their front three were better than our back four, which was a disappointment. It's a team game, it's a team performance. Everyone takes their responsibility.
"We know that teams with 10 can often react by producing steely, determined, gritty performances. It was an afternoon where they played very well with 10 men. We struggled, we persevered and we showed determination.
"Our focus won't change, our focus will just be on ourselves. We've got to keep winning points and keep winning games to push ourselves into the promotion situation.
"You get nothing for nothing in football. We didn't do enough to win the three today, we did do enough to get one."
