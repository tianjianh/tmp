North Wales Police had warned supporters to behave at the Racecourse and later confirmed there were no arrests at the match which ended 0-0.
Safety fears meant Chester fans had to travel on official coaches under police escort.
It is the fourth year the fixture has been marked as a "bubble match" - meaning supporters will be kept apart.
North Wales and Cheshire police forces have said restrictions could be reviewed if there was no trouble at the two games this season.
Speaking before the game, North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said: "If things go well, it looks as if this bubble business with the restrictions on travelling fans can be lifted which would be great news."
"This is now the only [current] fixture in all the tiers of English and Welsh football that is a bubble, including Premier League and Championship derby fixtures, and I think it is risk averse and disproportionate in terms of policing," he added.
