The 35-year old South African number eight joined Sarries in July 2009 and has won two Premiership titles with the club and last season's LV= Cup.
In all, he has made 113 appearances for the club, scoring 13 tries.
"There's definitely a tinge of sadness, deciding to hang up your boots, but I'm overwhelmed and joyful when I think of all the great memories I've made here," Joubert told the club website.
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall added: "Ernst has been a truly fantastic player during his six years at Saracens.
"He has played a huge role in helping us become a side that is challenging on the field and has been extremely important in establishing a brilliant culture off the field. I'm sure all Saracens fans will give Ernie the send-off he so richly deserves."
Before the end of November, Saracens host Toulouse and Worcester Warriors, either side of a trip to face Ulster.
