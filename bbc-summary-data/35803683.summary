France forward Antoine Griezmann gave Diego Simeone's side a first-half lead with a superb free-kick.
But Antonio Sanabria equalised for Abelardo Fernandez's men on 79 minutes before Castro tapped home Jony's low cross with a minute left on the clock.
With eight games left, Atletico trail leaders Barcelona by eight points.
Luis Enrique's side, who have a game in hand on Atletico, can extend their lead at the top of La Liga to 11 points if they beat Villarreal at El Madrigal on Sunday.
Atletico seemed on course for a fifth consecutive league win just before the half-hour mark, when Griezmann floated an inch-perfect free-kick from 25 yards over the wall and into the top corner of Ivan Cuellar's goal.
But the visitors, who played 120 minutes in the Champions League on Tuesday before beating PSV Eindhoven on penalties, lost their focus in the second half.
Sanabria equalised with a free-kick that deflected off Atleti midfielder Matias Kranevitter and past goalkeeper Jan Oblak.
Castro then hit the bar for Gijon following Sanabria's low cross from the left.
Atleti went down to 10 men for the final moments of the match, following an injury to defender Jose Gimenez after Simeone had already made his three substitutions.
Spain Under-21 international Castro took advantage to score the winner and secure a first league victory for Gijon since 31 January.
Gijon, who started the match in the bottom two and three points from a position of safety, remain in the relegation places following Granada's 2-2 draw with Rayo Vallecano on Saturday evening.
