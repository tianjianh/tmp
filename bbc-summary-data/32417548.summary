Election 2015: Pippa Bartolotti's call to legalise medical cannabis

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cannabis should be legalised for medical use, according to Wales Green Party leader Pippa Bartolotti.

Ms Bartolotti made the case for a change in approach in a speech at Cardiff University on Thursday night.
Legalising cannabis has been Green Party policy for some time.
Ms Bartolotti said: "No one has yet died from using cannabis, in fact the health benefits of cannabis in the treatment of epilepsy and cancer are already well documented."
She added: "Commercial organisations in the UK are already allowed to patent and sell cannabis extracts, whilst the population as a whole is criminalised for using it - even if it saves their life. This simply has to be changed."
Ms Bartolotti said cannabis is wrongly labelled as a gateway drug to harder substances like cocaine and heroin and it is the criminalisation of it which is the gateway.
