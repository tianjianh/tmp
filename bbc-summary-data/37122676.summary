Jayne Ludlow's side are preparing for home qualifiers with Israel on 15 September and Austria on 20 September.
The inclusion of Seattle playmaker Fishlock is significant as she was pondering international retirement.
"We're looking forward to the next campaign, which is really important for us," she said.
Fishlock hinted she would retire after Wales' failure to reach next summer's Euros but the 29-year old is now targeting another campaign.
"We're really excited," said Fishlock. "We haven't been together for a while now and we always enjoy being together.
"Friendlies are always important. The result is not the main thing - it's about what we get out of it and hopefully we can get good things out of this one.
"The team spirit is good, it's always good. It is fun."
