More than 40 possible breeding sites for water voles have been spotted on waterways across Wiltshire, Somerset, and Gloucestershire.

The Canal and River Trust, which ran the survey for the "shy and elusive" mammal, said there had also been an "encouraging" number of sightings.
It said the data reported by the public would enable ecologists to monitor, maintain and protect the habitats.
Habitat loss and the threat from mink have been blamed for their decline.
Sightings of the water vole - immortalised as Ratty in Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows - have declined over the past 45 years, the charity said.
Laura Mullholland, ecologist at the Canal & River Trust, said while the number of sightings "is really encouraging... there's a long way to go before they're out of danger".
"These results have definitely given us hope, not least because people are taking the time to look out for them," she said.
"The more people get involved with trying to save them, the more likely it is we'll have Ratty back on our canals and rivers for good."
