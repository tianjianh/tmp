[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It sounds like a storyline straight from Hollywood - but a star of Orange is the New Black has just married one of the show's writers, in real life.

Samira Wiley and Lauren Morelli met on the set of the Netflix drama, about life in a women's prison.
It was while writing for the hit show that Morelli, who was then married to a man, realised she was gay.
Wiley and Morelli's wedding took place in Palm Springs, California, at the weekend. Wiley's parents officiated.
They got engaged six months ago in the very same place.
Wiley and Morelli shared a picture, originally published by Martha Stewart Weddings, of them in their wedding outfits. Morelli captioned it "Wifey for Lifey".
The wedding had a confetti theme, according to the wedding website, and the pair entered their reception to the strains of Justin Bieber's Baby.
Wiley, 29, is best known for her role as Poussey Washington in the drama, and is to appear in a new adaptation of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale.
Her new wife came out publicly three years ago, writing on Mic.com that she realised she was gay in 2012 on one of her first days on the set of Orange Is The New Black.
