The number of people waiting more than six weeks for key clinical tests in the NHS has more than doubled in the last year, according to Scottish Labour.

The Scottish government's standard is that patients should be waiting no longer than six weeks for one of eight diagnostic tests - including MRI scans.
Scottish Labour has looked at recent statistical data.
It said "more and more patients" were waiting longer for procedures aimed at ensuring early detection of problems.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said waiting times were at "historically low levels".
The eight tests are upper and lower endoscopy, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, CT scans, MRI scans, barium studies and non-obstetric ultrasounds.
The official figures highlighted by the party are contained in a recent statistical publication from ISD Scotland.
According to the data, the total number of people waiting more than six weeks in Scotland across all eight tests was 5,314 at the end of March this year.
This was up from 2,472 at the same time last year, a rise of 115%.
When it came to CT scans alone, nearly 10 times as many people had been waiting more than six weeks compared to last year, up from 22 to 200 in the same period.
Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jenny Marra called for the matter to be addressed urgently.
She said: "These targets are there to ensure that people with potentially serious conditions get the benefit of early detection and have the best possible chance of a full recovery but more and more patients are having to wait longer than the six weeks.
"Our NHS is being overwhelmed because there simply aren't enough resources going in to cope with the targets being set by the Scottish government.
"They took the decision to squeeze the NHS budget even harder than the Tories and the consequence has been people being made to wait longer and longer."
Health Secretary, Ms Robison said the SNP Government has increased Scotland's health budget to a record high of more than Â£12bn.
She added: "Waiting times are at historically low levels in Scotland, and the latest figures show that more than 750,000 people have now been treated in under 12 weeks under this government's treatment time guarantee.
"Our hard working NHS staff ensured that 91.2% of patients had one of eight key diagnostic tests within six weeks according to the latest figures. This is against the background of increased demand and a challenging winter period.
"However, we know we must do more to cut waits, which is why we are targeting funding at boards and areas that need it most."
