Two teenage girls - including one who had been faking a pregnancy - have been detained for conspiring to kidnap three babies.

Holly Kelland, 17 at the time, contacted new mothers through a bogus Facebook profile and offered free baby clothes to get their addresses.
Her friend Cody Farrar, also 17, posed as a social worker and persuaded a mother in Derby to hand over her baby.
Both have been given 12-month detention and training orders.
Derbyshire Police believe Kelland, now 18, intended to pass the baby off as her own.

Det Sgt Duncan Gouck said: "She had obviously created a story around her pregnancy and that story was maintained over a period of time to family and friends.
"I can only assume the offences were committed in order for that false reality to continue into the future."
The bogus Facebook profile was set up in the name of Clare Farrant and was used to try to obtain the addresses of new mothers by offering them free designer baby socks.
A mother in Huddersfield was contacted first, on 14 September, but she gave her mother's address instead of her own and the girls did not visit her.
A woman in Derby was then contacted on 20 September, and was duped into giving her address with the promise of free socks and a raffle prize of Â£100 of baby clothes.
The girls visited her the next day and Farrar, posing as a social worker, said she needed to take the baby away for a health check.
The 20-year-old mother handed her baby to Farrar, but then became suspicious.
Later that day the girls contacted a mother in Wolverhampton in their third attempt to kidnap a child, but were foiled.
