The Scot's second title in two months is ideal preparation for this month's European Championships in Kolding.
Sixth seed Gilmour, who won European silver last year, saved a game point in the opener before taking control and winning 22-20 21-11.
Gilmour, who won last month's Austrian Open, beat Denmark's Sofie Dahl 13-21 21-16 21-11 in her semi-final.
The 23-year-old, who has fought her way back up the world rankings to 45 after an injury lay-off, was also taken to three games in the quarter-finals.
She had to wear down Delphine Lansac to lead 24-26 21-13 13-7 at which point her French rival retired from their 63-minute battle.
