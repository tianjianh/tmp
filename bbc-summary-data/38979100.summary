Tornado, the first mainline steam engine to be built in the UK since the 1960s, pulled an eight-carriage train between Appleby, in Cumbria, and Skipton, in North Yorkshire, along the famous Settle to Carlisle line on Tuesday.
It was the first time since 1968 that a steam locomotive has hauled a passenger train on a scheduled main line service.
Tornado will power two further return journeys between Appleby and Skipton on Wednesday and Thursday.
