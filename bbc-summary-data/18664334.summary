M1 in Bedfordshire reopens after bridge removed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The M1 in Bedfordshire has reopened after an old 1,400-tonne bridge at Junction 12 was demolished, the Highways Agency has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The road reopened both ways between J11 and J13 just before lunchtime on Sunday.
The bridge was knocked down as part of improvement works between J10 and J13.
The concrete and steel bridge, 17m wide and 41m long, was designed by Sir Owen Williams and Partners and built in 1959 to carry the old A5120 over the M1.
A new bridge opened in May.
Project manager Lynne Stinson said: "The demolition of the old bridge was an essential part of the managed motorway scheme.
"The closures meant that our workers were able to concentrate on demolishing the structure as quickly and as safely as possible."
The first phase of managed motorway between Junctions 10 and 11 is almost complete, with testing now being carried out ahead of it becoming fully operational in mid-July.
