The Oscar-winning star is nominated for her role as pioneering British scientist Rosalind Franklin in the play Photograph 51.
Kidman is up against Denise Gough (People, Places and Things), Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Nell Gwynn) and Lia Williams (Oresteia).
The awards, hosted by Rob Brydon, take place at the Old Vic on 22 November.
In the best actor category, four-time winner Simon Russell Beale is up for his performance in Temple at the Donmar Warehouse against Kenneth Cranham for The Father, Ralph Fiennes for Man and Superman and James McAvoy for The Ruling Class.
Imelda Staunton's highly-praised role in Gypsy has earned her a best musical performance nomination while Gemma Arterton's lead role in the Made in Dagenham show has earned her a place on the list for newcomer in a musical.
The National Theatre leads with seven on the shortlist, followed by Royal Court with five and the Donmar Warehouse with four.
The National's The Mother with the Hat by Stephen Adly Guirgis vies for the best new play with The Father, written by Florian Zeller, and Martin McDonagh's Hangmen.
The former's director Indhu Rubasingham makes the best director shortlist alongside Robert Icke for Oresteia and Jamie Lloyd for Assassins.
The London Evening Standard's Evgeny Lebedev said: "This fantastic shortlist bears witness to the fact that Londoners are living through a theatrical golden age. With ground-breaking director-led seasons, visionary new writing dominating the West End and the world's finest thespian talent queuing up to perform here, London's theatre scene is the envy of the world."
