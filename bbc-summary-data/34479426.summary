[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newsround want your videos of family life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newsround, the BBC's daily news programme for children on CBBC, needs your help with a massive project examining what it's like to be a brother, sister or only child in the world today.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We want you to share your videos of your children with us.
Whether they're fighting, playing, laughing, best friends or worst enemies, we want to see it.
It'll help the team understand what it feels like to be an older brother, younger sister, middle child or only child and they might use it in the film.
Do -have fun, be experimental. You could film an activity your children do together or something which is an aspect of your culture or religion, anything, as long as it is something which shows their sibling relationship. If you are using a camera phone then film landscape.
Don't - talk to the camera, talk to each other. Try not to film with the light source behind you.
Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a Newsround producer.
If you have a video of your family life life that you would like to share with Newsround then upload your videos here or email us with your stories and videos.
