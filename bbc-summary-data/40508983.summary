Sussex v Leicestershire: Clint McKay claims 4-59 as Foxes take the upper hand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicestershire seamer Clint McKay took 4-59 as the Foxes gained the upper hand against Sussex on day one at Arundel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sussex chose to bat after winning the toss but McKay and Mathew Pillans (3-63) did well to limit the hosts to 262.
Stiaan van Zyl (49), Luke Wells (42), Chris Jordan (34) and Luke Wright (29) all got starts as Sussex managed just two 50-run partnerships.
The Foxes lost openers Paul Horton and Arun Harinath, but Colin Ackermann and Mark Cosgrove reached stumps at 77-2.
