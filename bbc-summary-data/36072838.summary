The force said in a statement: "Following formal identification, officers have confirmed the woman's body recovered from the Dorset coast on Friday 1 April is that of Rose Polge.
"Rose's family have been informed and they request their privacy at this very difficult time."
Susan van de Ven, a friend of the Polge family and Liberal Democrat county councillor in Melbourn, where the family lives, said: "It's absolutely devastating news and an enormous loss for so many people, and not least the loss of Rosie herself - for the life she had ahead of her.
"My thoughts are of course with her family and her friends."
Dr Polge was reported missing from Torquay on 12 February.
Police, the coastguard, the RNLI and Dartmoor Search and Rescue were involved in the search.
The BBC understands that a note found in Dr Polge's car related mainly to personal issues, but included a passing reference to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
It is understood Dr Polge had been an active campaigner against plans to change working hours and conditions for junior doctors, and in January posted a new Facebook profile picture, featuring the hashtag #NotFairNotSafe.
