The Ospreys are the Welsh regions' best hope of reaching the Pro12 playoffs this season. Currently in fourth position, they will be hoping to climb up the table as they face bottom-of-the-table Zebre this weekend.
The game will be live on Clwb Rygbi on S4C on Saturday with coverage starting at 19:00 GMT. Joining Gareth Roberts as part of the presenting team will be former Wales international Emyr Lewis and Wales' forwards coach Robin McBryde.
