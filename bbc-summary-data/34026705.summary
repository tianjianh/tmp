[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 39-year-old was assaulted by the three men and two women near Nicolson Street in Edinburgh city centre.
Police said the victim had left a Tesco store at about 00:20 on Friday and turned on to Gibbs Entry when the group asked for money and cigarettes.
The man offered them cigarettes but was then subjected to the apparently unprovoked attack.
They then stole cash and cigarettes as he lay on the ground.
The men were described as being in their mid to late 30s. One was wearing a white jacket, another a grey top with shoulder patches, and the third an olive green jacket.
The two women were described as being in their mid to late 20s. One was wearing a black Adidas top and the other was wearing a tracksuit top which was mainly pink.
PC Kevin Walls said: "We are pursuing a number of lines of inquiry in relation to this incident but I would ask anyone who was in the area of Nicolson Street around the time of this crime and who has information that can assist with our investigation to please get in touch.
"It appears this was a completely unprovoked and vicious assault with the suspects showing absolutely no regard for the welfare of the victim."
He added that officers were reviewing local CCTV footage.
