Aldershot Town have signed striker Richard Brodie from National League rivals Southport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brodie, 28, only signed a new deal with the Sandgrounders in the summer but was left out of the squad for Tuesday's goalless draw at Macclesfield.
The former York City forward has signed a one-year contract with Aldershot.
"Richard is the different type of striker that we've been looking for," Shots boss Barry Smith told the club's website.
