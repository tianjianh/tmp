He will aid boss Gordon Strachan and assistant Mark McGhee, after the departure of Andy Watson to a coaching role at a football school in Oman.
The Scots host Canada in a friendly on 22 March, four days before a vital 2018 World Cup qualifier against Slovenia.
"Tony is well respected within the game," said Strachan.
"I would like to thank [Dons manager] Derek McInnes and Aberdeen for allowing Tony to work with the Scotland backroom staff for these next two games."
Scotland are on four points after four matches and sit second bottom of World Cup qualifying Group F, four points adrift of second-placed Slovenia.
