A competition to design a flag for Caithness has attracted 327 entries - including 10 ideas from the US and others from Brazil and Australia.

The contest, which involves Highland Council, has also had submissions from across Scotland and England.
The judging panel met in Wick last Friday to whittle the entries down to a short-list.
Four ideas are now being created in a digital format for an online public vote later this month.
The vote would run until 31 July.
Caithness Civic Leader Gail Ross said: "The flag will be the public symbol of Caithness so I was delighted that so many creative and inspiring designs were submitted.
"As well as entries from our local schools, 10 designs came from America and there were also entries from Brazil, Australia, England and elsewhere in Scotland."
