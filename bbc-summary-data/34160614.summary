Reid pounced early on with a tap-in to give the visitors the lead.
But Jason Banton, who joined Wycombe from Plymouth in the summer, blasted in an equaliser on 12 minutes from Aaron Pierre's knock-down.
Jervis scored his fourth of the season before half-time when a clearance cannoned off him and into the net.
Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"I can't fault the players efforts. We have had a brilliant start to the season, we just have to take a step back and look at where the club stand in this division.
"If only those posts where a couple of inches wider we would have had a few today, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.
"It's disappointing that we have lost but we now have a big game against Orient to bounce back with. It will be a real David and Goliath Game but I'm looking forward to facing one of the favourites to win the league."
