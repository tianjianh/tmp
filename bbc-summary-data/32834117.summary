English National Ballet (ENB) is to move to a new "state of the art" home in east London, its artistic director Tamara Rojo has announced.

The company will share the building - on the new London City Island development, close to the Canning Town railway interchange - with the English National Ballet School.
"I want the space to echo to the sound of creative Britain," Rojo said.
The companies hope to move into the new premises in autumn 2018.
The centre will combine training facilities, teaching and rehearsal studios alongside a theatre-sized studio space.
"I want to create a new space that allows us to produce and rehearse amazing work," said Rojo, who is also the company's principal dancer.
"Not only that, I want a building that will be available for other artistic organisations to rehearse too, whether they are staging opera, musicals or theatre."
English National Ballet, which was founded in 1950, is currently based in a 19th Century building in Kensington originally designed for student housing.
The English National Ballet School, established in 1988, inhabits part of a listed building in Fulham where it trains some 75 students per year. A third of ENB's current dancers are graduates of the school.
The two companies - who announced their intention to find a new home in July 2014 - will jointly fund-raise for the costs of fitting out the new space. ENB's current building is to be sold.
London mayor Boris Johnson described the joint relocation to east London as "an exciting development".
"Having bespoke, state of the art facilities will strengthen this internationally renowned company's ability to create new work and to rehearse, as well as allowing its talent development and creative learning plans to flourish," he said.
"The move will also open up new opportunities for local collaborations and further increase east London's growing status as an important cultural centre."
