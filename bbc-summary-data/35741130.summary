The Australian had a closing round of 12-over-par 84 at Doral, but picked up $48,000 (£33,700) for finishing 65th.
Bowditch, who completed his final round in two hours and 12 minutes, said: "I shot 37 over par and still made a paycheck. All's not that bad."
Adam Scott of Australia won by one shot on 12 under, from Bubba Watson.
Bowditch qualified for the tournament, which does not cut the worst players after two rounds, by virtue of his world ranking of 78.
He opened with a nine-over 81 on Thursday and followed it with consecutive 80s before having two triple bogeys in his final round 84 to record the highest-ever score at a WGC event but said he never considered quitting.
He had to play the final two rounds on his own after Brandt Snedeker pulled out with a rib injury.
Mike Dunaway was the last player to have four rounds in the 80s at the 1983 Las Vegas Pro-Celebrity Classic.
