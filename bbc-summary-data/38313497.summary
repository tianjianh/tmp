Nathan Clarke, 24, of Hamilton Drive, Lincoln, had admitted having a bladed article and reckless arson on 25 May.
Lincoln Crown Court heard he had vandalised his cell and threatened to harm himself before starting the fire using bedding and clothes.
Three prison officers had to be treated for the effects of breathing in smoke following the blaze.

Jon Straw, prosecuting, said Clarke's actions came after he was refused his request for an afternoon phone call.
He said the prisoner had become "petulant and abusive" and had threatened to cut himself with a toothbrush which had two razor blades melted into it, before starting the fire.
"One of the officers said it was the worst cell fire he had ever seen," Mr Straw added.
David Eager, mitigating, said Clarke had never intended to harm anyone else and had seen a psychiatrist who had concluded he was not dangerous.
Clarke, he said, had a history of taking so-called legal highs and harming himself.
Passing sentence, Judge Michael Heath told Clarke he had caused serious disruption to the prison and that the danger to other inmates was obvious.
