[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of guests.

Lawro's opponent for this week's fixtures is legendary 1980s pop star Rick Astley.

Astley is a Manchester United fan and says he did not really have any choice in the matter. "I did not even have to think about it," he explained. "I always supported United because my older brothers do."
He only began watching United regularly in the late 1990s when he took a break in his music career and his first visit to Old Trafford in 1998 saw the Red Devils beaten 1-0 by Arsenal, who are back in Manchester on Saturday.
Astley told BBC Sport: "United are so exciting as a team going forward but, like every team, there are certain days when it doesn't click and when it is like that it is just painful.
"That was just one of those days unfortunately - so I might be a jinx."
He has better memories of another meeting between the two sides a few months later, however, when he saw Ryan Giggs run past what seemed like half the Arsenal team to score his favourite United goal in a famous FA Cup tie.

"It is an obvious one to choose as my favourite but I was watching the game in a bar at the Val d'Isere ski resort in France," Astley said.
"The bar has a very low roof and the amount of people who banged their heads when Giggs scored was unbelievable - it just kicked off big time.
"It was weird because obviously the Arsenal fans were gutted but you could see in some of their faces that even they could appreciate it. It is just a ridiculous goal, almost as if someone wrote it down and said 'there you go, just go and do that'."
You can make your own predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro and other fans, and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
In the last round of games before the international break, Lawro got four correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 70 points.
He was beaten by former Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger, who got five correct results, with one perfect score, for a total of 80 points.
All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated.

Lawro's prediction: 1-1

Match report
Tottenham v West Ham (17:30 GMT)
The contract situation at Tottenham concerning Harry Kane and Hugo Lloris is a really interesting one. How Spurs deal with that problem, and whether they match their wage demands or not, will be a sign of the club's ambition.
As for the game, Kane's fitness will have benefitted from being allowed to leave the England camp early. He should start, like he did against Arsenal before the international break, and he should be a bit sharper now.
Spurs have drawn their past four league games but I fancy them to win here. West Ham will have to wait to pull clear of the relegation zone.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Rick's prediction: 2-1
Match preview
Middlesbrough v Chelsea (16:00 GMT)
I am on Match of the Day 2 for this game on Sunday.
Chelsea's impressive form continued against Everton last time out and, although Middlesbrough are on a decent run of results,  I do not see them stopping the Blues from making it six league wins in a row.
Like Liverpool, Chelsea do not have European football to worry about, and seem to be building up a head of steam.
The battle at the top is great for the Premier League. It looks like the top five teams might pull clear and Manchester United have got a lot of work to do if they want to stay in touch.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Rick's prediction: 0-3
Match preview
West Brom v Burnley (20:00 GMT)
These teams have a few things in common - they are both in mid-table and managed by two very good British managers who know exactly what they are doing.
I am going with Tony Pulis's West Brom to win on Monday, though. Sean Dyche's Burnley side got a point at Old Trafford at the end of October but that is their only point on the road so far this season.
The Clarets do not have much of a goal threat away from home and I do not see the Baggies giving them many opportunities in front of goal.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Rick's prediction: 1-1
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 140 points (week three v Laura Trott)
Lawro's worst score: 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
