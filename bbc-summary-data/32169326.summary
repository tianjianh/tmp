Nick Mann, 35, and brother Robert, 32, had been to see Shrewsbury Town's match at Portsmouth on Saturday.
Robert fell on to the Tube tracks at Old Street station, London, and Nick was hit by a train as he tried to help. He died in hospital on Sunday.
Fans at Shrewsbury's match held a minutes' applause in honour of Nick, who had followed the club all his life.
His photo was shown on the scoreboard in the 35th minute of the team's match against Dagenham & Redbridge on Friday, prompting fans to begin the tribute.
Both brothers were originally from the Shropshire town and had regularly attended fixtures around the country.
Tweeting shortly after watching the team beat Portsmouth 2-0 on Saturday, Nick had described it as one of his favourite away days of the season.
Paying tribute, Shrewsbury Town FC said its thoughts were with his friends and family.
A journalist and press officer, Nick was a big music fan, writing for a number of websites.
His brother Robert is still in a critical but stable condition at the Royal London Hospital.
British Transport Police (BTP) said they were not treating the incident as suspicious, adding that it appeared to be a "tragic accident".
One eyewitness described watching Nick hit by the train as he attempted to pull his brother off the line.
