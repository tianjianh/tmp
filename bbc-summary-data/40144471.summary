Philip Shard, 60, died in hospital last week after being struck and collapsed while playing golf at the Fynn Valley Golf Club, Witnesham last Saturday.
The club said it was a "tragic incident".  A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said crews "treated a man, believed to be in his 60s, who was in cardiac arrest".
Mr Shard was married and lived in Rushmere, near Ipswich.
The spokesman added: "Following treatment at the scene, he was resuscitated and taken to Ipswich Hospital by land ambulance in a critical condition."
Tony Tyrrell, club owner and secretary, said: "Everyone at the club is horrified by it. It's a dreadful thing to have happened and our thoughts are with his family.
"He only became a member a couple of months ago and he quickly became well known to the regulars."
