The visitors went close when a left-footed Jake Gosling strike shaved the outside of the post.
He also hit a free-kick just over the bar before pulling the ball back for Daniel Leadbitter, who dragged his shot wide.
The draw left Rovers in fifth place in League Two, one point off the top three with three games left.
