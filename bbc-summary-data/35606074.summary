A serving policeman jailed for trying to arrest one of Northern Ireland's most senior judges is to attempt to appeal his conviction to the UK's highest court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Anthony Carlin has also instructed lawyers to seek bail as he seeks to overturn the three-month prison sentence imposed for his approach to Lord Justice Gillen.
His application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court will be dealt with at a specially arranged hearing in Belfast on Friday.
On Wednesday, the 43-year-old PSNI officer was found guilty of contempt of court in proceedings brought against him by the Attorney General.
Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan held that he had acted with premeditation and determination.
Sir Declan described him as a man driven by self-importance and attention seeking who "revelled in being the spotlight".
The judge told Mr Carlin that if he seeks to apologise after 28 days the rest of his sentence will be set aside.
He had tried to arrest Lord Justice Gillen following the verdict of a repossession matter between Mr Carlin and Santander.
