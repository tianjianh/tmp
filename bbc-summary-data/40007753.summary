Europa League final: Man Utd's Ander Herrera excited by chance to 'make history'

Manchester United must focus on making history when they face Ajax in the Europa League final on Wednesday, says midfielder Ander Herrera.

The Spaniard, 27, is "really excited" by the chance to help United win the competition for the first time.
And he says United's second cup success of 2016-17 would make this a "great season" for the Red Devils, despite them finishing sixth in the league.
"I think we have the quality to get the trophy for the club," said Herrera.
"We have to play very well if we want to win it.
"We can be back in European titles - that's what United are about."
Victory in Stockholm would take United back into the Champions League, but Herrera said the players will simply focus on bringing a European trophy back to Old Trafford.
"We will have a chance to think about the other things we have achieved if we win it," he said.
"I am prudent because Ajax want to win it as well, and Ajax are a good team. They have a talented team. They play with no fear.
"It is one game, one trophy. That is what will be in our minds. We are going to play for one European trophy that this club has never won."
Herrera believes United are in the "right moment" to win Wednesday's final.
But he added: "Ajax are also a massive club. Massive clubs in finals are never easy to beat."
Herrera, who joined United in 2014 from Athletic Bilbao, was last week named the club's fans' player of the year.
But he stressed the club's achievements came before his.
"I don't want to think about what I have done," he said. "This is a team sport. This is Manchester United and we need hard work from everyone to get the trophy.
"If we don't win the final, people won't remember what I have done, or they will but not as much. I want to win it to make a great season.
"This game doesn't decide whether the season has been a success or a failure, that is too extreme. It can be a great season but I wouldn't say it would be a failure.
"I prefer to think that we have in our hands the chance to make history for the club and to make a great season."
Herrera will look to team-mates such as Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney - both Champions League winners in 2007-08 - for inspiration.
"They have been European champions. They can push us to be prepared for the final. Not every player in the dressing room has played in a European final. Less have won a European final."
Herrera said injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic had been helping the team team prepare for the final.
Ibrahimovic had surgery earlier this month after suffering cruciate knee-ligament damage in the Europa League win over Anderlecht on 20 April.
Herrera said: "Zlatan is here to help. We are a team who is together. Everyone is important. He is supporting us.
"The final is in Sweden, close to his house. But he will be there supporting and helping."
