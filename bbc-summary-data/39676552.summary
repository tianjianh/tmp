[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Torquay guaranteed another season in the National League with a well-deserved victory against relegated North Ferriby at Plainmoor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a nervous start, the Gulls grew into the game and started to apply pressure, which nearly paid off in the 14th minute when a powerful shot from Brett Williams struck a post.
Luke Young forced a good save from Owen Evans and later went close with a couple of first-half free-kicks.
The Gulls started the second half purposefully and finally breached the visitors' defence in the 58th minute when skipper Aman Verma headed home a free-kick after Jordan Lee had been brought down by Mark Gray.
Giancarlo Gallifuoco had a goal disallowed in the 65th minute, but the Gulls ensured they will be back in the National League next season when Myles Anderson headed home two minutes from time.
