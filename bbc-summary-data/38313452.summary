SFA: Malky Mackay to be appointed new performance director

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Football Association has appointed Malky Mackay as its new performance director.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Watford, Cardiff City and Wigan boss succeeds Brian McClair who stepped down in July this year after 17 months in the role.
Mackay was the subject of an English FA investigation in 2014 concerning text messages he had sent containing discriminatory language.
The Scot apologised for his actions and stated a desire to return to football.
Equality campaigners Show Racism The Red Card have backed the appointment, but SNP MSP Clare Haughey urged the SFA against the move, arguing it would send out the wrong message.

At the time of McClair's exit, SFA chief executive Stewart Regan said the role "requires a different style of leadership and focus".
And, when announcing his appointment, the SFA said Mackay will be "responsible for overseeing the strategy designed to improve elite talent development across the game, working in partnership with the clubs to deliver successful future international players".
Mackay said: "I am immensely proud and privileged to become performance director and I am acutely aware of the importance of this role in achieving future success for our talented young players.
"As someone who was fortunate enough to develop as a young player at Queen's Park and realise my dream of playing for my country at the national stadium, this feels like coming home.
"I can't wait to work in partnership with our clubs and my colleagues at the Scottish FA to help improve future generations of Scotland players."
Regan added: "From the start of the recruitment process, Malky was an outstanding candidate and by the end of that thorough process he was the outstanding candidate."
