Staff at a motorway service station which was badly damaged in a fire reacted slowly when the blaze started, a customer has said.

The blaze erupted in a restaurant at Fleet services on the M3 at 22:30 GMT on Wednesday
Mark Willis said the extent of the damage was "preventable". Fire investigators confirmed the blaze started in a coffee machine.
Operator Welcome Break declined to comment on the specific claims.
It said the cause of the fire was still being investigated.
Mr Willis said he was able to walk up to the seat of the fire, a coffee machine which had smoke "pouring out".
"It had that very distinct smell of a burning motor," he said.
He said he then left the building but another two customers entered as he exited. He also said the fire was initially small enough to have been extinguished "in seconds" with a fire extinguisher.
"It was a ridiculous a total waste of time for the fire services for a fire that could have been prevented," he added.
It said a temporary structure should be put in place by early January. The Fleet North services remain open.
The fire was brought under control in the early hours. No-one was injured but the rear of the building was destroyed.
Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service (HFRS) said 100 firefighters were sent to the scene and part of the M3 was closed for a time.
The footbridge which runs over Fleet services on the M3, named after BBC Radio 1's Scott Mills, was also closed due to smoke logging.
