Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said all managers "struggle" to control their emotions, after Manchester United's Jose Mourinho said he was being treated differently to his rivals.

Klopp apologised after shouting in fourth official Neil Swarbrick's face during Tuesday's 1-1 draw with Chelsea.
Mourinho said he was told he would be sent to the stand if he did not sit down during Wednesday's visit of Hull.
"It is quite an emotional game," said Klopp.
"To switch off emotions is not simple. We struggle. Not only myself and Jose, but [Arsenal manager] Arsene Wenger and a lot of others."
Klopp said Swarbrick responded to his apology by saying: "No problem, I like your passion."
Speaking about that incident following his side's 0-0 draw with Hull, Mourinho said: "A fourth official told a manager: 'I enjoy very much your passion.' I'm told to sit down or I'm going to be sent to the stand."
Mourinho appeared to be frustrated by the performance of referee Mike Jones and walked out of a post-match BBC interview.
Klopp said: "Maybe I was lucky with what the fourth official said because I have never heard something like this before. There are different ways to handle the situation.
"We are all different; sometimes we get a fine, sometimes not. It's not what we want to do, nor is it a tactic."
Liverpool, who are 10 points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, visit Hull City on Saturday (15:00 GMT).
