General election 2017: The story of results day

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adults in the UK have voted in the general election. This important vote decides the UK's next government and who will be the next prime minister.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Polling stations were open on Thursday from 7am until 10pm - and millions of adults had their say.
The result has now been announced as a hung Parliament.
The Conservative party did win the most Member of Parliament (MP) votes, but they didn't win more than half, which is what they needed to do in order to automatically stay in power.
However, Theresa May will stay on as prime minister, for now, after agreeing with the Democratic Unionist Party to work together to form a government.

This is the end of Newsround's live online coverage of the UK general election.

Prime Minister Theresa May has said that she will form a new government by working with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
Because the DUP are a party that only stand for election in Northern Ireland, you may not have heard of them unless you live there.
So here are five things that you should know about this party.
Listen to what Theresa May said when she announced that she would carry on as prime minister and work with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to form a new government.
Theresa May has said she will form a government with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that can provide "certainty" for the future.
Speaking after visiting Buckingham Palace, she said she would work with "friends and allies" in the DUP to take forward Brexit, saying: "Let's get to work."
The Conservatives are eight seats short of the 326 needed for a majority, but the DUP bring 10 seats of their own, meaning the Conservative government has the support of 328 MPs, for now.
Theresa May has been to visit the Queen to tell her she intends to form a Conservative government with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party.
The Conservative party, which is currently in charge of the UK government, has not won enough votes - and enough MP seats in Parliament - to automatically stay in power. This means the result is a hung Parliament.
But what is an MP? How does someone become one in the first place?

Prime Minister Theresa May will visit Buckingham Palace at 12:30pm today to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government.
Her party, the Conservatives, have not won enough votes to form a government on their own.
But Theresa May is hoping to stay in power by working with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is another political party. This is because the DUP won 10 MP seats in Parliament.
If these are added to the 318 seats which the Conservative party have so far won, this means that the two parties together will have more than half of the MPs in Parliament, which is needed for Theresa May to make a new government.

After a very long night, one thing we know this morning is that the results of this election are definitely not straightforward.
The Conservatives won the most votes out of everyone, but they have fewer MPs in Parliament now than they did last time, despite calling the election themselves.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party has failed to take power, but the number of votes and seats they've won this time has gone up, so they are happy.
So how are all the politicians feeling today? Bring on the emojis...

We now know that the result of the general election is what is called a hung Parliament.
But what does that mean?
Well, this means that no political party has won enough MPs in Parliament in order to automatically be in charge of the next UK government. This is called winning a majority, which nobody has managed to do.
Results are still being counted, but there aren't enough results left to be announced for anybody to win a majority.
So what happens now?
Theresa May will remain the prime minister for now, but if she is to stay in charge of the UK government for the next five years, she will need to team up with people from other political parties to create the next government.
