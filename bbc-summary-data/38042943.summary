England was awarded the 2021 World Cup in October after seeing off a rival bid from the United States and Canada, with North America recommended for 2025.
The tournament has always previously been played in Europe or Australasia.
RLIF chairman Nigel Wood said the award is "a historic moment in the global development of rugby league".
"It is exciting that our sport is expanding into a new destination for our premier event," he added.
"The USA and Canada provide world-class stadiums allied to a significant multi-cultural population which made the bid so persuasive."
The Toronto Wolfpack - Canada's first professional team - will compete in English rugby league's third tier in this coming season as part of the game's development in North America.
