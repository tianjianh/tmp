Libya profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Libya's media scene is fractured and ever-changing, reflecting the political chaos and infighting of the post-Gaddafi years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Media regulation is practically non-existent. There are competing "state-owned" media outlets, some using the same names but supporting rival administrations.
Most news outlets are bankrolled by private entities and business interests. Many recently-launched media are based abroad and little is known about their backers.
Satellite TV is the most popular medium. Print and online media are dogged by security problems and a poor technological infrastructure.
There are few daily newspapers. Most titles have very small print runs.
Libya is a very dangerous place for journalists. Foreign media have withdrawn staff and local journalists have been hounded, attacked or killed by militias.
In 2015, Islamic State group fighters seized media outlets in Sirte when they took control of the city. The group's Al-Bayan radio is heard on FM in parts of Libya.
BBC World Service Arabic broadcasts on 91.1 FM in Tripoli, and in Benghazi and Misrata on 91.5 FM.
There were around 1.3 million internet users by 2016 (Internetlivestats.com).
By mid-2014, Libya had a Facebook user penetration rate of 3.7% of the population, according to Dubai's Mohammed Bin Rashid School of Government.
