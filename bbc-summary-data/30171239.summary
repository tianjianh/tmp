Rodgers admitted it was "a difficult moment" and that he needed to fight hard and find a solution.
He said: "We are very disappointed with the performance and the result, and as the manager it is something I need to take full responsibility for."
Rodgers's side have only won once in their last five league games and are 18 points behind leaders Chelsea.
And, with a crucial Champions League group game against Ludogorets Razgrad in Bulgaria on Wednesday, Rodgers made no attempt to hide what improvements are needed. He said:
Rodgers added: "We need to find a solution quickly because this is very disappointing, and we have no one but ourselves to blame.
"We had to make changes in the summer and are near enough entering a transition phase. But whatever phase, we have to be better than that.
"This is the worst run my team has been on and the only way out is working together. We have to improve and very, very quickly because the games come thick and fast."
The departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and an injury to Daniel Sturridge has deprived Rodgers of a strike force that scored 53 league goals between them last season.
New attacking signings Mario Balotelli,Lazar Markovic and Adam Lallana have not filled the void and there have been problems in defence, with just two clean sheets in 18 league and Cup games.
Asked about his future after the defeat at Palace, Rodgers said: "I'm not arrogant to think I'll be in a job through anything. You have to win games.
"I've got a great communication line with the owners - we are honest and open with each other. But we have to get results and perform.
"I will only ever do my best - I need to fight even harder and take responsibility."
Rodgers confirmed Balotelli missed the Palace game with a groin injury sustained on international duty with Italy and said he had no problems with the striker attending Saturday night's fight between Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly at the Liverpool Arena.
"He was free and not involved. It was local, not too late. so it's not a problem," said Rodgers. "We will assess his injury over the next few days."
