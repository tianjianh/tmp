Alex, from New York, wrote the letter after seeing the photograph of five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, a bloodied and dazed Syrian boy which prompted outrage around the world.
Mr Obama said the letter was from a child "who hasn't learned to be cynical, or suspicious, or fearful of other people because of where they're from".
