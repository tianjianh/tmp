Peterborough Nene toad in the bowl toilet rescue

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rescue strategy was devised by country park staff after they found a toad firmly wedged under the rim of their office toilet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The amphibian was found by David Radley at the Nene Park Trust, Peterborough, on Monday morning.
Colleagues used rubber gloves and the toad was returned safely to the park.
Conservation officer Chris Park said while he was used to looking after wildlife in the parks, he had "never had to do anything like this before".
"We've no idea how it got there," Mr Park said. "Perhaps it fell into a sewer and then crawled up the u-bend. It might have been flushed a few times. It certainly looked very clean."
