A skin cancer appeal backed by a BBC presenter has reached its £45,000 target after just six weeks.

The Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal was launched in February to raise awareness of skin cancer and educate children in schools about sun safety.
The target was reached on Monday after the Freemasons in Derby donated £10,000 with a new target set at £75,000.
Radio Derby presenter Colin Bloomfield - who has stage four melanoma - said the donations were "hugely generous".
BBC Radio Derby is working with the Derby Telegraph and charity Skcin, which specialises in skin cancer prevention.
The station launched the appeal after Colin's diagnosis in 2013, and his openness and optimism on the disease touched thousands of listeners.
The 33-year-old had a malignant melanoma removed from his leg 10 years ago but in 2013 he was told the cancer had returned and in November he was given months to live when it spread to his brain.
"Every single pound has made such a big difference," he said,
"As a child I never understood the seriousness of getting burnt but I'm living through it now.
"[Melanoma] is a truly horrible disease that a lot of people don't understand the seriousness of.
"We are not used to seeing the sun in this country and when we go out and enjoy it, it is about doing it safely and responsibly.
"If we can hammer home that message to kids in schools that can only be a good thing."
Earlier this month Derby County Football Club raised more than £14,000 after donating £10 for every away ticket sold at Norwich.
The appeal aims to take the sun safe scheme to 200 schools in Derbyshire and East Staffordshire.
