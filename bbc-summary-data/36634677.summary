Michael O'Neill's side reached the last 16 stage before losing 1-0 to Wales in Paris on Saturday.
"Michael and the team have made the whole country proud," said sports minister Paul Givan.
"It has been fantastic to see the green and white army getting behind their team, both in France and back home."
The event will take place at the Belsonic Fan Zone site in the Titanic Quarter, where Northern Ireland supporters flocked to watch the team in their opening three matches.
Northern Ireland were appearing in their first major tournament for 30 years and a 2-0 win over Ukraine helped them to progress from the group stage.
An own goal from Gareth McAuley on Saturday proved decisive against Wales as Northern Ireland bowed out in Paris.

Monday's event is being hosted by the Department of Communities, Irish FA, Belsonic and Belfast City Council.
"It will give the fans the opportunity to see the team as they return from their historic journey in France," added Givan.
It is a ticketed event with tickets available from 18:00 BST on Sunday on the Ticketmaster website.
There will be a nominal £2 admin charge per ticket, £1 of which will go to NI Cancer Fund for Children, the official charity of both the Irish FA and Fan Zone.
Parking is not available at the venue so fans are encouraged to use public transport.
