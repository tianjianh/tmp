The event sees hot-air balloons light up their burners in time to music.
This year's glow also featured a musical tribute to the late Chester Bennington from the band Linkin Park, who died recently.
An earlier mass ascent of hot-air balloons was cancelled because of high winds but organisers are hopeful for launches on Sunday.
