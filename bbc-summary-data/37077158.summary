Shaun Whiter was helping his friend Joey Abbs to change a tyre near Newmarket, Suffolk, when it happened.
Jan Adamec, 40, of Haverhill, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He is on remand and will be sentenced in September.
Mr Whiter, 27, said: "Without a doubt it's good to know that the guy is off the streets."
The Stansted estate agent was due to begin training with Newmarket Town FC.
His legs were crushed by Adamec's vehicle as he tried to help his friend fix his car on Dullingham Road.
Mr Abbs, who was trapped between his and Mr Whiter's vehicles, also sustained a serious leg injury.
Adamec did not stop after the crash.
Mr Whiter underwent emergency surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. He lost both his legs below the knee.
He said: "Being 27, I didn't dream of this. Personally think I shouldn't have to deal with this but it's a case of now I have to deal with this and I hope he's aware of that."
Fundraising events, including a charity fun day in Exning, near Newmarket, on Saturday, have raised more than Â£100,000 towards Mr Whiter's rehabilitation.
Despite his injuries, he told his family he was determined to walk his fiancÃ©e down the aisle when they marry next summer.
The keen sportsman also said he would like to take part in the Paralympics.
