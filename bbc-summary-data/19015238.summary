[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland international Clarkson, 26, has been training with Rovers following his release from rivals Bristol City.
Faroe Islands international Baldvinsson, 22, is set to join from Norwegian second division side Algard.
Manager Mark McGhee told the club website: "I am expecting him to be a stand-out at this division because of where he has come from."
Clarkson started his career at Motherwell, where he played under Pirates boss McGhee, and made 251 appearances before joining City in 2009.
He scored 11 goals in 67 games for the Championship side but failed to secure a regular first-team place and spent time on loan at Brentford before being released.
Clarkson has won two caps for his country, scoring once.
Baldvinsson, who has made 120 appearances and scored 16 goals for Algard, is set to sing for Rovers for an undisclosed fee and will join up with the side on Monday for his medical.
