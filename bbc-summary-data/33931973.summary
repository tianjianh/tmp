The University and College Admissions Service says 6,910 students were matched with places through clearing.
This leaves 154,850 students still looking for a university place.
With the student numbers cap lifted this year, experts say universities are competing with each other for students.
Mark Bramwell, Associate Director of Sixth Form Colleges, said: "This year it's the universities who are competing, rather than the students, with increased use of unconditional offers, a 2% increase in students getting their first choice and extensive use of bursaries."
"Universities still have places to fill, and many will accept students who may have only missed the grade by a small margin," he added.
Last year nearly one in eight students were eventually placed through the clearing system.
Staff at Ucas staff had a busy day on Thursday as A-level results were released and collected by students.

The top three course searches on the Ucas website were for courses in law, economics and psychology.
