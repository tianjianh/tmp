Four residential homes could be closed and occupants moved to a new "care village" under new proposals.

The affected Norfolk homes - Heathfield, Mountfield, Somerley and Philadelphia House - met all standards in their most recent inspections.
NorseCare, the Norfolk County Council-owned firm which runs the homes, is to consult staff and residents.
It said the 1970s buildings lacked some facilities and it wanted to move residents to a facility in Bowthorpe.
The other options to be consulted on include leaving the homes as they are, admitting no more residents and allowing them to close over a number of years, refurbishing the homes or selling them to another care provider.
But NorseCare says its preferred option is to close the homes and transfer residents to an Â£18.9m care village being built in Bowthorpe, or to another care home or housing with care scheme in the area.
Between them, the four homes can cater for about 150 people. They were each praised by residents and staff in the most recent Care Quality Commission inspection reports.
Karen Knight, managing director of NorseCare, said: "These are people's homes and we recognise that the prospect of potentially moving out of them may be daunting.
"We want to reassure our residents, and their families and carers, that we will support them and listen to their concerns through the consultation.
"I hope they understand that we are suggesting these changes in order to provide better care accommodation for people in Norfolk, now and in the future."
