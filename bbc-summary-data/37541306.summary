Horgan is best known for comedy series Pulling and Catastrophe, both of which she co-wrote and appeared in.
"Most of the TV I'm watching is either created by, starring or directed by women," Horgan told the Radio Times.
"At all the Emmy parties I went to, the people I was honing in on to tell I appreciated their work were ladies - Rachel Bloom, Tina Fey, Jill Soloway."
She added: "They were everywhere. So certainly in the comedy world, it's looking pretty sweet."
Bloom is best known for appearing in Crazy Ex Girlfriend, while Tina Fey wrote and starred in 30 Rock and Jill Soloway created, wrote and directed Transparent.
Horgan's work on Catastrophe was nominated for outstanding writing for a comedy series at the Emmy Awards, which took place in Los Angeles last month.
She is currently working on the third season of Catastrophe and recently wrote the pilot for Divorce, which starred Sarah Jessica Parker.
Horgan also wrote the pilot for the comedy Motherland, which was warmly received when it aired on BBC Two last month.
It has not yet been confirmed whether a full series will be commissioned, but Horgan said: "I think we'll know fairly soon."
