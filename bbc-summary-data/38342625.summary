[SN]TITLE[SN]
Knighton firm to make 37-tonne RNLI beach vehicles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven vehicles weighing 37 tonnes that can tow rescue boats up steep beaches will be made in Powys for the RNLI.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clayton Engineering in Knighton will supply the charity with the "launch and recovery system" vehicles.
The 22-metre long vehicles can tow a 15-tonne lifeboat up steep shingle beaches.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said the contract was testament to Clayton's "manufacturing expertise, capability and highly skilled workforce".
Manufacture of the vehicles is set to be completed by 2020.
To meet demand, a £500,000 extension to the firm's factory will be built. The Welsh government is contributing £99,593.
Clayton Engineering employs 42 people and the Welsh Government said the investment would safeguard eight jobs and see at least three new workshop workers trained.
