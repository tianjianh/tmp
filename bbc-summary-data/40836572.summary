The 25-year-old South African, who broke the world record to win gold at Rio 2016 in 43.03 seconds, clocked 45.28 in London on Saturday.
Britain's Dwayne Cowan and Matthew Hudson-Smith also progressed, but Martyn Rooney was eliminated.
Elsewhere, Briton Sophie Hitchon needed just one throw to make it through to Monday's women's hammer final.
Hitchon, who claimed Olympic bronze at Rio 2016, managed a distance of 73.05 metres with her opener in qualifying to secure her progress.
"It's nice to make it in one throw but you have just got to make it," she said.
"I'm not going to lie, it [competing in front of a home crowd] does make you really nervous. I feel like you have your own pressure on yourself and then everyone else is here to support you so you want to perform well but the crowd is amazing.
"Once the final comes, I will just try to execute my technique and do nothing fancy."
