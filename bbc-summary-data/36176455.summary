Cheyenne Dunkley's glancing header from Chris Maguire's corner gave the U's, who finished second in League Two, the lead early in the second half.
Chris Maguire added a second from the penalty spot after Kemar Roofe was brought down in the area by Chairboys defender Aaron Pierre.
Callum O'Dowda sealed the win late on with a shot from inside the box.

Having dropped out of the Football League in 2006 before winning promotion four years later, Oxford will play in the third tier for the first time since 2000-01 next season.
With defender Dunkley breaking the deadlock after 53 minutes, Oxford's second-half domination was rewarded with two more goals.
First, Maguire fired in from 12 yards after Roofe was shoved over in the box by Pierre and then, in injury time, O'Dowda dribbled past two defenders before slotting home from six yards.
Wycombe, last season's beaten play-off finalists, finished the season in 13th place, 11 points below the top seven.

Oxford United manager Michael Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford:
"It feels fantastic. It's been a fantastic season what with the FA Cup run beating Swansea and reaching the final of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy.
"To top it off today with the performance the players put in, certainly in terms of the way they went about their business, they were very professional.
"Although it was 0-0 at half-time, we knew we were starting to turn the screw. We knew that if we kept a clean sheet, we'd score goals.
"We tried to play it down. It was about playing the game, not the occasion. We knew that when we got the opportunity to counter-attack, we'd hurt Wycombe."
