[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Key quotes from high-profile European and other figures on Britain's vote to leave the EU, as compiled by BBC Monitoring between 8 and 14 September.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"We respect and at the same time regret the UK decision, but the European Union as such is not at risk. We would be happy if the request for Brexit could happen as quickly as possible, so we can take the specific steps that need to be taken, and so that relations with the UK, which must remain on a friendly basis, can take on a new shape. And that means that only those can have unlimited access to the internal market who accept that there will be free access for persons and goods. There can be no a la carte access to the single market."  (State of the union debate to the European Parliament on 14 September, European Parliament website)
"We Europeans can never accept Polish workers being harassed, beaten up or even murdered on the streets of Essex. The free movement of workers is as much a common European value as our fight against discrimination and racism." (State of the union address to the European Parliament on 14 September, European Parliament website)
"Brexit is not a liability. I see it more as an opportunity... Our duty, our responsibility is to make Brexit a success for Europe, for all the citizens of Europe. And it is a possibility to end the dramatic complexity of our institutions. Brexit is not a matter of punishment, it's not a matter of revenge." (State of the union debate to the European Parliament on 14 September, via Reuters)
"[The European Parliament would] have to give consent to the agreement as stated in Article 50 so it's wise the parliament is involved from the start of this process. I want the UK to trigger Article 50 as soon as possible, so we can finalise these negotiations by 2019. I can't imagine we start the next legislative cycle without agreement over UK withdrawal." (Speaking to journalists in Strasbourg on 13 September)
"It would be a fatal error to assume that the negative result in the UK referendum represents a specifically British issue... The Brexit vote is a desperate attempt to answer the questions that millions of Europeans ask themselves daily. Questions about the guarantees of security of the citizens and their territory, questions about the protection of their interests, cultural heritage and way of life. These are questions we would have to face even if the UK had voted to remain." (Invitation letter for the EU's Bratislava summit, seen by AFP, via Yahoo)
"France wants the indecision to end and for the negotiations, the discussions to start at the end of the year or the start of next by triggering Article 50." (Speaking to cabinet, AFP, via Le Figaro, 14 September)
"We need to be extremely careful that the side that is leaving doesn't get particular competitive advantages on its way out. We all want a peaceful divorce, but in this situation only one side wants to part ways, so then we need to protect our own interests." (Speaking to Bloomberg, 11 September)
"[Italy's] first message is certainty is required, and the second is that it is necessary to take care of the EU, of its internal cohesion, of its interests. Not just the interests of the 27, but also a fundamental interest of the 28th country are at stake." (Speaking ahead of a meeting with British counterpart Boris Johnson, via Ansa)
"For many months now, we've been trying to get the EU to reform itself. We want to make use of Brexit discussions as an opportunity for that. Brexit isn't just about a breakup between the UK and the EU; it's also about a debate on the UK's new status towards Europe. The EU must be reformed, because Brexit isn't just a whim of the British. The EU is also much to blame." (Speaking on Polish TV broadcaster TVN, via Radio Poland, 8 September)
