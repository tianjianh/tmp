Singer Morrissey has revealed he has been asked to appear on cult BBC Radio 4 farming soap The Archers.

On his semi-official True To You website, the former Smiths frontman claimed he was "fascinated" by the offer.
There is speculation any appearance would engage Morrissey's outspoken views on the livestock industry.
A committed vegetarian, the musician has been known to ban meat products from venues at which he performs.
The BBC declined to comment on any possible Archers appearance.
The corporation said it preferred not to comment on future plots to avoid spoilers for listeners.
Twitter activity
The Archers has boasted a number of surprising cameos in recent years, including the Duchess of Cornwall.
In March this year, cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins made an appearance to coincide with Sport Relief.
The programme, which began in 1950, is the longest-running radio soap opera in the world and "considered to be a British institution", according to Morrissey's fan site.
The singer, who on the same website compared eating meat to paedophilia, recently made his first foray on to Twitter, five years after joining the microblogging site.
In his first tweet on Wednesday, the day after the release of his comeback single World Peace Is None Of Your Business, he wrote: "Hello. Testing, 1, 2, 3. Planet Earth, are you there? One can only hope..."
His second tweet said: "Follow, follow, follow. Twitter is the perfect metaphor for...something. Dunno what."
He acquired 224,000 followers in the first 24 hours.
Morrissey kicked off a US tour last week and was reportedly mobbed on stage by enthusiastic fans. At the weekend he was joined by Sir Tom Jones for a concert at the LA Sports Arena.
