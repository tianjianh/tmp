It is the fourth year the fixture has been marked as a "bubble match" - meaning supporters will be kept apart.
Police urged those going to the National League game at the Racecourse Ground to be "on their best behaviour" so future games can be "normalised".
The system will be the same for January's return fixture in Chester.
Police have said they will consider allowing independent travel again if there are two incident-free fixtures with no damage to stadiums.
North Wales police and crime commissioner Arfon Jones said: "I would urge fans of both Wrexham and Chester City to be on their best behaviour and ensure that the rivalry remains good-natured.
"That is the best way to guarantee that matches between the two clubs can take place with 15:00 kick-off times and independent travel to and from games."
