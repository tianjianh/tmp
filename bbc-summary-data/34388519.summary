The 24-year-old made 29 appearances in his first full season with the Welsh region after signing from Worcester Warriors on a two-year deal in January 2014.
Matavesi's new contract will see him stay at the Liberty Stadium until the summer of 2018.
"It was an easy decision" said Matavesi, who was born in England.
"I feel that I've grown in this environment, which is geared to improving players, and I think that I can continue to develop here."
Matavesi, who has also played for Exeter Chiefs and Racing Metro, has been an unused replacement in Fiji's opening two World Cup matches.
He is part of the squad preparing for Thursday's Pool A game against Wales at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.
Ospreys rugby general manager Andrew Millward said Matavesi had made an impression during his first season with the region.
"When he gets back from the World Cup we'll be expecting him to pick up where he left off last season and continue to be a key figure for us," Millward said.
