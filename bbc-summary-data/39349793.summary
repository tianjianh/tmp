[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tiny shrimp fossil named after David Attenborough

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tiny shrimp-like fossil which is thought to be around 430 million-years-old has been discovered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Researchers found the creature preserved in ancient volcanic rock, and decided to name it after their favourite naturalist Sir David Attenborough.
They called it: Cascolus Ravitis, which is a combination of the Latin word for Attenborough, and the Roman word for Leicester, where Sir David lived.
Take a look at some of these other animals named after David Attenborough.
Sir David said: â€œThe biggest compliment that a biologist or palaeontologist can pay to another one is to name a fossil in his honour and I take this as a very great compliment.â€
