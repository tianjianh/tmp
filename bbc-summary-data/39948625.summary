[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hanmer ambulance wait death accidental, inquest rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a woman who waited six hours for an ambulance after a fall was accidental, an inquest has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daphne Williams, 78, from Hanmer in Wrexham, died two weeks after being admitted to hospital in September 2016 for surgery on a fractured femur.
John Gittins, North Wales East and Central coroner, told the Ruthin hearing he accepted the delay had not contributed to her death.
But he added he would prepare a Prevention of Future Deaths report.
"I am fully aware of the huge body of work that is being carried out regarding delays in admission and allocation of resources," he said.
"There is a clear willingness to try to make things better and it's clear that with all the efforts being made some answers will come to light which will alleviate some of the difficulties."
But he added that the delay Mrs Williams encountered was "not acceptable".
