[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duchess of Cambridge will visit Malta later this year in her first official overseas trip without Prince William, Kensington Palace has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She will represent the Queen during a visit to the Mediterranean island on 20 and 21 September.
The trip has been planned to mark 50 years of Maltese independence.
The duchess will only spend one night away from home and Prince George, who will be one year old on Tuesday, will not go with her.
Earlier this year the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Australia and New Zealand with Prince George.
After the announcement of the duchess's solo trip, the official British Monarchy Twitter account tweeted: "The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh lived in Malta when they were just married, while the duke was on naval service."
