Delays as lorry gets stuck under railway bridge in Swindon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers faced long delays after a lorry hit a railway bridge in Swindon and turned onto its side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vehicle struck the 4.5m (14ft) high bridge on the Wootton Bassett Road shortly before 08:50 GMT.
The A3102 was closed to traffic while teams of engineers worked to free the vehicle.
British Transport Police said the driver was not hurt in the incident but Wiltshire Police said the road would remain closed for a couple of hours.
As a precautionary measure, Network Rail said trains crossing over the bridge had been limited to 5mph.
But a spokeswoman later said engineers had inspected the bridge and found "no damage" allowing services to return to normal.
