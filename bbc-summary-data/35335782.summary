Kerry Lee: Trainer wins again with Russe Blanc at Warwick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kerry Lee scored another big success in her first season as a trainer as Russe Blanc won the Classic Chase at Warwick.

The 20-1 shot, ridden by Charlie Poste, triumphed from Midnight Prayer seven days after Lee claimed the Welsh National with Mountainous.
"His jump at the last won him the race, similar to Mountainous last week. He thoroughly enjoyed himself," said Lee.
Russe Blanc is a rarity in racing, with his colour officially described as white.
Lee, who has taken over from her father Richard, added: "We tried not to come here expectant, just hopeful, and this horse has really enjoyed jumping."
Meanwhile, L'Ami Serge won the novices' chase at Wetherby for trainer Nicky Henderson.
The victor is about 7-1 second favourite behind odds-on market leader Douvan for the Arkle Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in March, although the JLT Chase is an alternative target
