[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Kerry, 71, is in a stable condition in hospital in nearby Geneva, Switzerland, a spokesman said.
He is expected to make a full recovery after breaking his right femur and is in good spirits, said John Kirby.
Mr Kerry, who was in Switzerland for talks on Iran's nuclear programme, has called off planned visits to Madrid and Paris and will fly home for treatment.
The accident took place in Scionzier, France, some 40km (25 miles) south-east of the Swiss border.
"Paramedics and a physician were on the scene with the secretary's motorcade at the time of the accident," said a statement by the state department.
Mr Kerry "is stable and... did not lose consciousness".
Mr Kerry was due in Madrid on Monday for the signing of a defence deal and in Paris on Tuesday for talks on combating the militant group Islamic State, but will now fly to Boston in the US for treatment.
Mr Kerry is known for his love of cycling and often takes his bike with him when he travels.
