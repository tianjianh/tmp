Prank Rangers-Celtic birthday cake is hit for baker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Rangers birthday cake, which reveals Celtic's green and white colours, when sliced, has become an online hit for a Glasgow baker.

Lilian Johnstone was commissioned to make the cake as a prank by friends of Rangers fan Iain Orr.
The outside is decorated in the red, white and blue livery and the crest of the Ibrox club.
Inside, the sponge is dyed with green food colouring and layered to match the hoops pattern of their Old Firm rivals.
Lilian, who works from home in Ruchill, Glasgow, posted a picture of her creation on her Cupcakes by Lilian Facebook page.
She has now been inundated with orders after it was shared thousands of times on social media.
She said: "I've made a cake like this before and it ended up on quite a few Celtic forums, but it never got as much coverage as this one.
"I honestly didn't expect it. I'm totally overwhelmed, it's amazing."
