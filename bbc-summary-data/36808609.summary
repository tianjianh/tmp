[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Jack, 19, Bryan McCabe, 45, Steven Gordon, 28, and Alexander Lanni, 22, ran onto the Hampden Park pitch after Hibs played Rangers on 21 May.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, Jack, of Edinburgh, also admitted pushed Rangers player Andy Halliday.
And Gordon, also of Edinburgh, pleaded guilty to kicking an unknown man while he was on the ground.
Each of the men either ran towards or approached Rangers fans and gesticulated in a threatening or aggressive manner or behaved aggressively.
They were among hundreds of fans who spilled on to the pitch after the full time whistle at the match which Hibs won 3-2.
It led to scenes of disorder among a small number of supporters which "appalled" the Scottish Football Association.
In court, Gordon was fined Â£566 and given an 18-month football banning order.
McCabe, also from Edinburgh, was given the same length of order and a Â£400 fine.
Sentence was deferred on Jack, from Edinburgh, until next month for a social work report and on Lanni, from Livingston, to call alongside his trial in December for allegedly assaulting a man at Hampden, which he denies.
Three other football fans denied charges of running on to the pitch after the game.
George Henderson, 49, from Penilee, is alleged to have behaved in an aggressive manner towards opposition fans and challenge an opposing fan to fight and attempt to punch them.
Robert Barr, 19, from Kilbirnie, denies entering the field and approaching rival fans, brandishing a chair and behaving in a threatening manner as well as assaulting a man by kicking him on the body.
Robert Smith, 24, from Glasgow, is also accused of entering the field, behaving in an aggressive manner, approaching opposing fans and waving his arm in the air, and assaulting someone by kicking them on the body.
Sheriff Kenneth Hogg granted bail for each of them and Barr and Lanni have special conditions not to attend any football matches until the outcome of their cases.
