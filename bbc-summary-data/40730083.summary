The 35-year-old won 27 caps between 2005 and 2008, including all four matches at the 2007 Rugby World Cup.
Thomas has spent the last four seasons with the Dragons, captaining them in 2015-16, and made 70 appearances for the region.
He had previously spent 10 seasons with Cardiff Blues and a year with Wasps.
"I am delighted to be able to bring Thomas Rhys Thomas into our coaching team as I feel he has the attributes to make an outstanding coach," Dragons head coach Bernard Jackman, the former Ireland hooker, told the club's website.
Meanwhile the region have signed two young hookers.
Wales under-20 international Liam Belcher, 21, has played five times for Cardiff Blues while Welsh-qualified Gerard Ellis, 24, joins from London Irish where he has featured in the first team squad for four seasons.
