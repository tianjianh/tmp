[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC England has a Pinterest board about inspiring people who have made a difference to the lives of others.

The pins include some of our most uplifting stories, features and videos about local heroes.
You can follow the board here to see a selection of our stories every week to re-pin, like and comment on.
If humans aren't your thing, we also have a board for animal fans in need of a quirky news fix.
All of the rest of our boards can be found here with new ones regularly being created so follow our account to see our latest collections.
