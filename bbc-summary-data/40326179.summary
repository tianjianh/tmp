Thousands of people raced through gallons of mud at Drumlanrig Castle near Thornhill at the weekend.
They were taking part in the annual Tough Mudder event.
It saw participants run through ice cold water and navigate around 20 obstacles in a course designed by British special forces.
Described by organisers as "the toughest event on the planet", the extreme endurance challenge was the brainchild of Will Dean and Guy Livingstone and regularly takes place in the UK, US, Australia and Canada to test fitness, stamina, mental strength and camaraderie.
