[SN]TITLE[SN]
Queen carries out 341 engagements in year she passed Victoria's record

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Queen had another busy 12 months in the year she set a new record as Britain's longest-reigning monarch, carrying out 341 engagements.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She surpassed the tenure of Queen Victoria in September and has now reigned for nearly 64 years.
The Queen, who turns 90 in April, carried out 306 engagements in the UK and 35 overseas.
This was more than the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry combined - but fewer than Prince Charles.
It was also a busy year for the Duke of Edinburgh, who took part in 217 UK engagements and 33 abroad, despite turning 94 in June.
Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had 198 engagements in the UK and 94 abroad between them.
The duchess did not travel overseas, largely because she gave birth to Princess Charlotte in May, while the duke combines his royal duties with his role as a helicopter co-pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance, which he started in July.
Prince Harry left the Army in June after 10 years' service, before spending the summer as a volunteer with conservation experts in southern Africa.
The Prince of Wales undertook 380 engagements at home and 147 abroad, but this was fewer than his sister Anne, the Princess Royal, who carried out 456 engagements in the UK and 88 overseas.
The figures were compiled by Times reader Tim O'Donovan, who does so every year based on engagements announced in the Court Circular - the official record of engagements carried out by royals.
He told the newspaper: "During the year the Queen became the longest-reigning British monarch; the number of engagements carried out by her majesty in her 90th year and by the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 95 in June, is remarkable.
"Except for Christmas Day and Easter Day, the Queen never has a day off from the official red boxes which pursue her everywhere."
