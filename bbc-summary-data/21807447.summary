Chris Poole, 46, was attacked last August outside the Premier store in the Hydneye area of Eastbourne, East Sussex, and died the following day.
Joe Chapman, formerly of Iden Street, Eastbourne, was jailed at Lewes Crown Court for a minimum of eight years.
Shane Noble, 20, of no fixed address, was jailed for a minimum of 11 years.
Both had been found guilty of murder last month following a three-week trial.
Sussex Police said Mr Poole was punched and kicked in the head shortly before 21:00 BST on 16 August after becoming involved in a row with a group of teenage boys.
Outside the court, Ricky Poole said: "Chris was my only brother, my only sibling.
"All the family are here today so you can see what he meant to us. We miss him every day."
Commenting on the sentencing, he said: "I expected more but I can see why the judge gave what he did to reduce the chance of an appeal being upheld.
"In time to come they [Noble and Chapman] will be free again and maybe they would have learnt their lesson.
"We, the family, will never be free of our pain and suffering.
"Christopher's life was taken from us by two ruthless people and all those who knew him are united in the grief we feel at the loss of a wonderful son, brother and friend who leaves behind a heartbroken partner, Penny, and her four children."
Det Supt Nick May, who headed the investigation, said: "This was a horrific attack - what I would describe as a senseless act of violence."
