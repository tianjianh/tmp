[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 1-0 Bristol Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry defeated play-off hopefuls Bristol Rovers to record back-to-back League One wins for the first time in five months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides had chances to win an end-to-end game but a combination of good goalkeeping and poor finishing kept it a low-scoring affair.
Rovers arrived at the Ricoh Arena with a vocal 4,000 following, but it was the home side who should have been cheering in the 28th minute when Callum Reilly was put through on goal, only for the midfielder to poke the ball inches wide.
Coventry had Lee Burge to thank after the break for keeping them level, first tipping Ollie Clarke's 54th-minute shot over the bar before getting down low to save Tom Lockyer's effort a minute later.
And it was the Sky Blues who would eventually break the deadlock as striker George Thomas fired into the top corner to keep their faint hopes of avoiding relegation alive.
