Four men have gone on trial accused of repeatedly raping a woman and filming sexual acts on their mobile phones.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men are Justinas Gubinas and Ovidijus Kavaliauska, who are both 22 of Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire, Remigijus Bidva, 24, and Nerijus Radavicius, 29, of Longhaven.
They have been charged with raping the woman at a farmhouse while she was drunk and incapable of giving consent.
They all deny the charge and have lodged a special defence of consent.
The men are alleged to have forced the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to drink alcohol and induced her to carry out sex acts on 1 November 2014.
Giving evidence at the High Court in Aberdeen on Monday, the woman told the jury that the men took her to a house outside Fraserburgh in a car.
CCTV footage played to the court showed the woman chatting to a group of young men in a car park after leaving Deejays nightclub in Fraserburgh.
She described herself as being "beyond drunk" and claimed she was kicked in the back and slapped awake later that day.
The woman, who suffers from a borderline personality disorder, said video footage taken of sex acts made her feel "dirty".
The trial continues.
