[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stevenage 0-2 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool's promotion hopes were given a boost as two second-half goals handed them victory over Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both teams were locked on 27 points going into the game, just outside the play-off positions, and substitute Bright Osayi-Samuel's curled finish from the edge of the box initially separated the well-matched sides.
Mark Cullen scored a late second to seal Blackpool's eighth league win of the campaign following their 4-1 win against Newport in their last league outing.
The first half was a close affair as Tom Pett and Kyle Vassell impressed for Stevenage and Blackpool respectively.
In the second half Brad Potts was unable to find the target from a free header and Fraser Franks forced a save from Sam Slocombe.
Eventually 18-year-old Osayi-Samuel broke the deadlock in the 77th minute with a curling finish past Chris Day from the edge of the box - his first senior goal.
Cullen then took advantage of Dean Wells' slip to pick the ball out of the air and fire in six minutes from time.
