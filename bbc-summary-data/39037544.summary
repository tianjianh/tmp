People are being asked for their views on scrapping free seaside seats for the over 60s in Weymouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Weymouth and Portland Borough Council is looking at stopping deckchair passes for residents over the age of 60.
The deckchairs have been free of charge for the past 30 years to those holding a pass which proves they live within the borough.
The council said scrapping the free chairs that line The Esplanade could save £5,000 a year.
A deckchair at the seaside resort currently costs £2 to hire for a full or part day.
Councillors voted in favour of a public consultation over the proposals at a meeting on Monday.
The council's head of tourism and leisure, Nick Thornley, said: "These are tough times for local authorities - we felt that there might be an alternative way to use the money."
