The crash happened shortly before 23:00 BST on Saturday on the A337 close to the Holland Wood Campsite near Brockenhurst.
The driver of a Ford Puma, a man in his 20s, died at the scene. A fire crew member was taken to hospital with minor injuries and has since been discharged.
The road was closed between Lyndhurst and Brockenhurst while investigation work was carried out.
Hampshire Fire and Rescue said the fire engine had been on its way back to Winchester after dealing with a gas leak at a petrol station in Lymington.
A spokeswoman confirmed the vehicle did not have its blue lights on at the time of the crash.
"Our thoughts are with the family and friends [of the car driver] during this traumatic time," she added.
"We are committed to the welfare of our fire fighters and are supporting those who were involved in this tragic incident."
