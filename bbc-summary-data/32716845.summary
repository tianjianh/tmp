Sixteen people died in the northern state of Bihar and one person in Uttar Pradesh in Tuesday's 7.3 magnitude quake.
At least 65 people died in Nepal and nearly 2,000 were injured, with fears the figures could rise.
The massive 7.8 magnitude quake in April killed more than 8,000 people in Nepal and least 66 people in India.
Most of the fatalities and injuries were then also reported from Bihar, one of India's poorest states.
Wednesday's quake left people dead, mainly in wall and house collapses, in at least six districts of Bihar.
A school building caved in and a dozen students were hurt, a report said.
Fearing aftershocks, many people in the affected districts slept in the parks and open spaces on Tuesday night.
"It was the same feeling that we experienced a fortnight ago. It was very scary... I'm not sure what will happen next," one woman, Anita Devi, told The Hindu newspaper.
Officials in the eastern state of West Bengal said eight people received minor injuries.
In north-eastern Assam state, buildings developed cracks and train traffic was disrupted after the tremors.
People ran out of their homes and offices in the capital, Delhi, and West Bengal, Assam and Orissa states after Tuesday's quake.
Tuesday's earthquake was centred about 76km (47 miles) east of the capital, Kathmandu, near the town of Namche Bazaar.
A second tremor of 6.3-magnitude hit Nepal 30 minutes later and numerous other aftershocks continued into Wednesday morning.
The main quake was felt in northern India, Tibet and Bangladesh.
