Buffon, 38, started the goalless draw in Milan to draw level with Spain keeper Iker Casillas' tally.
He produced several routine saves before AC Milan teenager Gianluigi Donnarumma came on at the break.
Italy almost won the friendly in the final 10 minutes, but Andrea Belotti's low shot came back off the post.
The match was the latest to use a semi-live trial of video replays with two video assistant referees ruling on key decisions.
They were called into action shortly after the hour when Kevin Volland's shot went under Donnarumma's body but after being reviewed, the goal was ruled out for offside.
Video replays were first used at international level during a friendly between Italy and France in September and a final decision on their use will be made by 2018.
Elsewhere, a much-changed France side were booed off the pitch after labouring to a 0-0 draw against Ivory Coast in Paris.
"We struggled, that's not what I want to remember from 2016," said Deschamps, whose side reached the final of Euro 2016 as hosts.
Russia, who will host the next World Cup in 2018, earned a late 1-0 friendly win against Romania as they played a historic international in Chechnya.
It was the first international Russia had played in the region, which experienced two devastating wars in the 1990s when government forces battled Islamist insurgents.
Substitute Magomed Ozdoev, who was born in the Chechen capital Grozny, scored the only goal three minutes into stoppage time.
In other matches, Iceland won 2-0 in Malta,Sweden beat Hungary and Ukraine saw off Serbia by the same scoreline.
