Cancer research centres in the UK have been given a £190m investment boost.

Cancer Research UK is sharing the funds across 13 locations with the the biggest grants of about £40m going to Manchester and Cambridge.
The charity aims to draw together cutting-edge research and medical expertise - resulting in more timely, life-saving treatments for patients.
It will provide "vital infrastructure", Dr Iain Foulkes, executive director of strategy and research funding said.
He said it would also boost research to develop smarter, kinder treatments for children and be particularly important for hard to treat cancers like pancreatic, oesophageal, lung and brain tumours.
Departments of health in the UK and the charity are also investing £36m over five years into experimental medicine centres for adult patients and a network of centres for children.
The centres are partnerships between Cancer Research UK, universities, hospital trusts and other organisations, which collaborate to improve cancer research and clinical practice.
Five of the 13 locations chosen to receive grants are in London - at the Institute for Cancer Research (ICR), Kings Health Partners, the Barts Centre, University College London, and Imperial College London.
Two are in Scotland - the Edinburgh and Glasgow centres.
The others are in Birmingham, Newcastle, Oxford, Southampton, Cambridge and Manchester.
