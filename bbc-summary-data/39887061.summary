Partick Thistle: Alan Archibald says there has been no Swindon approach

Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald says there has been no approach from Swindon Town and "it would need to be a good offer" to prise him from Firhill.

BBC Scotland understands Archibald is on a shortlist of candidates for the English League One club's vacancy.
But Archibald said: "We've not heard a thing. That's all it is - speculation.
"Regardless, I'm in a good place here, there's a good structure at the club and we've had our highest finish in a long time."
The 39-year-old is the longest-serving manager in Scotland's top flight and was on the four-man shortlist for the PFA Scotland manager of the year, won by Celtic's Brendan Rodgers.
Swindon are looking to replace Luke Williams, who left the Wiltshire outfit last week after they were relegated.
"There's nothing to report; the club put out a statement saying something similar," said Archibald.
"We just move on and get on with work as normal. I would need to wait and see if there's an approach made.
"There's not been, as far as I'm aware. I'm not going to talk about it unless there's something to speak about."
Archibald was approached by Shrewsbury Town in October but decided he had "unfinished business" with Thistle.
While Shrewsbury avoided relegation from League One, Swindon will be dropping down a division.
However, Archibald would not be drawn on whether that made the Robins a less attractive prospect.
"If there is something there to speak about it, I will go away and think about it and see what's there," he said.
Archibald did stress that, with Thistle having secured their first top-six finish since the Premiership was created, he was still enjoying his time with the Glasgow club.
"In the last four seasons, we've progressed all the time," he added.
"We're in a good position on and off the pitch."
Departed Swindon boss Williams had worked under director of football Tim Sherwood, but chairman Lee Power has told BBC Wiltshire that there would be a change of structure once they appoint a replacement.
Power would be less involved in player transfers, with the new manager given a budget to control.
