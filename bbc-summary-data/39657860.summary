[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No action will be taken against a Bath MP over sexual assault allegations, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In November, the Sun alleged an attack took place in May at a Eurovision results party in Ben Howlett's constituency.
The Conservative MP strenuously denied the claim and voluntarily attended a police station to speak to detectives.
Mr Howlett's office said it "understood the matter is now closed".
A CPS spokesman said: "In November 2016, the CPS received a full file from Avon and Somerset Police relating to an allegation of sexual assault in Bath.
"This file has now been considered by a specialist lawyer who has concluded that it does not meet the evidential threshold, and no charge has been authorised."
