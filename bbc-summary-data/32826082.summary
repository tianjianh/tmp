Reading Carnival 2015 scrapped over licence failure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading Carnival has been scrapped this summer after organisers failed to apply for a licence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The carnival, which has been organised by Reading's Caribbean community since 1977, was due to take place on Sunday.
Reading Borough Council said it discovered in February the committee's chairwoman had resigned and has had no response to its inquiries.
In 2013, the carnival was cancelled due to lack of resources. Organisers have not yet responded to the BBC.
Last year, organisers cut the carnival back, limiting it to four floats in the parade and no costumes.
A previous highlight in Reading's event calendar, the carnival attracted up to 5,000 people in past years.
Yvonne Fitzgerald, editor of the Reading Caribbean Express magazine, said she was "disappointed for the people who started this event with the hope that it would continue in growth for the local Caribbean people of Reading".
She added "an official apology to the Caribbean people of Reading is the least" the committee could do.
A Reading Borough Council spokesman said the carnival was "an important event in Reading's cultural calendar which the council has supported since it began in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee".
"The council wrote to the chair of the committee in February this year and was informed she had resigned.
"There has been no response to date from the forwarding email address for the committee."
