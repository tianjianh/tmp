The incident at Rushmoor Fire Station in Hampshire is just one of a number of occasions when emergency vehicles have been delayed by motorists.
Fire chiefs are launching a campaign aimed at drivers amid concerns such incidents are on the increase.
Photos and videos of obstructing vehicles are being posted as part of the service's #INeedMySpace campaign.
Hampshire Fire and Rescue said drivers commonly used its Eastleigh headquarters as a cut-through to avoid traffic lights while others blocked roads and stopped in box junctions outside its fire stations.
Videos showing drivers crashing into fire engines as they tailgated the emergency vehicles have also been released.
Assistant chief officer Andy Bowers said: "The issue of motorists blocking the paths of emergency services vehicles is worse than ever before.
"Some drivers are parking opposite one another making an entire road inaccessible while others are actually stopping by station exits, often in the hatched areas, and some are even leaving their cars on our grounds.
"On the road we have to deal with motorists who are unsure what to do to allow emergency vehicles to pass, and often slam on their brakes the minute they hear the siren, as well as people who try and tailgate when we have gone past.
"These issues are causing delays and, when tackling a fire or cutting somebody out of a car, this can be the difference between life and death."
