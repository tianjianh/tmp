Kell Brook stops Kevin Bizier to retain IBF welterweight title

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British fighter Kell Brook successfully defended his IBF welterweight title with a second-round stoppage of Kevin Bizier in Sheffield on Saturday.

Brook, 29, had too much power for the Canadian challenger from the outset as he staged a third successful defence of the belt he first won in August 2014.
"I want the big fights now," Brook told Sky Sports.
Meanwhile, Olympic champion Luke Campbell saw off Gary Sykes to take the Commonwealth lightweight title.
Like Brook, Campbell - who won gold at the 2012 Olympics in London - needed just two rounds to take victory on the undercard at Sheffield.
After putting Sykes on the canvas, a flurry of powerful punches had his opponent on the ropes, forcing the referee to step in.
Brook's win completed a successful return to the ring for the Sheffield boxer after a 10-month absence.
He had stopped Frankie Gavin in six rounds in May last year and a proposed fight with Argentina's Diego Chaves was called off after Brook picked up a rib injury.
The IBF had mandated his bout with Bizier, whose previous two defeats came against Jo Jo Dan, a fighter Brook defeated in four rounds a year ago.
Brook was dominant from the outset against Bizier, who cut his eye inside the very first minute, and a second visit to the canvas for the Canadian led to the stoppage with 45 seconds left in the second round.
