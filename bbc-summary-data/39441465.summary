Westbrook scored 57 points as well as notching up 13 rebounds and 11 assists.
It was his 38th triple-double of the season - just three short of the NBA record set by Oscar Robertson - with eight games remaining.
"Overall, it's just incredible what he's doing now," Thunder coach Billy Donovan said.

"That performance was one of the best," Magic coach Frank Vogel added. "It's tough to rank those over the years, but it's right up there with the best. Give him credit."
A triple-double means a player has recorded a double-digit number in three of five statistical categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks.
"I don't take this game for granted. I just try to come out each and every night and compete at a high level," Westbrook said.
