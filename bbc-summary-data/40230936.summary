Jacques Rudolph (111) and Chris Cooke (93) added a record 168 for the seventh wicket against Worcestershire, coming together in the depths of 56-6.
Then Andrew Salter (80*) and Lukas Carey (54) both hit hard for career-best scores in a stand of 124.
Worcestershire lost Darryl Mitchell to Michael Hogan for 18 before bad light stopped play in their second innings.
Rudolph and Cooke's stand outstripped the previous best of 106 by Jonathan Hughes and Robert Croft at New Road in 2002, before Joe Leach dismissed both in the same over.
But Salter and Carey steered Glamorgan to a lead of 114 on first innings, after the last four wickets piled up 323 runs following Josh Tongue's first-day bowling heroics.
Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"Tough day at the office for the bowlers from what we thought was a position of strength, we turned up thinking we could enjoy a lead but they played some very good cricket on a pitch that was always improving, and they've now put us under a bit of pressure.
"We're going to have to bat well, but once you get that new ball 30 or 40 overs old and you get in, you can score- but we're going to have to score heavily to put them under pressure."
Glamorgan's Andrew Salter told BBC Wales Sport:
"The way Rudolph and Cooke played was tremendous, it was a great starting point for us to go on for the rest of the day, and momentum ran our way so we could get a lead.
"It was nice to share some success with Lukas, he made it look easy towards the end of his innings and he was smoking it- I'm really happy to get a personal best and I'm hoping a hundred's not too far away.
"We're in a great position, hopefully we can take some early wickets and put some pressure on them. The wicket was tricky all day and you never felt in, if you hit good enough areas there's enough there for seam and spin."
