A third of babies born in 2012 in the UK are expected to live to 100, according to a new report.

The Office for National Statistics experts base their projections on current and future survival trends.
And if their calculations are borne out, more than 95,000 of those who turn 65 this year can expect to celebrate their 100th birthday in 2047.
The number of centenarians has been steadily increasing - from 600 in 1961 to nearly 13,000 in 2010.
In 2012, the figure is expected to hit 14,500, and by 2035 will have breached the 100,000 mark.
And more of these will be women than men.
In 2012 there are 826,000 babies aged under one year. Although more are boys - 423,000 compared to 403,000 girls - the survival odds are greater for females. Women have higher life expectancies than men at every age.
Of those born in 2012, 135,000 men and 156,000 women are expected to still be alive by age 100.
The report -What are the Chances of Surviving to Age 100?- comes as ministers have pledged to double funding for dementia research in the UK.
In the next decade, the number with the disease - mostly elderly - is expected to top one million.
