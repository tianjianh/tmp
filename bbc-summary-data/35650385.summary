Separate talks are due to be held between the management of Dublin's tram system and Siptu, the union representing Luas drivers.

It follows four days of stoppages by Luas drivers in a dispute over pay. Workers want an increase of up to 53% while management are offering between 1% and 3%.
The disruption has affected about 90,000 commuters in Dublin each day.
Further strikes are planned on 8 and 17 March.
The strike planned for 17 March falls on St Patrick's Day, a national holiday in the Republic of Ireland.
The union said its members believe they are underpaid, particularly when compared to workers doing similar jobs in Irish Rail.
Transdev, the private company that operates the Luas, said a workers' pay claim of up to 53% was not sustainable and would add 6m euros (Â£4.65m ) to its costs.
