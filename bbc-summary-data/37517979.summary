The 20-year-old, on loan from Championship club Birmingham, is in his second spell with the Robins and has made three appearances this season.
Cheltenham are currently 23rd in League Two, with eight points from their first 10 games after just one league win.
"Unfortunately the injury has put him out and it's quite a long-time injury," Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
