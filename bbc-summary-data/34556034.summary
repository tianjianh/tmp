Prestonpans boxer Josh Taylor made it two wins out of two as a professional with a first round knock-out against opponent Adam Mate.

It was the first time the Commonwealth gold medallist had fought in front of his home crowd at a packed Meadowbank.
"I didn't think it would be as quick as that," Taylor told BBC Scotland.
"This boy is very special," said manager Barry McGuigan. We've got to take the right fights at the right time."
The Hungarian Mate came into the contest with an impressive record with 17 wins in his 22 previous fights, but it was evident from the first bell that Taylor was more than a match for him.
Taylor burst out of the corner and had Mate on the canvass with only 45 seconds on the clock.
And when the Commonwealth Games champion caught Mate with a left hook to floor him for the second time the referee stepped in to stop him enduring any further punishment with only 85 seconds of the first round gone.
The speed of victory caught Taylor by surprise who expected a stern test in front of his home crowd.
"It was a pretty hostile atmosphere and when I seen him in the centre of the ring I could see it in his eyes that he was a wee bit scared.
"I thought he would have come out a bit more but I caught him with a good shot and I felt that I was stronger than him."
Taylor is managed by the former world champion Barry McGuigan who said there was little learned during the fight that they didn't already know about his boxer.
"It was a pretty pointless exercise in one sense because Josh didn't get the sort of rounds we were expecting. But he is a tremendous puncher and and that guy (Mate) went down and wasn't getting up there is no doubt about it."
McGuigan says they will now need to look for a tougher opponent next time around.
"We know the calibre that Josh is but I am now thinking where are we going to go now. We need to get guys that are even better (than Mate) and just get him out again."
Taylor says he wants to be back in the ring before the end of the year before he will even contemplate looking at any potential title fights.
"I hope to be back in the ring before Christmas. I will only take a couple of days off before getting back into training, learning and developing."
"Because of my amateur background I am at domestic level title already but obviously I need to develop as a professional and get rounds under your belt before you do that."
