[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A runner who overcame two strokes, a hole in the heart and a broken back to complete his first five-kilometre parkrun says he will be back to try for a new personal best.

Ben Parker had previously been told he would never walk or talk again.
The 39-year-old completed the event at Kesgrave on Saturday morning.
His sister, Lucy Bryanton, said "everyone was in tears" and "Ben was just overwhelmed".
Parkrun volunteer Perry Evans said: "It makes you value life. Stories like this are inspirational."
Mr Parker suffered what was believed to be a brain hemorrhage after falling from a window 13 years ago. He also broke his back.
Mrs Bryanton said she was told "he is probably going to die".
"He was in a terrible state," she said. "We were told if he came round he wouldn't be able to do anything."
Mrs Bryanton said their mother, Ann, nursed him back to health through a regime of swimming, speech therapy and walking.
Three years ago he had another "massive stroke," with doctors again warning he could die.
"He couldn't talk," said Mrs Bryanton. "He felt he had just come round after the accident."
Doctors later said the original incident had also probably been a stroke caused by a hole in the heart.
Mr Parker fought his way back to relative health again, but found he was lonely after moving out on his own - prompting his sister to suggest he tried the parkrun.
"He feels part of a community now," she said. "They were such welcoming people. Ben told me, 'I can do better next time'."
