Carl Beatson Asiedu, 19, who had appeared in CBBC's MI High, was stabbed in the heart near Club Life nightclub in Vauxhall, south London, in 2009.
Junior Ademujimi-Falade, 21, from Camberwell, south London, was convicted of manslaughter last month.
The Old Bailey heard the victim, who had been performing at the club, was attacked with a friend by a group outside the venue.
Ademujimi-Falade was a friend of the man suspected of inflicting the fatal blow. The suspect is believed to have fled to Nigeria.
Earlier, Mr Asiedu, the son of a pastor and a midwife, and his friend and fellow student Peter Lama - who was also stabbed but survived - had been performing there with their rap group Kid 'n' Play.
Judge Martin Stephens told him: "Your victim was a young man of talent and much promise.
"The devastation to his family is incalculable."
Richard Whittam QC, prosecuting, said: "There has been no suggestion that either of the young men had done anything to invite the violence visited on them."
Mr Asiedu, who had attended St Francis Xavier College in Clapham, south London, was attacked by a group including former school bullies who detectives believed may have been jealous of his success.
Mr Asiedu was about to start the second year of his degree at De Montfort University in Leicester in media production when he was killed.
He had recorded a single in 2007 and worked with the Black Police Association to produce a documentary for schools raising awareness of knife crime.
In addition, he had appeared in a small role in episodes of MI High, children's adventure series about school pupils working as spies.
They were not broadcast until last year, after he died.
