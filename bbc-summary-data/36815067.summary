A planned switch-on of Birmingham's new fixed speed cameras has been delayed after summer showers hindered work.

Seven cameras in Birmingham and two in Solihull were to start working on Monday but this is has now been moved to August.
The city council said "terrible weather" had prevented contractors fitting and testing all the equipment.
Fixed cameras in the West Midlands were switched off in 2013 in a bid to save about Â£1m a year.
Stewart Stacey, cabinet member for transport and roads, said: "We now hope to be ready for 8 August, but in the meantime, I would remind motorists of the need to drive within the speed limits set by law to keep our roads safe for everyone."
