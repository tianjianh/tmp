Northampton Railway Station: Preparations for dig

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Preparations for an archaeological dig at a site earmarked for a new railway station are due to begin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The existing Castle Station in Northampton will be replaced by a Â£20m glass and steel building in 2014.
In medieval times a royal castle was situated on part of the site, and last year items from Saxon times were unearthed in an initial trench.
The dig will be done by experts from Northamptonshire Archaeology and will take about 12 weeks.
It will record any remains before the new station is built.
Councillor Jim Harker, leader of Northamptonshire County Council said: "Northampton's unique selling point over many of its neighbours is its long and important history and heritage.
"It had one of the first universities in England and its castle was the scene of many important historical events."
Last October, a 12th Century ironstone wall, pottery fragments and a Saxon brooch were unearthed during a preliminary investigation on the site.
During the next two weeks hoarding will be put around the site and it will be prepared for the dig.
The short-stay car park will be relocated to a new area alongside the station.
