Worcester City are waiting to give a debut to their latest signing, former Romanian top-flight midfielder Marius Ologu, after spotting him at training - with another non-league club.

Ologu, 26, has come in from West Midlands League Premier Division side Dudley Town on a short-term deal.
"He was training with the group coming on after us," said boss Carl Heeley.
"As we were packing the kit away after we'd done, we were watching and this one lad stood out by a country mile."
The City joint manager told BBC Hereford & Worcester: "We could have said it was the European scouting network that we'd set up, but I don't think anyone would have believed that. The fact is, we've taken a punt on him.
"When we pulled him out and had a little word with him, it transpired that he'd played in the Romanian top flight and had come over to England looking for a professional club. It's a strange stroke of luck. We'll just have to see how he copes with the rigours of National League North."
"We don't know how we he'll adapt but we've given him a short-term deal. He's got great technique and he works hard but we need to get his fitness up. He played in a friendly at Halesowen, scored a great free-kick and looked very lively, but he unfortunately picked up a little groin strain which has knocked him back a bit."
After a poor first half of the season, relegation-threatened City, last season's FA Cup heroes, currently stand 16th in National League North ahead of Tuesday night's home game with fellow strugglers Stalybridge Celtic, when victory would lift them seven points clear of trouble.
Back in Romania, Marius Ologu began with his hometown club Universitatea Craiova, for whom he made 17 appearances before leaving in 2011 to join Astra Ploiesti.
He has since played for Turnu Severin, Targu Mures, Caransebes and National Sebis, prior to coming to England to sign for Dudley in December.
