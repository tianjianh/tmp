Lincoln bypass inquiry told there will be losers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The second public inquiry into Lincoln's Â£92m bypass has heard restricted access by some villages would be balanced by its benefits.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The final day of the two-week inquiry heard from Lincolnshire County Council which said the Eastern Bypass would reduce congestion and promote growth.
Residents objected to the scheme which would close a route into the city from three villages.
The inquiry concluded on Friday with a decision expected in the coming months.
The multimillion-pound project has been delayed by protests from villagers in Cherry Willingham, Reepham and Fiskerton because the proposed route would close Hawthorne Road.
They claim they would be forced to use a longer and more dangerous route, and want a road bridge installed.
But Simon Randle, representing the council, told the hearing the bridge would be too expensive.
He said that whilst there would be losers from the scheme, this had to be balanced against the wider objectives of reducing congestion and promoting growth and investment in Lincoln.
Councillor Richard Davies, speaking after the inquiry, said: "What we've seen is a culmination of two weeks really useful work.
"Everybody has had an opportunity to make their views heard we've debated some of the issues and we've had the opportunity in open discourse to really discuss in particular some of the objections."
The council's previous plans to link the A158 Wragby Road with the A15 Sleaford Road were rejected by the government in 2014 because of safety concerns over a bridge.
It has since been redesigned but still does not take traffic.
