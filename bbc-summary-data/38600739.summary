[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Another 24-hour strike by guards on Southern rail is to be held on 23 January, the RMT union has announced.

The action is the latest in the long running dispute over drivers taking on responsibility for opening and closing train doors.
Train drivers in the Aslef and RMT unions walk out again on Friday, leaving almost all Southern's 2,242 weekday services cancelled.
The rail firm said it had already invited the RMT to fresh talks.
Further drivers' strikes are planned for 24, 25 and 27 January.
What's the Southern rail strike about?
RMT leader Mick Cash accused Southern's parent company Govia Thameslink (GTR) of breaking a pledge to retain a second safety-critical member of staff on trains.
He said a commitment made by GTR chief executive Charles Horton in a recent BBC debate "melts away" in direct talks.
"RMT is available but it is down to Southern/GTR to show that same commitment and stick to the promises they gave on camera in front of a TV audience across the region," Mr Cash added.
A Southern spokesman responded: "Mr Horton spoke face-to-face with [RMT deputy general secretary] Mick Lynch immediately after the recording of the debate on Sunday.
"He invited the RMT to fresh talks but we've had no dates or times from them.
"We also made a formal written offer to Aslef over a week ago and we have heard absolutely nothing."
On Wednesday, Southern said it would go to the Supreme Court to try to block Aslef's action, after losing a court case and an appeal last year.
