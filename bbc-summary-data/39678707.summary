Leicestershire v Glamorgan: Nick Selman leads Glamorgan fight back with century

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Opener Nick Selman led the way for Glamorgan as they reached 281-4 in reply to Leicestershire's first innings total of 420.

Selman survived an awkward start and accelerated to reach the third century of his career.
Jacques Rudolph (58) and Colin Ingram (84 not out) played their parts in Glamorgan's best batting of the season.
Earlier the Foxes' last two wickets added 110 runs to frustrate the Welsh county's attack.
The big hitting of tail-enders Ben Raine, Clint McKay and Charlier Shreck looked to have swung the momentum in the home side's favour.
But Selman's increasingly confident innings and a mature knock from Ingram made sure that Glamorgan passed the follow-on target with just four wickets down, shortly before the close.
Leicestershire all-rounder Clint McKay told BBC Radio Leicester:
"They bowled quite nicely this morning but me and Charles (Shreck) got lucky enough to get away with a few and build that total past 400.
"(Rudolph) is a world-class player, he showed his class and batted beautifully, got them off to a nice start and we couldn't drag the scoring rate back throughout the day.
"I'd say it's even, four down on a very nice wicket, and the second new ball is going to be what makes the difference in the game."
Glamorgan batsman Nick Selman told BBC Wales Sport:
"Coming off the back of the last two games it was good to get some runs, me and Col [Colin Ingram] had the mindset of being busy and being positive.
"We got through a tough spell after lunch and reaped our reward afterwards, it was a shame to get out but hopefully Colin can kick on and get a big one.
"If we get through the new ball and get a good lead, the ball's going to be in our court."
