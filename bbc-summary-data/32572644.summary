The man from Norfolk was walking on the mountainside on Pen yr Ole Wen when he was unable to continue.
Saturday's incident happened after the party he was walking with had made a navigational error, according to Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue.
The man was winched on board an RAF helicopter and taken to hospital at Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd.
In a separate incident, Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue escorted two teenage girls to safety after they became exhausted while walking over the Carneddau range towards Bethesda while on a Duke of Edinburgh gold award expedition.
