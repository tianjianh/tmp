Ethan McKen, 24, from Nottingham, was hit by a wave at a Black Sea resort in Bulgaria on 8 August.
A silence was held at all matches in the Notts Senior League and across the Central Midlands league.
Mr McKen played as a defender for the Bulwell FC reserve team.
He taught PE at several primary schools in the Ashfield district of Nottinghamshire.
Ben Moore, manager of Bulwell FC reserves, said: "It was a mark of respect from the league to him - he had played for several teams in the league.
"He was a determined and confident lad - he stamped his mark on our team in a very short time."
Bulwell FC reserves captain Darrell Hatton said: "He was a talented player - we were were very shocked to hear about his death."
Friends said Mr McKen was kind and naturally clever, gaining a first-class honours degree in sports science and management from Nottingham Trent University.
