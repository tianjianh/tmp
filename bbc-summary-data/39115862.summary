The deal means Calderon, who finished 21st in the GP3 feeder category last year, will spend time in Sauber's simulator and with the team at races.
The 23-year-old will race in GP3 for a second season in 2017.
Team principal Monisha Kaltenborn said Sauber could give Calderon "a professional platform to develop her racing knowledge and skills".
Calderon said: "I am grateful to be working with such an established Formula 1 team and to benefit from its long experience.
"I look forward to working with the team and learning as much as I can. It is a step closer to my dream - one day competing in Formula 1."
