Nia Davies's affair with the girl, an A-level student, was deemed to amount to unacceptable professional conduct.
An Education Workforce Council disciplinary hearing found six allegations of misconduct proven against the Coleg Sir Gar teacher.
Ms Davies, 31, from Cardiff, was banned from teaching for at least two years.
The panel was told the teenager's father told college bosses about the secret relationship after he spotted a love bite on her neck.
Presenting officer Cadi Dewi said: "Davies showed a willingness to overstep boundaries at the college. There were frequent references to the use of drugs, using cannabis and alcohol.
"It was an extremely close and highly inappropriate relationship. It became a relationship that was sexual in nature."
The girl admitted to her parents she had spent weekends away in Bath and London with her teacher.
She denied having sex with Ms Davies when interviewed by police, but admitted they had kissed and would sleep together at Ms Davies's home.
Ms Davies was arrested and bailed by police, but never charged.
The college investigation was not completed before Ms Davies's contract expired. She refused to attend subsequent investigation meetings.
Davies admitted counts of engaging in communication of a social nature and seeing the girl unaccompanied on a social basis outside of college.
The proven claims included inviting the girl into her home address, allowing her to sleep at her home, kissing her and giving her a love bite.
Claims of sharing a bed with the girl in London and engaging in sexual intercourse were not proven, but panel chairman Peter Williams said: "Ms Davies' conduct was found to be sexually motivated."
George Pollitt, representing Ms Davies, said: "She said they have engaged in some sort of relationship, which is not platonic, since 2015 when the girl was over the age of 18, and when my client was not employed at the college.
"I cannot put a label on what the relationship is, but I'm told it's hard to define. They met up socially as friends and things blossomed."
