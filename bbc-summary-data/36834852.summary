[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Super League leaders Hull FC will head into the Super 8s on the back of a hard-fought win at Salford Red Devils.

The visitors led 12-6 at the break through tries from Steve Michaels and Frank Pritchard, either side of a Michael Dobson score for Salford.
Second-half tries from Mason Caton-Brown, Niall Evalds and Rob Lui then put Salford ahead with 10 minutes left.
However, scores from Chris Green, Marc Sneyd and Mahe Fonua ensured the Black and Whites stay top of the table.
Hull FC are now two points clear of second-placed Wigan, who lost at home to St Helens, and face the Warriors in the Challenge Cup semi-finals next week.
They have now won 10 of their last 12 Super League matches, with seven games to go until the top four compete in the play-offs.
Salford will take part in The Qualifiers for a second successive season after their six-point deduction for breaching the salary cap - they would sit sixth in Super League without that punishment.
Before kick-off, Salford announced the signings of 29-year-old Luke Burgess and 32-year-old Feleti Mateo from Manly Sea Eagles.
Salford head coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Manchester:
"We can't fault the effort of the group, it is probably just our smarts a little bit.
"We seem to keep falling on the wrong side of the referees decisions but we can only control what we can control.
[On the new signings] "It's going to be a boost for the group and raise the standards within the team.
"Luke will come in and stiffen up the middle and is really strong defensively, and Mateo will bring a different dimension to us."
Hull FC head coach Lee Radford:
"Sika has been our best player on the field recently and was again tonight. Curtis Naughton was also fantastic at full back and Kirk Yeaman was outstanding.

"Salford are a very good side and I was not surprised by their performance.
"There was little in it and when they went ahead the stadium lifted and they had some wind in their sails.
"I'm really pleased to finish top but all the fun and games start now."
