Armed officers and a police helicopter were sent to the restaurant on St Andrews Quay at about 11:30 GMT after reports of gunfire.
Police said a blue Volkswagen Golf containing two people was fired at and its windows shot out.
Detectives said a grey Volkswagen Golf left the scene but two people were subsequently arrested.
Humberside Police said: "We know the registration plate of the outstanding vehicle and offenders."
The force believe it was an isolated incident, with the offenders and victims known to one another. No shots were fired by police.
Darren Woodhead was in the McDonald's drive through queue when the shooting took place.
He said: "I heard gunshots close to us and a car sped off out of the drive through.
"Within minutes police had arrived with pistols, then three police vans arrived with more heavily armed officers."
Officers cordoned off the scene for forensic examination of the area.
