Paul Tisdale: Exeter City squad playing for their futures in final three games

Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale says the last three games of the season will decide which players he retains.

The Grecians have an outside chance of making the League Two play-offs, but realistically must win their final three matches to make the top seven.
"The next three games will dictate decisions I make.
"We're not in a position where I can say 'yes, we're plodding along in mid-table and we know what we're going to do'," Tisdale told BBC Sport.
"In isolation there's a reason for everybody, everyone's played their part and has benefit to the squad.
"But from a manager's point of view, structurally you're always trying to develop and eke out more efficiency."
However, Tisdale said that players not currently in the side, could still be part of his longer term plans at St James Park.
"Those that are playing on Saturday aren't the ones that are guaranteed to be in the team in six month's time - that's about the rhythm we have as a team now," he added.
"That doesn't mean that they are ahead of others who may not be on the pitch."
