Workers at finance giant Prudential have started industrial action in a row over moving jobs overseas.

Unite said its members based in Reading had backed action by 97%, saying 81 jobs would go by moving work to India.
The workers voted not to co-operate with the transfer of work from Wednesday, which Unite said would "severely delay" the move.
Prudential said it expected to operate as normal without any disruption to services.
In May, the firm began a consultation with pension staff at its Reading office over proposals to make about 80 permanent roles redundant.
Unite regional officer Ian Methven said they had been "left with no choice" but to take strike action in order to protect their jobs.
"There are alternative ways of saving money in this area and we urge Prudential to think again about the offshoring of this skilled work," he added.
A Prudential spokesman said talks with the Union were ongoing and it aimed to find alternative roles within the company "for as many people as possible".
He said: "Upwards of 30 such alternative roles have been secured to date, from the initial 80 positions at risk, and we expect further opportunities to emerge over the next eight months."
