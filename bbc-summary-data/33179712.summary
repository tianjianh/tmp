Cardiff University academics said research with the public shows "major concerns" about state surveillance.
The conference comes in the wake of plans for new UK laws to help police and agencies monitor online threats.
Ben Wizner, the lawyer of former CIA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, is addressing delegates.
Dr Lina Dencik from the university said: "We have found that the lack of transparency surrounding the level of state surveillance and the way it is being conducted remains a major concern among the British public.
"People want to know why and how their personal data is being collected and used and what legal safeguards exist."
The Home Office has been asked to comment.
The two-day conference, at the university's School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies, is being held as part of a major research project called Digital Citizenship and Surveillance Society.
