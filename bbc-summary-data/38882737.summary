Kevin Craig, 40, and Alan Golding 67, of Southsea, Portsmouth, admitted being concerned in the supply of the drug in Dundee last March.
Police raided the Balunie Crescent property after being tipped off that a "significant" quantity of drugs would be delivered there.
Both men will be sentenced on 7 March.
The High Court in Glasgow was told that Golding has no convictions in the UK, but was jailed for four years and nine months in Spain after being arrested on a yacht which was transporting cannabis.
Prosecutor Bernard Ablett said: "Police obtained a search warrant for the property and took up observations.
"At 17:20 the accused Alan Golding arrived in his Mercedes car and walked to the front door of the house.
"Minutes later he and Kevin Craig went out and returned carrying two black bin bags and a white box that had been in Mr Golding's car boot."
The two men were searched and retrieved £1,522 from Golding's trouser pocket and £90 from Craig.
The bin bags and box were found to contain a total of nine heat-sealed bags of cannabis which had a street value of between £90,000 and £136,000.
The men will be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh.
