TV is the most popular medium, especially in cities. BTV is the sole terrestrial network. Popular satellite and cable channels and Indian TV stations have large audiences.
State-run radio covers almost the entire country. BBC World Service in English and Bengali can be heard on 100 MHz FM in Dhaka.
Newspapers are diverse, outspoken and privately-owned. English-language titles appeal mainly to an educated urban readership.
Media outlets tend to be polarised, aligning themselves with one or other of the main political factions.
In 2014, the government prompted concern from media freedom advocates by issuing a policy banning TV and radio stations from broadcasting material deemed to harm the image of the armed forces and law-enforcement agencies impede state security.
Around 6.8% of Bangladeshi citizens are online (InternetLiveStats.com, 2014).
US-based Freedom House says there are periodic blocks of YouTube, Facebook and high-profile blogs.
A temporary block imposed on Facebook and other platforms in late 2015 was criticised by social media users, while businesses reported a negative effect on trade.
Some prominent bloggers, especially those commenting about Islamic fundamentalism, have been murdered for their writing. Bloggers and social media users have been arrested on blasphemy-related charges.
