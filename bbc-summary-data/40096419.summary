She was taken to hospital after the accident and then flown to Majorca for further treatment.
She was believed to have suffered serious head injuries.
Prof Ferdinand von Prondzynski, RGU's principal, said: "We are aware one of our students has been involved in an accident while on holiday in Ibiza.
