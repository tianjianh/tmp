The funeral of IRA supergrass Raymond Gilmour is to take place following a post mortem, but his name will probably never appear on his headstone.

BBC NI's Enda McClafferty last spoke to Raymond Gilmour in 2014 during an interview in which he said the security forces had "basically abandoned" him.
The supregrass' body was discovered last week by his teenage son at his home in Kent.
He had been living under an assumed identity for more than 30 years.
Raymond Gilmour , from Londonderry, became an RUC Special Branch informer when he was 17 and was the only witness in a trial of 31 IRA suspects that collapsed in 1984.
He is "unlikely to be remembered in the way he would have liked", says our correspondent.
The security service agent is to be buried following a post mortem, although "the name Raymond Gilmour is unlikely to be on his headstone", he adds.
Following the trial's collapse, Gilmour was considered "damaged goods" while republicans viewed him as a "a traitor, who betrayed his friends and family for money", said Enda McClafferty.
"Gilmour said that he saved countless lives during his time as an agent for the security services, but in reality history will look at Raymond Gilmour as the man behind the first supergrass trial here, a trial that collapsed."
Raymond Gilmour first joined republican paramilitaries the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) in 1976 as a police agent working for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).
He then moved to the IRA in 1980 before his cover was blown two years later when police used information supplied by him to recover a machine gun.
He decided to testify against a number of alleged republicans in 1984, but the case collapsed when the then lord chief justice, Lord Lowry, dismissed his evidence, calling it "unworthy of belief".
In the 2014 BBC interview, Raymond Gilmour talked about constantly "living under threat" and how the security forces had "basically abandoned" him.
"You always got the sense when you were talking to him that here was a man who was in a very dark place, suffering from severe psychological problems, alcohol abuse and indeed depression," says our correspondent.
During his time as an agent for the security services, Gilmour said he was paid Â£600 per week for information.
In latter years he had been living on a weekly disability payment of Â£80.
He told the BBC he had "no regrets" about his work as an agent, but said being unable to attend the funeral of his mother "was a big regret in his life."
