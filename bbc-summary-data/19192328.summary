The money will be spent on new teaching space, student accommodation and a Centre for the Arts.
The university aims to complete the first phase of redevelopment by September 2013, subject to planning consent.
The entire scheme, including new buildings and refurbishing existing facilities, would be completed by September 2015.
The plans have been submitted to Bath and North East Somerset Council which hopes to reach a decision on permission by October.
A university spokeswoman said a total of £26m would be spent on two 350-seat lecture theatres and 30-seat lecture rooms in a new building able to hold 2,000 students.
This would be connected to the main campus parade by a "skywalk" bridge.
The plans also include a £43m accommodation complex which would house 708 en-suite bedrooms in 75 flats across two buildings.
It would also include a refectory with seating for 350.
The spokeswoman said the new £10.9m Centre for the Arts would provide both the university and surrounding region with a venue for a public programme of arts events and activities.
A dedicated executive education suite would enable the School of Management to offer an extended programme of short courses, master classes, speaker events and seminars, she said.
Plans for the 1 West building at the heart of the campus involve a £22m refurbishment, retaining its original character but increasing teaching and researching space, and improving environmental performance.
The vice chancellor, Prof Dame Glynis Breakwell, said: "Despite continuing economic uncertainty and the changing tuition fee landscape, the University of Bath is facing the future with great confidence.
"Our aim is to further enhance the university's ability to deliver an outstanding student experience; creating additional facilities for research, and an inspiring working environment, as well as providing cultural and economic benefits for the wider Bath region."
She said the Centre for the Arts would offer the city a perfect venue for hosting national and international conferences.
