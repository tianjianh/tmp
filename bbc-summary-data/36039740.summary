British singer Pete Doherty and the Senegalese star Youssou N'Dour are due to play in November, a statement said.
A precise opening date is yet to be set but renovation work has begun, the management added.
The Islamic State-claimed attacks across Paris on 13 November left 130 people dead.
US rock band the Eagles of Death Metal, who were mid-performance when the militants burst in and began firing, have said they want to play at the venue again.
Announcing the schedule for later this year, the Bataclan's management said: "We want to preserve the [Bataclan's] warmth and friendliness and maintain its popular, festive spirit."
US rock group Nada Surf and the French rap group MZ have also been booked to play the venue in December, with further acts to be announced.
