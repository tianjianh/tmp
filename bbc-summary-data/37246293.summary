[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lucas Walker was playing when he was swept away last month.
His mother, 37-year-old Julie Walker, tried to save him, but both died. His brother Samuel, 13, also tried to help.
A newspaper death notice said a celebration of their lives was being held at Aberdeen Crematorium on Friday morning.
The notice said: "They were a much loved mother and brother, a dear daughter, sister, auntie, niece and cousin. Lucas was a very dearly loved son, grandson, brother and nephew.
"Julie and Lucas will be so sorely missed."
Relatives earlier said in a statement that they were "devastated" by the tragedy.
They thanked rescuers for their efforts.
Lucas' brother was also pulled from the water, along with a man and a woman who had also tried to save the pair.
Safety measures at the beach are being assessed as part of an inquiry.
Lucas was a pupil at Bramble Brae School in Aberdeen.
