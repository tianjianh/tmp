GBBO: How Andrew Smyth kept the result a secret

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Never mind the dreaded soggy bottoms - he tainted his tarts with a sugar glaze.

That's the opinion of the mother of Andrew Smyth, the County Down man who was runner-up in the Great British Bake Off.
He and fellow finalist, Jane Beedle, lost out to 31-year-old PE teacher Candice Brown from Bedfordshire in the show's finale on Wednesday night.
Although he failed to be crowned the prince of tarts, Andrew excelled during the technical challenge, coming top of the leader board.
Twenty-five-year-old Cambridge University graduate, Andrew, is originally from Holywood but now works as an aerospace engineer in Derby.
Andrew told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme it was difficult to keep the result of the pre-recorded programme a secret.
"It was tough to keep it under my hat for quite a long time, especially in work after we had been filming at the weekends."
The finale saw the trio create a three-layered meringue crown for the signature challenge - which Candice filled with prosecco-soaked berries and pistachio jewels, topped with a miniature Queen Victoria crown.
They then had to make a perfect Victoria sponge cake for the technical challenge, set by Mary Berry, with only one instruction and no measurements given.
So did Andrew make his mark on his meringue? Or was the competition just too stiff?
"You've got to push the boat out, I think I missed the mark maybe on some of the flavours," he said.
"I tried to be a bit too adventurous with the meringue but I was really chuffed with the 3D effect of it on that ridiculous paper mÃ¢chÃ© head."
Being an engineer is a world away from the Great British Bake Off tent, but Andrew said his skills stood by him as he constructed his cakes.
"You've got to use any strengths you have in the tent ... I was determined to bring all the benefit I could from my engineering experience."
His parents Kay and Nigel are, of course very proud but the final was bittersweet for them.
Kay said: "Everybody did really well to make it to the final... unfortunately Andrew made the decision to put a sugar glaze on his fruit tarts which tainted the pastry."
Dad, Nigel, said: "It was particularly exciting, I think any of them could have won in the show stopper, it was a very complicated task.
"But unfortunately, just on the day, Andrew with his tarts didn't quite live up to his expectations, he's still delighted."
So have the lights, camera and action of the Bake Off tent  tempted Andrew towards a career in television?
"I'm very excited to see what comes up, I'm keeping my options open," he said.
"My colleagues don't need to be alarmed that I'm leaving in the next couple of weeks, but I'd love to use Bake Off as an opportunity to get in to some form of science and engineering broadcasting.
"That's my two loves in terms of teaching and explaining things to people, the engineering side, as well as baking."
It is Bake Off's seventh series - and the final one broadcast on the BBC after Channel 4 bought the rights.
Andrew said he does not envisage that the show's migration to another channel will cause problems.
"The reason people love Bake Off is because they can get involved and they can bake along too and that is always going to remain at the core of it.
"I don't see a problem with it moving, it's just a bit of a new chapter."
