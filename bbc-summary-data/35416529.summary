[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Toyota has kept its crown as the world's top-selling carmaker for the fourth straight year.

The company sold 10.15 million cars overall in 2015, slightly beating expectations.
Germany's Volkswagen came second with 9.93 million vehicles sold, followed in third by General Motors from the US with 9.8 million.
Volkswagen had been top in the first half of 2015 before a diesel emissions scandal set back sales.
Business in a number of major markets such as the US and Japan, as well as in emerging markets, has slowed due to the global economic slowdown.
In 2014, Toyota claimed the top spot with 10.23 million cars sold.
The company is best known for its Prius hybrid, Camry and Corolla sedan models and the Lexus luxury brand.
Toyota also announced it was considering buying out the rest of fellow car maker Daihatsu, of which it already owns 51.2%.
Shares in Daihatsu jumped 16.4% on the Tokyo stock exchange on the news.
Toyota shares rose by 3.8%, also boosted by media reports suggesting there was to be a cooperation deal with Suzuki.
Both carmakers denied the rumours, but Suzuki also saw its shares jump by 11.4%.
