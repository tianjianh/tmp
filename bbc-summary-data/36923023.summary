Season ticket holder David MacDonald, 50, admitted making his way on to the Hampden pitch after the final whistle.
He gesticulated at Hibs fans after the Edinburgh club's 3-2 win and tried to start a fight with one of them, before he himself was knocked to the ground.
MacDonald, from Glasgow, who has 20 previous convictions, was also handed an 18-month football banning order.
Jailing him at Glasgow Sheriff Court, Sheriff Aisha Anwar told MacDonald: "Your conduct on 21 May, however you may choose to justify it, was deplorable.
"The shameful images of what occurred during the football match were replayed across the world."
The court heard that MacDonald attempted to hit a Hibs fan before being punched to the ground, cutting his head and becoming unconscious before being helped by a first aider.
MacDonald was later traced to his home in the city's Royston area and arrested by police weeks after the game.
Meanwhile, police have arrested five more people in connection with the cup final disorder, bringing the total number of arrests to 55.
Those detained during an operation on Thursday were a 17-year-old male, a 22-year-old man, two 35-year-old men and a 15-year-old girl.
