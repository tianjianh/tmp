The popular broadcaster touched thousands of listeners with his openness and optimism as he battled skin cancer.
A charity appeal prompted by his diagnosis has so far raised more than Â£62,000 in just over two months.
Bloomfield, who worked at the station for 10 years as a presenter, reporter and a Derby County commentator, died at a hospice near Shrewsbury.
He had a malignant melanoma removed from his leg 10 years ago but in 2013 learned the cancer had returned.
Last year, he was told it had spread and was given months to live.
One Direction singer Niall Horan said on Twitter: "Sad to hear to hear of the passing of Colin Bloomfield today, he was a super great guy, great commentator."
Radio Derby's editor Simon Cornes said: "Reporter, producer, commentator, presenter  - Colin was all of those.
"You're lucky in radio if you're good at one of these things but Colin's talent was a rare one and he was extraordinarily accomplished at all of them. He made it seem easy. We know it isn't.
"If you were designing the perfect colleague you'd come up with Colin. His modesty was disarming but it was his warmth and his positive attitude to life that made him so popular with everyone at Radio Derby.
"We've lost our friend but it's a mark of the man that so many of our listeners feel they've lost their friend too. All of us are going to miss him dreadfully."
Derby County spokesman Colin Gibson, who had worked with Bloomfield at BBC Radio Derby, said: "As a broadcaster he was the consummate professional.
"He could be - at one time - eulogising about what was happening at Neighbours and the next turn he'd being interviewing the prime minister and he would do them both brilliantly. He could really turn his hand to anything.
"His bravery during his fight with cancer had to be admired, preferring always to talk about the Rams or his beloved Shrewsbury Town rather than the pain he was going through."
Derby County president Sam Rush said: "He will be sadly missed by everyone at Derby County Football Club as we had a tremendous working relationship with him.
"He can only be described as an inspirational individual and both a wonderful and humble young man."
"He was someone that we had the utmost respect for, especially for the way in which he conducted himself during the difficult times he faced."
Earlier this year, working with the Derby Telegraph and charity Skcin, the presenter launched the Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal.
The money will be used to make hundreds of schools in Derbyshire and East Staffordshire "sun safe", by educating youngsters about skin cancer prevention.
BBC Radio presenter Sally Pepper is running the London Marathon on Sunday to raise money for the appeal.
Bloomfield has received a series of standing ovations by football supporters - including at the Rams' Championship match against Brentford on 11 April when fans chanted his name in the 33rd minute.
