Five nasty US presidential debate jibes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The insults hurled during the presidential debate in St Louis, Missouri, make it one of the nastiest ever seen. Here are five of the most vicious jibes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Those Hillary Clinton emails again.
Mr Trump says he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton's deletion of 33,000 emails held on a private server when she was secretary of state.
Clinton: "It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."
Trump: "Because you'd be in jail."
Clinton's 'emailgate' sliced and diced
Buzzfeed characterises the event as "easily the craziest and most surreal debate in modern history".
Mr Trump issued his own video on Saturday, denying that the notorious 2005 recording of him making offensive sexual comments about women was the real Donald Trump.
Not so, said Hillary Clinton:
"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.
"But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we've seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to 10. We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter."
New York Times: "Both candidates were visibly uneasy as the 90-minute event unfolded with almost unremitting hostility."
Mr Trump steered the topic round to one of Hillary Clinton's campaign low points - her description of Trump supporters as deplorable.
"We have a divided nation, because people like her - and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.
"And when she said deplorable, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse."
Could Republicans still dump Trump?
For the Daily Beast: "Donald Trump Goes Full Rage-Monster on Hillary and Bill Clinton."
In a sign of what was the come, Mr Trump raked up the Clintons' past during an appearance alongside four women at a nearby hotel, less than two hours before the debate.
The four were:
Bill Clinton was present at the debate as were the women. Mr Trump said this:
"There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women."
Who won the debate?
"Ugliest debate ever," opines Politico.
And unusually for a presidential debate...
...but despite the vitriol, there was a final pressing of the flesh.
"Focused Trump trounces Hillary at second testy debate," is the verdict of the New York Post.
