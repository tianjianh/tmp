Bromley 1-1 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley's fight to secure their safety in the National League will go down to the wire after they drew with Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bromley took the lead early on as Bradley Goldberg's right-footed effort flew past Jonny Maxted in goal.
The visitors were given a glimmer of hope when Jordan Preston cut in from the left and fired into the bottom right corner to draw level.
In response, Bromley pushed for a winner and Toby Sho-Silva saw his chip agonisingly come back off the post.
Guiseley now go into the last game of the season just one point above the relegation zone.
