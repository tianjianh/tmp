[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South African Tokyo Sexwale ended his campaign to become the next Fifa president during his speech ahead of the vote in Zurich on Friday.

The 62-year-old told the Fifa congress: "I suspend my participation. I leave only four people."
Gianni Infantino, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein and Jerome Champagne remain.
Sexwale was a rank outsider and did not have the backing of the Confederation of African Football.
In January, Caf announced its support for Asian confederation president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa.
Sexwale, a former prisoner in an anti-apartheid jail with Nelson Mandela, conducted a low-key campaign and there seemed to be a real chance that he might not win any of the 207 votes in the first round.
He said he was prepared to work with any of the four remaining candidates to replace Sepp Blatter.
