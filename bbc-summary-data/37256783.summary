The Cardiff-born player scored 478 tries in 487 games for Wigan, becoming the greatest try-scorer in the history of the British game.
A pioneer among black players, Boston signed for the club in 1953 and also played for Blackpool.
He attended the ceremony in Wigan's Believe Square, where the bronze statue created by sculptor Steve Winterburn is located.

The 82-year-old recently revealed he was suffering from dementia.
Wigan Warriors head coach Shaun Wane said the statue was a "fitting" tribute, adding: "Doing this for Billy is just reward for what he's done for the town of Wigan.
"Whenever anyone speaks about Wigan rugby league, they tend to mention Billy Boston."
Club director Kris Radlinski added: "His charity work over the years is unwavering, as is his support of Wigan rugby league and his love for the club and town."
More than Â£90,000 was raised for the statue, which included a large donation from former Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan and Â£3,000 from Wigan Council, a council spokeswoman said.
Councillor David Molyneux, deputy leader at the council and chairman of the Billy Boston Statue Trust, said: "The fact we have managed to fulfil this vision - as a result of other people digging deep and giving their time - is a testament to Billy the rugby player and also Billy the Wiganer, so I'd like to say thank you to all those involved."
