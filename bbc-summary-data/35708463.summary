Argentina wing Gonzalo Camacho will bring his injury-plagued spell with Leicester to an end in the summer.

The 31-year-old will be replaced by Sale's Tom Brady from next season.
Camacho made his debut in the European Champions Cup in December, more than two years after joining, and has since played three Premiership games.
"He has had some horrendous bad luck, but it's right that we move in a different direction," Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill said.
"Tom is a young English qualified player we think that is better for us."
A shoulder injury limited Camacho to one game for his country and one pre-season match for Leicester in two years before the current campaign.
He signed a new one-year contract in September, but a thigh injury then sidelined him in October, delaying his debut further.
"He has been a fantastic guy, a fantastic person and for injury reasons, mainly, he's not had the chance to prove himself," Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
Brady is the latest winger to commit to Tigers for the 2016-17 season, with South Africa international JP Pietersen also moving to the East Midlands side.
Meanwhile, fly-half Owen Williams is set to return for Sunday's home game against second-placed Exeter after eight weeks out with a broken jaw.
However, hooker England Tom Youngs faces a fitness test on an ongoing back problem ahead of the Chiefs' visit.
