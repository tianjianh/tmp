More than 100 pianos went under the hammer as the Edinburgh Piano Company held its closing down sale.
The firm supplied pianos for famous musicians including Frank Sinatra, Van Morrison and Luciano Pavarotti over more than 30 years in business.
Retiring business owner James Cameron saw his stock sold off for prices ranging from £104 to £48,880.
The highest priced item was a Bösendorfer grand piano from Vienna, dubbed the "Rolls Royce" of the instrument.
Bidders, including Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos, packed the firm's showroom in Joppa, Edinburgh, while bids were called in from across the world, with buyers in China and America taking part.
In total, the sale of 116 pianos by specialist company Piano Auctions Ltd netted £373,250.
Mr Cameron, 73, said he was "absolutely delighted" with the sale.
He said: "There were more people in the sale room than I have ever had in the history of the business.
"I'm sad that it is our final day of trading but I'm pleased that we've gone out on a high note.
"It's been an enjoyable business but I'm sure all those pianos have gone to good homes."
Mr Cameron started the business in the early 1980s while studying musical instrument technology in the city.
His instruments went on tours with Jamie Cullum, Van Morrison, Evelyn Glennie and Tony Bennett, and he provided pianos for a Frank Sinatra concert at Ibrox Stadium in 1990 and another by Pavarotti at the SECC.
He now plans to set up a musical centre in his home near Biggar and host jazz nights.
