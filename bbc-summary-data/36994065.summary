[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 0-1 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was an afternoon of firsts as Bradford triumphed 1-0 at Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordy Hiwula fired in his first Bantams goal, and their first of the season, to secure the opening victory of manager Stuart McCall's second spell in charge.
It arrived after just 12 minutes as the frontman, on a season-long loan from Huddersfield, met captain Tony McMahon's cross from the right with a cushioned header.
And that effort was enough to ensure Grant McCann tasted defeat as Posh manager for the first time in his seventh game at the helm after a couple of caretaker spells during last season.
His side created little of note until Marcus Maddison was denied by a fine Colin Doyle save with five minutes to go.
Paul Taylor had earlier tested the visiting goalkeeper while Tom Nichols steered a header wide.
In fact Bradford should have won more emphatically as Josh Cullen missed a glorious chance to mark the start of his second loan spell with a goal early in the second half.
He side-footed wide from 10 yards after McMahon had once more unlocked the home defence.
