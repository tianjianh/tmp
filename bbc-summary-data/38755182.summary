[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Welsh cynghanedd group Carmarthen Bardic School is celebrating its 25th anniversary and hopes to publish a collection of poems written by past members.
It has helped train a number of National Eisteddfod winners including Mererid Hopwood, who tutors for the group, and Aneirin Karadog.
The lessons are held over a pint at the Carmarthen Quins Rugby Club.
Cynghanedd has bee present in Welsh language rhyming since the 6th Century, and developed into a complex set of poetic rules from about the 13th Century.
Geraint Roberts, one of the original members, said: "There's a very close correlation between the development of the Welsh language and cynghanedd.
"We set homework and that's a critical part of it - going over the homework, looking over mistakes and looking for ways of improving and developing."
One of its youngest members, 15-year-old Dafydd Llywelyn, said: "My forefathers learnt this craft and I want to keep the tradition alive."
