Maths teachers will be offered extra help to boost results with the launch of a national network of excellence.

Universities and other experts will be called in to improve lessons and numeracy in an Â£800,000 plan.
Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: "We must now work together to get the basics right", with Wales hoping to show an improvement in December in the international Pisa comparison tables.
One teachers' leader welcomed the plan, but warned of a maths teacher shortage.
The scheme, aimed at lessons for all ages from nursery to sixth form, includes:
"Education reform is our national mission," said Ms Williams.
"Working together we will ensure that our young people have an equal opportunity to reach the highest standards."
In December 2015, a task force set up by former Education Minister Huw Lewis called for a centre of excellence for maths and hubs in schools to boost what was seen as the weakest of the core subjects.
Dr Sofia Lyakhova, a senior lecturer in maths at Swansea University, said her institution had already been working with other universities to boost the teaching of further maths at A-level.
"I am delighted that the government is making that support available across all of Wales," she added.
Tim Pratt, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, welcomed the announcement, but also called for urgent action to tackle a shortage of maths teachers.
"Schools are reporting difficulties in recruiting maths teachers with the right level of skills and training they need," he said.
"We would be very happy to work with the Welsh government to develop strategies to address this situation."
However, Mr Pratt added that the initiative should not "further skew the curriculum which is already dominated by maths, English/Welsh and science".
"These are obviously very important subjects but so are other subjects, and we need to ensure that pupils are taught a broad and balanced curriculum."
