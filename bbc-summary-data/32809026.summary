A hotel operator has started a legal challenge against turning part of Lews Castle in Stornoway on Lewis into self-catering apartments.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19th Century property, which has been closed for 25 years, is to reopen later this year following a revamp.
Kenman Holdings Limited, which has a number of properties in the town, claim the privately-run apartments have been developed using public money.
Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - denies the allegation.
In a statement, the comhairle said it would strongly contest any legal challenge raised in the Court of Session in Edinburgh.
Lews Castle was constructed in 1847 for James Matheson, who made his fortune from the opium trade. Opium exported from China and India was often mixed with tobacco by smokers.
The property has been revamped in a project led by the comhairle and costing Â£13.5m.
Most of the property has been turned into a museum and archive.
