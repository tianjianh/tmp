A new £5m health centre in Flintshire has been granted planning permission.

GPs, district nurses, health visitors and community clinics will be among the services brought together at Flint Health Centre.
The project will now move into the final stages of design and planning in order to gain final Welsh government approval.
Contractors will be appointed over the summer, with work expected to start on the site in the autumn.
It follows Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board's decision to close the town's community hospital.
Dr Elizabeth Shaheir, GP and the clinical lead for the development, called it a "massive development" for the area.
"It will mean we can treat our patients in modern facilities and we'll be able to work more closely with our health and social services colleagues to plan and deliver better care," she added.
