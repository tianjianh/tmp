The Inverness Whisky and Gin Festival has taken place over four days in the Highland capital.
Held at Bogbain, a 19th Century farm on the edge of Inverness, the event also involved fringe events in the city.
The festival, which ended on Saturday night, featured tasting sessions of rare malts, live music and cookery demonstrations by professional chefs.
Makers and sellers of whisky and gin also exhibited their products.
