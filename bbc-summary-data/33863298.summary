Gerald Francis Quinn, 75, from Torquay in Devon was a "committed Catholic" who lost his wife to cancer in 1988 and whose daughter died in 1999.
He died at the scene on the A35 Bridport after a crash involving his car and a lorry on 4 August.
Officers are still appealing for witnesses come forward.
Mr Quinn's family said in a statement: "Gerald was a kind and considerate man who devoted 30 years of his life as a secondary school French teacher in Torbay.
"He will be much missed by his remaining two children, three grandchildren and wider family and friends."
Police said the crash, involving a white curtain-sided lorry and Mr Quinn's orange Daewoo Matiz, happened in Sea Road South just before 05:00 BST on 4 August.
Sgt Dave Stroud from Dorset Police said: "The lorry was heading toward Crown Roundabout on Sea Road South when it collided with the car, which was heading in the opposite direction, between West Bay Roundabout and the fire station.
"I am appealing to anyone who witnessed this collision, or the manner of driving of either vehicle, prior to the incident."
