It will be part of a special exhibition for the 950th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings in the town named after the famous battle in 1066.
The tapestry was created by residents and visitors and has previously been displayed next to the Bayeux Tapestry.
Robert Emeleus, Battle Museum chairman, said he was hoping for a flood of visitors for the special anniversary.
Margaret Emeleus, also from the museum, said: "It was a very difficult period, after the battle... life in England radically changed."
The Battle of Hastings
Battle of Hastings: Does it matter exactly where it happened?
She said the Alderney Tapestry had inspired the Battle community - 6,500-strong compared to Alderney's population of 1,900 - to start its own embroidery project.
Mrs Emeleus said it was looking at the story "from the Battle through to 1115" and it was "bringing together the Battle community".
Mr Emeleus was quick to point out the project was "not in competition [with Alderney]".
The Alderney Tapestry is due to be on displayed in the Battle Museum of Local History from 2 September until mid-October 2016.
