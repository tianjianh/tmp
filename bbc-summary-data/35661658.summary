Stuart Howatson, 37, from Warwickshire, ordered expensive computer security systems, offered an engineer a job and duped hotel staff to get free rooms.
Sentencing him, Recorder Derek Sweeting QC told him the the real purpose of the fraud was to make him feel better and more powerful.
The court heard he has a variety of personality disorders.
He previously admitted 12 counts of fraud and theft. The court heard he had been jailed in 2010 for pretending to be a royal protection police officer.

Howatson's lawyer, Nick Devine, told Coventry Crown Court: "The plain fact of the matter was that he was enjoying the fact that he was dealing with these big figures, and the fact he was pretending to be someone with the kind of authority to enter into such contracts.
"It was all about what he got out of the pretence of being somebody in a considerable position of authority in a glamorous line of business."
Prosecutor Sharon Bahia said one of four people Howatson lied to was was an engineer who flew to Cologne with his wife to meet him after being promised a job as an operations director with Mercedes.
Ms Bahia said the man described Howatson as being very knowledgeable about Mercedes-Benz, and offered him Bupa health care and software to learn German.
The court was also told that Howatson, of Fisher Road, Bishops Itchington, used false email accounts purporting to belong to his assistants at Mercedes to book hotel rooms in Bewdley and Kidderminster.
Passing sentence, Recorder Sweeting told Howatson: "You carried off the deception with a great deal of persuasive skill."
