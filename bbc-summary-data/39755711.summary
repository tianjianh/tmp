The victim was found injured in Gilmour Avenue in the Hardgate area of Clydebank at about 13:00 on Friday.
It is believed he had been attacked by four men carrying weapons. He was taken to hospital, where his condition was described as "serious".
Police are treating the incident as an attempted murder.
It is thought the suspects arrived in the area in a black five-door BMW 1 Series car. They later made off in the direction of Kilbowie Road towards Glasgow Road.
Det Supt Kenny Graham said: "This was a targeted and brazen attack on a single individual which took place in broad daylight.
"Gilmour Avenue is a quiet residential area and nearby residents were left shocked by this violent incident.
"We are currently assessing CCTV and conducting door-to-door inquiries.
"The suspects can only be described at this time as wearing dark clothing.
"Local residents and passing motorists will have witnessed or heard this disturbance given the time the incident occurred.
"We would ask anyone with information to contact us."
He added: "Officers remain in the area today, with high-visibility patrols ongoing throughout Hardgate.
"I want to reassure local residents that we are doing all we can to trace the men responsible."
