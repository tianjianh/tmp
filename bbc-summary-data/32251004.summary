Dunblane ready for Andy Murray wedding to Kim Sears

Heart-shaped burgers, a crystal-encrusted garter, bunting and more - Dunblane is preparing itself ahead of the wedding of Kim Sears and Andy Murray in the town's cathedral on Saturday. Large numbers of Murray fans are expected to come to try and catch a glimpse of the bride and groom.

The town's High Street is decked out ready for the big day and many of the shops have turned their window displays over to wedding themes. Some visitors are stopping to take photos on their phones.
"I just hope it's a really lovely day for them on Saturday," says one woman.
"Dunblane's doing them really well," adds another.
One local butcher has even come up with some heart-shaped burgers to mark the day.
"We're going full blast on sausages and burgers and pies," says Graham Fleming, owner of Bennett's butchers in the town. He expects the day itself to be busy with catering for extra people in the area.
"It's really good for a town like Dunblane," he continues, "because we are a small town, but it does put us on the map and it does help to pull the community together."
Like any good wedding there is bound to be a lot of attention on what the bride will be wearing, and that is of great interest in another of the town's shops.
Lesley Ann Anderson of Point Nouveau Bridal shop is busy preparing for other weddings taking place in the town this week, trying to get as much as possible done ahead of time before the place gets really busy.
"I can't wait," she says of the Sears-Murray wedding. "I think it's every little girl's dream. It's a fabulous venue. The dress is the big issue at the moment."
A few weeks ago she sent Kim Sears a gift of a bespoke garter, encrusted in crystals and embroidered on the inside with the couple's initials, the date and the venue - Dunblane. A few days later she received a thank you note back.
"It was the most horrendous day in terms of what the weather was like," says Ms Anderson as she remembers Andy Murray visiting the town after his Wimbledon win.
"We were down here while the crowds built up, and by lunchtime you couldn't have put another person on this High Street. And this is their wedding now so we are expecting it to be an enormously busy day."
In another shop they have already made a stab at guessing what the couple will be wearing. At the Sue Ryder charity shop they have mocked up a window display of Kim Sears and Andy Murray in their wedding clothes - Andy's wearing a kilt.
"We've been very busy," says shop manager, Bernie Gallafent.
"Dunblane's been very busy the last couple of days as well. It's been absolutely fantastic. We've had newspapers in, we've had TV crews in, it's really very good for the charity as well."
At one end of the town stands the imposing Dunblane Cathedral, where Saturday's ceremony will take place.
On Thursday afternoon, a small huddle of photographers had already gathered amid rumours of a wedding rehearsal. Just opposite, with a bird's eye view of everything, is the town's museum.
"We've had people here already and they're talking about the times of the trains they're going to get from Edinburgh on Saturday," says Betty Cameron, a volunteer at the museum.
She says although some locals may feel the town will be too busy on Saturday, most are looking forward it.
People who have lived in the town for a long time know Andy and his family, she adds: "It's just like a local lad getting married. People have got smiles on their faces and they're talking about the wedding - that's a good thing."
