United took the lead on the night and in the tie when Henrikh Mkhitaryan drilled in a low finish in the 10th minute but Anderlecht equalised when Sofiane Hanni scored after 32 minutes.
United were minutes away from a penalty shootout before Rashford got the winning goal after 107 minutes with a brilliant turn and finish.
That means Mourinho's men won 3-2 overall across both legs of the quarter-final.
Winning the Europa League is very important for United and manager Jose Mourinho as it offers another route into the Champions League, European club football's biggest competition.
The other sides into the semi-finals are Ajax, Lyon and Celta Vigo with the draw taking place at midday on Friday.
