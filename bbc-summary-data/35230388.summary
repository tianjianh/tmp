Fifteen-year-old Pranav Dhanawade broke the previous record of 628 set by Arthur Collins in 1899 on Monday.
But he continued his innings in the HT Bhandari Cup inter-school tournament and reached 1,009 runs.
He smashed 59 sixes and 127 fours in 395 minutes before his KC Gandhi School declared the innings at 1,465 against Arya Gurukul School on Tuesday.

Mumbai school cricket is highly competitive and has produced cricketers like legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar and current Indian opener Rohit Sharma.
"I was not thinking of a record," Dhanawade told BBC Hindi."it was not in my mind at all but as soon as I got close to the feat it was clear to me that I could achieve it."
Dhanawade said his father, an auto-rickshaw driver, had pushed him to play and was partly responsible for his success. He said he was ready for international cricket, but intended to first play in the under-19 state team.
Dhanawade's innings propelled him to the top of the trends on Twitter in India, where reactions to his innings have ranged from praise to shock and disbelief.
