Michael McFeat, from Abernethy, was said to have been held after posting a picture of Kyrgyz co-workers queuing for a "chuchuk" horsemeat sausage.
The caption compared the dish to a stallion's genitalia, AFP reported.
The news agency said his co-workers were so upset that they called a strike at the Kumtor goldmine where he works.
Mr McFeat has deleted the post but put an apology on his Facebook page on Saturday:
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with the local authorities after a British national was detained in Kyrgyzstan and are ready to provide consular assistance."
It was reported that Mr McFeat faces up to five years in prison.
The Kumtor open pit mine is the largest gold mine in central Asia and its output accounts for more than one-third of the country's export of goods and services, according to its website.
It is operated by Canadian firm Centerra Gold, based in Toronto.
The company was unavailable for comment.
