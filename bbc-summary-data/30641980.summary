Aberystwyth University staff also made instruments from a computer printer and church organ pipes.
The electronic ensemble powered by computers and led by a robot conductor was also joined by four musicians.
The performance will broadcast on BBC Four on New Year's Eve at 20:00 GMT.
Dave Price, of the university's department of computer science, spent three days at the Royal Institution working on the production.
He said: "Our robotic instruments worked beautifully and didn't miss a beat during the rehearsals."
A drum bot, electronic keyboards, and robotic bass guitar were provided by other universities around the UK, while Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain, contributed a robotic theremin player.
