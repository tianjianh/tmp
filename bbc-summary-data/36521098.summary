The 23-year-old from Runcorn, who became an MBE last week, had finished runner-up in the past two years.
But four wins and a second place this year make her Britain's first champion in the event's 17-year history.
Sport climbing is hoping to be included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, with a decision expected on 3 August.
Rob Adie of the British Mountaineering Council, which supports and administrates the GB climbing team, said: "It's important we get competition climbing visible in the public eye as much as possible, which Shauna's win and MBE will help us greatly to do."
Bouldering is a form of climbing usually practised on small rocks and boulders.
