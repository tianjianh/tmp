The IOC announced mixed-gender events in athletics, swimming, table tennis and triathlon have been approved for Tokyo.
Stanford could link up with the Brownlee brothers for Team GB in Japan in three years.
"It's fantastic and something I am excited about," said Stanford.
The 29-year-old was fourth in the Rio Olympics individual event after finishing behind her house-mate Vicky Holland.
"The team relay has proved to be a very popular event with the athletes and spectators and audiences," said Stanford.
"The team element is not something we see a lot with triathlon very often, so to be able to compete genuinely as a team will be fantastic.
"It's another medal event for triathlon in the Olympics and the more medal events we can get the better."
In the meantime, she competes in the World Series event in Leeds on Sunday.
Stanford could be one of a number of Welsh sportswomen to benefit from changes to mixed gender events.
Double Olympic swimming silver medallist and Commonwealth Games champion Jazz Carlin could target the 1500m freestyle after previous 400m and 800m success.
Fellow swimmers Georgia Davies and Chloe Tutton might be contenders for the 4x100m medley mixed relay, while Olympic athlete Seren Bundy-Davies would be in line for a place on the track in the 4x400m mixed relay.
The introduction of the Madison in the cycling programme could benefit Olympic team pursuit champion Elinor Barker, while mixed team events in the judo could benefit 2014 Commonwealth Games champion Natalie Powell.
Tokyo will have five more sports than Rio, taking the total to 33, but the existing sports have been given 15 more events.
