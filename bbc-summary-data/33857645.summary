Wanderers forward Zach Clough's well-struck half-volley was pushed wide in the best chance of the first half.
After Dorian Dervite and Gary Madine wasted openings for the visitors, Powell slotted home after an excellent ball by Samir Carruthers.
Neil Lennon's side pressed but Clough and former England striker Emile Heskey both had efforts well saved.
Bolton have not won for nine games in a run that stretches from last season, and remain the only side yet to score in the Championship this season.
The Dons, who were promoted from League One last season, have won two of their opening three matches in their first season in the second tier.
Having failed to score in their opening three games, Bolton started brightly and full-back Dean Moxey, Dervite and Madine all went close.
The hosts improved after half-time and, after Ben Amos saved well from Carruthers's curling effort, midfielder Powell's goal secured the win.
MK Dons boss Karl Robinson:
"We started okay and we didn't concede many chances but territorially they had a lot of the play with set pieces and corners and they got into our box a lot.

"I said to them at half-time that they've got to believe in themselves because we looked like we don't belong here and they were wondering 'are we meant to be here?'
"I told them we've earned the right to be here, they've earned the right to come up against some wonderfully gifted players and they've earned the right to show everyone how talented they are.
Bolton manager Neil Lennon:
"It's been the story of our season so far - we're playing well and I feel that's a game that got away from us because we were in control for long periods and we've missed big chances.
"It's frustrating and disappointing but it's encouraging because to a degree we're playing really well but we need someone who putts, to use a golf analogy.
"We look a decent side but we're just lacking that composure in front of goal whether it be the finish or whether it's the final pass and that's the most important facet of the game."
