West Mercia Police questioned a 37-year-old man and a woman, aged 27, about suspected cruelty to foxes.
The hunt's kennels in Wormelow, near Hereford, have been closed and all horses and hounds moved elsewhere.
A message on the hunt's Facebook page says salaried staff have been suspended and an internal inquiry will begin.
