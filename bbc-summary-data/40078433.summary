[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP leader Paul Nuttall has said he would be willing to execute those who kill children or British soldiers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He supports capital punishment and says his party would be willing to offer a referendum on its reintroduction.
Asked by the Mail on Sunday if he was prepared to act as executioner, Mr Nuttall replied: "Yes."
The last executions in the UK were by hanging and took place in 1964. UKIP's manifesto does not include a call for the return of the death penalty.
Mr Nuttall told the paper: "I would like to see the death penalty for terrorists and child killers.
"'For people who kill a (British) soldier and harm children, I would not have a problem doing it. I believe in capital punishment for treason. Opinion polls show the vast majority of people agree with me."
