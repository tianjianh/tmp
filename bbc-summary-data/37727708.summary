The dog was put down with the consent of its owner - the children's aunt - who has been named in reports as 31-year-old Clare Ferdinand, a serving Essex Police officer.
Police are not treating the attack as a criminal investigation.
During a brief hearing, coroner's officer David Dinnell said: "Archie Darby was a four-month-old baby being held in his mother's arms when he was taken out of her arms by the family dog and attacked."
The inquest heard an ambulance was called and CPR was attempted but Archie was pronounced dead at the scene at 16:02 BST.
Senior Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said: "Please let condolences be expressed to Archie's family at this very dreadful time for them."
A full hearing will take place in December.
