Hosts Ireland will be in action along with France, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Wales, Scotland and Austria.
Hockey Ireland said on Wednesday that the event, Ireland's first since the Olympic Games, will be played in Ulster on 11-19 March.
"Our team will be playing in front of a home crowd, giving them an extra edge," said Hockey Ireland CEO Rob Johnson.
He added: "It also gives an opportunity for the fans to see the Rio team in action on home turf and will be a great opportunity for the Hockey community to get together."
Round 2 will be played over three men's and three women's events, with eight teams assigned to each destination.
Ireland women's team will compete at the first event in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from 14-22 January.
They will be joined by Italy, hosts Malaysia, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Singapore, Fiji and Wales in aiming for qualification for the Hockey World League semi-finals and a shot at progressing to the 2018 Hockey World Cup.
