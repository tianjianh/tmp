A woman who was given the power of attorney for her mother abused it by racking up bills of about £12,000 on shopping and eating out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carolyn Jamieson's 10-month spending spree came to an end when police were called to investigate a failure to pay her mother's nursing home fees.
The 60-year-old admitted embezzling £12,000 at Dumfries Sheriff Court.
She was made the subject of a community payback order, with a condition she carry out 120 hours of unpaid work.
The court was told that Jamieson, of Dumfries, committed the offence at the town's Goldielea Care Home, and elsewhere, between April 2013 and February last year.
Solicitor Matthew Pumphrey said there was no suggestion that Jamieson's mother, who has since died, was left short of anything that might be needed and the nursing home fees were now being repaid.
