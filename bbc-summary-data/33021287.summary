Learning disability unit temporarily closed after 'serious incidents'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inpatient unit for people with learning disabilities has closed temporarily after "a number of serious incidents" at the facility.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said closing the unit at Long Leys Court in Lincoln was "in the best interests" of patients.
It has notified police of two incidents involving patient safety and care.
Patients have either been discharged or transferred to other services. The unit provided care for up to 16 people.
The trust, alongside the South West Lincolnshire Clinical Commissioning Group, took the decision to close the unit due to concerns surrounding the quality of care being provided.
In a statement, it said: "Both the trust and commissioners share the view that this temporary closure is in the best interests of people with a learning disability, who often have complex needs and for whom we have a duty to ensure that the care they receive is of the highest quality.
"There have been a number of serious incidents at the unit recently which have highlighted concerns.
"Despite intensive action... [we] do not feel that the unit can currently provide sufficiently high quality care for patients."
John Brewin, chief executive of the trust, Dr said: "There have been three serious incidents in the past couple of months - two of which we've felt necessary to refer to the police."
He said the incidents were to do with standards of care and patient safety.
Asked whether any patients had come to any harm, or staff had been disciplined, he said due to police involvement he was unable to give any further details.
Lincolnshire Police said it was aware of a number of separate incidents at the unit.
The force is considering whether there is any evidence of criminal activity.
