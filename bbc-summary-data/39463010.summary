[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol City moved four points clear of the Championship relegation zone by beating Wolves, whose five-match winning run was ended at Ashton Gate.

Aden Flint headed against the bar for the hosts before Jamie Paterson curled in their opener from 18 yards.
Tammy Abraham's coolly taken penalty made it 2-0 after Matt Doherty had brought down Mark Little in the box.
Abraham's second from close range sealed the win, with Jon Dadi Bodvarsson getting Wolves' consolation.
The Iceland striker scored his first goal since 20 August, but it came too late for Wanderers to mount a serious comeback.
City had started Saturday's game just one point above Blackburn, but their win and Rovers' home defeat by Barnsley established a valuable cushion over the bottom three with five matches left to play.
Two successive wins before the international break appeared to have eased some of the pressure on City, but away losses at Brentford and Preston - the latter a 5-0 defeat on Tuesday - put Lee Johnson's side back in trouble.
However, they capitalised on a poor Wolves performance, which was massively below par compared with those that earned boss Paul Lambert the Championship manager of the month award for March.
Wanderers, who gave a first start to teenager Morgan Gibbs-White, struggled for creativity without injured record signing Helder Costa and winger Ivan Cavaleiro, who came off the bench to replace the 17-year-old shortly after City's third goal.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "After conceding five at Preston, I needed to pick players I could trust today and the reaction was just as I had hoped.
"We had energy about us and did the basics well.
"The job is far from done, but I have never doubted our ability to stay in the Championship."
Wolves boss Paul Lambert: "We fell below the high standards we have set and when that happens in the Championship you get beaten.
"I am not going to have a go at the players because they have been brilliant in recent games.
"All good things come to an end, but we are certainly not going to pretend our season is over."
