In pictures: Top 10 GB medal moments so far

A week into the Rio Olympics and there have been many memorable moments so far for Team GB. Here are 10 of them.

Flying through the air and into British sporting history, 25-year-old Bryony Page took silver in trampoline - the first medal of any colour in the sport for Team GB at Olympic level. She later revealed she had overcome the trampolining equivalent of the "yips" when she developed a fear of somersaulting earlier in her career.
Hearts were in mouths across Britain when Mo Farah fell with 16 laps to go in the 10,000m. But he recovered and eventually powered to victory, retaining his Olympic crown and becoming the first British track and field athlete to win three Olympic gold medals. Next target - a second gold and second title retention in the 5,000m.
Making a gruelling event look remarkably easy, the GB women's team pursuit riders - Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell-Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald - charged to victory against the US, knocking two seconds off their own world record. The win also made Trott a record breaker in her own right, as the first British woman to win three Olympic golds.
The women's team pursuit gold matched the earlier achievement of Team GB's men. Ed Clancy, Owain Doull, Steven Burke and Sir Bradley Wiggins were behind at the halfway mark, but reeled Australia in and eventually won by almost a second. Sir Brad also made individual history, becoming Britain's most decorated Olympian with five golds, one silver and two bronzes.
Undaunted by the green water they were plunging into, Jack Laugher and Chris Mears won the synchronised 3m springboard - GB's first ever Olympic diving gold - ending China's dominance of the sport. There were tears afterwards as the achievement sank in, even more so because back in 2009 Mears was given just a 5% chance of surviving serious illness.
Baby-faced but brilliant, Adam Peaty, 21, won GB's first gold of the Games in the 100m breastroke, finishing more than a second ahead of his nearest rival and breaking his own world record. Not bad for someone who was afraid of water as a child. His victory also thrust his grandmother Mavis Williams into the limelight, as she became "Olympic Nan" on social media after her tweets of support.
From kayaking trips with the scouts to Olympic gold, Joe Clarke declared himself "gobsmacked" to win the kayak slalom. Viewed as an outside bet for a medal ahead of the Games, he qualified third fastest for the final, but pulled a superb run out of the bag when it mattered, finishing ahead of Slovenia's Peter Kauzer.
Team GB had to wait 108 years to win a medal in the men's all-around gymnastics competition, but thanks to Max Whitlock they now have bronze. Disappointed to miss out on the podium in the team event, Whitlock came back fighting and was delighted to finish in third place behind Japan's Kohei Uchimura and Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev.
She might have missed out on gold this time, but Katherine Grainger's silver alongside teammate Victoria Thornley in the double sculls was an astounding achievement at the age of 40 and after taking a two-year break from the sport. Grainger is now the most decorated female British Olympian, with four silvers and a gold to her name.
And finally, GB might have been convincingly beaten in the end, but a silver in the men's rugby sevens was still an incredibly proud moment for the team. The victors, Fiji, had been top seeds and were on devastating form in the final. Fiji's gold was the nation's first ever Olympic medal, and their joy at winning made for much vicarious pleasure, especially as they were coached by a Briton, Ben Ryan.
