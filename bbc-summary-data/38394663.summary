Three men found guilty of murdering a man in broad daylight in Cardiff have been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lynford Brewster, 29, died from stab wounds in the Llanedeyrn area of the city on 12 June.
Jake Whelan, 24, from Cardiff, Robert Lainsbury, 23, of Worcester, and Dwayne Edgar, 29, from Llanedeyrn, laughed as they were handed life sentences at Cardiff Crown Court on Wednesday.
The judge called the murder a "callous, cold-blooded killing".
The court heard drugs boss Whelan plotted to kill father-to-be Mr Brewster after "an altercation".
He drove to the Midlands to collect Lainsbury and brought him back to south Wales where they met Edgar.
Armed with knives, including a large combat knife, they went to look for Mr Brewster before stabbing him in the back and once in each leg.
The court heard the three men then ran off and tried to escape by throwing their phones away.
As he was jailed, Lainsbury told the judge "Merry Christmas to you too", before spitting at a police officer as he was taken to cells.
Whelan was jailed for at least 32 years, Lainsbury 30 years and Edgar 28 years.
A family tribute said: "Today would have been Lynford's 30th birthday.
"Lynford was a loving son, partner, brother and would have been a doting father to his unborn daughter.
"He is missed everyday by each and every one of us."
Senior investigating officer, Det Insp Mark O'Shea of South Wales Police, described the attack as "brutal and cowardly".
