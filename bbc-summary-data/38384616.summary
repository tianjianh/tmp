The funeral of a worker killed when a building collapsed at Didcot A Power Station in February has taken place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Huxtable, 34, of Swansea, was one of four men killed during a partial collapse at the decommissioned plant.
His body was recovered almost seven months later in September.
About 200 mourners gathered at Swansea Crematorium where his coffin, bearing a Swansea City badge, was driven on a flatbed truck by his former colleagues.
Thames Valley Police and the Health and Safety Executive are still investigating the incident.
