Latham Schofield was one of four people in a silver Renault Megane travelling along Plodder Lane in Bolton in the early hours of Thursday.
He suffered fatal injuries and died at the scene.
His family said he was "cheeky and silly sometimes but that made us all love him even more".
Another 17-year-old boy was taken to hospital and remains in a serious but stable condition, police said.
The 18-year-old from Bolton was also charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop at and report the collision, using a motor vehicle without a licence and insurance and using a vehicle with no test certificate.
He is due to appear at Bolton Crown Court on 11 March.
A 19-year-old man who was also arrested has been released without charge.
