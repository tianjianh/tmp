That shortlist will be announced on the BBC Sport website on Friday, 27 November and the public will be able to vote online for their winner from then until midday on Friday, 11 December.
The winner of this year's prestigious award will be revealed before BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2015, which will come live from Belfast's SSE Arena on Sunday, 20 December.
Last year, Real Madrid and Portugal footballer Cristiano Ronaldo won the award for the second time, beating tennis player Serena Williams, boxer Floyd Mayweather and MotoGP rider Marc Marquez.
The award recognises the overseas athlete who has made the most substantial contribution to sport. More information about this year's award can be found here.
