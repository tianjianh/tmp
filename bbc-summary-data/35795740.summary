Hamilton Accies manager Martin Canning conceded that the 1-0 win over Inverness CT was a "huge result" in their fight to stay in the Premiership.

Victory moved Accies five points clear of Kilmarnock who occupy 11th place with just eight games remaining.
"Today we've got three points which is a huge three points," said Canning.
"When you start looking to see how many points ahead you are, you start taking your eye off the most important thing which is the 90-minute performance."
It was Hamilton's first win in their last five league games and was timely with Kilmarnock losing against Aberdeen.
"We're fully focused on trying to win as many games as possible and whatever will be will be," continued Canning.
"At this stage of the season it's about points and performances kind of go out of the window.
"Inverness obviously put us under a lot of pressure. Defensively I thought we were reasonably solid. We changed the shape and went to five at the back to give us the extra man there.
"I don't think Michael McGovern has had many saves to make albeit we've been put under a lot of pressure, which means the guys in front of him have been doing their job."
Inverness CT manager John Hughes admitted a top-six finish may be beyond his side with them now five points adrift of sixth place.
Hughes told BBC Scotland: "We need to get back winning games.
"I trust these boys. We've had some strong characters missing.
"The same guys are going back to the well all the time. We need two or three back to take the weight off them."
Hughes felt his side were second best initially but came into the game strongly as time wore on with luck eluding his side when it counted.
He said: "I felt Hamilton maybe shaded it in the first 20 minutes. We had good strikes but you need to work the goalkeeper. Over the bar doesn't score you a goal.
"Second half it was all Inverness and they break on us and the ball ends up in the bottom corner in off the post.
"That's where were at right at this moment in time - us not getting the rub of the green."
