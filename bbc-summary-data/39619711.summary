Molinari stormed into contention with two eagles in the last seven holes to set a clubhouse target of nine under par, which Dunne was able to match thanks to a birdie on the last.
The players then returned to the 18th hole for a sudden death play-off.
A scrappy par proved to be enough for Molinari to secure the title.
Dunne, who had enjoyed a two-shot lead going into the final round, found trouble off the tee and failed to get up and down from a greenside bunker.
The 24-year-old's second place finish was his best ever on the European Tour however.
"I felt like there were just so many shots that slipped away from me. It's just one of those days," said Dunne.
"I felt like I was really close to shooting four or five under and stuck with one under in the end. I'm happy with my form and looking forward to next week.
"I'm just a bit disappointed not to come out with the result we wanted but it's a step in the right direction."
For the Italian, it was his first European Tour success since 2010.
