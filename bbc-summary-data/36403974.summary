Defender Doe, 27, made 266 appearances for Daggers, scoring 11 goals, before leaving the club last summer.
Midfielder Howell, 29, returns to the club after playing 37 times for Boreham Wood during the 2015-16 season.
"For whatever reason they left a year ago, but have made every effort to reunite with this football club," boss John Still told the club website.
Dagenham & Redbridge and Boreham Wood will face each other in the National League next season after the former finished next to bottom in League Two, having won only eight of their 46 games.
