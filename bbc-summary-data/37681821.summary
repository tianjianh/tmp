The BBC said the radio show would "explore of what cars symbolise to women today, including freedom, power, refuge, novelty and familiarity".
The four-part series, which will feature a different guest every week, begins on 30 November.
Dawn French, Olivia Colman, Sarah Millican and Germaine Greer will be among the interviewees.
Coren Mitchell said: "I'm really looking forward to sitting down with some of the greatest women in modern British culture and talking about the pros and cons of the five-speed manual gearbox."
Cars will be used "as a vehicle to share memories and take a comic look at life, love, sex, work, childhood, adulthood and adventure", the BBC said.
The episodes will be recorded in front of a live audience at the BBC's Radio Theatre in London.
Members of the public will be invited to take part in the programme and share their own memories, such as driving to a first job, doing the school run or picnic trips in a campervan.
French, who will appear on the first episode, said: "It will be great to get together with Victoria for a good old girly natter about the torque stats on the BMW Luxus 850."
BBC Radio 4 comedy commissioning editor Sioned William said of Coren Mitchell: "She's brainy, witty and - I'm reliably informed - can change a tyre in under five minutes."
