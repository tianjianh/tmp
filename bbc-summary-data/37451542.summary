The 25-year-old, who helped his country win gold at the Olympic Games last month, signed a "multi-year" contract with Sarries in January.
"We are naturally disappointed Save has decided not to take up the offer," director of rugby Mark McCall said.
"We felt he would have been a great addition, but we respect his decision."
