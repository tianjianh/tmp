Indians celebrate Maggi verdict

Indians have reacted with joy to a court verdict that said a ban on popular Maggi noodles was "untenable".

#Maggi became the top trending tag on Twitter, with most celebrating the verdict.
The Bombay High Court called the ban by food safety authorities "arbitrary" and said it violated the "principles of natural justice".
Nestle will not be able to sell Maggi until fresh tests ordered by the court clear the popular snack.
The six week rider has however been mostly lost on what is clearly a Maggi craving public.
Some drew ironic comparisons to another popular hashtag "taste of freedom" relating to India's Independence Day which falls on 15 August.
Maggi is one of the most popular snacks in India, and ban and food safety concerns notwithstanding, many hoarded away packets to tide them over the ban.
"The young and old ones in my home can't go without Maggi. So, I got about 30 packs before it went out of stores. Turns out, there are still six of them left", Gargee Borah, a  30-year-old professional from Assam told the BBC.
Facebook shout outs where people have pleaded for Maggi from others who have hoarded packets have also been a common sight since June, when the ban was enforced.
"Cravings happen. All the time. Especially when at the middle of the day (or night), the wind carries the whiff of some selfish neighbour's meal menu", Mala Magotra complained.
"One such day, I pleaded to anyone who was ready to listen - "do you have Maggi? And are you ready to share?" Several replied "I do". Only one offered to send me some. But never did."
Food writer Sourish Bhattacharyya explained India's enduring relationship with its favourite noodles saying, "When Maggi instant noodles arrived in India in 1983 - the year when India lifted the cricket World Cup for the first time - they instantly caught the nation's imagination."
"When the brand launched the Me and Meri Maggi campaign (Me and My Maggi campaign) in its silver jubilee year in 2008, inviting people to send in their personal Maggi stories, its advertising agency Publicis Capital was deluged with more than 30,000 entries."
The High Court order is by no means a complete reprieve for Nestle and Maggi, and even in a best case scenario Indians will have to wait six weeks, assuming the fresh tests declare Maggi safe for human consumption.
