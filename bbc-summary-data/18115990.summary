Manchester City 'best value for money' for fans

Manchester City have won the Premier League title and are also top of the league of value for fans, according to the ING Direct Value table.

The bank chart compares club season ticket costs with Premier League performance and entertainment value and getting the most points for your pound.
ING places QPR, who just avoided relegation, at the bottom of the table.
Wigan, who had a great escape from relegation, are second best value, and West Bromwich Albion third.
Second bottom were Liverpool, whose eighth-place finish in the top flight, Carling Cup triumph and FA Cup final place were not enough to counteract a high season ticket cost and poor scoring record.
And Wolves found themselves in both the official and value relegation zones.
The value league was compiled by comparing season ticket prices with points earned, and with a bonus for goals scored, deemed to affect fans' enjoyment of the game.
Just under half of fans felt they received good value for money in the 2011-12 season just ended, and as a result are seriously thinking about whether or not to renew their season ticket for the next campaign.
However it seems that clubs are listening to their concerns, with more than half of Premiership teams (12 of the 20) freezing or lowering their season ticket prices this year in an attempt to retain fans.
Relegated Blackburn Rovers have the most disgruntled fans - many of whom have staged protests in the past season against Indian owners Venky's and manager Steve Kean - with more than half of ticket holders (56%) saying they will not renew.
Aston Villa, who just dodged relegation and recently sacked manager Alex McLeish, had a third of fans (31%) saying they planned to cancel their tickets.
Two-thirds of supporters (67%) also say that a wage cap for Premier League footballers would be a positive move.
Arsenal captain Robin Van Persie topped the "best value player" poll, followed by Newcastle United striker Demba Ba and Tottenham's Scott Parker.
The report's compilation was overseen by Dr Steve Kelly from the University of Huddersfield, an expert in sports and club finance and structures.
