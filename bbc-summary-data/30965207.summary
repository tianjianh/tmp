A hydrant created a "geyser" on a city centre street when it was switched on overnight.

The tall column of water on Navigation Street, Birmingham, could be seen for several hours on Saturday morning.
A Severn Trent Water spokesman said the firm believed the hydrant, intended for emergency service use, had been tampered with.
It urged the public not to interfere with the devices, which can pose a safety hazard when used incorrectly.
A team of engineers arrived at the scene at 08:00 GMT to switch the hydrant off. There were no supply issues to nearby properties, the firm said.
The spectacle caused amusement on social media, with several users joking about the city's "new water feature".
While Craig Hamilton tweeted about "a big geezer causing trouble in central Brum in the early hours".
