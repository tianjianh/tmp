Lewis Hamilton: Nico Rosberg says debate over rival's tactics is 'pointless'

Formula 1 world champion Nico Rosberg has said the debate around Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton's tactics in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is "pointless".

Hamilton ignored team orders and drove deliberately slowly in an attempt to back Rosberg into rivals.
Mercedes could take action against Hamilton, but Rosberg said he "understood" the Briton's tactics.
"It's done, it's a thing of the past and it's fine," said the German, 31.
Hamilton, 31, went into the race 12 points behind Rosberg and needed to win - with the German finishing lower than third - to take the title.
Mercedes repeatedly ordered Hamilton to speed up during the race, but he ignored their commands and told his team to "let us race". Rosberg still finished second to secure his first F1 world title.
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Rosberg refused to be drawn on the subject, saying he "respected" Hamilton because they were "really good friends back in the day".
