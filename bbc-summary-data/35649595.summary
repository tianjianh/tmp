The 25-year-old missed the 1-0 loss at St Andrew's that left Wanderers seven points from safety.
"It's an internal matter. He's let himself and the club down," Lennon told BBC Radio Manchester.
"No player is bigger than the club and there are certain parameters and principles that you set."
Madine, a former Carlisle trainee, joined Bolton last summer on a two-year deal following his release by Sheffield Wednesday after loan spells at Coventry and Blackpool last season.
"He could come back into our thinking for the weekend," Lennon added.
Meanwhile, goalkeeper Ben Amos is expected to be out for up to six weeks with an ankle injury.
