The mystery of the missing airman
The photograph, uploaded on Thursday, shows Miss Oliver sitting on the end of a bed, cradling her baby bump.
She is holding a pair of baby boots, similar in style to the ones Mr Mckeague was wearing on the night he went missing.
The personal trainer had met Mr Mckeague via a dating site five months before he went missing on 24 September.
She is due to give birth in late spring or early summer.
On Facebook, she wrote: "I can't help but be truly unconditionally in love with my baby and your [sic] not here yet.
"You bring so much pain yet just as much joy."
Mr Mckeague was last seen in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.
Search teams are in their tenth week of trawling the landfill site at Milton, Cambridgeshire.
I struggle with finding the right words because Sometimes when you have to be strong and [put] on a brave face you forget about the precious moments that pass by.
Yesterday was an emotional but exciting day, and sometimes it only takes one person to help you see what you have.
I miss and love Corrie with every part of my body and little things set off different emotions.
I can't help but be truly unconditionally in love with my baby and your [sic] not here yet.
You bring so much pain yet just as much joy and Your daddy would be proud of you my little one and would love you as much as I do.
Corrie will be a part of both of us forever and no one can take that away
Mummy loves you little baby
