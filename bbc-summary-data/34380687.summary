The monarch, who is Colonel-in-Chief of the unit, travelled by helicopter from Balmoral, Aberdeenshire, to the former RAF base at Leuchars station.
She was met by Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Cattermole and the regiment's pipes and drums.
The Queen toured a hangar speaking to soldiers about the work of the unit, which went to Afghanistan in 2014.
The monarch, wearing a pastel pink jacket and hat, also inspected the regimental drum horse Talavera before meeting the families of soldiers and attending a private lunch with officers.
Lt Col Cattermole said: "It was an honour to be visited by our Colonel-in-Chief in our new home, Leuchars station.
"Her Majesty took great interest in the work the regiment is doing both here in the UK, supporting UK resilience, and overseas on numerous training missions."
The Army took control of the site in April and soldiers have gradually been moving there from their base in Fallingbostel.
The new base will be fully manned by next summer when the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards return from operational training in Canada.
It is the first time the regiment has been based in Scotland for more than 40 years.
Military personnel and their families based there will number about 1,800, with soldiers also coming from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) and the Royal Military Police.
Col Cattermole added: "Change is never easy but the one thing that has remained constant is the support given to us by the local community in Fife.
"The regiment now looks forward to contributing to community life in Scotland while continuing to support operations around the globe in our new light reconnaissance role."
