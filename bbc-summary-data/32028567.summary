Attahullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Wardak, said the attackers targeted three passing vehicles, including a bus.
No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attack south-west of the capital Kabul, which happened after midnight.
Taliban militants are believed to be active in many parts of the province.
Foreign troops ended their combat role in Afghanistan in December but some have remained in the country to support the Afghan military who are battling a bloody Taliban insurgency.
There are also fears that the influence of Islamic State could be growing in Afghanistan.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is currently visiting the US, where he is expected to urge for more funding for Afghan forces.
Mr Ghani is due to meet US President Barack Obama later on Tuesday.
