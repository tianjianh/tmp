Team Brewster beat the Olympic silver medallists skipped by David Murdoch 7-2 9-5 at Perth's Dewars Centre on Sunday to clinch the men's spot.
Playing third for Brewster is Glen Muirhead, brother of winning skip Eve.
Her rink claimed the women's place with three wins in a best-of-five tournament decider against Hannah Fleming's team.
"I thought it would go to three finals," said Brewster, who will be competing in his first European Championships at the event from 19-26 November.
"Dave's team were throwing the stones really well but we got off to a great start and a three in the third end gave us the lead and we managed to keep it.
"It hasn't really sunk in yet and it will be great to compete in a home event. We have trained really hard, the ice has been good this week and the guys have played great. Now we need to do more of the same at Braehead."
For Eve Muirhead, there is the excitement of playing in a European Championships in her home country.
"I think that makes a massive difference," she said.
"To get the chance to represent your country in your country is something quite special.
"Any team that's there has earned the right to be there so it will be tough as usual and I guess you've got to go there on form. Our new coach Glenn Howard's going to be there with us and he's brought a lot to this team so far."
Meanwhile, Glen Muirhead's long-term girlfriend Anna Sloan, who plays third for Team Muirhead, makes her return from injury this week.
Glen said: "It's going to be exciting for us both. We're going to be motivated to push each other on and likewise with my sister.
"It's just that extra little couple of per cent and, home soil at Braehead, so there's even more to look forward to. I'm excited and it should be fun."
