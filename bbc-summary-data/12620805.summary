Daily Politics and Sunday Politics highlights of 2015

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Daily and Sunday Politics are on-air six days a week for much of the year reporting the political news from Westminster and beyond.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Here are some of the clips from our interviews hosted by Andrew Neil and Jo Coburn, with films from our reporting team.
Follow us on twitter or 'like' us on  Facebook where we look forward to your comments and you can hear more news about upcoming guests and films.
When Parliament is sitting, the Daily Politics is on BBC2 from 1200-1300 on weekdays, with an 1130 start on Wednesdays for PMQs, and the Sunday Politics is on BBC1 from 1100-1215, occasionally moving for live sport and news events.
Both have a repeat on BBC Parliament at midnight, and are on BBC iPlayer for 30 days.
