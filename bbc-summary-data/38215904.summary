Coulson, who will miss the rest of the current season with an ankle ligament injury, made 12 appearances for the U's in all competitions this term.
The 27-year-old has played a total of 269 games for the club, having made his debut in December 2008.
"I want to thank everyone at the club for looking after me at this tough time," he said.
"I can now concentrate on getting my ankle right and returning to fitness as soon as possible to repay their loyalty."
