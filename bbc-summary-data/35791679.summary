Leyton Orient moved into the play-off places as Ryan Edwards' own goal gave them victory against 10-man Morecambe.

The Shrimps had goalkeeper Barry Roche sent off early on for bringing down Orient striker Jay Simpson in the area.
Replacement keeper Kieran O'Hara, only 19 years old, kept out Simpson's effort from the spot with an outstretched leg.
But the teenager was powerless when Alan Goodall hit a clearance against Edwards and the ball rebounded into the net to give Orient the points.

Leyton Orient player-manager Kevin Nolan told BBC Radio London: "We've done it without really playing well, and I think that was due to a lot of unnecessary things that happened in the game.
"We can't finish teams off and that's what we've got to learn to do. We're working hard on the training ground with lots of crossing and finishing.
"Hopefully in the coming weeks we'll start seeing that ball hit the back of the net a few more times."
