The England Under-18 international has been a regular for the Wolves Under-23 side and has also been part of the first-team squad during pre-season.
Ennis, 18, is likely to make his first Shrewsbury appearance in a pre-season friendly against Burton on Saturday.
Meanwhile, young goalkeeper Callum Burton has joined Championship side Hull City for an undisclosed fee.

Shrewsbury boss Paul Hurst has now made 11 close-season signings, five of them loan players, while 13 players (including last season's six loan men) have now left the League One club.
Goalkeepers: Craig MacGillivray (Walsall), Dean Henderson (Manchester United - loan)
Defenders: Zak Jules (Reading), James Bolton (Gateshead)
Midfield: Jon Nolan (Chesterfield), Ebou Adams (Norwich City - loan), Daniel James (Swansea City - loan)
