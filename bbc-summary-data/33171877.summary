[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More needs to be done to prevent vulnerable pupils being excluded from school, an education watchdog has said.

Estyn called on local authorities, schools and pupil referral units (PRUs) to work together to prevent children leaving full-time education.
Its report highlighted inconsistent provisions at PRUs.
Estyn's new chief inspector, Meilyr Rowlands, said "effective strategies" were needed.
He said: "Although we have seen good practice in PRUs, all stakeholders still need to do more to make sure there are effective strategies in place to help vulnerable pupils both in and outside school settings."
The report, Education Other Than At School, also encouraged "prompt intervention" with disengaged pupils and said some PRU staff felt "isolated and unsupported".
The report highlighted good practice in Ceredigion where there have been no permanent exclusions in schools for six years.
