The hosts took the lead when Gwion Edwards headed home Luke Rooney's cross at the back post.
Akinfenwa headed in a Barcham cross after the break to level the scores.
Barcham, who earlier forced a fine save from Freddie Woodman, won it with another header after George Francomb's shot was blocked.
AFC Wimbledeon boss Neal Ardley told BBC London 94.9:
"I wanted to see whether we could recreate the Plymouth game in the first half.

"I needed to find out whether they could recreate that because that's how I imagined it and we didn't, we clearly didn't.
"Straight away I had a brave decision to make. It was a simple one to change it around and unfortunately Tom (Elliott) was the one that made way, it could have been anyone at that point.
"There is no point having a player like Bayo Akinfenwa and not playing to his strengths when the time is right."
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Sussex:
"I thought we dominated the first half and were excellent and they dominated us second half and a couple of mistakes and a couple of bad goals we conceded.

"We are obviously not pleased, we're frustrated and we wanted to make this place a fortress starting today. We have a chance to make it right on Tuesday night.
"I'm just disappointed for the players and the staff and the supporters."
