Newspaper review: Electoral pacts, fur coats and Rory's high security nuptials

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Only DUP can win South Belfast for unionism" - Arlene Foster's words dominate the Belfast Telegraph's front page.

In an article written by the party leader, she indicates the UUP should give the DUP a "clear run" in South Belfast in the upcoming general electon.
Mrs Foster also reveals that the DUP would not stand in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, giving the UUP a chance to hold the seat.
However, commentator Alex Kane has a word of warning for anybody thinking of entering into an electoral pact in the News Letter.
"Unionist pacts rarely work," the writer says.
He goes on to say that they tend to be an "often knee-jerk reaction" to a perceived or actual political/electoral set back. He says they show "little evidence of progress, alternative or lessons learned".
Pacts are the theme of the day with The Irish News reporting on a "pro-Remain" pact.
The paper says that talks over an "electoral pact between pro-Remain parties" are set to intensify at Stormont.
Sinn FÃ©in said last week that it was interested in forming a "progressive alliance" to fight against a hard Brexit. However, it seems the Alliance Party may be unwilling to enter into such an agreement.
Writing in the Irish News, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood urges Alliance to form a pact to "ensure that the pro-Remain majority of Northern Ireland is reflected in the election".
Alliance's Stephen Farry has said "pacts don't work" and that they are "anti-democratic".
Both The Irish News and The News Letter report on the condemnation of the bomb intended to kill police officers left outside a Belfast primary school.
The "sizeable" device was left at the gate of Holy Cross Primary School in Ardoyne on Sunday.
John McWilliams, who was moved out of his house said, "I grew up with all this and we don't want it now. People want to live peacefully".
The News Letter reports that the DUP's Gregory Campbell has declared it is "Time to get tough on these cowards".
It's a "Final Muster for Korean veterans," on the front page of The News Letter. It shows Korean veteran William McConnell at a ceremony to remember fallen colleagues from the 1950-1953 wer.
Many of the surviving veterans are in declining health.
It seems security was tight at the wedding of the year in Ashford Castle at the weekend.
County Down golfer Rory McIlroy married his American fiancÃ©e Erica Stoll at the County Mayo venue.
However, the hoards of press and locals who gathered outside the castle hoping for a glimpse of the big day, were left less than satisfied.
The Irish News includes a picture of the happy couple in Cong before the wedding and the Belfast Telegraph has captured his proud parents and Irish golfer Padraig Harrington leaving the venue looking in high spirits.
When you think about Ballynahinch, your mind, might, for obvious reasons not go to native Americans.
However the News Letter reports that a group from a native American church is coming to the town to "bring a message of hope back to Northern Ireland".
It reports that they will be coming to a church in Ballynahinch this week to "share the story of how their new faith is bringing hope and healing to their community".
Finally, all the papers report on the sale of a fur worn by a stewardess on the Titanic who was saved from the doomed ship.
The coat, worn by Mabel Bennett  has been sold for Â£150,000 at auction on Saturday, almost twice the estimate.
She was rescued by a lifeboat as the liner went down after hitting an iceberg on her maiden voyage on April 14 1912.
