A knife, "bloodstained goggles" and "make-up stained masks" were among the items produced at Bristol Crown Court.
The 16-year-old's dismembered body was discovered in a shed at an address in Bristol in March.
Becky's stepbrother Nathan Matthews and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare deny murdering her.
Crime scene investigator Lucy Pinkard confirmed pliers with apparent blood stains, a screwdriver and handcuffs were also recovered.
Becky's aunt, Sarah Broom, left the public gallery as the jury were shown a bloodstained green jumper which had been cut along the back.
An all-in-one garment with "apparent blood staining" was also shown to the court. Jurors had previously been told Becky was probably wearing the "onesie" and the jumper when she died.
Ms Pinkard said bloodstained safety goggles, a kitchen knife, scissors, two screwdrivers, masks, handcuffs, pliers and a shower curtain were found in a small rucksack discovered in the shed at 9 Barton Court in the Barton Hill area of the city on 3 March.
The finds also included a broken beaded bracelet and white bedding with blood stains and scorch marks which were wrapped in three layers of cling film and a black bin bag inside a suitcase, the court learned.
The jury also heard from a police officer who examined a polka dot suitcase found in the shed which contained a circular saw alongside an empty bleach bottle, limescale remover, pan scourers, two T-shirts and a pair of jeans
Earlier, the jury was shown suitcases, a blue plastic box and a bin liner, in which Becky's body parts were found.
PC Jeremy Gale told the court a stun gun, which is a prohibited weapon, was found at Ms Hoare's house in Cotton Mill lane.
The court heard if it had been used for a split second it would have had a disorientating effect, and if used for longer the victim would have lost control of their muscles.
Mr Matthews, 28, of Hazelbury Drive, South Gloucestershire, admits killing his stepsister but denies murder and conspiring to kidnap her.
He also admits perverting the course of justice, preventing Becky's burial and possessing a prohibited weapon.
Miss Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, denies murder and conspiracy to kidnap, the weapons charge, perverting the course of justice and preventing a burial.
Two other men, Donovan Demetrius, 29, and James Ireland, 23, deny assisting an offender.
The trial continues.
