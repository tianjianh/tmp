Liverpool centre-back Dejan Lovren has been left out of Croatia's provisional 27-man squad for Euro 2016 after falling out with coach Ante Cacic.

The row started during a friendly in March when the 26-year-old was an unused substitute before he reportedly sought guarantees he would start games.
"I haven't closed the door on Lovren for good," said Cacic, who took over for Croatia's final two qualifiers.
"He can return one day if he realises that he has to be a team player."
He added: "When it dawns on him that he can't look down on his team-mates, the staff and the coach, he will perhaps find a way to get back in."
Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric and Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic have been included by Cacic for the tournament in France, which starts on 10 June.
"These are the best players we have at our disposal," said Cacic, who must submit his final 23-man squad by 31 May.
"Playing in the national team requires good form and total commitment at club and international level. We want to keep a sound atmosphere in the dressing room."
Croatia are in Group D along with Czech Republic, Spain and Turkey.
