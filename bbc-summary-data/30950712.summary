More than 500 speeding drivers have been caught by new cameras on the M4 in just five days.

Four average 50mph enforcement cameras were installed in October on a two-mile stretch at Port Talbot and they went live on Monday.
But around 125-a-day have been caught in less than a week.
The cameras are the first to go into operation on a Welsh section of the M4, and during a pilot before Christmas around 700 drivers a day were caught.
However, Wales Road Casualty Reduction Partnership GoSafe welcomed the reduction in drivers caught compared with the trial period.
Partnership manager Chris Hume said: "There is a clear indication that there has been a decrease in the numbers of people exceeding the limit.
"Excessive and inappropriate speed remains a factor in collisions and associated fatalities and serious injuries on our roads in Wales.
"Our main priority is to continue to educate motorists about the effect of inappropriate speed with enforcement being the last resort after engineering solutions are considered."
