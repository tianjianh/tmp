Grimes, 22, made 12 appearances on loan at Leeds last season, having joined Swansea in 2015 for Â£1.75m from Exeter.
This is the former England Under-21 international's third loan spell, following a stint at Blackburn in 2016.
"As well as being a central midfielder, he can also play in the number 10 role and he possesses a quality left foot," Cobblers manager Justin Edinburgh said.
"He is only a young man, but has a good amount of experience and after impressing at Exeter he has played in the Premier League and the Championship."
