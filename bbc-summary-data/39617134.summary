Durham v Nottinghamshire: Keaton Jennings ton in vain as visitors win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottinghamshire wrapped up a second Championship win of 2017, despite 102 not out by Durham's Keaton Jennings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England batsman Jennings put on 45 with Mark Wood and reached three figures from 202 balls with 16 fours.
But they were all out for 250, setting Notts just 108 to win, and openers Greg Smith (60 not out) and Jake Libby (39) scored at over five runs per over.
Libby fell to Paul Coughlin, but they reached 110-1 in just 29.2 overs to go top of the Division Two table.
Durham's first home defeat in the Championship since 2015 - a run of 11 games - strengthens Nottinghamshire's status as favourites for the Division Two title.
Without rested England bowler Stuart Broad, seamers Jake Ball, James Pattinson, Luke Fletcher and Harry Gurney shared all 20 wickets to make it consecutive 22-point wins, following the opening round victory over Leicestershire.
They were unable to prevent a ninth century in the last year for Jennings though, with the 24-year-old batting through the entire second innings to reach three figures shortly after Wood was caught at mid-wicket for 21.
In response, Smith and Libby moved the score along briskly and although Libby was bowled by Coughlin, Samit Patel (10) arrived to help complete the chase.
Nottinghamshire head coach Peter Moores told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"I thought we played really well here, set up from how we bowled in our first innings.
"Samit Patel and Michael Lumb then played positively and from that moment we managed to dominate the game.
"There were two good attacks here and the pitch has been good throughout. This was a good advert for the county championship."
