Carolina were heavy favourites, having lost only once all season and with the league's Most Valuable Player of the season Cam Newton at quarterback.
But Newton was smothered by the Broncos defence and gave up three turnovers, including one that led to a touchdown.
That helped Denver, quarterbacked by veteran Peyton Manning, open a 10-0 lead early on and they never lost it.
It had been rumoured the game would be 39-year-old Manning's last, but he said afterwards he would "take time to reflect".
"It's been an emotional week and it's an emotional night," he added.
Newton did not have a good game, but he was not helped by an awful display by Carolina's receivers, with Jerricho Cotchery guilty of two crucial drops.
It's a third Super Bowl title for the Broncos - after wins in 1997 and 1998 - while the Panthers are still waiting for their first.
"It's very special," said Manning. "This game was much like this season has been. It tested our toughness, resilience our unselfishness."
Broncos linebacker DeMarcus Ware gave a lot of credit to Denver defensive coordinator Wade Phillips.
"He came in and figured out how to utilise the guys, utilise the talents," he said. "He changed everything up to where we could be more aggressive and get to the passer, but also create a lot of havoc."

"They just played better than us," said Newton, a first round draft pick in 2011. "I don't know what you want me to say.
"They made more plays than us and that's what it came down to. We turned the ball over, gave up sacks, threw errant passes. That's it."
Defensive end Keony Ealy said the team would learn from the defeat.
"It sucks, but I can't dwell on it," said Ealy, who tied the Super Bowl record with three sacks and became the first player to record multiple sacks and an interception in a Super Bowl.
"The better team won. They showed up, they played. They didn't make mistakes, we did make mistakes. We can't do that."
Broncos linebacker Von Miller was named the game's Most Valuable Player after completing five tackles, two and a half sacks and two forced fumbles.
"I'm so proud of my guys," said Miller. "It's been every last one of you guys in the locker room that has gotten me to this moment right here."
He becomes only the 10th defensive player to win the award and only the fourth linebacker.
Miller, 26, was the number two pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, in which Newton was drafted first by the Panthers.
For Manning, the NFL's all-time leader in passing yards and touchdown passes, this win will strengthen his case to be seen as the greatest quarterback of all time.
He has now won two and lost two of his four Super Bowl appearances - his first win coming with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 - and improved his post-season record to 14-13.
It was not a vintage performance from the quarterback, who was sacked five times and did not throw for a touchdown.
But simply playing on the winning team represented a remarkable turnaround after a difficult season during which Manning was ignominiously benched for deputy Brock Osweiler after throwing four interceptions in a game against the Kansas City Chiefs in November.

British group Coldplay were the main performers at the half-time and they were joined by Beyonce, Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson.
Coldplay opened the show by singing 'Yellow' and 'Viva La Vida' as children carrying multi-coloured umbrellas and violins streamed onto the pitch.
Mars and Ronson performed their hit 'Uptown Funk', before Beyonce sang her new song 'Formation'.
The artists closed the show by performing a mash-up of Coldplay's hit 'Fix You' and Beyonce's 'Crazy In Love'.
