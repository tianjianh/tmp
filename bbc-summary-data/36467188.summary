The organisers of Scotland's biggest music festival are urging fans to travel to the site by bus to avoid a repeat of 2015's travel problems.

Last year, festival-goers were caught up in lengthy queues and traffic gridlock around the T in the Park site at Strathallan.
The organisers' new transport plan includes separate roads for buses and cars at the venue.
A bus station will also be created at a new location for next month's festival.
Ian Martin, transport manager at T in the Park, said: "We've made some major changes to our transport plans and we strongly advise people take the time to plan their journey.
"Our main message is that bus is best. You'll be able to relax while the driver gets you to the festival safely, quickly and closest to the site.
"We are confident in the set-up for 2016 and would remind fans that T in the Park is Scotland's biggest festival, so an element of patience will always be required, but waiting times will be of a normal level for an event of this scale."
He added: "Please be respectful of the local community and, if you are driving, leave time for toilet stops at service stations. Remember there is a strict drink-driving limit in Scotland, so don't risk it."
Due to temporary road closures, organisers have warned that satellite navigation systems will be "wrong" and have asked drivers to follow event signs.
Calvin Harris, the Stone Roses and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are scheduled to headline the three-day festival.
