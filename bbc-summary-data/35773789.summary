Arscott, who spent four seasons at Bristol between 2006-2010, has featured in nine games for the club this term.
The 31-year-old made only seven league appearances for Bath after joining from Premiership rivals Exeter in June 2014.
"He's an assured presence in the full-back role," Bristol director of rugby Andy Robinson said.
"Luke has a wealth of Premiership experience with Bristol, Bath and Exeter so we are confident he can make the step up to top-flight rugby if we achieve our goals."
