A woman and an 11-year-old boy who were hit by a car were "deliberately driven at", police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was "only by chance" officers were not dealing with a murder inquiry, West Midlands Police said.
The 26-year-old woman and child were hit by a silver Vauxhall Vectra as they were crossing Tennyson Road in Wolverhampton at about 6.45pm on Wednesday 2 December.
A 27-year-old man has been arrested, the force said.
Det Sgt Lisa Tibbitts said the car's front end would have been damaged when the boy "hit the bonnet", causing front end damage.
She said officers were looking for a "sporty looking" silver Vectra with tinted windows.
"If you work at a garage and have recently had to repair a car matching this description then we want to hear from you," she added.
The woman and boy were treated in hospital for minor injuries.
