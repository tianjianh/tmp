Guernsey's Watson, 23, came within two points of beating Serena Williams in the third round of Wimbledon last year.
Caroline Wozniacki, Victoria Azarenka and Madison Keys have also committed to playing the event, which ends a fortnight before Wimbledon.
"I had some incredible moments on grass last year and want to do even better in 2016," Watson said.
"I was sorry to have to miss the event last year and I'm looking forward to starting my grass-court season there," added the world number 56, who was unable to play last year's tournament through injury.
