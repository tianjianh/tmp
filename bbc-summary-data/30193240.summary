The new link will also be joined on the 29 March by the return of services to Oslo and Stockholm.
Flights between Edinburgh and Copenhagen will fly five times per week and will then increase to daily between 29 June and 9 August.
They will then switch to six times per week until the end of October.
Flights to Stockholm will be on a daily basis and those to Oslo will operate twice a week on Thursday and Sunday.
Gordon Dewar, chief executive of Edinburgh Airport, said: "We're committed to growing through choice and this is at the heart of everything we do at Edinburgh Airport.
"We want to make sure our passengers are able to choose from the very best range of flights and services.
"Scandinavia is an important destination for us to serve and is a popular choice for passengers travelling for both for leisure and business.
"We're delighted SAS will be joining us again with these new services which will link us into the impressive connectivity options available from the hub in Copenhagen."
Denise Hill, head of international marketing at VisitScotland, said: "Scandinavia is a lucrative market for Scotland and we are delighted to welcome yet more visitors with the introduction of these exciting new direct routes into Edinburgh Airport.
"However as we work to extend Scotland's international network, adding major international hubs and attracting airlines which are part of the world's great airline alliances is key. SAS is a key partner of the important Star Alliance, the leading global airline network.
"Creating as many links as we can with Star Alliance partners increases Scotland's connectivity with the world, enabling visitors to reach our stunning country from every single corner of the planet. This really is excellent news for Scotland."
