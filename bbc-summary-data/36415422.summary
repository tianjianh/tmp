[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Germany's unemployment rate fell to a record low in May, while the jobless rate across the eurozone fell to 10.2% in April.

The unadjusted rate in Germany declined to 6% from 6.3% in April, the Federal Labour Office said.
That was the lowest level since German reunification in 1990.
Differences remain between the formerly divided country: it was just 5.5% in what was West Germany, but 8.4% in the once-Communist east.
The fall reflected the strength of the labour market in Europe's largest economy.
The eurozone jobless rate was down from 11% in April last year and the lowest figure for the 19 countries using the euro since August 2011, Eurostat said.
Across the 28 countries in the European Union, unemployment fell to 8.7% in April, down from 8.8% in March and 9.6% in the same month last year.
That was the lowest rate for the EU since April 2009.
However, seven countries still have double-digit unemployment, with Italy at 11.7%, Spain at 20.1% and Greece at 24.4%.
The April unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 24 was 18.8% in the EU, down from 20.7%, and 21.1% in the eurozone, compared with 22.5% in the same month last year.
