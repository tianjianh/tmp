The 23-year-old has made 82 appearances for Tranmere since joining from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2014.
Rovers manager Gary Brabin told the club website: "We worked hard with him last season and I think we saw plenty of improvement in his game.
"He is still only 23 and has a lot of potential. I believe there is still more to come from him too."
