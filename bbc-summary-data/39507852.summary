Expel Ken Livingstone for Hitler remarks, Carwyn Jones says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones has said Ken Livingstone should be expelled from the Labour party for repeating comments about Adolf Hitler and Zionism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-London mayor faces a fresh inquiry for denouncing a party decision to extend his suspension for a year.
Mr Jones said he called for expulsion last year when Mr Livingstone first made "these deeply offensive remarks".
"There is no place for these views in the Labour Party and no place for anyone who espouses them," he said.
"We have a zero tolerance position on racism so there can be no debate as to what action the party must take.
"These repeated comments are totally and utterly unacceptable and Ken Livingstone must be expelled from the Labour Party."
Mr Livingstone has been suspended since April 2016 when he claimed Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s.
On Tuesday a Labour party disciplinary panel upheld three charges of breaching party rules and extended the suspension for another year.
Some Labour MPs and Jewish groups have criticised the decision not to expel Mr Livingstone, but he said he had been "suspended for stating the truth".
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Livingstone would face a fresh investigation, saying it was "deeply disappointing that, despite his long record of standing up to racism, Ken has failed to acknowledge or apologise for the hurt he has caused".
