[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man jailed for raping a young mother who killed herself days later has failed in a Court of Appeal bid against the conviction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Masood Mansouri, 34, from Chester, was jailed in April for the kidnap and rape of Ceri Linden, 20, from Colwyn Bay.
He said he did not get a fair trial because his victim was not alive to be quizzed in the witness box.
Judges dismissed his conviction appeal but cut his sentence from 13 to nine years.
Ms Linden was attacked after mistakenly getting into his car thinking it was a taxi during a night out in Chester in August 2014.
She went to police afterwards and was interviewed on camera, but was dead within days, having taken an overdose.
Mansouri was convicted at Chester Crown Court after Ms Linden's video evidence was shown to the jury.
Giving judgment at the Court of Appeal, Lady Justice Rafferty, sitting with Mrs Justice Cox and Sir John Royce, said Mansouri's convictions were "safe".
But after considering the length of the sentence, she said it was too long and cut it to nine years.
