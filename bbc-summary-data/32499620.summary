Money raised will support DEC members attempting to reach families affected by Saturday's quake which struck west of the capital Kathmandu.
The death toll has risen above 4,000 and is expected to rise much higher, with millions of people affected.
Donations are being accepted via the DEC website and the 24-hour donations line 0370 60 60 900.
Neil Mathers, chair of the DEC Nepal Earthquake Appeal in Scotland, said: "The pictures and stories coming out of Nepal show families ripped apart by this disaster. The sheer scale of this emergency and the effort required to help the people of Nepal recover is only now becoming clear.
"Survivors are in need of medical help, shelter, food and water. In many cases they have lost everything and our members are ready to help them rebuild. We urgently need the financial support of the public in Scotland to fund our emergency response."
The DEC Appeal in Scotland has received Â£250,000 donation from the Scottish government.
The DEC Nepal Earthquake Appeal, fronted by Joanna Lumley, will be shown by all major UK broadcasters including the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky on Tuesday evening.
