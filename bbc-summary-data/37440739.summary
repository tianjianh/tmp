Bannan is into its third series on BBC Alba and it is hoped that it could also make it onto BBC2 or BBC Four.
The deal with the international distributors DRG will help showcase the island abroad.
Bannan, which is based around the fictional village of Camus, is filmed in Tarskavaig in the south west of Skye.
It has emerged as BBC Alba's most popular series since the channel launched on Freeview in 2011.
