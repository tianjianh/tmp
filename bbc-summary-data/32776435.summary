The 43-year-old died after the vehicle he was travelling in overturned near the city of Blantyre late on Saturday.
Tenthani was well known across Malawi. He also worked for the Associated Press news agency and local newspapers.
Malawi's President Peter Mutharika said Tenthani would be remembered "as a man of immense talent... eloquence, humour and warmth".
BBC Africa editor Solomon Mugera said: Colleagues across BBC Africa are in deep shock after learning about the passing away of our Malawi reporter Raphael Tenthani. He was a consummate journalist who used his talent to powerfully tell the story of Malawi to the BBC's global audience.
"In addition to being humble, patient and generous, colleagues are also unanimous in their admiration of Raphael's enviable writing skills."
In 2010, Tenthani won a UN Media Award for his work on the Millennium Development Goals.
His funeral is expected later on Monday.
