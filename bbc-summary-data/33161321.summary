The star, who was announced as Jeremy Clarkson's replacement on Tuesday, said the show would star at least one woman.
Former model Jodie Kidd, who presents Channel 5's Classic Car Show, has already been tipped for the role.
Formula One presenter Suzi Perry has also been rumoured for the show.
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Evans said he wanted his co-stars to be "extremely knowledgeable about cars... people who have great energy, good timing... who are keen to do things differently."
Asked if one of the presenters would be female, he replied: "I can confirm that definitely, 100 per cent."
The BBC has not said when they will for announce the complete presenter line-up, but filming on the new series is expected to begin in a few weeks.
Earlier on Wednesday, Evans said he was "thrilled" to get the job, describing the motoring show as his "favourite programme of all time".
"I promise I will do everything I possibly can to respect what has gone on before and take the show forward," he added.
Car enthusiast Evans has signed a three-year deal with the BBC Two show.
An "all-new" line-up means Clarkson's co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May will not be involved.
Top Gear is watched by 350 million viewers worldwide and is one of the BBC's biggest shows, with overseas sales worth an estimated Â£50m a year.
Jeremy Clarkson was suspended, then dropped, as a presenter in March after hitting one of the show's producers.
His final appearance on Top Gear will be shown on 28 June. The episode will be made up of two films shot before Clarkson was suspended, with Hammond and May presenting links from the studio.
Viewers will see Clarkson, Hammond and May behind the wheel of classic cars and beaten-up 4x4s in their final challenges as a trio.
