The "dance party", as described by organisers, was meant to be held on Friday in Tacloban, the worst-hit area.
Critics said its slogan - "Party like it never happened, remember because it did" - made light of the tragedy.
The super typhoon left more than 7,000 people dead or missing and millions without homes.
Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, hit on 8 November last year sending huge storm swells into inland areas and destroying wide swathes of central Philippines.
Organiser Calai Cinco, herself a survivor of the storm, said the event had aimed to "provide a place for people to connect with other survivors and celebrate life, while raising funds for educational scholarships, to be donated to a local NGO".
"Our lives, like all survivors, were changed forever by November 8th, 2013," she said in a statement from the organisers released to announce the cancellation.
Promotional material around the event, which had the slogan "party like it never happened: remember because it did," had been accused of being inappropriate. It also sold T-shirts bearing the words "Eat, Pray, Loot", in an apparent reference to the aftermath of the storm.
One comment  on the Facebook page of the event said : "Don't you think a party is insensitive on your death anniversary?"
Another person said: "How can you pretend that it never happened and party because you are alive when people are still homeless?"
The organisers apologised in the statement to "those that misinterpreted the meaning of their event".
"The #FYolanda event is not about drinking and partying. It is an expression of life and celebration of survival. We must show everyone that Tacloban is still alive. And we must join together as survivors to help support the next generation."
The organisers said they would continue to sell a T-shirt that read "not even the strongest typhoon could bend the strongest people" to keep raising funds.
