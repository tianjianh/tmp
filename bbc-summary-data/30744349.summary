Activities are planned in Gretna, Leith, Stirling and Dundee.
Ms Hyslop said the focus of the second year of events would extend from the capital out to other parts of the country.
She said World War One had had a "significant and broad impact on our nation".
The calendar of events for 2015 is:
Ministers are liaising with Stirling Council, Dundee City Council, City of Edinburgh Council, Dumfries and Galloway Council and the Royal Scots Regimental Association on arrangements for each event.
Further details will be announced later in the year.
Ms Hyslop said the events were part of the "busiest year" of the five-year commemoration programme.
"The Quintinshill Rail Disaster, Gallipoli campaign and Battle of Loos each had a profound and long-lasting impact on Scotland and it is right that we pause to remember each event, and the Scottish communities who were affected," she said.
"The First World War had a significant and broad impact on our nation.
"Through our national commemorations the people of Scotland will have opportunities to reflect on its lasting social and civic legacy."
Norman Drummond, who chairs the Scottish Commemorations Panel, said the events would take place in the communities most affected.
"2015 will be the busiest year in Scotland's five-year commemorations programme," he said.
"We will further pause to reflect on the horror of war, the service and sacrifice of our servicemen and women and of those at home, and the lessons we continue to learn from World War One."
