Guernsey food outlets rated for hygiene

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hygiene ratings for food outlets on Guernsey have been released to the public for the first time.

The five-star rating system is based on the results of routine inspections conducted by the Environmental Health Officers since September.
Guernsey's Deputy Health Minister Martin Storey said the "scores on the doors" rating allowed islanders more informed choices about where to eat.
He said previously the results were only seen by the food outlets.
Deputy Storey said: "It's the right the public should know the results as well.
"It's ideal for this island where we have so many restaurants... the most important thing is to have the scores on the doors - it's what the customer sees.
"It's an incentive for people who are handling food to make sure their standards are up to scratch."
Tobin Cook, deputy environmental health officer, said it had been brought in after monitoring a similar system in the UK from which it was adapted.
He said: "There'll always be a small number of businesses which aren't operating to the required standards... the public should be able to make their own choices on whether they see fit to eat there."
The system will be extended to all Bailiwick food outlets once their routine inspections have taken place.
