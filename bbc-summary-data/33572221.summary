Jamshaid Khan, 30, was repeatedly turned down for permanent UK residency.
When his wife, EU citizen Milena Yulianova, refused to support his latest bid to stay in the UK he stabbed her to death in their London home.
Mr Khan, of Forest Gate, east London, must serve at least 20 years in prison for her murder on 28 January 2014.
He arrived in the UK in 2011 after witnessing Taliban killings where he lived on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Old Bailey heard.
Sentencing him, Judge Stephen Kramer QC said he was "a manipulative, devious and deceitful man" who had "wriggled and writhed" his way through the trial.
The court heard Khan had applied more than once for permanent UK residency after converting to Christianity and had grown increasingly dependent on his wife of 15 months for her help to stay in the UK.
The jury was told they rowed on 28 January over the opening of a bank account and Khan stabbed his wife with a kitchen knife on the arm and chest 14 times. She ran into the street and a man in a takeaway shop nearby in Nigel Road and two others tried to help and revive her, but she died later in hospital.
Khan denied murder and claimed he had stabbed the young masseuse in self-defence because she had produced a knife but the jury did not believe him and convicted him of murder on Monday.
During the sentencing, Judge Kramer said: "You killed Milena in anger because she would not help and support you in your application. While the marriage existed in 2014, you were already looking for other eastern European women who you thought could help.
"You were chatting with them on Facebook. You told one of the women on Facebook that Milena had died in a car accident. Those conversations indicate you were already contemplating you might feel the need to replace her."
The judge praised the "immense public service" of the three trial witnesses who went to the aid of the victim and awarded each of them Â£500.
Following Khan's release from prison, he is likely to be deported.
