[SN]TITLE[SN]
Danielle Millar guilty of sexually molesting 14-year-old girl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has been ordered to sign the sex offenders register after she admitted sexually molesting a teenage school girl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Danielle Millar, 22, from Mount Street, Ballymena, entered guilty pleas to two counts of sexual activity with a child under 16.
The offences happened on a date unknown between 1 January and 1 July 2012.
She was released on bail and will appear in court again on Friday.
A further charge of sexually assaulting the same 14-year-old girl was not put before the court on Tuesday.
A prosecuting lawyer told Antrim Crown Court that while he had to "make some enquiries" about the Crown's position regarding the last count, he was "confident" a trial would not be necessary.
The judge adjourned the case to Friday, commenting "that it would be best for everyone's interests if the case could be encapsulated" in Millar's guilty pleas.
He added that while it would be "premature" to order pre-sentence probation reports at this stage, given her admissions she was now "obliged" to sign the police sex offenders register.
