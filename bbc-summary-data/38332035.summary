Glasgow Warriors targeting European title, says Zander Fagerson

Scotland prop Zander Fagerson says his Glasgow Warriors team have targeted winning the European Champions Cup.

The Warriors pulled off a huge result to beat French champions Racing 92 in Paris last weekend and host the return game at Scotstoun on Friday.
Fagerson says the focus has to be on one game at a time but admits the Warriors have big ambitions.
"That's every team's aim in the Champions Cup - to win it. If I told you otherwise, I'd be lying," he said.
"But I'm not thinking about that at all - just focused on the task ahead this weekend."
Warriors are second in Pool One, one point behind Munster, who have a game in hand along with Racing, although the French side sit bottom without a point.
Fagerson has four caps for Scotland but is still surprised to be starting in a side so close to qualifying for the quarter-finals of Europe's top club competition.
"We've been close before and had some tough pools a few times and this is definitely the goal," said the 20-year-old.
"It is amazing to be part of and I have to pinch myself at times. I didn't expect any of this at all."
Fagerson broke into the Warriors side as they won the 2014-15 Pro12 title and agrees that the win over Racing was their best achievement since then.
However, the forward stressed that "the job is only half done" and coach Gregor Townsend pointed out that, with only three pool games played, it is too early to think beyond qualifying for the last eight.
"We will have to win two out of our next three games and we have Racing, Munster and Leicester still to go, so these are very tough matches," said Townsend.
"Munster have been on fire for the last six or seven weeks. They beat Leicester easily at home.
"We are going to have to play very well just to get out of our pool and, if we did so, it would be historic."
Townsend was coy about Warriors' chances of winning the trophy.
"No Glasgow team has made it to the quarter-finals of the Champions Cup and, once you are into the last eight, anything can happen," he said.
"If you look at history, we have never got out of our pool, so let's just deal with the difficulty that is qualifying for the quarter-final stage.
"For a one-off game, that was tremendous at the weekend. We've had them before - going to Montpellier a couple of years ago, Bath at home.
"The European Champions Cup is much more difficult to get through than it used to be and we've never achieved it in the past.
"Now, with the 20 best teams in Europe, all qualifying by merit bar one team, it shows you have to play your best rugby to have a chance of getting through."
