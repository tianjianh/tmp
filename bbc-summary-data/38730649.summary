Anglo-Welsh Cup: Sale Sharks 41-3 Cardiff Blues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues are out of contention for an Anglo-Welsh Cup semi-final spot after suffering a heavy defeat at Sale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denny Solomona, Welshman Jonathan Mills and Laurence Pearce went over before the break.
Pearce added a second after 50 minutes and Neil Briggs and James Flynn followed before a late penalty try.
The seven-tries-to-none win sent Sale from bottom to the top of Pool Two, but Ospreys can reclaim pole position if they beat Bristol on Saturday.
