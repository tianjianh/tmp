[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scotland-England border flag 'flexibility' sought

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Berwickshire councillor has asked whether flags other than the Saltire can be flown on the Scottish side of the border with England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Cook has made the inquiry regarding provision at Lamberton on the boundary between the Scottish Borders and Northumberland.
He said three Saltires currently fly on the Scottish side.
Mr Cook asked whether a county flag of Berwickshire or the union jack could also be flown north of the border.
His request to Transport Scotland is scheduled to be discussed by Scottish Borders Council's Berwickshire area forum.
Mr Cook pointed out that on the English side of the border the flag of Northumberland, St George's flag and the union jack were regularly flown.
He has asked whether it would be possible to fly a flag featuring the emblem of Berwickshire - a bear chained to a tree.
He said the local area forum was keen to highlight the "regional distinctiveness" of the area.
Mr Cook also asked whether it would be possible to fly the union jack reflecting the "shared identity and relationship which exists across the border".
