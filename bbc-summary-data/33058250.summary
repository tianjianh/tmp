Two rooms in the former hospital were affected by the fire on Monday evening but no-one was injured.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Police Scotland attended.
A police spokesperson later said: "A 13-year-old boy has been charged and will be reported in connection with wilful fireraising."
Officers were said to be continuing to follow positive lines of inquiry.
Police said they were working with local schools to make children aware of the dangers of derelict buildings.
Insp Jason Carrigan, from the Kittybrewster community policing team, said: "They should not be entered under any circumstances.
"Fire creates a very real danger for the people in the area as well as the emergency services who have to respond to such incidents.
"As part of our work in the community, we continue to liaise with local schools to make children aware of these dangers."
