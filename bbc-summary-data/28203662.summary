The women, aged 46, 47, 54 and 61, all work at Fosse Court care home in Leicester, which cares for adults over the age of 65, some with physical or mental disabilities.
They have all since been bailed pending further investigations.
A spokesman for the home said: "The home is receiving additional support from senior managers."
He added: "As there is an on-going police investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment on this particular matter. "
The Care and Quality Commission (CQC) said its inspectors went into the care home last week "in response to concerns that had been shared with us about standards of care".
It found "a number of serious issues".
Malcolm Bower-Brown, CQC deputy chief inspector of adult social care, said inspectors were back at the home today carrying out further checks and both the police and Leicester City Council had been informed.
An inspection report will be published, along with any sanctions against the home's provider, "as soon as possible", he said.
Mr Bower-Brown added: "In the meantime, we are aware of the city council's decision to seek alternative care homes for their clients.
"We appreciate the anxiety this will cause for some residents and their families and are working closely with the city council to ensure the moves to new homes are handled as carefully as possible, to safeguard the safety and welfare of residents."
