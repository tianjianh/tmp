Tube Strike: RMT announces walkout on two underground lines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tube Drivers on two London Underground lines are to stage a 24-hour strike in a dispute over the displacement of staff.

Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) drivers will walk out on the Central and Waterloo and City lines from 21.00 GMT on Wednesday.
A reduced service will run on the Central Line, while the Waterloo and City line will not run at all.
Transport for London (TfL) urged the union to call off the strike.
Peter McNaught, operations director for the Central line, said: "We have made all reasonable efforts to resolve this dispute."
However, RMT general secretary Mick Cash said "the door has been slammed in our faces" during negotiations.
The dispute centres around plans to transfer eight train operators between Central line depots.
Mr Cash said RMT members were being "sent out from pillar-to-post to plug gaps that are solely down to staffing shortages".
"If [London Underground] are allowed to get away with this move on the Central Line they will start shunting drivers around at the drop of a hat regardless of the consequences," he added.
During the strike a shuttle bus will operate between Epping and Chingford in north-east London.
Other London Underground services will operate as normal, but TfL has warned services will be more busy than usual.
During a 24-hour walkout across the tube network on 8-9 January, Clapham Junction was evacuated as commuters faced overcrowding at major transport hubs.
