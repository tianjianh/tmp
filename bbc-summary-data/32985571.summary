[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MPs are to pay tribute to former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, after his sudden death on Monday aged 55.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There will be a dedicated session in the House of Commons at 12:30 BST immediately after the first Prime Minister's Questions of the Parliament.
Mr Kennedy led the party for six years and took the Lib Dems to their best election result in 2005.
No cause of death has been given but police said it was not suspicious.
The tributes session will begin at about 12.30 BST, after the first Prime Minister's Questions of the new Parliament.
Speaker John Bercow said it would be an opportunity for MPs to "say what they think and feel and remember about our departed colleague".
Mr Kennedy, who lost his Ross, Skye and Lochaber seat in last month's general election, died at his home in Fort William on Monday. His family said they were "devastated" to lose "a fine man and a "loving father".
Tributes from across the political spectrum poured in after the news was announced.
David Cameron said politics had lost a man of "immense ability", while Nick Clegg said his opposition to the Iraq war had been "enormously courageous".
Under Mr Kennedy's leadership, the Lib Dems won a record 62 seats in 2005 but he resigned eight months after the election after revealing he had been receiving treatment for a long-standing drink problem.
Charles Kennedy: 1959-2015
By Nick Robinson, BBC political editor
Charles Kennedy left a mark on British politics. The man who took his party to its electoral peak, he was the only UK party leader to warn the country of the perils of invading Iraq when Labour and the Conservatives were uniting to support it.
He was also the only Liberal Democrat MP who could not bring himself to vote to form a coalition with the Conservatives.
But British politics also left its mark on him. Elected at the age of just 23, politics and the House of Commons became his life whilst alcohol was his friend, his prop and his curse.

Mr Clegg, who will step down as Lib Dem leader in July, said that on a good day Mr Kennedy had "more political talent in his little finger than the rest of us put together".
"He was one of the most gentle and unflappable politicians I have ever known, yet he was immensely courageous too - not least when he spoke for the country against the invasion of Iraq," he said.
The Lib Dems have opened an online "book of condolence" where anyone can leave messages via its website.
In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Kennedy's family said: "It is with great sadness, and an enormous sense of shock, that we announce the death of Charles Kennedy.
"We are obviously devastated at the loss. Charles was a fine man, a talented politician, and a loving father to his young son."
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Police officers attended an address at Fort William on Monday, June 1 to reports of the sudden death of a 55-year-old man.
"Police were notified by ambulance service personnel. There are no suspicious circumstances."
Mr Kennedy's political career began in the Social Democratic Party and he became the youngest MP of the time when he won the Ross, Cromarty and Skye seat in 1983 at the age of 23.
He became SDP spokesman on social security, Scotland and health and continued to hold a series of frontbench posts when most of his party merged with the Liberals to form the Lib Dems in 1988.
He took over the Liberal Democrat leadership from Paddy - now Lord - Ashdown in 1999.
His 2002 marriage to Camelot public relations executive Sarah Gurling - and the later birth of his son in 2005 - was seen by many in the party as a sign he was settling down. He and his wife split up in 2010.
After his resignation, Mr Kennedy maintained a lower profile. He did not play any role in the coalition government, having voted against his party's decision to enter an alliance with the Conservatives.
Prime Minister David Cameron said Mr Kennedy was "a talented politician who died too young", while acting Labour leader Harriet Harman said he "brought courage, wit and humour to everything he did".
Tony Blair, who clashed with Mr Kennedy over the former Labour PM's decision to take the UK to war in Iraq, said his death was "an absolute tragedy".
He said he had the greatest of respect for Mr Kennedy who entered Parliament at the same time as him, in 1983, describing him as "a lovely, genuine and deeply committed public servant".
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Kennedy was "an incredibly talented, gifted, effective politician", while Lib Dem peer Baroness Williams said he had "huge charisma" and was "deeply loved in the party".
"He was completely beyond the standard of what we rather regard as greatness in politics. He could have been a very great man indeed," Lady Williams told the BBC.
Reflecting on Mr Kennedy's battle with alcohol, ex-Lib Dem MP Sir Malcolm Bruce said the party did not handle his exit as leader well, telling the BBC there were times when "we hoped he was coping with it but he wasn't always".
And Alastair Campbell, the former adviser to Tony Blair who has tackled his own problems with alcohol, said the two men - who became close friends - faced a "shared enemy".
"Alcoholism is a disease and people should reflect on that," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
