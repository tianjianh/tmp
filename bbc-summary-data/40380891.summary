Academy graduate McAleny, 24, made just three appearances for Everton, but scored 10 goals in 19 appearances on loan with Oxford United last season.
He has also spent time on loan at Scunthorpe United, Brentford, Cardiff City, Charlton and Wigan.
"Conor has turned down a number of clubs in the Championship to sign," said Fleetwood chairman Andy Pilley.
McAlney is League One Fleetwood's third summer signing following the arrivals of midfielder Kyle Dempsey and defender Harvey Rodgers.
