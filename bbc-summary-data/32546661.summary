[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 50 children in north Kent have been allocated school places in a neighbouring London borough because of a lack of spaces locally.

Kent County Council (KCC) told pupils in Dartford they cannot go to any of their chosen schools in September but can have places at Erith School.
Parent Richard Robertson said it would mean his daughter Josie having to take three buses to school in Bexley.
KCC said it was looking at offering paces at Ebbsfleet Academy instead.
Councillor Roger Gough said the shortage of places was caused by the closure of the Oasis Hextable Academy at the end of this academic year.
"Oasis Hextable closed because its numbers were relatively low and the provider felt it was financially unviable," he said.
"We argued strongly to government that the closure should not take place because there was a need for school places in this corner of Kent."
He said the council was looking again at the allocation of places since parent has raised the issue of the bus journey to Erith.
Ebbsfleet Academy, in Kent, which has places, is further from Dartford but is accessible with a single bus journey.
"Since parents raised with us the concern that bus journeys were not looking at all manageable we have been in discussions with Ebbsfleet Academy and a new set of offers is being made," said Mr Gough.
