[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police car attending a crash in Southampton in which a man was seriously injured was involved in a second collision in the same road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man is in a life-threatening condition after being hit by a Vauxhall car in Winchester Road, shortly after 07:30 GMT.
A police car attending subsequently collided with a Fiat. No one was hurt.
Winchester Road was closed throughout the morning between Shirley High Street and St James Road.
Bus passenger Katie Oakley said: "I heard a loud bang, then a female police officer got out of the car to see if the lady in the other car was OK.
"The lady looked quite shaken up so the officer was supporting her and told her to wait in one of the nearby houses.
"Then an unmarked police car and a couple of police motorbikes showed up to look at the damage. The road was closed and we were told to leave the bus."
A police spokeswoman said: "A car responding to the initial crash was involved in a minor collision - there were no injuries."
