Police said those who dumped the firearm were "despicable and dangerous".
The rifle was discovered on Monday along with a gun cabinet and ammunition.
Police said the items had been stolen during a burglary in Lurgan on 9 December.
"We are extremely fortunate that no one was hurt," said Sgt Sam Hoey.
"The fact that a child found it does not bear thinking about."
The children did not touch the items and alerted their parents to the discovery, police said.
