Open 2015: R&A have 'no intention' of using Royal Porthcawl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The governing body of golf's Open Championship, the Royal and Ancient, says it has "no intention" of hosting the competition at Royal Porthcawl.

The Welsh course was praised after hosting 2014's Senior Open, with Tom Watson suggesting it could stage the Open.
But R&A championship committee chairman Peter Unsworth dismissed the idea.
"We're happy with the number of courses on the rota, and we don't have any intention to go to Porthcawl," he said.
There have been 14 different courses used for the Open, though only nine are on the current roster with a 10th likely to be added in 2019.
Scotland, England and Northern Ireland have all hosted British golf's blue riband event, leaving Wales as the only country in the United Kingdom not to have done so.
The Royal Porthcawl became the first Welsh venue to host a major tournament when it staged last year's Senior Open, which was won by Bernhard Langer.
The 2010 Ryder Cup was held in south Wales at Newport's Celtic Manor course - but that venue does not qualify to host the Open which is only ever played on seaside links courses.
Royal Porthcawl has made a bid to the R&A to be added to its roster of Open venues, alongside illustrious locations such St Andrews, where this year's tournament is being held from 16-19 July.
While the course is generally perceived to be up to standard, infrastructure around the Royal Porthcawl may not meet requirements.
Roads leading to the course are narrow and residential, while local public transport could struggle to cater for the huge crowds that Open Championships attract.
