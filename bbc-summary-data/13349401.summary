Radio is the medium of choice, reaching rural areas where most Ethiopians live.

Although the state controls most broadcasting outlets, including the sole national TV network, there is a handful of private radio stations.
Some opposition groups beam into Ethiopia using hired shortwave radio transmitters overseas.
The number of privately-owned newspapers has grown; some are available online. Press circulation is largely confined to the literate urban elite.
The private press offers quite different reporting to state-owned newspapers and routinely criticises the government.
The relationship between the press and officials has sometimes been difficult. A "legislative arsenal", including anti-terror laws, has eroded "the democratic space and freedom of expression", said media rights group Reporters Without Borders in 2012.
There were around 1.8 million internet users by December 2013 (Internetworldstats.com). The government owns the sole ISP, "allowing it to censor when and where it sees fit", the Committee to Protect Journalists reported in 2011.
There is substantial filtering of political news, according to OpenNet Initiative. The government curbs access to the sites of domestic "insurgent groups" and several blogs and websites run by opposition groups abroad, says the US State Department.
