Concerns have been raised that people in a Carmarthenshire town will soon have to travel further afield to see a GP as their surgery is to close.

Harbour View Surgery in Burry Port shuts in July when the doctor retires.
A local councillor said the town's other surgery was unable to take on everyone from Harbour View which looks after about 1,400 patients.
Health bosses said they were committed to providing care for everyone in the area.
Town councillor Geraint Davies said: "I understand that there isn't much space in the other surgery, and so patients would be expected to travel to Kidwelly or Llanelli. That is too far, especially for elderly people in Burry Port."
Hywel Dda director Jill Paterson said the health board was working closely with local surgeries and the community council.
"Over the coming days patients will receive a letter telling them which surgery they can register with from 1 August onwards," she said.
