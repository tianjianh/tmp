Crewe Alexandra manager David Artell is considering an attempt to sign former England international Wes Brown, reports BBC Radio Stoke.

The former Manchester United and Sunderland defender, 37 is being released by Blackburn Rovers, who opted against offering a new deal after relegation from the Championship.
"It's not something that's pressing, immediate or close," Artell said.
"It's something we may visit depending what happens in the next few weeks."
Artell added that the League Two club must decide whether Manchester-born Brown, who has made 456 career appearances, would be the right signing given his age.
"Should he be on our list? Give me a good reason why he wouldn't be," said Artell.
"Is he right for us at 37? That would be the big question mark, I suppose. But he certainly ticks all the other boxes.
"We've got other priorities at the moment in other positions, but when we get around to looking at centre-halves, we'll consider Wes along with the others."
Artell has already lost defenders Jon Guthrie and Ollie Turton this summer, while captain George Ray, 23, is also out of contract.
Being under 24, the club would receive compensation if Ray chose to move elsewhere but Artell is confident that Ray will accept an offer of a new two-year deal.
Artell has added Carlisle defender Michael Raynes to his squad.
His other two signings are strikers - Chris Porter from Colchester United and Jordan Bowery, who has made a more permanent move to Gresty Road after finishing last season on loan from Leyton Orient.
