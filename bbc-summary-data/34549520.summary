Northern Ireland's record scorer took over from Warren Feeney in midweek and watched the Blues suffer a League Cup defeat by Ballinamallard United.
Goals difference separates Linfield and pacesetters Crusaders, who were also beaten in the League Cup on Wednesday.
The champions visit the Mallards while Cliftonville host Portadown with Gerard Lyttle appointed manager on Thursday.
Grant Cameron presents Irish Premiership coverage on Saturday Sportsound from 14:00 BST on Radio Ulster.
There is commentary from Warrenpoint as David Healy starts life as Linfield manager while we will also follow the action between Cliftonville and Portadown.
The show will have updates from the other four league games and the League cup quarter-final draw at 17:30.
Lyttle was handed the Solitude job after impressing in the caretaker role following the departure of Tommy Breslin last month.
The Reds are just three points behind the top two while Portadown are down in sixth.
Crusaders had their 12-game unbeaten run ended by Championship side Institute at Seaview on Wednesday night.
Crues boss Stephen Baxter gave fringe players an opportunity to shine but the big guns will be back for the trip to Ferney Park on Saturday.
"We'll have players back for this game and after that performance against Institute we'll need them," said Baxter.
"It's always a challenge down in Fermanagh but it's important we get back to winning ways.
"They have now beaten Glentoran and Linfield recently - we'll need to be at our best."
Ballinamallard lie four points off the bottom and manager Whitey Anderson hopes to build on the League Cup success at Windsor Park.
"It was a big win and now we have to carry it forward for Saturday's game and beyond," he said.
"Hopefully it will make the players believe in themselves and we can push on.
"We're at home but Crusaders are a fantastic side and a threat all over the park."
Coleraine have moved to within four points of the top and the Bannsiders take on Dungannon Swifts at the Showgrounds.
Glenavon face Ballymena United at Mourneview Park while the Oval is the venue as Glentoran prepare to meet Carrick Rangers.
