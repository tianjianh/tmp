Row over Ruth Davidson comedy rap song slur

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An SNP MP has been criticised for defending a comedy rap group's use of the word "dyke" to describe Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson.

The Witserface group referred to Ms Davidson, who is openly gay, as "Dykey D" at the launch of a pro-independence organisation at the weekend.
Joanna Cherry, who is also gay, described the routine on Twitter as "hilariously irreverent satire".
She later said she "regretted the offence that was caused".
And she said she had spent her life campaigning for LGBTI rights, and had herself been the victim of homophobic assaults.
Scottish Conservative MSP Annie Wells had written to Ms Cherry urging her to apologise to Ms Davidson for the "direct attack on her sexuality" and to "challenge homophobic behaviour in future rather than promote it".
And Colin MacFarlane, director of gay rights group Stonewall Scotland, said: "Calling someone a dyke is homophobic. If it goes unchallenged it gives the green light for others to follow suit."
The routine by all-female group Witserface at the launch of the Scottish Independence Convention in Glasgow saw the performers take part in a mock rap battle in the guise of SNP MP Mhairi Black, Nicola Sturgeon; Kezia Dugdale and Ms Davidson.
Footage of the performance has been circulating on social media.
In her letter to Ms Cherry, Ms Wells wrote: "In the piece, one of the rappers refers to Ms Davidson using the homophobic term 'dyke'.
"Both Ruth and the openly gay Scottish Labour leader (Ms Dugdale) are dismissed as 'poor excuse for women'.
"A character pretending to be Ruth Davidson then enacts a foul-mouthed rap of a highly sexual and predatory nature directed at Mhairi Black MP, also an openly LGBT politician of some profile."
She said the prevalence of "hate speech" such as the use of dyke as an insult was one of the reasons Stonewall had launched its No Bystanders campaign, asking people to stand up to homophobic language whenever they hear it.
Ms Wells added: "In light of the above, would you care to reassess your promotion of the act by Witserface, apologise to Ruth Davidson for the direct attack on her sexuality and consider signing up to the No Bystanders pledge yourself, in order to challenge homophobic abuse in future, rather than promote it".
In a subsequent written reply to Ms Wells, Ms Cherry said: "I saw yesterday's performance as a lesbian woman watching a satirical comedy sketch written by lesbian women, which mocked representatives of all parties, including the SNP.
"In that context I did not believe it was intended to be offensive but I do understand why some find it to be.
"Language is important - particularly when we are still working hard to change social attitudes towards LGBTI people.
"While some people, including myself, have reclaimed the term and now use it proudly - I understand others are not comfortable with it and while the event and performance were not organised by the SNP I regret the offence that was caused".
Caron Lindsay of the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: "There is plenty to criticise Ruth Davidson for without having to resort to cheap slurs regarding her sexuality. This is the sort of language you might have expected to hear in the 70s or 80s, not today.
"Scotland has taken huge steps towards equality in recent years and this was an unwelcome blast from the past. An apology would be in order."
The Scottish Independence Convention event was hosted by actress Elaine C Smith, with speakers scheduled to include former First Minister Alex Salmond, SNP MP Tommy Sheppard, Scottish Greens MSP Ross Greer, broadcaster Lesley Riddoch and Carolyn Leckie from Women for Independence.
The convention aims to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for independence.
A spokesman for the SNP said: "We condemn any form of homophobia - this was not an SNP event."
