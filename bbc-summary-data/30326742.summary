[SN]TITLE[SN]
More pupils missing school to go on term-time holidays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of primary school pupils in Wales going on unauthorised holidays during term-time has increased.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last year 8% of all absences were because of holidays that had not been agreed by schools - an increase from 3.2% last year.
Half of local authorities in Wales ask head teachers to refuse all requests for holidays during term time.
However, the Welsh government says schools can authorise up to 10 days absence per pupil, per year.
The Conservatives say the figures show there is confusion about the policy.
Shadow education minister Angela Burns said: "Conflicting guidance for schools from local education authorities, regional education consortia and the Welsh government is confusing.
"It has led to inconsistent decisions on authorised absence."
Overall absence levels in schools in Wales are down to their lowest level since 2007/08.
A Welsh government spokeswoman said: "Overall these primary school attendance statistics are very positive.
"They show that attendance of primary school pupils in Wales is at its highest level since records began.
"Parents do not have an automatic right to withdraw pupils from school for a holiday."
