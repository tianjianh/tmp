Organisers said 1,047,000 tickets have been applied for and five of 14 sessions are oversubscribed. They include the 100m final, which would be Bolt's swansong and which more than 200,000 want to see.
The capacity for the championships at the London Stadium in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park - which is also now home to Premier League side West Ham United - will be around 50,000 per session.

Performances by British athletes at last month's Olympic Games in Rio, where Team GB won more medals than they did at the London 2012 Games, have also boosted interest.
A British Athletics spokesperson said: "The UK public witnessed new athletics heroes emerge at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and applications for London's championships were boosted by the public wanting to witness these athletes in action next summer."
Bolt, an 11-time world champion, added: "It's fantastic to see."
