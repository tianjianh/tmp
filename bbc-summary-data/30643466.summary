Cardiff City Supporters' Trust has written an open letter to owner Vincent Tan calling for a return to the club's traditional home blue kit.

In June 2012, the Welsh club announced it would be changing the kit from blue to red and introducing a new badge.
Fans will march to Cardiff City Stadium on 31 January to deliver a letter requesting a return to the former kit.
"There must be a return to playing in blue at home for the next season," read the letter.
The letter also called for "a return to the traditional club badge that was removed at the rebranding".
It continued: "Ever since the decision was taken more than two-and-a-half years ago to rebrand our club it has created division within the fan base, with many supporters feeling that the changes completely ignored the club's long history and traditions.
"To repair bridges we believe that there must be a return to playing in blue at home for the next season, along with a return to the traditional club badge that was removed at the rebranding.
"Committed fans, who have in many cases followed the club for decades, feel disenfranchised and have told us that they are considering not renewing their season tickets at the end of the season unless there is a return to blue.
"We dearly hope that such a boycott can be avoided.
"We believe that unless changes are made the division between the fans and our club will only grow. Your executives in Cardiff will confirm that the stadium is overwhelmingly blue at every home match. The fans of Cardiff City have given their verdict."
The decision by Tan to rebrand the club, whose nickname is the Bluebirds, was to help "appeal in international markets".
Cardiff were on the verge of administration when Tan took over in May 2010 and survived three winding-up orders in the 2009-10 season over unpaid taxes.
An outstanding debt of £24m to main creditors Langstone - whose spokesperson is former Cardiff City owner Sam Hammam - was settled in July 2013.
In January 2014, Cardiff City reported a loss of £30m for the season 2012-13 season, when they were promoted to the Premier League, and the club's overall debt rose to £118m, with just over half - £66m - owed to Tan.
The letter from the Trust also queried the state of the club's finances: "We are also concerned that the pledges made by yourself to convert the debt owed by the club to you into equity have yet to be realised.
"We would be grateful if you could make a firm commitment on the conversion of the debt."
Cardiff were relegated back to the Championship after one season, which saw Malky Mackay sacked as manager mid-campaign to be replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
Solskjaer left as Cardiff boss in October 2014 with Russell Slade named the Norwegian's successor.
Cardiff are currently 12th in the Championship after a five-game winless run and face Colchester United in the FA Cup third round at home on Friday night.
