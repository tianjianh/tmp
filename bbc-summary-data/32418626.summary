[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A petition signed by 85 residents of the Dukes Park estate, Bilston, Wolverhampton, claims there is regular anti-social behaviour by youths congregating at the playpark.
Police were called to the park 58 times last year over complaints including arson and the racing of vehicles.
Wolverhampton City Council will consider what action to take on Friday.

West Midlands Police said it had increased the number of foot and mobile patrols in the area and deployed its Anti-Social Behaviour van.
The council said a camera had been installed as a deterrent and to help identify offenders.
Trenches and banks have also been built to prevent vehicles driving on grassed areas, a report to the council said.
On Friday, the council will consider whether the large play equipment should be replaced by smaller items suitable for toddlers, or whether all the equipment should be removed and the area grassed over.
