A Birmingham secondary school is set to close in August despite a campaign to save it by hundreds of residents.

Pupils and staff at the Baverstock Academy, Druid's Heath, were told of the plans at an assembly earlier.  A four-week consultation has begun.
The Department for Education (DfE) said a new sponsor had not been found for the school, which has been in special measures since 2014.
The school featured in a BBC Panorama film in 2014.
The documentary looked at whether the academy could honour its pledge to keep disruptive pupils in school and help them achieve five GCSEs.
Its future was plunged into uncertainty in 2015 following financial difficulties.
Nearly 2,400 people signed an online petition which called the school "a constant force of stability to the community".
However, regional schools commissioner Chris Quinn said potential sponsors felt the "financial and educational issues" affecting the school were "too complex to guarantee the improvements needed".
She has asked for views on the proposed closure by 7 February.
Steve McCabe, Labour MP for Birmingham Selly Oak, said the government had treated the parents, pupils and community "with utter disregard".
"It is a complete disgrace and my constituents will not forgive this betrayal," he said.
He called for an urgent meeting with the education secretary to ask what efforts were made to save the school and about costs of closing it.
The DfE said the school was "undersubscribed", adding it would be working with LEAP, the trust which runs the school, and the local authority to find alternative places to ensure students' education "is not disrupted."
