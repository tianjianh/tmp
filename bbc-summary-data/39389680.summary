[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Marquis scored a hat-trick to put Doncaster within touching distance of automatic promotion from League Two as came from behind to beat Grimsby Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Jones' volley had put the hosts ahead only for Marquis to cancel it out within three minutes before heading in Gary McSheffrey's corner soon after.
Tommy Rowe put Marquis in for his third after half-time for the striker's first hat-trick in a Doncaster shirt.
Andy Williams and Alfie May then struck to seal an emphatic away win.
Leaders Doncaster need just three more points from their final six games to be certain of a top-three finish after wins for Stevenage and Luton delayed their promotion party for at least another week.
Stevenage's 1-0 win over Barnet kept them 16 points adrift, while Luton also beat Blackpool by the same scoreline to remain 18 points behind Donny.
Doncaster manager Darren Ferguson told BBC Sheffield:
"It's a really good day. We felt that we needed a reaction after last week. There was one or two things said, and the reaction and message today is we have done our bit, let's see what the rest do.
"We have been transformed into a team which has a great work ethic and that's the big change for us as a football club.
"Last season was as low as it's ever been for me as a manager because I didn't expect it. When I came into the club I had high hopes we would do certain things I wanted to do, but the board have been great.
"You need time to get your methods across and it's a different look to the club; sometimes you need to take one step back to take two or three forward.
"The place was stale and needed a massive lift. Now we have just started with the building blocks and hopefully the first part of that is not far away."
