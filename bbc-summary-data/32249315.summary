[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham Council managers' pay 'should increase'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Recruits to senior management posts at Rotherham Council should be paid more due to "negative publicity" about the authority, a committee has agreed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A report to councillors outlined potential difficulties in attracting the best candidates.
A criminal investigation was launched after the council was found "not fit for purpose" over its handling of child sexual exploitation cases.
The decision will be put before the full council for approval on 22 May.
In the report to the staffing committee, Phil Howe, director of human resources, says "additional financial incentives" may be needed.
An investigation found that more than 1,400 children had been subjected to abuse in the town over 16 years.
The council's entire cabinet resigned after it was found that they were still failing to protect vulnerable children from harm, and that there was a culture of bullying, sexism and suppression at the authority.
Committee members were told in Mr Howe's report: "Due to the recent negative publicity surrounding the council, it may be necessary to consider awarding additional financial incentives to attract suitable applicants to senior managerial positions in Rotherham."
The report asked councillors to decide whether a "market supplement" was necessary to recruit to specific chief officer posts, up to a limit of 25% of annual salary.
Public service union Unison was considering a response to the proposals.
