Dempsey, 36, finished second in the RS:X class, following a bronze in 2004 and silver in London four years ago.
The two-time world champion was guaranteed second place behind Dutch gold medallist Dorian van Rijsselberge going into Sunday's medal race.
Van Rijsselberge capped his victory by winning the medal race, with Dempsey coming in fourth.
Dempsey, competing in his fifth Olympic Games, celebrated his 36th birthday on Saturday knowing he was already assured of silver.

Van Rijsselberge, 27, beat the Briton to gold in 2012 and had an unassailable advantage of 23 points going into the final race.
Dempsey planned to retire after Rio but, following Sunday's medal race, he said: "I love racing. I think I am occasionally a bit competitive. I just don't like losing and I love windsurfing.
"If you are going to carry on doing it, you have to be winning or at least in contention, and I love the Olympics - I think it is the best thing in the world; everything it stands for, I think, is pretty special."
Dempsey's coach, Dom Tidey, said: "What a way to go out. There was no stress and he could soak it all up. Hopefully it's not his last race at an Olympics, I'm going to try to convince him to do another!"
Also on Sunday, Britain's Bryony Shaw failed to medal in the women's RS:X, finishing ninth as France's Charline Picon took gold.
