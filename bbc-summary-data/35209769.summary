Doncaster Rovers Belles have signed England striker Natasha Dowie.

The 27-year-old scored four times for Liverpool in the WSL last year and has returned from a two-month loan spell at Australian side Melbourne Victory.
She has won 14 caps for England and was named 2013 FA Players' Player of the Year as she helped Liverpool win the first of two successive WSL titles.
She is the third Liverpool player to join Belles after Becky Easton and Katrin Omarsdottir signed on Thursday.
"I'm at a stage in my career where I have won a lot of things and I see Doncaster as an exciting, up and coming team with a great set-up," said Dowie, who scored the winning goal for Everton to beat Arsenal in the 2010 FA Women's Cup final.
"I know a lot of the players and think they, as well as the staff, are great characters on and off the pitch. The offer I was given ticked all of the boxes.
"I want to win silverware. I'm a winner full stop. I've come to Doncaster to win things or to at least challenge until the end.
"I want to bring lots of goals to the club this season. I'm a hard-worker who never gives up so I hope this will be appreciated by the players and fans," she added.
Doncaster boss Glen Harris feels the signing Dowie shows newly-promoted Doncaster will be a force in this year's Women's Super League.
"She is a winner and with her ability and desire to succeed, her arrival at the club is a significant statement of intent," he said.
"This was a considered decision from Tash. We know several clubs were keen to secure her signature but we are pleased she has committed to Belles - which again, with another quality signing, sends out a strong message."
