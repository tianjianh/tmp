The Aberystwyth store is due to open in spring 2017.
M&S announced this month it would shut 30 of its clothing and homeware shops and convert dozens more into food stores.
It said it was "really excited" about its Aberystwyth plans and had received positive feedback from the community.
It is due to open as part of a development in the town centre alongside Tesco, which opened its doors this week.
Twelve homes were demolished to make way for the stores.
