Armitage, 24, who will join Wasps next season and has had spells with London Scottish, London Irish and French Top 14 side Toulon, has scored 12 tries in 25 appearances for Welsh this term.
"Guy has been one of the stand-out performers in the Championship," said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young.
"He has a real hunger to get involved and can create as well as finish."
Armitage has represented England at every age-group level and played at the 2011 Junior World Championships in Italy.
"Dai Young shows great confidence in his squad and you can see the players have bought into his plan and excelled," Armitage told the club's website.
"For sure, it's an exciting new challenge for me and I feel I am ready."
Armitage joins fly-half Danny Cipriani, Ireland prop Marty Moore, and hookers Tommy Taylor and Tom Cruse as new arrivals at the Ricoh Arena for 2016-17.
