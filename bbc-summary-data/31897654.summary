Seven Somerset war memorials granted Grade II-listed status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven war memorials in Somerset have been granted Grade II-listed status by English Heritage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The memorials are in Brewham, Preston Plucknett, North Cheriton, The Charltons, Templecombe, Pen Selwood and Huish Episcopi.
The move is part of an English Heritage scheme to list up to 500 war memorials annually over the next five years to mark the centenary of World War One.
The War Memorials Trust is working with English Heritage on the project.
Roger Bowdler, from English Heritage, said: "These memorials will gain a place on the National Heritage List for England to tell the story of this country's sacrifice and struggle."
