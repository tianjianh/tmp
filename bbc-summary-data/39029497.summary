The firm's Bathgate facility produces, packages, stores and distributes patient kits for clinical trials.
The new roles include warehouse logistics, distribution and packaging equipment operators.
Catalent said the move was in response to increased demand from both UK and global customers.
The jobs announcement comes as the company prepares to celebrate 20 years at its Bathgate base, where it currently employs 220 people.
General manager Angela Cassidy said: "Our Bathgate facility plays a key role in Catalent's global network and we are proud of the work we do in helping important medicines reach patients.
"Catalent's commitment to the site is reflected in the significant investment and expansion that has taken place over the last two decades, including around Â£500,000 invested in the last year alone."
The Bathgate site, which was originally purpose-built as a clinical packaging and logistics facility, was officially opened in 1997.
A 20th anniversary celebration is being planned for later in the year to recognise the site's "past, present and future contributions to the development of new medications".
