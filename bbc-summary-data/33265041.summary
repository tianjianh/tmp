Former England boss Fabio Capello has left his role as Russia head coach after three years in the post.

The 69-year-old signed a four-year contract extension in 2014 to keep him under contract until the 2018 World Cup, which will be staged in Russia.
But the Italian's deal has been ended  after a run of poor results.
Russia have eight points from six games in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, and face the prospect of needing to win a play-off to reach the tournament.
They were knocked out of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil in the group stage without winning a game.
The Russian Football Union (RFU) said it had "reached an agreement to terminate his contract by mutual consent".
Reports in Russia suggest Capello has received 15m euros (Â£10.7m) in compensation from the RFU.
Last month, a group of fans launched a fundraising campaign to buy the Italian out of his contract.
