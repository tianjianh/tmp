The blaze started in an electrical fuse box in the ninth-floor flat in Millbank House, Graham Street, in the St Mary's area of the city, on Saturday evening.
Some residents who left their homes were unable to get back in while firefighters tackled the blaze.
It took crews from three stations an hour to extinguish the fire, which broke out shortly before 20:00 GMT. No-one was injured.
Southampton City Council has moved the family to emergency accommodation.
During such emergencies, the fire service said, residents in high-rise blocks are advised to remain in their flats unless their property is directly affected by fire or smoke.
A spokeswoman said the buildings were equipped with fire doors and warned that people moving through the building could be putting themselves in danger as well as hindering the emergency services.
