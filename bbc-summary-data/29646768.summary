Inspired by her Girl Guides' Promise, Betty Lowe, from Salford, has been helping people since joining the movement and remains an active member.
She was given David Cameron's Point of Light award, which recognises outstanding individual volunteers.
Miss Lowe, who has been volunteering at Salford Royal hospital for 40 years, has "enjoyed every minute of it".
"I never married or had children but I feel like I've spent my life surrounded by wonderful people who I care about very much," she said.
"I have never been one for sitting in front of the TV and always want to be out and about with people."
During her Girl Guides career Miss Lowe has been a leader, a district commissioner and vice president of Girlguiding in Greater Manchester West.
She has organised camping trips, trained guide leaders and to volunteers at Salford Royal hospital's cafe for the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS).
Mr Cameron said: "Betty is an incredible woman who has dedicated her life to volunteering.
"As an RVS volunteer for 40 years and a girl guide for 95 years, Betty has lived and breathed serving others. Her selfless, positive attitude is an inspiration."
David McCullough, chief executive for RVS, said: "She has spent her life helping others and yet doesn't see it as anything other than something she has greatly enjoyed."
