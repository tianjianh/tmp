A gardener has completed an attempt to break the world record for the fastest shed.

Kevin Nicks, from Great Rollright, Oxfordshire, got bored with his Volkswagen Passat and converted it into a shed on wheels.
Earlier, his unusual vehicle was clocked at an average of 70.8mph over two 100m runs during a day of record attempts near York.
Mr Nicks, 50, said he was happy to have achieved his goal.
He will now submit his results to Guinness World Records, which will decide if he has officially broken the previous record of 58.4mph.
Mr Nicks, who is hoping to use the vehicle as advertising space, said: "It's good to be getting the word out there, which will help as an advertising tool.
"I can say 'advertise on the side of the world's fastest shed'."
It took Mr Nicks seven months to transform his car, using steel beams and timber, and create his shed on wheels.
It is legal to drive on the road and can reach speeds of almost 80mph, he said.
Mr Nicks added: "I had the car sitting around and it was going to be scrap, but it was too good for scrap.
"It's fun, it makes everybody smile."
The record attempt was held at the 10th World Wheelie Championship at Elvington Airfield near York.
