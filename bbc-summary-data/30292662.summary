A Californian software firm is creating 89 jobs in Belfast with the development of a UK sales and operations centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Revel Systems makes technology that allows iPads to be turned into cash registers as well as allowing retailers to analyse sales, organise rotas and manage payrolls.
The product is mainly used by small and medium retailers and food businesses.
The Belfast investment is being supported with grants of almost Â£700,000.
Revel employs about 200 people worldwide but expects to grow to around 1,000 over the next 18 months.
The firm was founded in San Francisco in 2010 and recently raised $100m (Â£64m) in a third round of investment.
Lisa Falzone, the co-founder and chief executive, said the firm was "excited" about market opportunities in the UK and Europe.
She said: "We are excited to help European merchants take their businesses to the next level and are looking for dynamic leaders with real entrepreneurial spirit who can continually look for new creative solutions to meet customers' needs."
Point-of-sale technology, using tablet computers and cloud-based storage, is a growth industry.
Another US-based point-of-sale firm, Shopkeep, already has an operation in Belfast that employs about 35 people.
