Jackson Irvine: Ross County reject Burton Albion bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County have rejected a bid from Burton Albion for Australia midfielder Jackson Irvine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood that the offer is not being considered as it does not meet the Scottish Premiership club's valuation of the 23-year-old.
Irvine, who earned his fourth cap as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Greece this month, signed from Celtic last summer after a season on loan.
He made 46 appearances this season, helping County lift the League Cup.
The Dingwall club, who defeated Celtic 3-1 in the final, also finished sixth in the Premiership table.
Irvine began his senior career with Frankston Pines in his homeland before switching to Celtic.
However, he only made one substitute appearance for the Scottish champions and also spent a season on loan to Kilmarnock before joining County.
Albion are preparing for their first season in the Championship in England under manager Nigel Clough.
The Brewers won promotion after finishing runners-up in League One and have released Robbie Weir, while fellow midfielder Mark Duffy has moved to Sheffield United.
