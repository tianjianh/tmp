The 71-year-old, who also worked with the Scissor Sisters, Badly Drawn Boy and Klaxons, had fought lung cancer for the last two years.
Big Life Management, which Summers co-founded 29 years ago, said the music industry has "lost one of its most brilliant characters".
Summers's artists sold more than 60 million albums and 72 million singles.
He is survived by his wife Dianna and daughters Katie, Rio and Georgia.
A spokesman for Big Life Management also said Summers was one of the industry's "most vibrant, most notorious" personalities.
"A champion of new music, a non-conformist and a visionary, Jazz Summers will be greatly missed," he added.
Born in March 1944, Summers enrolled in military school aged 12 before joining the army at the age of 15. He served as a radiographer and spent time in Hong Kong and Malaysia.
Along with manager Simon Napier-Bell, Jazz helped Wham! break America in 1985 and become the first western pop group to tour China.
Summers formed his own management company, Big Life, with Tim Parry in 1986 and they also ran Big Life Records, which featured hundreds of music releases.
These included such artists as The Orb, Yazz - Summers's former wife, Coldcut, De La Soul and The Soup Dragons.
Summers also worked with Lisa Stansfield, Soul II Soul, La Roux and London Grammar.
He published his autobiography Big Life in September 2013.
