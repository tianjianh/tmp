Some of the biggest stars in the music world have been on stage at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, the most prestigious night in the pop calendar.

Sam Smith stole the show at the Grammy Awards, winning four awards as well as performing his hit Stay With Me with Mary J Blige.
But Madonna stole much of the attention on the red carpet, showing she is determined not to be overshadowed by the younger pop crowd.
The queen of pop later sang Living For Love with a pack of horned male dancers before being lifted to the skies.
Australian singer Sia - whose claim to fame is that she does not want to be famous - sang her hit Chandelier while facing the wall (right) while Bridesmaids actress Kristen Wiig and 12-year-old Maddie Ziegler danced in set made to look like a grotty, cluttered flat.
Sia had earlier arrived in a conspicuous disguise, accompanied by Ziegler.
Pharrell Williams was among the big winners, picking up three trophies as well as performing his song Happy while apparently dressed as a bell boy.
When Beck won best album, Kanye West invaded the stage and threatened to launch a tirade, before apparently thinking better of it and going back to his seat. In 2009, he grabbed the microphone from Taylor Swift as she tried to accept a prize at the VMAs.
Beck, who also won best rock album, performed a duet with Coldplay's Chris Martin.
Taylor Swift got a hand with her dress on the red carpet. She missed out on the awards for record of the year and song of the year.
The big-name pair-ups included Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, who performed Irving Berlin's Cheek To Cheek.
Rihanna arrived in a pink layered dress by Giambattista Valli.
Katy Perry mingled with fans before swapping fashion tips (possibly) with Rihanna.
Perry then changed clothes - and hair - to perform her ballad By the Grace of God as part of a poignant segment highlighting domestic abuse.
Kanye West appeared in a single spotlight to perform Only One, which he wrote with Sir Paul McCartney.
He later returned with Sir Paul and Rihanna to perform their joint collaboration FourFiveSeconds.
Jessie J and Sir Tom Jones, former co-stars on The Voice UK, got together for a duet of You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.
Charli XCX (left) and Iggy Azalea were up for record of the year for their hit Fancy - but lost out to Sam Smith.
Beyonce won three awards and also sang the gospel standard Take My Hand, Precious Lord.
Rita Ora warmed up for her performance at the Oscars later this month with an appearance at the Grammys.
Hard rock legends AC/DC opened the ceremony with Rock or Bust and Highway to Hell.
Recalling his Oscar-winning film role in Ray a decade ago, Jamie Foxx (right) got into character as Ray Charles as he joined Stevie Wonder to present the prize for record of the year.
