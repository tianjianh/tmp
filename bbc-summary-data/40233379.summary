[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four helpful goats are doing their bit for their local park in Brooklyn, USA, by eating their way through some of the mess left by a hurricane.

About 30 big trees were knocked down by a big storm called Hurricane Sandy in 2012, making big gaps in the forest.
The gaps became overgrown with weeds, but local residents didn't want big machines and chemicals to clear up the mess.
Instead they've recruited Max, Cinnamon, Unicorn, and Swirl - a team of forest goats, who are happy to eat everything!
They're gradually munching their way through the debris, to get the park back to normal!
