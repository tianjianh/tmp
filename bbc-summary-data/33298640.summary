A Royal Navy veteran who served on Arctic Ocean convoys to the Soviet Union in World War Two has received a medal from the Russian government.

Norman Waller, 90, from Scarborough, was awarded the Medal of Ushakov during the town's Armed Forces Day commemorations.
He served aboard destroyer HMS Westcott escorting merchant ships from Scotland.
Mr Waller said the medal was recognition for "all those who went out there and the ones who were lost."
The medal was presented by the Mayor of Scarborough Tom Fox and the town's Conservative MP Robert Goodwill, on behalf of the Russian Ambassador Alexander Yakvenko.
More than 3,000 men died during the maritime campaign that wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill was said to have called the "worst journey in the world".
The convoys transported crucial supplies and munitions to the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1945.
Mr Waller said that while there was the risk of attack from German submarines and aircraft, the weather was the biggest danger.
"These convoys didn't sail in the summer months they were only from the end of October," he said.
"The weather up there was diabolical."
"Spray coming over would be frozen by the time it hit the ship."
