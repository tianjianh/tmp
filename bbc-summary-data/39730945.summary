Maybin has been struggling with a wrist injury in recent years and withdrew from the Johannesburg Open in February.
He lost his European Tour Card at the end of 2014 and has admitted in a statement that he has found the last few years "challenging".
Maybin turned professional in 2005 and competed in both the US Open and the Open Championship.
He came close to winning only his third European Tour event in 2008 when he lost in a play-off at the South African Open.
The Northern Irishman finished the 2010 season in the top 40 in the Race to Dubai standings but has been troubled with the wrist problem since June 2015.
He played in a Pro-Am in South Africa last week on his return to action after 20 months out of the game.
After losing his European Tour card, Maybin had hoped to play in around 15 tournaments on the Challenge Tour the following season, before suffering the bad wrist injury in June.
