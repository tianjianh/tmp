[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work has begun to demolish a 1970s shopping centre in the centre of Oxford as part of a Â£440m redevelopment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Westgate development in the city centre will eventually have more than 100 shops, 25 restaurants and cafes, a cinema and 61 flats.
The multi-storey car park on the site was demolished last year. It will be replaced with a 1,000-space underground car park.
The development is due for completion in autumn next year.
It will include rooftop terrace dining and new public spaces.
Site owner Westgate Oxford Alliance, a joint venture between commercial property company Land Securities and The Crown Estate, said the development would cover 800,000 sq ft (74,322 sq m) when complete.
Preparatory work began in February 2015 following planning approval by Oxford City Council.
