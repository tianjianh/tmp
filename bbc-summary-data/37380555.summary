Mourinho made eight changes for Thursday's game, and a lacklustre display saw his side beaten 1-0.
Captain Wayne Rooney and full-backs Antonio Valencia and Luke Shaw were left at home to rest for Sunday's Premier League match (12:00 BST).
Mourinho said: "We go back to a normal team without so many changes."
Tonny Vilhena scored Feyenoord's winner late on, though Nicolai Jorgensen, who delivered the cross, was offside.
Defeat was United's fourth in a row in European away games, and came five days after a 2-1 home defeat by Manchester City.
Right-back Valencia and left-back Shaw were replaced by Matteo Darmian and Marcos Rojo respectively at De Kuip.
Ander Herrera, Anthony Martial, Juan Mata, Marcus Rashford, Morgan Schneiderlin and Chris Smalling were the other to come in.
Midfielder Paul Pogba kept his place - but the world record Â£89m signing from Juventus struggled to make an impact.
"I don't like to individualise too much," Mourinho said. "It's something I don't like.
"I think he was like the team. In the first half they were in control but were playing half pace.
"The second half was when they increased intensity and that was when they conceded the goal."
