A Glasgow DJ prompted concern that an iconic plain bread brand was under threat, after a social media post urging people to buy it.

Kodie Blak posted a picture of Mothers Pride Scottish Plain bread on Facebook and said due to falling sales only one factory now produced it.
The comment prompted concern about availability of the bread, and the post was shared more than 13,000 times.
The firm which produces the bread said it had no plans to stop producing it.
A spokeswoman for Hovis, which includes the Mothers Pride brand, said: "We know that Mothers Pride has a very loyal consumer base who are passionate about the Scottish batch loaf.
"We do love and appreciate the strong response of support we've seen from Scottish consumers."
Mothers Pride is a batch bread made in a large baking tray, which means the loafs only form a crust on the top and bottom.
It differs from a pan loaf, which is baked in an individual tray and so forms crust round the whole bread.
The two types of bread were immortalised in the Jeely piece song - a Scots folk song written in the 1960s - in the line: "If it's butter, cheese or jeely, if the bread is plain or pan".
Mothers Pride bread, which has been in production for 80 years, is made in Glasgow by the only batch plant left in the UK.
For a time in the 1970's and 80's it was one of the UK's best selling white breads.
