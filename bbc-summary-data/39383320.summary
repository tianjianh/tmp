Hurling League Division Two A: Antrim aim to clinch final spot by beating Westmeath

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antrim will hope to secure their place in the Division Two A Hurling League final by accounting for Westmeath on Sunday at Cushendall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A draw will be enough to secure the Saffrons a place in the final although the Antrim management will be demanding a conclusive victory.
The Saffrons have defeated Kildare, London and Armagh thus far in addition to an away draw in Carlow.
Carlow will be guaranteed a final place if they earn a home win over Armagh.
Defeat for Armagh could see them suffering relegation although London currently occupy the drop spot on scoring difference.
London face Kildare at Clane on the Sunday with the Lilywhites hoping that an Antrim or Carlow defeat could open their door to them qualifying for the Division Two A final.
The winners of the Division Two A final will then face the bottom team in Division One B in a promotion-relegation play-off.
