[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 2-1 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Jones' fifth goal of the season helped Port Vale maintain their 100 per cent home record as they came from behind to beat Gillingham at Vale Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Valiants' top scorer secured all three points after Remie Streete hauled his side back into the game following Josh Wright's opener for the visitors.
The Gills midfielder found the net from close range in the 25th minute, tapping in Cody McDonald's shot following a well-worked short corner.
But Streete was quickest to react after keeper Jonathan Bond parried Gezim Shalaj's shot back into the danger area for the defender to thump home the equaliser after 76 minutes.
The winner came just eight minutes later when Jones received the ball on the edge of the Gills penalty area and created space with some neat footwork before firing a low shot past Bond.
Vale were much improved after going a goal down and Streete almost levelled after 58 minutes but his low drive from Paulo Tavares' free-kick 20 yards out cannoned back off the upright.
