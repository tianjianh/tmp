A sketch by poet Dylan Thomas, discovered more than 60 years later, is to be sold at auction.

Thomas drew the 1949 sketch of a friend who had apparently collapsed during a pub crawl through London and gave it to another, saying: "Remember me".
It is part of a private collection due to go under the hammer in Cardiff on Saturday.
Auctioneers Rogers Jones & Co said the drawing had attracted "worldwide interest".
Ben Rogers Jones, from the firm, said: "Dylan Thomas has a huge following both in the UK and in the United States.
"This simple drawing gives us a fantastic, detailed account of a bohemian night out in Soho, 65 years ago almost to the day."
The drawing, which has a pre-sale estimate of £1,500 to £2,000, dates back to 4 September 1949.
"At this stage of the poet's life, it is safe to say that he was often drinking... and he was fully immersed in the London bohemian-set," a spokesman for the auctioneers said.
They said it was during a visit to Soho's Gargoyle Club that Thomas decided to draw a "symbolic picture" of his slumbering companion, Mably Owen, with a waiter and a staggering woman.
He is then believed to have folded the pencil sketch, before handing it to Mr Owens' wife, Daphne, saying: "Remember me".
The drawing is accompanied by a letter from Daphne Owen explaining how it came about.
Thomas, originally from Swansea, died in 1953 in New York.
