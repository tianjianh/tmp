Michael Tidser smacked the Championship side in front after seven minutes as Graeme Murty's temporary Ibrox reign, following Mark Warburton's departure on Friday, suffered an early setback.
Kenny Miller pulled Rangers level six minutes later with a deflected shot.
And Martyn Waghorn prodded home after the break for a deserved win.
Rangers and Morton had met on 14 previous occasions in the Scottish Cup, with the Cappielow outfit's only win being at Hampden in the 1922 final.
However, with Morton consistently punching above their weight in the second tier under Jim Duffy and with Rangers in turmoil, the travelling fans may well have fancied their chances.
Morton took early advantage of the sense of bewilderment at Ibrox. Defender Clint Hill rose to return Ricki Lamie's long ball back towards the Ton left-back but Andy Halliday, recalled to the starting line-up in place of Arsenal loan player Jon Toral, was caught out.
His slackness was seized upon by Tidser, who advanced towards the Rangers goal and dispatched Aidan Nesbitt's lofted pass with a venomous left foot to add to Rangers' woes.
Halliday was not the only player in blue looking on edge - Hill and the Swiss defender Philippe Senderos were harried well by the well-drilled Tidser and Nesbitt and had often to resort to backwards passes, adding to the unease emanating from the stands.
Indeed, a wayward header from Senderos at the start of the second half gave Morton a glorious chance to score their second but, with only the goalkeeper to beat, Nesbitt heaved his effort high over the bar from 18 yards.
Morton last won at Ibrox in November 1980, before any of the current Greenock players were born, and despite their confident displays in the Championship they seemed to lack the belief they could pull off a Scottish Cup Ibrox win with 83 minutes still to play.
Nesbitt was left isolated up front as Barrie McKay began to probe at the banks of yellow shirts before him.
The lively Rangers winger and Miller have been two of Rangers' best players this season and both were involved in the equaliser in 13 minutes. McKay blasted a shot which Gaston parried but the Ton keeper was helpless as Miller's left-foot drive flew into the net off Thomas O'Ware's heel for his ninth goal of the campaign.
And it was the eager McKay who supplied Emerson Hyndman at the edge of the box three minutes later. The American, on loan from Bournemouth, controlled the ball and turned in one move and only Gaston at full stretch denied him a goal.
Jason Holt headed wide from James Tavernier's curling cross as Morton retreated but the Ton's discipline and hard work were rewarded by going in at the interval on level terms.
The second half took its time to move through the gears, with that over-hit effort from Nesbitt matched in its wastefulness by a Waghorn shot wide of the net.
The hosts took the lead when Hyndman collected Holt's ball into the box and cleverly knocked it in the direction of Waghorn, who bundled it home from a few yards.
Jamie Lindsay sent a curling shot a yard wide of the Rangers goal and, in injury time, Luke Donnelly made it a trio of missed chances for the visitors when he pinged a shot over the crossbar after Ross Forbes had pounced on dithering by Lee Hodson and goalkeeper Wes Foderingham.
Duffy held his head in horror in the away dugout but he and his Morton players can hold their heads high at their display. They are well placed for a place in the Premiership play-offs, while Murty holds the fort at Ibrox until a new manager is appointed.
Rangers caretaker manager Graeme Murty: "It was a bit of a whirlwind really.
"I will take some time tonight to decompress and relax and possibly have a glass of wine and get my thoughts sorted out but I have to say I stood on the sidelines and thoroughly enjoyed watching the team play.
"I am just busy sorting out my head. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Does it drive me in a way for the future? I have no idea. I will sort my thoughts out later."
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "We put an awful lot into the game.
"I thought we scored an outstanding first goal and we had two fantastic chances. If you get chances like that at Ibrox you have to take one of them.
"Overall we can't complain about the performance, but ultimately it's about winning and we congratulate Rangers.
"We've got terrific character. We've got a young side but they've got great belief in each other and they work hard for each other.
"No matter who we play, we will always give them a game."
