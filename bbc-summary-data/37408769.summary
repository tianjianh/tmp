[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bayern Munich 3-0 Hertha BSC

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bayern Munich maintained their perfect start to the season as they moved back to the top of the Bundesliga with a comfortable victory over Hertha Berlin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Franck Ribery showed deft skill to swerve past two Hertha defenders and shoot low underneath Rune Jarstein as Bayern went ahead on 16 minutes.
Thiago Alcantara doubled their lead as he took advantage of a defensive lapse from the visitors in the area.
Moments later, Arjen Robben secured victory with a curling strike.
It was the Dutch international's first appearance of the season after overcoming a long-term groin injury and he capped it with a typical Robben finish, cutting in from the right to bend a left-footed shot inside the far post.
Hertha also came into the game, having won all three matches so far this season, but were outclassed by a dominant Bayern who reclaimed top spot from Borussia Dortmund, who beat Wolfsburg 5-1 on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, RB Leipzig were held at home 1-1 by Borussia Monchengladbach thanks to Fabian Johnson's late equaliser while Cologne moved up to second in the table with a 3-1 victory over strugglers Schalke.
Bayern Leverkusen played out a goalless draw against Augsburg and bottom side Werder Bremen once again failed to win as they were beaten 2-1 at home by Mainz.
