Two men have been arrested after a stolen car was "set on fire and abandoned" against the front door of a house in Larne, County Antrim.

The house was badly damaged in the incident in the Killyglen Road area of the town on Sunday afternoon.
The men, aged 24 and 34, are being questioned about the attack which was reported to police shortly before 16:45 BST.
It follows a series of arson attacks in Larne over recent days.
On Monday, a hair salon in the town was extensively damaged when a car was driven through its metal shutters.
It is not yet known if the Killyglen Road incident is linked to the previous attacks.
However, Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs, who represents East Antrim, said the latest incident "all the hallmarks of a tit-for-tat attack between feuding criminals".
"Another car has been set on fire and, with the risk of an exploding petrol tank, homes have been endangered along with the lives of local residents," he added.
Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said the attacks must "stop now before someone is injured or killed".
"This situation cannot be allowed to increase any further and I appeal to everyone involved to help put an end to things."
A Northern Ireland Ambulance Service spokesman told the BBC its staff were called to the scene just before 17:00 BST, after a report that the car has been driven into the house.
A number of people were assessed by paramedics but no-one was taken to hospital.
