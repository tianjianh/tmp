[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly 70 jobs have been saved in Scotland after a buyer was found for seven stores threatened by the collapse of discount shoe retailer Brantano.

Administrators PwC said a firm run by Alteri Investors bought Brantano shops in Inverurie, Inverness, Glasgow, Perth, Dundee, Elgin and Linwood.
A total of 68 Brantano staff are transferring to Alteri.
However, nearly 130 posts in Scotland remain under threat as 13 Scottish stores were not included in the deal.
Brantano went into administration in January, about four months after the chain was bought by an investment firm.
Trading continued while a buyer was sought.
PwC announced on Monday that the majority of the UK-wide business had been sold to Alteri, preserving 1,372 jobs and 140 stores and concessions.
However, 58 stores and concessions were not included in the Alteri acquisition, including 13 stores in Scotland.
They include: Coatbridge (11 staff), Aberdeen (8), Clydebank (11), Ayr (10), Wishaw (11), Dumfries (7), Irvine (12), Glasgow - Partick (8), Glenrothes (7), Edinburgh - Straiton (11), Lanark (12), Linlithgow (10) and Kilmarnock (11).
Lead administrator Tony Barrell said: "We continue to trade the remaining Brantano business whilst discussions with interested parties continue.
"Unfortunately, in the event further sales are not possible, redundancies will become inevitable.
"We are working closely with Brantano employees and offering every support possible through this difficult period."
