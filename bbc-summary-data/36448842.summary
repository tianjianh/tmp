The 53-year-old Scot replaced Paul Lambert at Ewood Park on a two-year deal after he left his role with Major League Soccer side Houston Dynamo.
There has been some negative reaction to the ex-Burnley manager's arrival, with a petition set up against him.
"I'm not naive in any respect. I understand opinion, people will have an opinion about me," said Coyle.
He told BBC Radio Lancashire: "I would suggest if Jose Mourinho came in here there would have been some fans that were not happy about him, so that's not making light of it.
"I certainly understand that local rivalry and everything that goes with it, then it might be a bit more dividing of people. All I would say is when you come along, come and support your team, get behind your team because that is the key.
"I've been in the game long enough to understand those opinions."
The Lancashire "Cotton Mill" derby between Blackburn and Burnley is considered to be one of the most passionate in England, with just 14 miles separating the two founder members of the Football League.
Coyle won promotion to the Premier League in 2009 with the Clarets before his move to Bolton halfway through the following season.
"Of course there's that rivalry, I understand that, I get that," added Coyle. "But this is an unbelievable job at a fantastic club.
"People will have their opinion but that doesn't alter the fact that it has got an outstanding supporter base and it's up to us to give those fans something to shout about on the field.
"Of course you weigh up everything, but it's a great opportunity to move forward."
