Lego renditions of some of the world's most famous buildings have gone on show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An exhibition of more than 50 pieces of Warren Elsmore's work - known as Brick City - opened at the Harley Gallery, near Worksop, Nottinghamshire.
The former IT consultant's creations include Rome's Trevi Fountain, the Reichstag and Battersea Power Station with a flying pig.
Included in the exhibition is a 5ft by 5ft model of St Pancras Station.
Mr Elsmore, who makes Lego buildings full-time, said: "We will sit there, look at the pictures and then something in the back of my brain will click that I need a certain part in a certain colour, and a certain orientation.
"I'll get that part and we will start building. Normally we just do it by eye."
The exhibition runs until January.
