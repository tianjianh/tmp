Rio 2016: Russia names 68-strong athletics squad for Olympics despite ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russia has named a 68-strong athletics team for this summer's Rio Olympic Games, despite being banned from international competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Athletics' governing body first imposed the ban in November following allegations of widespread state-sponsored doping in the country.
The Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) and its athletes last week appealed against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).
A final decision is due by 21 July.
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has said a handful of Russian athletes could compete in Rio as "neutral athletes".
To do so, they must meet a number of criteria, including being repeatedly tested outside their homeland.
Russian doping whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova has been cleared to run and was described as a "symbol" for clean competitors.
The All-Russian Athletics Federation (Araf) on Tuesday published a list of the 68 athletes it said had met its criteria for taking part in the Olympics, which start on 5 August.
Two-time Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva and London 2012 high jump gold medallist Ivan Ukhov are included.
Araf said each of its athletes has "sent an individual request to the Olympic Games" to be checked by the IAAF, as "Araf is not now a member".
It said it had also appealed about the "overall legality of adding extra criteria for the participation of sportsmen competing at the Olympics".
The International Olympic Committee's deadline to achieve qualifying criteria for the Games is 11 July, though the ROC says that would be extended should Cas rule in favour of its athletes.
