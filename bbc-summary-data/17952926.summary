Hand washing in hospitals halves superbug infections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign that was launched in hospitals encouraging people to wash their hands has helped halve the number of "superbug" infections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Superbugs are germs that antibiotic drugs can't destroy, so if people get ill, they can't be treated.
In hospitals, the bugs can spread easily from patient to patient.
During the government's "Clean Your Hands" campaign, the amount of soap and hand gel being used in hospitals tripled.
The campaign has now finished but it's hoped hospitals will carry on the hand washing practices highlighted.
