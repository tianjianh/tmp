The 27-year-old Honduras international has signed a four-year deal at the Britannia Stadium.
Stoke manager Tony Pulis said: "This is a fantastic deal for the club because Wilson has proved himself to be a top class performer at the highest level."
Palacios moved to Spurs in a £12m deal from Wigan Athletic.
The move was finalised close to the end of the transfer window after Palacios passed a medical and agreed personal terms.
He made 22 starts for Spurs last season and featured for his country at the World Cup in South Africa, playing three times.
Pulis added: "He has a considerable amount of international experience and played a prominent part in getting Tottenham into the Champions League only two years ago.
"He has great energy and the qualities to become a driving force in the middle of the park, the type of player our fans will love.
"We have been looking to stregthen our options in midfield and I am delighted to have him on board."
Palacios follows Jonathan Woodgate, who completed a free transfer from Spurs to Stoke earlier this summer.
Stoke later broke their transfer record to sign striker Peter Crouch from Tottenham in a £12m deal.
