Zookeepers in Indonesia have moved a smoking orangutan away from visitors to a small island to help her quit the habit.

Tori, an orangutan from a zoo in Solo in central Java, has been smoking cigarettes thrown into her cage for a decade.
She was moved along with her male companion, Didik. Both are now on the island within the zoo, keepers said.
She started smoking by mimicking humans, they said.
Tori would reportedly pick up butts that were still lit, hold them between her fingers and begin puffing.
Didik, on the other hand, would stamp on the butts to put them out, local media reports said.
"A common problem for zoos in Indonesia are naughty visitors," zoo director Lilik Kristianto was quoted as saying in the Jakarta Globe newspaper.
"Although there are sign prohibiting them from giving food or cigarettes to the animals, they keep on doing it."
Tori is one of four endangered orangutans at the Taru Jurug Zoo.
