Model railway to be removed from attic for train display

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An intricate model train set that took an enthusiast more than 60 years to put together in his attic is to be exhibited by rail enthusiasts.

The display featuring thousands of pieces was created by Laurence Teague, of Redditch, Worcestershire, who died last year aged 74.
It is yet to be decided when the removal process can start.
The Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway plans to exhibit part of the display in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire.

A spokesperson for the heritage railway added because of the size of the display, which runs 32ft by 11ft, (9.7m by 3.3m) it would not be able to display the entire works due to the likelihood of damage occurring in the removal process.
The model collection is currently in the loft of Mr Teague's house. His widow Gail said he had shown an interest in railways since the 1940s.
"Any form of locomotion interested Laurence. He started the collection before he even knew me. It was a passion he had all his life."
She added: "He wasn't allowed to put up the railway display in the loft until I knew he was up there doing the rooms in the house first. It took him a year to do up every room in the house; and he spent half a year doing up his railway display."
Mr Teague, founder of Teague's Television in Redditch, donated the display in his will to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway.
Mrs Teague said her late husband would have wanted people to enjoy the display, but added she would be upset when the railway collection was taken from the loft.
"His humour is up there. His personality is up there. It's so much of him," she said.
