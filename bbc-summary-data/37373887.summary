ITV is reportedly planning a nightly celebrity-based entertainment show that could push the News at Ten to 22:30.

According to Broadcast, the currently untitled show will begin in 2017 and have a regular time slot throughout the week across a two-month period.
It claimed the show will have revolving celebrity hosts and have segments with the potential to be shared online.
The programme could be aired at 22:30 or earlier at 22:00, which would mean the News at Ten would be shown later.
Broadcast magazine likened the show to The Late Late Show with James Corden, which has had great success on US network CBS, especially with its Carpool Karaoke and Drop the Mic segments.
ITV told BBC News it was "looking at an entertainment show for the new year" and said "more details will be confirmed in due course, including scheduling".
"There are occasions when the main bulletin moves for big entertainment event programming or sport," a spokesperson for the channel continued.
"However, we have no plans to permanently move the news from the 10pm slot."
Previous attempts to launch a nightly chat show in the UK include The Jack Docherty Show, which ran on Channel 5 from 1997 and 1999.
Graham Norton also had a nightly talk show, V Graham Norton, that ran on Channel 4 from May 2002 to December 2003.
