Selby, 28, the younger brother of world champion Lee Selby, faces Cristofer Rosales, ranked seven by the WBO, at Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena on 26 May.
Wales' most decorated amateur boxer in history is unbeaten in eight bouts since turning professional in September 2015 and also has a top 10 WBO rating.
"I'm getting closer to my dream of becoming a world champion," Selby said.
"It's great to be back boxing in Wales in the biggest test of my pro career so far.
"This WBC world title eliminator will put me in touching distance of following in the footsteps of Lee."
Nicaraguan Rosales, 22, is a stablemate of former four-weight world champion Roman Gonzalez, and will travel to Cardiff on the back of a 13-fight winning streak.
"Rosales is one place above me in the WBC world rankings and from what I've seen of him he looks a dangerous fighter," Selby confirmed.

"These are the tests I need to bring out my best, training is going well and you'll see the best version of me."
Rosales, however, is confident in his own credentials.
"This is a massive fight for me," he said.
"I'm in the best shape of my career and I will beat Selby. Selby was a very good amateur but I'm from the Managua school of hard knocks and I know that I'll have too much for him."
In the other headline fight, Cardiff's Craig Kennedy challenges Blackpool's English cruiserweight champion Matty Askin for the vacant British cruiserweight title.
