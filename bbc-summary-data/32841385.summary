The theatre closed in March and had been expected to reopen in time of for the annual pantomime in December.
It was built on the site of the medieval St Leonard's Hospital and it was thought the hospital foundations had been destroyed.
However, archaeologist have found the medieval foundations intact beneath the main auditorium.
Ben Reeves, from York Archaeological Trust, said:  "It is amazing that considering all the alterations to the theatre so much of the medieval hospital has survived under the stalls and elsewhere within the building.
"The remains are an exciting and important discovery for both archaeologists and the public."
St Leonard's Hospital was founded in the 13th Century but closed in the 1530s as part of the dissolution of the monasteries.
The Grade-II listed theatre was originally constructed amidst the hospital ruins in 1744.
It was enlarged in the 1760s and was refurbished in the Victorian style in the 1880s. A modernist glass extension was added in 1967.
The theatre said this year's pantomime would be held in a semi-permanent, purpose-built auditorium at the National Railway Museum (NRM).
All 13,500 people who have bought tickets will receive a letter offering them seats of a similar value for the production at the NRM.
The York Conservation Trust said the building would reopen in time for the spring 2016 season.
