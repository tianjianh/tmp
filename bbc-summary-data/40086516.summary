Dan Biggar: Wales fly-half enjoying Lions learning curve

Wales' Dan Biggar says he is learning a great deal from his British and Irish Lions fly-half rivals ahead of this summer's Test series in New Zealand.

Biggar has won 56 Wales caps, but has been selected for his first Lions tour.
The 27-year-old along with Ireland's Jonathan Sexton and Owen Farrell of England are the three number 10s in coach Warren Gatland's 41-man squad.
"What I've found really interesting with Johnny and Owen is the amount you pick up off them," Biggar said.
"It's good to see how clever their brains are and how they understand the game and get a different perspective on 10 play."
The Wales player has established himself in recent years as his country's first-choice fly-half and is setting his sights on a Test start.
But he is more than willing to put personal rivalry to one side for the greater good of the team.
The Lions are aiming for back-to-back series wins for the first time since 1974, having won in Australia four years ago - also under the charge of Gatland.
"Obviously we're all competing for the same position and we all want to be playing in that 10 shirt," Biggar said.
"But the most important thing rather than the battle for places is that we do everything on and off the field and for boys playing in different games.
"We have to back them up as much as possible because the greater gain would be the Lions winning the series in New Zealand, which would be absolutely historical."
Ospreys fly-half Biggar says he will not make any drastic changes to the way he plays the game.
He is among the more vocal and outwardly confident players in the Wales team and feels his outspoken nature can benefit the Lions.
"You want your 10 to have a bit of authority and bit of confidence to push you round the field a bit, rather than be softly, softly," Biggar said.
"You have to find out who can take a little bit more of a kick up the backside or some boys may be a bit more softly, softly.
"It's about driving standards and leading the team around the pitch."
Biggar has been sharing a room with Sexton and says the pair, who both make their feelings known to their team-mates on the pitch, get along well.
"It's been the 'narkiest' room in the hotel but otherwise it's been a really good week.
"We've always got on well when we've played against each other and it's really good to get to play alongside him and challenge him, as much as he's probably looking to challenge myself and Owen."
