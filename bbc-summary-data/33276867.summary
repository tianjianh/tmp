Saved by the Bell actor Dustin Diamond has been sentenced to four months in jail for a bar fight during which a man was stabbed.

Diamond - who played Screech in the TV show - was convicted earlier this month of two charges of carrying a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct.
The 38-year-old actor had said he was defending his fiancee and had not intended to stab anyone.
He has been ordered to report to jail on Sunday to start his sentence.
Diamond left the courtroom in Wisconsin without commenting.
The fight happened on 25 December in Port Washington, Wisconsin, while Diamond was with partner Amanda Schutz.
Diamond said a group in the bar wanted to pose for pictures but others were badgering him and Schutz, and he tried to help her by brandishing his pocketknife to deter the group.
The man who was stabbed was not seriously injured.
As well as his role in the 90s high school-set sitcom, Diamond appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in the UK in 2013.
