[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paris St-Germain saw their title party fall flat as the Ligue 1 champions lost 2-0 to second-placed Monaco to suffer a first home league loss since May 2014.

A week after securing a fourth straight title, PSG were beaten for only the second time in the league this season.
Vagner Love swept Monaco in front from Thomas Lemar's 65th-minute cross.
David Luiz then pulled back Fabinho to concede a penalty which the Brazilian coolly chipped home as Monaco won after three successive draws.
PSG were guilty of a handful of bad misses as they lacked their usual intensity on what should have been a night of celebration at the Parc des Princes.
Top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic could have scored a hat-trick, while substitute Jean Kevin-Augustin also steered wide from close range late on.
The visitors moved within 22 points of PSG but more importantly went six points clear of fourth-placed Lyon as they look to secure Champions League qualification.
The top three clubs in France gain a place in the Champions League with the top two going straight into the group stage.
