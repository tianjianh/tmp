Rob Baxter: Exeter Chiefs coach not surprised by lack of international call-ups

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter head coach Rob Baxter says his side need to perform consistently at a "high intensity" if they are to earn more international recognition.

Chiefs, third in the Premiership, had only four players included in squads for this year's Six Nations.
That compares to the seven players called up from each of leaders Wasps, second-placed Saracens and fourth-placed Bath's squads.
Asked if that was a surprise, Baxter replied: "not particularly".
"You've got to understand that although we've finished the end of the season very well and we had guys away on Saxons duty and other internationals, we actually didn't start this season very well," he told BBC Radio Devon.
"We weren't performing either as a team or individually at the intensity that you need to to demand an international selection.
"I think Luke Cowan-Dickie is getting close now, you can see the level of his performances the last month or so have been fantastic, and I think Henry [Slade] is very close.
"But overall if we want to drive our players into the international setups we have to perform at a very high intensity and as individuals they have to perform at a very high intensity."
