The 26-year-old former Birmingham City trainee has made 60 appearances for the Glovers since signing from Exeter City in June 2014.
"He's been superb between the sticks," said Yeovil manager Darren Way. "He's kept us in many games with his bravery.
"He is a quality goalkeeper and I see him playing a major role in us becoming a force in League Two next season."
Poland-born Krysiak had loans spells with then Scottish Premier side Gretna, York City, Swansea City, Motherwell and Burton Albion, before leaving St Andrew's for Exeter in 2010.
Along with Omar Sowunmi, Ben Tozer, Nathan Smith, Ryan Dickson and Francois Zoko, Krysiak was one of six players offered a new deal.
Yeovil let 10 players go, including fellow keeper Chris Weale, following their 19th-place finish in League Two, 14 points above the relegation zone.
