[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tipuric, 27, has not played since suffering concussion playing for Wales against Italy on 19 March.
The 2013 British and Irish Lion missed Wales' summer tour of New Zealand as a result of the injury.
Ospreys will be without a number internationals who did play on the tour, including Alun Wyn Jones, Rhys Webb, Dan Lydiate and Dan Biggar.
Tipuric fell heavily at a lineout in the 64-17 Six Nations win over Italy and missed the remainder of the 2015-16 season.
He returned to training with the region in early July and said at the time: "I'm feeling healthy and enjoying pre-season."
Ospreys (v Belgium): Dafydd Howells; Tom Williams, Joe Thomas, Jonathan Spratt (Capt), Keelan Giles; Luke Price, Matthew Aubrey; Gareth Thomas, Hugh Gustafson, Rhodri Jones, Rhys Jones, Rory Thornton, Josh Cole, Justin Tipuric, Rob McCusker.
Replacements: Alex Dunham, Rowan Jenkins, Ma'afu Fia, Mitchell Walsh, Tyler Ardron, Joe Bearman, Tom Grabham, Josh Matavesi, Ashley Beck, Morgan Williams.
