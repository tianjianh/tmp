The Leeds site is home to rugby league side Leeds Rhinos, rugby union side Yorkshire Carnegie and Yorkshire County Cricket Club.
Plans include a new South Stand on the rugby ground and a new joint stand overlooking both the rugby pitch and cricket ground.
A public consultation over the proposals is due to start in February.
The capacity of the cricket ground would increase under the plans with the aim of hosting matches in the 2019 Cricket World Cup and securing future Test matches.
Plans were revealed in 2014 for a Â£50m revamp of the cricket ground, which currently holds about 17,000 spectators.
The new combined stand proposes about 4,200 seats for cricket and 3,800 facing the rugby pitch.
The new South Stand for the rugby stadium has a planned capacity of 7,700 with 2,200 being seated.
Gary Hetherington, Leeds Rhinos chief executive, said: "It will present a major construction challenge and inevitably cause some disruption for all teams during that period.
"Our [rugby] stadium capacity will reduce to just over 13,000 for a period during the 2017 season."
Funding is to be provided by a combination of public and private sources including Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Leeds Rhinos.
Leeds Rhinos also plan to sell sites in Weetwood and Tingley for housing development with the receipts invested in the scheme.
Consultation events are planned including a four-day exhibition at the Headingley ground.
