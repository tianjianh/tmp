West Ham are one point above the relegation zone after failing to win in their last five Premier League games.
Sullivan said the 48-year-old did an "amazing" job in his first season in charge, as the club finished seventh.
"Slaven cares passionately and this defeat will be hurting him as much as anyone," he told the club website.
"I have no doubts that he is doing everything he can to address the situation and everyone is working together to ensure we turn our season around."
Bilic said he was "humiliated" by Saturday's defeat at London Stadium, where West Ham have only won twice in the league since their move from Upton Park in the summer.
"Despite what some people have said, there is still a great spirit among the players and everyone is working towards the same objective," added Sullivan.
"We all need to stick together and get behind the team. We are all part of the West Ham United family and in hard times families pull together."
