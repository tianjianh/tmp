[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A crowd of 3319 saw the visitors move ahead through an Andy Graham header and a Craig Moore penalty.
Brian Gilmour was sent off for handball on the goal-line and Michael Moffat reduced the deficit from the spot on the stroke of half-time.
Joe Cardle beat the offside trap to level and the winner came from Faissal El Bakhtaoui's deflected strike.
With closest challengers Peterhead also winning, Dunfermline's lead stays at eight points with a game in hand.
The Pars were well on top before Graham stunned them by thundering home a header from a corner and worse was to come for the hosts when a defensive mix up led to Alan Forrest beings brought down for Moore's successful spot-kick.
The game turned back in the Fife side's favour when Gilmour elected to prevent Josh Falkingham's header with his arm.
Moffat converted from the penalty spot to begin the comeback.
Cardle's shot for the leveller squeezed in despite the gallant efforts of Nicky Devlin and, with all the momentum and an extra player, Dunfermline went on to claim all three points.
Top-scorer El Bakhtaoui cut in from the right hand and from 22 yards his shot was taken beyond Greg Fleming by a touch off a defender.
