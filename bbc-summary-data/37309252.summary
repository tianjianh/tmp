PS4 Pro: How does it compare to Nintendo NX and Xbox Scorpio?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tech company Sony has just revealed a brand new console - the PS4 Pro.

The console was unveiled at a big event in New York, in America, three years after the PS4 came out.
It will be released in November and will cost around Â£300.
Makers at Sony have said that the new console will be able to stream videos in 4K, which means that games will look better and will be higher quality.
It will also support Playstation VR, which means players will be able to play games on it using a virtual reality headset.
They also said it would have a faster processer, meaning that it can cope with the higher quality graphics, without glitching.
Players would still be able to play PS4 games on the console.
Enter the NX, Nintendo's top secret new console.
There are currently no pictures of the console, but there have been lots of hints and rumours about what it will be like.
Earlier this year Nintendo applied for a patent, which means that they have legal protection from people copying their idea.
In this patent there are suggestions that they could be making a 'hybrid' console, that could be plugged into a TV and played at home, and also unplugged and used out and about.
There are also rumours that it will use game cartridges, like older Nintendo consoles and Game Boys.
As well as that Nintendo have supposedly been looking into Virtual Reality, so could the new NX also be VR headset compatible?
Gamers will have to wait until March 2017 to see what the console looks like when it is launched.
Microsoft also have a huge new console under their belts which won't appear until late next year.
It's another top secret project, code named: Project Scorpio.
The head of Xbox games marketing Aaron Greenburg has said it will: "change the way we think about the future of console gaming."
From what we know, the Xbox Scorpio will have similar features to the PS4 Pro.
It will be able to play games in super high quality 4K, and old Xbox games will still be compatible.
Makers have also strongly hinted that the console will be playable with a Virtual Reality headset.
Nothing has been announced about how much the console will cost, but experts have been suggesting it might cost around Â£500.
So it seems that the next generation of consoles will all be sporting super-high quality graphics, and perhaps leaning to towards more Virtual Reality gaming experiences.
