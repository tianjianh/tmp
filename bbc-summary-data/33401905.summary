Ban on MLA office party emblems and flags proposed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The panel that sets the Northern Ireland Assembly's pay and allowances has proposed a ban on flags, party emblems and memorials at MLAs' offices.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The latest report by Stormont's Independent Financial Review Panel covers office costs, travel expenses and childcare expenditure.
The panel is consulting on new restrictions on assembly members' rent allowances and mileage claims.
It proposes that politicians should register their attendance at Stormont.
It says that offices are funded for assembly members to serve their constituents rather than for party political purposes.
In future, the only logo that should appear is the assembly flax flower, the panel's report recommends.
The panel has also proposed that assembly members' expenses should be docked if they do not electronically register their attendance at Parliament Buildings for at least 99 days a year.
Other proposals include a cap on constituency office rent of ??8,000 per year, and a ban on home-to-office mileage claims for MLAs, which it is believed could save ??74,000 per year.
The panel is looking for responses to their suggestions before 11 September.
