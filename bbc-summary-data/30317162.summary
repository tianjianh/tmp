[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry teacher charged with child sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A PE teacher in Coventry has been charged with child sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Maycock, who taught at Caludon Castle School, is accused of three counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.
The 43-year-old of Swanage Green, Walsgrave, was arrested on 14 November last year after an allegation of assault against a 15-year-old girl.
He was charged on Tuesday and is due to appear before magistrates in Coventry on 16 December.
In a statement, Coventry City Council said: "As legal proceedings are now active, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time.
"The council and the school are cooperating fully with the police on this investigation."
Caludon Castle School, in Axholme Road, declined to comment.
