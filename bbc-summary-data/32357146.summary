SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond were campaigning together, saying the party stands for new progressive politics.
But Scots Labour leader Jim Murphy said his party could change the UK forever.
Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has called for more oil and gas apprenticeships.
The Conservatives and the SNP were both out campaigning in the north east of Scotland.
What are the top issues for each political party at the 2015 general election?
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Ms Sturgeon said: "In this election Scotland has an opportunity like never before to make its voice heard at Westminster, but it is clear that the only party who can be that voice is the SNP."
Mr Salmond added: "Ours will be a voice for a new, better and more progressive politics at Westminster - for everyone across these islands."
But Lib Dem deputy leader Sir Malcolm Bruce has warned a clean sweep for the SNP, with polling suggesting the party is on course for a significant number of MPs, could give them no representation in government.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We are finding that people are voting tactically because if you take these polls all the way through, Scotland could effectively put itself out of reach of being part of any government because we have elected nobody of the governing party, whatever it is."
Meanwhile, the party's Jo Swinson pledged Â£800m for the NHS in Scotland.
"This would enable us to bring mental health services for young people out of the shadows," she said.
Mr Murphy is arguing that it is Scottish Labour which can offer progressive change in government.
He said: "In just 19 days time the people of Scotland face a simple choice.
"They can vote to change Scotland and the UK forever with the Labour party, or austerity max with the SNP's plans for full fiscal autonomy."
Ms Davidson, on a visit to Aberdeen, highlighted a Tory pledge to create an extra 10,000 apprentices by the end of the decade.
She said:  "I'd like to see many of these new apprenticeships designed for the north east's oil and gas sector - because we know that there is still a great future for thousands of Scots in our energy business.
"The more Scottish Conservative MPs we return in May, the more we can drive forward our positive plan for a growing economy and a skilled workforce."
