The iron cannon ball could have been fired in the decisive Battle of Naseby, Derbyshire-based auctioneers Hansons said.
Other finds include 17th Century belt buckles, bottle seals and rifle flints.
The items were discovered in gardens around Lutterworth, Leicestershire, over the last 40 years.
Charles Hanson, owner of Hansons, said it is "extraordinary" for so many items from the period to have been found in residents' gardens.
"We understand [the cannon ball] was discovered by someone clearing their vegetable patch," he said.
"The iron cannon ball measures five inches in diameter and it's certainly a heavy weight. It was found quite a depth underground.
"It's amazing what objects can be found in a garden."
Mr Hanson added the cannon ball was confirmed by Leicestershire Museums and Art Gallery as being similar to ones found nearby in Naseby, Northamptonshire.
The items are set to be auctioned on 25 July, with the cannon ball given a guide price of between £50 and £100.
