Wigan Athletic 2-2 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich missed the chance to climb into the Championship's top six after Omar Bogle's second-half double earned struggling Wigan a point.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nelson Oliveira's looping header from Alex Pritchard's set-piece had given Norwich a deserved first-half lead.
But Bogle's near-post header from a corner and cleanly struck free-kick put the hosts ahead as they battled back.
Mitchell Dijks then nodded level from a Norwich corner and both sides searched for a late winner that would not come.
Wigan remain 23rd, five points below 21st-placed Burton with a game in hand, while Norwich stay seventh but move to within two points of sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday.
The Canaries had put the ball in the net on 25 minutes when Russell Martin headed in on the rebound after a Jonny Howson effort bounced off the woodwork, but the linesman's flag was already raised for offside.
However, not long after the visitors - bidding for a fourth straight win - did take the lead as Oliveira netted his eighth league goal of the season.
After the break, Wigan sprung to life and former Grimsby striker Bogle's quickfire brace on his first start for the Latics turned the game around.
But Dijks' header soon had the visitors back on level terms to deny Wigan a seventh league win of the season.
The hosts, who had failed to scored in nine of their past 12 home league games, could have won it late on but Norwich keeper John Ruddy saved well from Jake Buxton.
Wigan Athletic boss Warren Joyce: "I'm disappointed we did not end up winning the game, because I felt we deserved the three points.
"I was happy with the whole team - the effort, the commitment, the work-rate, the desire.
"We were good value to have taken the lead, and it's disappointing not to see it through."
Norwich City boss Alex Neil: "We were the better side in the first half and we controlled the game - we should have been more than 1-0 up.
"The frustration for me is that the goal that Russell Martin scored was onside, having watched it back.
"We were frustrated tonight as a group. We feel we should have won it. We made it difficult for ourselves."
