A mine shaft has opened up under the patio of a house in Cornwall.

The 300ft (92m) deep shaft at Scorrier was discovered when surveyors were checking the site for the sale of the empty house.
It is thought to be a remnant of Cornwall's tin mining industry in the 18th Century and will be recapped with concrete.
Former mining consultant Alan Buckley said old shafts were capped by railway sleepers which rotted over the years.

But many of the older mines were not marked on records.
"You often get collapses after long periods of rain, which we have had," he said.
"Scorrier is in the area of the old Great North Downs Mines, a major part of the tin mining industry in Cornwall, so it's not surprising to find collapses here."
Stuart Dann, who runs Cornwall mine survey firm Mining-Eye in Cornwall said: "The area was completely different in the 18th Century with dozens of engine houses and hundreds of shafts.
"The area is like a massive bit of Swiss cheese.
"There have been several old mines opening up recently, including one at Telegraph Hill in St Day which is 200ft (61m) deep."
Structural engineers are deciding the future of the house.
