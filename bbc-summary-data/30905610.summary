A man in his 50s died on Tuesday after falling from the roof of a new farm building he was working on at Derrycarne Road near Portadown.
Another man was injured. His condition is not thought to be life-threatening.
As the men were working on a building rather than farming project, it is not being treated as a farm death.
The accident happened Road shortly before 13:30 GMT.
Both men were foreign nationals. The man who died had not been named.
DUP councillor Jonathan Buckley said the farmer was devastated by what had happened.
