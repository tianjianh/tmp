Chris Gayle century sees West Indies beat England at World Twenty20

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Gayle's brutal unbeaten century sent England to a chastening six-wicket defeat by West Indies in their opening match of the World Twenty20 in Mumbai.

Gayle struck 11 sixes in his 47-ball hundred, the joint-third fastest in T20 internationals, and became the first man to score two tons in the World T20.
He took West Indies to their target of 183 with 11 balls to spare.
Joe Root earlier made 48 in a total of 182-6, the highest score England have failed to defend in a Twenty20.
England, champions in 2010, next meet South Africa on Friday knowing that defeat would push them to the verge of elimination.
Despite lifting the trophy six years ago, England have lost 15 of the 27 matches they have played in World T20 tournaments.
England's chances of success were always going to rest on containing Gayle and, at first, he was kept quiet by only facing 18 of the first 48 balls in the West Indies innings.
However, he exploded to life by hitting Adil Rashid for two huge sixes over long-on and, after that, decimated the England attack.
Ben Stokes was twice sent over the square-leg fence, while three successive straight maximums off Moeen Ali in the 14th over effectively ended the contest.
Two more leg-side sixes off David Willey took him through the 90s and a single off Stokes saw Gayle match the three figures he reached in the very first World T20 match against South Africa in 2007.
The suspicion before the tournament was that England's bowling could be a weakness - though captain Eoin Morgan said pre-match that he was not worried - and the inaccuracy of the attack was exposed by the brilliant Gayle, who was barely asked to hit square of the wicket on the off side.
The evening dew made gripping the ball difficult, but the pace attack still failed to use English-style conditions of a green-tinged pitch and swing in the air.
Too often the pace quartet of Willey, Chris Jordan, Stokes and Reece Topley missed their lengths, either with short balls or full tosses, while England also managed to bowl 10 wides.
Rashid briefly impressed with his leg-spin before he was belted out of the attack by Gayle.
England were well placed when Root and Alex Hales shared 55 for the second wicket, but stalled after Hales was yorked by left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn.
They had reached 92-1 from 11 overs but, after Hales' departure, added 36 in the next five overs, finding the boundary only three times as West Indies took pace off the ball.
Root's classy 48 was ended when he slapped Andre Russell to mid-off, with scoring given a late boost by three sixes from Jos Buttler and Morgan's unbeaten 27 from 14 balls.
England's total looked competitive. Gayle proved it was anything but.
Man of the match Chris Gayle: "It was a fantastic innings and I'm really happy to have finished the game, I didn't leave it for anyone. Sulieman Benn said to me I had to go out and entertain him, that gave me that spark as well."
England captain Eoin Morgan: "I thought it was a competitive total. We would have liked 200, 220 probably would have been a winning total but we never really took the game away from them. Once Gayle gets himself in he's hard to stop."
West Indies captain Darren Sammy: "It's always a joy to watch Chris - the universe boss, as he renamed himself from world boss. England batted well but we were happy to chase 182. We thought at one time we would be chasing 220, but they never really accelerated."
England lost the two T20s on their tour of South Africa and meet the Proteas in Mumbai on Friday (14:00 GMT). West Indies play defending champions Sri Lanka on Sunday.
