EVEL: SNP urges rethink on English 'veto'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP has called on the prime minister to rethink his party's plans to give English MPs a veto on English-only legislation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a letter to David Cameron, SNP MP Pete Wishart called the proposals "a constitutional outrage" that would see Scots MPs "cut out" of vital issues.
They were announced in the House of Commons on Thursday.
However, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the move was a "sensible and pragmatic" step forward.
He insisted Scottish MPs would still be able to fully represent their constituents.
The SNP, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all condemned Conservative plans for so-called English votes for English laws (Evel).
Announcing the plans at Westminster, leader of the Commons Chris Grayling said a new procedural stage would be introduced for laws passing through parliament where English or English and Welsh MPs would be asked to accept or veto legislation only affecting their constituents before it has its final reading.
There is due to be a Commons vote on the change on 15 July.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the move a ''constitutional shambles'' which was ''staggering in the extent of its hypocrisy and incoherence''.
In his letter to the prime minister, Mr Wishart wrote that the change "undermined constitutional integrity and the future of the Union".
He added: "The proposals are nothing less than a constitutional outrage that will see Scottish MPs cut out of voting on matters which impact Scotland and our budget.
"Quite simply, they will reduce the rights of Scottish MPs to protect the interests of their constituents."
He said SNP MPs would oppose the "disrespectful" proposals.
But Mr Mundell wrote to the first minister to insist that Scottish MPs would still be able to vote on every Bill.
He added: "If the Bill contains elements which do not apply to Scotland, Northern Ireland and, in some cases Wales, an extra stage will be added to the process to allow those MPs whose constituencies are affected to give or withhold their consent to the legislation - effectively, a veto.
"For those Bills which wholly and exclusively relate to England, the Committee stage will be taken by English MPs only, but with all MPs voting at the other stages.
"These are sensible and pragmatic steps which do nothing to limit Scottish MPs' rights to represent their constituents, but which do give MPs from other parts of the UK the chance to veto proposals which only affect their constituents."
He said the plans would receive "widespread sympathy and acceptance" in Scotland.
