[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scunthorpe United 6-0 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Graham Alexander celebrated his first home game in style by guiding Scunthorpe to a thumping victory over Swindon - their biggest win since 2003.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conor Townsend's strike and a deflected shot by fellow full-back Jordan Clarke put the Iron in control at the break.
A low strike by Hakeeb Adelakun and Tom Hopper's left-foot effort made it 4-0.
And Paddy Madden's 21st goal of the season was followed by a Hopper header to seal a win which takes the hosts to within six points of the play-offs.
Swindon, who were beaten 4-1 by Wigan on Easter Saturday, are nine points clear of the League One relegation zone.
