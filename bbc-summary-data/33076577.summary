The new Fifty Shades of Grey novel has reportedly been stolen - and its publishers fear the contents will be leaked ahead of its release next week.

Here are some other high profile works which made their way into the public domain ahead of time.
A week before the final Harry Potter novel was due to be published in 2007, all 759 pages were leaked online.
Images of all the pages along with a transcript appeared on a number of websites, while bloggers angered fans by writing lists of all the characters who died in the book.
US publisher Scholastic also sued two companies for dispatching copies of the book four days early, some of which ended up on eBay.
The film version of the book also suffered a leak when a 36-minute clip of the movie was illegally posted on file-sharing websites days before its cinema release.
Last year, the Doctor found himself at the centre of two leaks.
In July, five scripts for the eighth series were posted online - seven weeks before the episodes were due to be broadcast.
A week later footage featuring the new Doctor - Peter Capaldi - appeared on the internet, although it was in black and white and missing special effects.
BBC Worldwide said the leak originated from an office in the US and disciplinary action was taken.
An almost finished copy of X-Men Origins: Wolverine was uploaded to several file sharing websites a month before its cinema release in 2009.
Although it was a high quality copy, some special effects were incomplete and green screens and wires attached to actors were still visible.
Its star Hugh Jackman said he was "heartbroken" over the leak, which the FBI was called in to investigate.
A New York man was sentenced to a year in federal prison in 2011 for uploading the film on two websites.
An early version of the script for the upcoming Bond film was stolen by hackers as part of the cyber attack on Sony Pictures last November.
As well as the script, copious notes from executives were included about improving the film's ending, which MGM's Jonathan Glickman said was "a let down on climax".
The film is still in production and is due in cinemas in November.
The first episode of the third series of hit US anti-terror show was leaked almost a month before it was due to be broadcast in 2013.
More than 100,000 BitTorrent users pirated the episode within hours of it being uploaded.
Although preview copies were distributed to press, the leaked episode was unfinished and missing visual effects and the opening credits.
The most recent high profile leak occurred in April when the first four episodes of Game of Thrones' fifth season were put online a day before its official broadcast - nearly half of the 10 total episodes.
The programmes, which were downloaded millions of times, were believed to have been copied from preview DVDs given to members of the press.
Last month HBO said it would be switching to a secure streaming media site and would no longer send critics hard copies of the shows to prevent further piracy.
