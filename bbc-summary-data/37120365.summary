[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This was the seventh largest victory, in terms of runs, in the 3,767-match history of ODIs.
Pakistan piled up 337-6 in a match reduced by rain to 47 overs per side, with Sharjeel Khan scoring 152.
Ireland were bowled out for just 82 inside 24 overs in reply, with left-arm spinner Imad Wasim taking 5-14.
Sharjeel's 152 was the third quickest 150 in the format in terms of balls faced, his innings coming off 86 balls and including 16 fours and nine sixes.
He racked up his maiden ODI century in just 61 balls, registering Pakistan's fourth fastest ton in the format.
The teams will meet again at the same venue on Saturday.
After the two encounters with Pakistan, Ireland will finish their season with further one-day internationals against South Africa on 25 September and Australia on 27 September - both in Benoni, South Africa.
Pakistan are using the games as preparation for five one-day internationals against England, having drawn the recent Test series between the countries.
Ireland captain William Porterfield:
"It was a good toss [for Pakistan] to win but we let ourselves down with the ball. We can't let teams get away from us like that.
"It is a tough learning curve bowling against some of the best batsmen in the world but our young bowlers want to come back, go again and come back stronger.
"It is difficult chasing down a total like that; we just have to go and address how we went wrong."
