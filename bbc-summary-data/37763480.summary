The 22-year-old Samoan scored 40 tries in 2016, a Super League record, and has been linked with a move to rugby union side Sale Sharks.
Josh Charnley recently made a cross-code move from Wigan to Sale.
"We have rebuffed three approaches for Denny, two from rugby union and one from rugby league. He is not for sale," Gill told BBC Radio Leeds.
"We haven't sold him and we're not loaning him back like I've heard from some rumours.
"We expect Denny back in training on 7 November with the rest of the squad."
Solomona was nominated for the 2016 Man of Steel award, which was won by Hull FC hooker Danny Houghton.
