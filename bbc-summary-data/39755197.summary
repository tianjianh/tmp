The Otley-born former road race world champion attacked with 14km of the 122.5km route to go, shaking off Britain's Dani King and Olympic road race champion Anna van der Breggen.
Deignan, 28, finished in Harrogate in three hours nine minutes 36 seconds.
In stage two of the men's race, sprinter Nacer Bouhanni claimed victory from Caleb Ewan.
It was the second consecutive day that Orica-Scott's Ewan was runner-up but that was enough to earn him the race leader's blue jersey.
Deignan, her Dutch Boels-Dolman team-mate Van der Breggen and Cylance Pro Cycling's King were part of an eight-strong group that broke away from the field with about 60km remaining after climbing the brutal Cote de Lofthouse.
The three riders then moved ahead as the route flattened out before Deignan made her move to record her first win since marrying Team Sky racer Philip Deignan in September 2016.
"It rates pretty high up there. To finish how I did, solo, with the crowds on the finish line is surreal and special all at the same time," she told BBC Sport.
"I didn't soak it up until I had about 100m to go," added Deignan, who finished 55 seconds ahead of American Coryn Rivera.
Women's Tour de Yorkshire result:
1. Lizzie Deignan (GB/Boels Dolman) 3hrs 09mins 36secs
2. Coryn Rivera (US/Team Sunweb) +55secs
3. Giorgia Bronzini (ITA/Wiggle High 5) Same time
4. Amy Pieters (NED/Boels Dolman)
5. Hannah Barnes (GB/Canyon SRAM Racing)
Frenchman Bouhanni, riding for Cofidis, prevailed after an untidy sprint to the finish of the 122.5km stage from Tadcaster, caused by a flurry of late attacks.
The stage win leaves him two seconds behind Ewan, with Friday's stage winner, Dutchman Dylan Groenewegen third overall on the same time.
"It was hard and steep at the finish - it seems like all the roads are hilly in Yorkshire," Bouhanni, 26, said.
"Yesterday I watched the finish of the 2014 Tour de France stage here and that allowed me to better understand today's sprint.
"There were so many people on the road it felt like the Tour de France."
Men's Tour de Yorkshire, stage two result:
1. Nacer Bouhanni (Fra/Cofidis) 2hrs 45mins 51secs
2. Caleb Ewan (Aus/Orica-Scott) Same time
3. Jonathan Hivert (Fra/Direct Energie)
4. Dylan Groenewegen (Ned/LottoNL-Jumbo)
5. Chris Lawless (GB/Great Britain)
Men's Tour de Yorkshire, overall classification:
1. Caleb Ewan (Aus/Orica-Scott) 6hrs 55mins 17secs
2. Nacer Bouhanni (Fra/Cofidis) +2secs
3. Dylan Groenewegen (Ned/LottoNL-Jumbo) Same time
4. Chris Opie (GB/Bike Channel Canyon) +8secs
5. Jonathan Hivert (Fra/Direct Energie) Same time
