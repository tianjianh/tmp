The 25-year-old joins St Helens back-row Atelea Vea and Catalans hooker Eloi Pelissier in agreeing moves this week.
Green made his debut for Hull KR, who have been relegated to the second tier, in 2012 after being in their academy.
"He's ready to stamp his authority within our playing group," head coach Neil Jukes told the club website.
