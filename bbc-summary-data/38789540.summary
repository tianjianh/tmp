Leyton Orient have appointed Danny Webb as manager following Andy Edwards' decision to take up a youth coaching job with the Football Association.

The much-travelled lower league defender, 33, the son of Chelsea legend David Webb, has been placed in charge until the end of the season.
He becomes the 10th man to take charge of the East London-based League Two club since the summer of 2014.
The struggling O's are at risk of relegation from the Football League.
Saturday's 2-0 defeat by Mansfield Town saw them drop into the relegation zone after a run of just two wins in nine games under Webb.
Edwards, 45, who had a two-game spell as caretaker manager when Andy Hessenthaler left in September, was himself put in charge until the end of the season after the sacking of Alberto Cavasin in November after a run of eight defeats in 10 games.
"It is with regret that I have made the decision to stand down as manager of Leyton Orient," said Edwards, "It has been a very difficult decision, but I feel that it is in the best interests of my career and my family.
Webb, who was appointed Orient first-team coach this summer, became assistant manager when Edwards was appointed on 23 November and now takes a further step-up, starting with next Saturday's home game against automatic promotion contenders Carlisle United.
