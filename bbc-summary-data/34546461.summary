The Scottish veterans were presented with the Legion d'Honneur, on board a French naval destroyer berthed in Leith.
The award honoured them for the role they played in liberating France during the war.
Many of those being honoured took part in the D-Day landings in June 1944.
The ceremony was the latest in a series that have taken place throughout the UK since the 70th anniversary of D-Day in June 2014, when President Francois Hollande pledged to honour all surviving British veterans who fought in France during the war.
About 3,000 applications were received in the space of a few months, with hundreds of medals awarded so far.
The latest medals were presented on board the destroyer Aquitan by Emmanuel Cocher, the French consul general in Scotland, and Rear Admiral Patrick Chevallereau, the French embassy's defence attachÃ©.
Among those receiving the honour were 95-year-old Hugh Maguire from Armadale in West Lothian, who fought with the Royal Ulster Rifles and took part in the D-Day landings.
The others were Thomas Cave, Cyril Deas, Anthony Delahoy, Alexander Govan, John Greig, William Pritchard, Walter Sharp and Aidan Sprot.
A spokeswoman for the consul general said: "France will never forget the gallantry and bravery they showed in taking part in the liberation of France 70 years ago.
"The actions and sacrifice of these men, and that of so many who fell on the battlefield, was instrumental in bringing back freedom and peace in France and across Europe."
