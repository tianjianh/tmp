Remie Streete netted the decisive goal with a header in the 38th minute.
The Boro found the net in the 23rd minute when Ben Kennedy tapped home following a goalmouth scramble, but his effort was disallowed for offside.
Vale took the lead 15 minutes later when Streete climbed highest at the back post to meet Jerome Thomas' cross from the left.
In the second half, Charlie Lee came close to finding an equaliser as he fired a low shot narrowly wide of the post and had a header smothered by Jak Alnwick, while Jack King had a goal-bound effort blocked.
Substitute Anthony de Freitas should have doubled the Valiant's lead in the 74th minute but missed the target when he raced onto Thomas' clever backheel.
His miss almost proved costly when Matthew Godden was slipped through in the fifth minute of injury-time, but the forward struck the post.
