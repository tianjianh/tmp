[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two people were seriously hurt and 31 others injured in the blast in New Ferry, Wirral on Saturday evening.
Wirral South MP Alison McGovern asked Prime Minister Theresa May for a meeting to discuss the "significant dereliction" faced in the area.
Mrs May said she would be "happy" for the MP to meet Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid.
At Prime Minister's Questions, Ms McGovern thanked everybody who had helped during the the aftermath of the explosion.
She said it had been "a miracle more people were not injured".
Mrs May said she also wanted to "commend and thank" those who helped the injured.
She said the Labour MP could meet Mr Javid to "discuss how that community can be rebuilt and overcome the impact of this explosion".
Ms McGovern's question followed the opening of a community hub at New Ferry village hall to give support and advice to people and businesses affected by the explosion.
