At least 15 people have been killed and many others wounded in a suicide bomb attack in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, officials say.

The explosion happened in Kadhamiyah, a mainly Shia Muslim district in the north of the city, they added.
The attack happened at rush hour, and was the latest in a spate of explosions in the capital over the past two weeks.
On Sunday the government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ended a 12-year-old night-time curfew in the city.
That came despite at least 32 people being killed on Saturday in a string of attacks across the city.
Mr Abadi said he had taken the decision to lift the curfew to help normalise life in Baghdad.
Monday's attack happened in a square that was packed with morning commuters, police officials said.
The district is home to one of the holiest shrines in Shia Islam and has suffered similar attacks in the past.
On Saturday, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a restaurant in the predominantly Shia New Baghdad area, killing 22 people and wounding at least 50.
More people died in attacks on two markets, one in the city centre and one in a south-west district.
Speaking at the time, the interior ministry said it did not believe that the blasts were linked to the lifting of the curfew.
