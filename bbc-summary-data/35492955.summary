The Ravens are 14th in the table, 12 points off the play-off places and 10 points above the relegation zone.
"This is not a decision that has been taken lightly," chairman Jerry Dolke told the club website.
"The club has new investors who have higher expectations than current performances on the pitch are showing."
Neil Smith, Goldberg's assistant, has been named as interim first-team manager at Hayes Lane.
Goldberg was re-appointed Bromley boss in 2011 for his third spell in charge of the club, and led the club to the Conference South title last season.
He told BBC Radio Kent he had "agreed to step down in the best interests of the club".
"It has all been done extremely amicably," he added. "It was a harder decision for me than the board but I am proud of the fact I am leaving the club in much better shape than when I first came in.
"We have had a bit of a wobble recently but my belief and ambition has never wavered.
"I had ambitions to take Bromley to the Football League but football is all about opinions, and the opinions are I am not the man for the job."
