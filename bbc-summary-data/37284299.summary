About 150 vehicles remain at Gwynedd's Festival No.6 park-and-ride car park after hundreds became stuck following heavy rain.

Up to 200 people took refuge at a Porthmadog leisure centre on Sunday, after being stranded overnight.
Councillors have called for an inquiry into how authorities allowed the car park to be sited on a flood plain.
But Natural Resources Wales said organisers were aware of flood warnings.
A statement on the festival's website warned festival-goers to expect long delays after the car park reopened following an overnight closure on safety advice.
On Monday afternoon, they posted a message on their social media accounts stating 90% of cars had left after 18 tractors were used to clear the site.
Many of the remaining vehicles are expected to be collected later in the week after their owners had to return home.
Gwynedd council tweeted at about 22:00 BST on Monday to confirm the makeshift rest centre in Porthmadog leisure centre had closed.
However, a local hotel said it had accommodated two couples who were still waiting to collect their cars.
Gwynedd councillor Selwyn Griffiths praised the local response, saying: "The community really rallied round.
"I can't praise the local farmers enough for turning up with their tractors and working for 12 hours or more to get cars out of the mud."
