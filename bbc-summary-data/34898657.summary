Refugee Action to close East Midlands regional office

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A refugee support charity says funding cuts will force it to close its regional base in Leicester as the city prepares to take in Syrian families.

Refugee Action (RA) said its funding had been stopped and will close the office's doors on 31 December.
The charity said the government was making life for refugees "as difficult as possible" to deter claims of asylum.
The Home Office said it was taking direct responsibility for work it contracts to the charity to save money.
RA currently has a contract to run the Assisted Voluntary Returns (AVR) scheme, which helps failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants return home, but the government has now taken over the work.
Its office also serves Nottingham and Derby and has provided help and support for refugees for the past 15 years, officials said.
No announcement regarding the future of the charity's other offices, including those in London and Liverpool, has been made.
Louise Calvey, director of operations, said it was a sad day for the city which has a "history of welcoming refugees".
"The Immigration Act and some of the provisions proposed by Home Secretary Theresa May set out very clearly the government ambitions around asylum seekers and refugees - [but] creating an environment of welcome in the UK isn't what they are proposing to do," she said.
"Rather, it is to make life as difficult as possible for our client groups and that's the saddest thing of all."
In a statement, the Home Office said its move was about saving money.
"The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who need our protection and we are taking 20,000 of the most vulnerable refugees directly from Syria over the course of this parliament," it added.
