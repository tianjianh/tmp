Plans to expand and improve a museum celebrating the two-time Formula One world champion Jim Clark have secured a major cash commitment.

Scottish Borders Council has agreed to give more than Â£500,000 to the project.
The Â£1.2m scheme would see the existing Jim Clark Room in Duns expanded and enhanced to allow cars and trophies to be put on display.
The aim is to open the museum in 2018 - the 50th anniversary of Clark's death at Hockenheim in Germany aged just 32.
Born in Kilmany in Fife, but raised in Duns in the Borders, Clark was crowned Formula One world champion in 1963 and 1965 and won a total of 25 grand prix races.
He is still considered to be one of the finest racing drivers of all time.
He remains the only driver to have won both the Formula One and Indy 500 titles in the same year.
Councillor Vicky Davidson said she was delighted the financial commitment had been confirmed.
"The existing trophy room is a popular visitor attraction in its own right, but what will be created really befits the incredible achievements of this adopted Borderer and unassuming Berwickshire farmer," she said.
"The new museum will give us space to display some of Jim Clark's actual race cars along with his trophies and will put the museum up there with Scotland's foremost visitor attractions.
"The council would like to thank the Jim Clark Trust and its patrons as well as the wider motorsport community for their continuing support."
Doug Niven, who along with Ian Calder represents Clark's family on the Jim Clark Trust, said he looked forward to working with the council to ensure the plans come to fruition.
"Being able to display some of Jim's cars in an expanded museum in Duns has been a long-held dream of many people, and this commitment from the council takes us a lot closer to seeing that achieved," he said.
