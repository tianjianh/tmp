Kirby Misperton fracking plan suffers three-month delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on whether to allow fracking at a site in North Yorkshire has been delayed by a further three months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Third Energy submitted an application to extract shale gas at a site near Kirby Misperton in Ryedale in May.
North Yorkshire County Council told the company earlier this month it needed more time to respond to the plans.
It has set a provisional decision date of 9 February. The delay contravenes the government's push to deal with fracking applications in 16 weeks.
Third Energy said it was disappointed by the news.
A decision was expected on 18 November after the initial consultation on the application at the KM8 well site ended in October.
However, the authority requested further information from the company, prompting a new consultation which was due to end on 25 November.
A letter sent to Third Energy this week said it needed further time to speak to the Environment Agency and Highways Authority about the plans.
It said: "Every endeavour continues to be made to process the application with due diligence and timeliness."
