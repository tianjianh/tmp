The 430 sq km (166 sq miles) park is home to the largest concentration of the world's remaining one-horned rhinoceros.
Pictures showed park staff members examining and then transporting the calf through the park.
It is not known where the calf's mother is, but poaching is a common problem in Kazaringa.
Local media estimate that 12 rhinoceros were killed by poachers since January this year.
