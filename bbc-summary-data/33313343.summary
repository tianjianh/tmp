The Mill Quarter development is to be built on the site of the Thimblerow car park in the city centre.
The project is expected to create 150 jobs and attract 300,000 visitors every year.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney visited Perth to announce plans for the Mill Quarter, which he described as a "unique new destination".
Expresso Property has been selected as the preferred developed for the site, which would also include a multi-storey car park.
The project, which will also create 350 construction and supply jobs during the build phase, was secured by Perth and Kinross Council, with help from the Scottish Cities Alliance, a partnership between Scotland's cities and government.
Announcing the "exciting" new project, Mr Swinney said: "If Scotland's cities thrive, so too does the rest of the country.
"By providing a unique new destination for restaurants, retail and leisure, the Mill Quarter development will boost the local economy by creating jobs and attracting visitors to the area."
Councillor John Kellas, convener of the council's enterprise and infrastructure committee, added: "Expresso Property's proposals will provide a welcome addition to the city's local economy, driving additional employment and adding to the spend potential across the entire city centre.
"As the population grows, a development of this nature further establishes Perth as a city in which to invest, work and live in.
"The location of the development will be of extra significance, as we begin to witness the emergence of an attractive cultural quarter within the city."
