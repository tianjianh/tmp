[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Assembly chief executive Claire Clancy said a contractor agreed to return £4,000 because the firm was previously warned "there could be  a problem".
She called the sum "disappointing".
In August, a woman admitted receiving £100,000 from the assembly, after officials were duped into believing they were paying for cleaning services.
Six payments were made to Tracey Baker, 44, between October 2013 and June 2014.
Ms Clancy told the Public Accounts Committee on Tuesday that legal advice had been taken to see whether the loss should be shared with the contractor Total Support Services "because of the steps we had taken to notify the contractor that there could be a problem and their failure to use the proper control processes".
"We came to a negotiated settlement with the contractor," she said.
"It was only £4,000 of the £104,000 that they agreed to meet, which we found disappointing."
