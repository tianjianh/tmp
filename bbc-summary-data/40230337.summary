[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County goalkeeper James Bittner has signed a one-year extension to his contract to keep him at Rodney Parade until June 2018.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old arrived before the 2016-17 season as a player-coach.
He has understudied leading goalkeeper Joe Day and became joint caretaker manager after Graham Westley's departure in March, 2017.
Newport survived in League Two and boss Mike Flynn said Bittner is "another good pair of eyes on the touchline".
Bittner said: "After an unbelievable finish to last season, when I think we showed to everyone what we are capable of, I am delighted to have re-signed for the club."
