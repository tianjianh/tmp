The Lancashire fast bowler overtook Sir Ian Botham's milestone of 383 wickets last year to become England's most prolific bowler of all time.
The Burnley-born 33-year-old said becoming the nation's record Test wicket-taker was yet to sink in.
Anderson said he "felt very fortunate to have made a career out of cricket."
He added: "Obviously I've played for England for over 10 years and to be recognised for that is really special for me and a huge honour for myself and my family."
The Lancastrian has now amassed more than 430 Test wickets, but said he had still not come to terms with becoming the leading wicket-taker - a moment that came during the tour of the West Indies last spring.
After being made an OBE for services to cricket, he said: "It was a real surreal moment for me. Obviously Sir Ian Botham is someone I've looked up to as a child growing up - and to pass him, it still hasn't sunk in yet.
"Again, I'm just lucky I've managed to play the game long enough to be able to overtake him and contribute to English cricket as I have."
Anderson played in England's Test series victory over South Africa last month.
