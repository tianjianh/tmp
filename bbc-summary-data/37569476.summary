[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brazil's ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been charged with corruption again, local media say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He allegedly helped a relative of his ex-wife win a contract for construction giant Oderbrecht in Angola.
Police have yet to confirm the news. But in a statement on Facebook Lula said he had always "acted within the law".
This is the third indictment against the politician who served two terms as president, stepping down in 2011.
Earlier this year he was charged for allegedly obstructing investigations. He is also accused of benefitting from a vast corruption scheme at state oil giant Petrobras.
A statement on Lula's Facebook page said his lawyers would "analyse the document from the federal police,  which was leaked by the media and revealed in a sensational way before the defence had access".
It went on to refer to a "media massacre... to try and destroy the image of the most popular president in the country's history".
In recent months the reputations of both Lula and his Workers' Party have suffered a blow with corruption allegations and a recession in Brazil.
