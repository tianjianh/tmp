[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 1-1 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goalkeeper Joe Lumley produced a trio of fine second-half saves to earn Bristol Rovers a League One draw with Bradford at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Queens Park Rangers loanee performed heroics to keep out efforts from Tony McMahon, Billy Clarke and Nathaniel Knight-Percival as the visitors pressed for a winner.
Rovers took a 15th-minute lead when Chris Lines picked up the ball just outside the right-hand corner of the box and curled an exquisite left-footed shot into the opposite corner of the net.
But the lead lasted only 11 minutes as Charlie Wyke's clever back-heel inside the box allowed Nicky Law to beat Lumley with a clinical finish from 10 yards.
Both sides attacked with purpose from the opening whistle, Rory McArdle heading just over for Bradford and Rovers winger Cristian Montano having a goal-bound shot blocked by McMahon in a competitive first half.
Bradford had the better chances after the break, but the hosts stood firm thanks largely to Lumley's bravery and agility.
