Arguably one of the most famous created by the Two Ronnies was the mix-up between "fork handles" and "four candles".
People have been using the hashtags #fourcandles and #forkhandles as a tribute and images likes these have been shared online.
Jonathan McKendry tweeted this
Four candles on fork handles, as tweeted by Dave.
Birdie tweeted this drawing of four candles.
Jack Lambert tweeted an image of various forks.
Marlborough Rug Co. has been there and got the t-shirt.
