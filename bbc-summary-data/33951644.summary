South Petherwin Church post office opens for villagers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cornish village which has been without a post office since January is to have a new one based in its church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The South Petherwin branch closed in January when the post master resigned and the premises were withdrawn from post office use.
The new service will operate in St Paternus Church from 10 September as part of a village community shop which opened in July.
It will open Monday to Saturday between the hours of 08:00 BST and 12:00 BST.
The Post Office said it was delighted to be restoring a range of services to the village, which will include customers being able to collect benefits in cash.
It will also include a hearing loop and wheelchair access.
