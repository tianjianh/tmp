Essex have signed Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Amir as an overseas player for part of the 2017 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amir, 24, has played 20 Tests for Pakistan, including four against England this summer, having returned from a spot-fixing ban in 2015.
The left-armer will join Essex following international commitments and will be available for all formats.
Amir was banned from cricket for five years after being convicted of spot-fixing in a Lord's Test in 2010.
He was one of three Pakistan players jailed in November 2011 for his part in a conspiracy to bowl deliberate no-balls against England. He served three months in prison.
Amir's suspension originally covered all forms of the game, but in January last year he was cleared to play domestic cricket in Pakistan.
He has since played for Karachi Kings and Chittagong Vikings in Pakistan and Bangladesh respectively.
He returned to international cricket in January this year in a Twenty20 match against New Zealand in Auckland, when he was booed by fans.
"We are thrilled that Mohammad has decided to join us for half of the 2017 campaign. He showed a real desire to be a part of the club," said head coach Chris Silverwood.
"He is still only young but has proved himself at international level already, so it is a real coup to get this signing completed."
Essex will play in Division One of the County Championship in 2017, having won the Division Two title this summer.
