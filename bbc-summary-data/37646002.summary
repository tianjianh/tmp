The "Sappers" Colonel-in-Chief inspected an honour guard and met soldiers from bases across the UK at Brompton Barracks in Chatham, Kent.
She also inspected some of the vehicles used by the Corps of Royal Engineers in operations around the world.
In a speech, the monarch paid tribute to the Royal Engineers' "extraordinary" work in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"Your ability to provide a flexible and adaptable force, quickly and without fuss, for the purposes of war fighting, peace building or disaster relief is world class," she told the troops.
Commanding officer Lt Col Sean Cunniff said it was wonderful for the Corps to host its Colonel-in-Chief at its headquarters as the culmination of its 300th anniversary commemorations.
"For me personally, to be in the right place at the right time, commanding the regiment when she's here and commanding the parade, is a remarkable privilege," he said.
Guests at the barracks included musician Jools Holland, who attended in his role as a deputy lieutenant of Kent.
The Queen also met three retired sappers, Dave Henson, Micky Yule and Nick Beighton, who competed in the Paralympics in Rio.
She met five-year-old black American Labrador Max, handled by L/Cpl Alex Farquhar, 25, from Rutland, who explained the dog's involvement in finding weapons and explosives.
"It was an honour to meet the Queen. She was clearly very interested," said L/Cpl Farquhar.
