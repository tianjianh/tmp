Derek Young: Formartine man hopes Partick are 'rusty' for cup tie

Formartine United midfielder Derek Young hopes Scottish Cup opponents Partick Thistle come back "tanned and tired" from their winter break.

The Jags spent time in La Manga ahead of Saturday's fourth-round tie versus the Highland League club at Firhill.
"We're not daft, we're playing a Premiership team who were doing really well just before the winter break," said the former Thistle player.
"Hopefully we'll catch them a wee bit rusty," added the 36-year-old.
Thistle took seven points from their last three matches to move up to seventh in the league.
Formartine United, based north of Aberdeen in Pitmedden, have already shocked League Two Annan Athletic in the competition, beating them 4-0 in the third round.
Young made more than 200 appearances during two spells with Aberdeen and also had stints at Dunfermline, Queen of the South, Morton, Forfar and Grindavik in Iceland.
He came on as a late substitute when the Dons lost 4-3 in a Scottish Cup semi-final to Queen of the South in 2008.
"I've been the other way about when we were the team playing the lower side side," said Young.
"You need to have your wits about you and our boys are desperate for the day to arrive, it can't come quick enough.
"[Current manager] Alan Archibald was there [as a player] when I played for Partick Thistle and I see him every so often at coaching conventions and we chat away. He's done a fantastic job there."
Young played in Aberdeen's European ties against Atletico Madrid, Hertha Berlin and Dnipro and admits adjusting to performing in rural corners of the north of Scotland has been slightly strange at times.
"We were laughing the other day because we had a four-hour bus journey up to Fort William and behind one of the goals was a mountain," added Young.
"Someone asked me what I thought of it and I said, 'it's not the Vicente Calderon but it'll need to do'.
"But I'm still playing football and I'm still loving it. Some places are an eye-opener but I'm not one for saying, 'I'm not doing that'."
