[SN]TITLE[SN]
St Kilda to Harris relay team swim under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven swimmers have started their third attempt this year to swim between St Kilda and the Isle of Harris.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The relay team had to call off previous attempts in May and July because of bad weather.
The charity swimmers tried to complete the swim last year but had to abandon it about 24 miles (38km) into the 60-mile (96km) crossing.
They hope to take advantage of a spell of fine weather and struck out from Village Bay on Hirta early on Monday.
The swimmers hope to reach Huisinish in Harris by 22:00 on Tuesday.
