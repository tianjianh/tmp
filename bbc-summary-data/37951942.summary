Filmed in south Wales, The Proud Valley stars Paul Robeson, who is being celebrated as part of the British Film Institute's (BFI) Black Star season.
It tells the story of David Goliath, who was adopted by the community after joining a local male voice choir and getting work with Blaendy miners.
The tour will begin on Sunday.
It is being launched at Chapter in Cardiff where Treorchy Male Choir will perform.
Hana Lewis, manager of Film Hub Wales, one of the BFI's nine UK film audience network hubs, said: "Venues across Wales, including in the heart of the main coal mining region, have the chance to explore the role he played in the civil rights movement across their local communities.
"Audiences will have a chance to see unique choral performances alongside the film, in spectacular settings, from art deco auditoriums to regenerated miners' halls."
