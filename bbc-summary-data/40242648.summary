[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gloucestershire v Nottinghamshire: Hosts bat out the day to secure draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucestershire batted through the final day to secure a draw with Division Two leaders Nottinghamshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts, resuming on 30-1, made a bad start as Harry Gurney (2-62) took two early wickets to reduce them to 35-3.
Graeme van Buuren (88 not out) shared a fourth-wicket partnership of 91 with Chris Dent (71) to steady the ship.
Van Buuren and Phil Mustard (39) put on 92 for the fifth wicket to take them close to parity, before a draw was agreed with the home side on 254-5.
Leaders Notts now have a 16-point advantage over second-placed Kent but have played a game more, while Gloucestershire move up to seventh with 45 points from five matches.
Gurney took two wickets in his first two overs of the day, as he had Will Tavare and Gareth Roderick trapped leg before to balls which stayed low.
But any Nottinghamshire hopes of a fifth Championship win of the season were subdued as Van Buuren, who got a golden duck in the first innings, passed 4,000 first-class runs to help Gloucestershire secure a draw.
