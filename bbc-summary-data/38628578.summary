The 18-year-old man was taken to hospital with serious head injuries after the incident at Shepherds Way and Clifford Street at about midnight. He died a short time later.
Two passengers in his car - two males aged 18 and 17 - suffered head, shoulder and hand injuries.
A 52-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
He was uninjured in the crash.
Sgt Finn Quainton, of Lancashire Police, said: "While we have arrested one man in connection with the collision, we are keen to establish the exact circumstances of what happened.
"We believe a number of people were in the area at the time and would encourage them to come forward and talk to police."
