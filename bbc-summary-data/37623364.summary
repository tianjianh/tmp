St Helens have re-signed scrum-half Matty Smith from Super League champions Wigan Warriors on a three-year deal.

Smith, who was contracted to Wigan until 2018, came through Saints' academy but left for Salford in 2011 in search of regular first-team games.
The 29-year-old joined Wigan a year later and won two Grand Finals and a Challenge Cup with the Warriors.
"I am thrilled and honoured to be back at my hometown team," Smith told Saints' website.
"It should be a seamless transition as I have come through the system at Saints and know the key staff and players as well as the club's culture."
Smith, who led Wigan onto the pitch in their Grand Final victory over Warrington on Saturday, is St Helens' third new signing for 2017 following the captures of Luke Douglas and Ryan Morgan.
New Zealand half-back Thomas Leuluai will rejoin Wigan for next season while the Warriors have also signed France full-back Morgan Escare.
