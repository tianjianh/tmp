After a goalless first-half, the Dons took the lead against the run of play as Lewis Baker tapped in as Dele Alli delivered a low cross to the near post.
As Fleetwood searched for an equaliser, Will Grigg latched on to a long ball and scored with a drilled low shot.
Alli's stunning 20-yard half-volley two minutes later saw MK Dons move within three points of Preston in second.
The loss for the Cod Army dented their hopes of reaching the play-offs, with the defeat leaving them eight points behind Chesterfield with three matches remaining.

MK Dons boss Karl Robinson told 3CR: "Fleetwood are a very good side...so we knew how difficult it was going to be.
"We knew we had to be at our best to get something out of the game.
On Dele Alli "The boy's got tremendous potential.  He's been fighting to try and find his form since he's come back. We saw in that final 45 minutes he's back to his best. He's the best player in the league.
"The players have performed and won 3-0. I can't ask anything more than that."
