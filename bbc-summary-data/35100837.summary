6 Music will broadcast gigs from venues including the Colston Hall, O2 Academy and Trinity from 12-14 February.
Bristol natives Beak, The Blue Aeroplanes and DJ Pinch will also perform. The full line-up will be revealed next month.
Previous 6 Music Festivals have been held in Manchester and on Tyneside.
Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie joined 6 Music DJs Mary-Ann Hobbs and Steve Lamacq to launch the festival in the city on Tuesday.
The band will perform material from their new album Chaosmosis live for the first time at the festival.
And it will be a homecoming for Tricky as the trip-hop auteur showcases material from his new album Skilled Mechanics, which is released in January.
Mary Anne Hobbs promised the festival would be an "unforgettable experience".
She said: "This year, the festival is coming to Bristol, a place where music is such a primary element of the DNA of the city.
"The 6 Music Festival is such a special event because it brings all the elements of what we do as a digital radio station into a physical space - the artists, the whole of the station's staff and presenters, and of course our wonderful listeners."
Lamacq said: "Bristol has some fantastic venues - I was there a while back to see a band called The Archie Bronson Outfit and had an excellent night at the Colston Hall so I'm really looking forward to going back there.
"I've also presented a lot of good shows from Bristol over the years including Sound City for Radio 1 in the '90s and some gigs for 6 Music, so I know the appetite for music is really healthy around the city. I hope people come along and enjoy it."
