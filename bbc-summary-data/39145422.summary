The Haven partnership complements the agreement the Centurions have with Championship side Sheffield Eagles.
Players from Leigh will be available for both teams when not required by their parent club.
"We were happy to also add to that to facilitate a game opportunity for where Sheffield weren't in need of any of our players," owner Derek Beaumont said.
Haven general manager Amanda Hewer said: "Leigh have a lot of depth in their squad and we have suffered immensely during the off season due to injuries and suspensions.
"This partnership will allow us to cover any shortfall in our squad."
