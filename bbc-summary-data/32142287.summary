Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, a mother-of-three, was airlifted to hospital but later died. Her eight-year-old daughter suffered minor injuries in the incident on The Kingsway on Tuesday.
Swansea council has said it is taking action to improve safety on the road.
Temporary barriers are to be installed along the central reservation.
Cllr Mark Thomas, Swansea Council's cabinet member for environment and transportation, said: "We are now taking immediate steps to further improve safety for pedestrians by introducing temporary barriers along the central reservation on The Kingsway.
"We will also be holding urgent discussions with the police and bus operators to consider further safety measures which, subject to their agreement, may include re-routing buses and potentially changing the direction in which they travel on The Kingsway."
Swansea council dropped the speed limit to 20mph last year as an initial response to calls for improved safety on The Kingsway.
Sgt Lucas' son Grant, 21, paid tribute to his mother with a post on Facebook.
It read: "On behalf of the family, we would like to thank all friends for their support.
"I am absolutely well and truly gutted. It's mad how my mum and I became much closer over the last couple of weeks and had it all planned out!
"Mum was the best there is and was simply amazing. I love you with all my heart and WILL make you so so proud RIP Mum."
Colleagues from South Wales Police also took to social media to pay tribute to Sgt Lucas, who was based at Llanishen police station in Cardiff where she ran neighbourhood policing teams.
South Wales Police east division tweeted that the "communities of Llanishen, Rhiwbina, and Thornhill lost a police officer who really cared".
The sentiment was echoed by Alun Michael, Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales, who tweeted she was a great loss to her family, the force and the community.
Richard Jones, a special chief officer at Gwent Police, described her as an "exceptional lady", adding that he had worked with her several times.
Richard Lewis, a senior officer for territorial policing at South Wales Police, said her death was "incredibly sad".
Steve Trigg, chair of the South Wales Police Federation who had known her for a number of years, said: "She was really well respected.
"It is just a huge loss to her family, her friends and to South Wales Police."
In a statement, Chief Constable Peter Vaughan said: "Louise was a great police officer who was universally respected and was dedicated to her role of serving the communities of South Wales.
"The many tributes which have been paid to Louise are a reflection of how highly she was regarded not only by her colleagues in the police service but by the wider community."
Sgt Lucas's husband Gavin played rugby for Newport, Pontypool and Cardiff. He is also head coach at Llandaff North RFC, who have cancelled all their Easter fixtures.
A spokesman for Llandaff North RFC said: "We at the club send Gavin, the children and all Louise's friends and family our deepest condolences and warmest thoughts at this most difficult and painful of times.
"The North family stands beside you. As a mark of respect all matches scheduled for this weekend have been postponed."
Nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition calling for changes, including a return to a traditional two-way system on the road.
The current system has two lanes of traffic travelling in the same direction on one side of the road, but two lanes of traffic going in opposite directions on the other.
Tuesday's incident has been highlighted by an online petition calling for more road changes, saying: "Too many people have been injured and now a young lady has lost her life."
There have been a number of accidents on the road over the last few years and in September 2013, Daniel Foss, 37, from Reynoldston, Gower, died after being struck by a National Express bus.
First Cymru Bus said staff were "working with the police to establish exactly what happened" in the incident with a X11 bus on Tuesday shortly before 11:25 BST.
South Wales Police are continuing to investigate and witnesses are asked to call 101.
