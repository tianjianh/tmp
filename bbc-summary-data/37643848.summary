[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ched Evans jury told 'not to judge morals' of those involved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The jury at Ched Evans' retrial for rape has been told not to judge the "morals" of those involved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Chesterfield striker denies raping a 19-year-old woman at a Premier Inn in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, on 30 May 2011.
Mr Evans, 27, was found guilty of rape at Caernarfon Crown Court in 2012, but his conviction was quashed in April.
Mrs Justice Nicola Davies told the jury at Cardiff Crown Court to decide the case "calmly, objectively and without emotion".
Mr Evans denies having sex with the woman while she was too drunk to consent.
He insists she agreed to let him "join in" while she was having consensual sex with fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, 27, after a night out in Rhyl.
The prosecution and defence have now both presented their evidence and the judge is directing the jury before each side presents their closing arguments.
She said: "Your task as a jury is to consider the charge made against this defendant, namely the charge of rape.
"You must do that by assessing only the evidence you have heard in this case.
"You are not here to judge the morals of any person who has given evidence in this case. And this includes the complainant and the defendant."
Closing the case for the prosecution, Simon Medland QC told the jury Mr Evans treated the complainant "with a callous, self-centred indifference".
"At the end of the 19th Century poet and writer Oscar Wilde was moved to remark that everything in life is about sex, apart from sex itself which is about power," he said.
"I accept, of course, that Oscar Wilde at the end of the 19th Century is a long way removed from room 14 in the Premier Inn in Rhyl, but you might think, considering this case, that it was one of his more insightful remarks."
He added: "This wealthy, successful young footballer felt entitled to have her and he did so regardless of whatever she might have wanted, and in doing so, we submit, made this rape."
Judy Khan QC, making the defence's closing statement to the jury, said the case against Mr Evans was "built around a myth".
"If [the complainant] cannot remember, she must have been incapacitated through drink and, in other words, the crown say, lack of memory equals lack of capacity, equals lack of consent," she said.
"We say that when you look at all of the evidence, that is wrong."
Miss Khan told the jury evidence given by two men who had sex with the complainant around the time of the alleged offence was "similar".
She added: "It totally undermines the prosecution case. It totally undermines the suggestion that it was without consent."
The trial continues.
