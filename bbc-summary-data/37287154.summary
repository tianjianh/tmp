Catalans Dragons extended Wakefield Trinity's losing streak to seven games with hard-fought Super League victory.

Jason Baitieri and Julian Bousquet tries, added to Tony Gigot's two goals, established a 12-4 half-time lead for the visitors, whose top four hopes were ended with defeat by Warrington.
Wakefield fought back after half-time with Craig Hall adding to Max Jowitt's first-half score.
However, the Dragons hung on to end their own three-game winless run.
Both teams had scores ruled out in a game strewn with errors, with Catalans edging the game via Gigot's accuracy from the tee.
Fans also applauded on 19 minutes to mark the life of Trinity fan Alex Rose, who died aged 19 on Thursday.
Wakefield Trinity head coach Chris Chester:
"If you wrote a book on the dumbest team in the competition, you would probably write a book on our performance tonight.
"We just weren't smart. We dropped the ball over the line a couple of times, we threw the ball into touch a couple of times and we had tries disallowed. You can credit Catalans' defensive efforts but what we did with the ball was woeful at times."
"Catalans were the smarter team. We must have had 10 to 12 opportunities but we couldn't get over the try-line. We just need to get some pride back in the jersey. We don't want to be known as the team who got in the top eight because Salford had points deducted.
Catalans Dragons head coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"I was very impressed with the attitude of the boys. We defended our own line very well and we are pleased to have taken the points, because Wakefield never gave up.
"There were several players missing, so we had some younger guys out there, so our depth is looking good.
"It is a pleasing victory, even though we cannot make the top four, we played with plenty of pride."
