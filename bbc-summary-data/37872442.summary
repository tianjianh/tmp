Turkish Airlines Open: Danny Willett struggles as Thorbjorn Olesen shoots 62

Dane Thorbjorn Olesen shot a course-record nine-under 62 to lead the Turkish Open at the halfway stage as Danny Willett's hopes of finishing the season as European number one nosedived.

England's Willett needs to finish fifth to regain top spot in the Race to Dubai, but was joint 58th after failing to claim a birdie in a round of 74.
Olesen enjoyed an eagle and eight birdies as he moved to 15 under, six shots clear of Spaniard Adrian Otaegui and Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee.
Otaegui had earlier broken the course record himself with a 63, before Olesen went one better.
"I feel pretty comfortable," said the leader, who won the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship last year and made a strong start to this season, but had missed the cut in seven of his past 10 events before this week.
Bogeys on the 16th and 18th left Masters champion Willett 16 shots adrift of Olesen.
Willett had led the money list since claiming his first major title at Augusta in April, but was overtaken by Henrik Stenson on Sunday after the Open champion was joint second in the WGC-HSBC Champions and Willett finished 75th in the 78-man field.
