[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts were made to wait until the second half to go in front, with Dan Livesey's bullet header from Jordan Williams' corner the breakthrough they needed.
York defender Matt Fry's own goal eight minutes later was enough to ensure Barrow's unbeaten run stretches to seven games.
York, meanwhile, drop one place to 18th after losing three of their last four games.
