About 3,000 tonnes of wood chips caught fire early on Monday at South Wales Wood Recycling in Coity.
The Food Standards Agency said "food produce affected by ash or fallout should be washed or peeled before use".
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service has spent five days at the scene.
A fire service spokesperson said crews had made more progress in reducing the quantity of stacked materials and continued to damp down burning wood.
Public Health Wales said: "When the smoke passes or dissipates, doors and windows should be re-opened to air homes and properties."
The fire involved a stack of wood chips about 15m (49ft) high.
The service asked people in the area to keep doors and windows closed and turn ventilation systems off to minimise their exposure.
An investigation into the cause is ongoing.
