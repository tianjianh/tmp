A woman called 999 because she was refused entry to McDonald's for being "too drunk".

The woman said she had been at a nightclub opposite the restaurant in Albion Street in Leeds and was barred when she went to get food.
She told the 999 call handler: "I went to McDonald's and they said I was too drunk to go in I'd had two drinks, I'd like a police officer please."
The call handler said it was a matter for McDonald's and not the police.
"It's not an emergency call, we won't be attending. Goodbye," he added.
Tom Donohoe, from West Yorkshire Police's contact centre, said staff handle about 1,000 calls a day.
"If someone is blocking our lines with non-emergency matters, or worse still non-police matters, they are potentially slowing down our response time to genuine emergencies," he said.
"I cannot stress enough that the 999 number is for emergency use only."
A McDonald's spokesperson said: "Our first priority is to ensure our restaurants are safe and welcoming for both our customers and employees.
"In this instance, entry to our St John's Centre restaurant was restricted due to the inappropriate behaviour the individual was displaying.
"This is not a matter for the police and nor is the individual banned from our restaurant."
