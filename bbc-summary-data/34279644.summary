World Triathlon Series: Don't write off Helen Jenkins - Non Stanford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Non Stanford is confident she and fellow Welsh triathlete Helen Jenkins will be at next year's Olympic Games.

Stanford, World champion in 2013, can secure her place at Rio 2016 if she finishes in the top three at the ITU World Triathlon Grand Final in Chicago.
Jenkins' bid has been hampered by injuries but Stanford is not writing off the 31-year-old's chances.
"I wouldn't be surprised if she was fighting for one of the top places in Chicago," Stanford said.
Stanford, 26, and Vicky Holland will earn early selection for Team GB by finishing in the top three in Chicago.
Swansea-born Stanford took a step towards Olympic selection when she was second in August's test event in Rio with Holland third.
But former double world-champion Jenkins, who missed June's European Games with an ankle injury, failed to finish in Rio after being kicked during the swim.
"The policy suggests you have to podium at both Rio and Chicago to be selected so unfortunately for Helen that might mean she won't get selected this year," Stanford added.
"There are definitely opportunities next year for her to be selected.
"Helen's chances are definitely very high and she's one of the favourites to take one of the spots for next year."
After missing the 2014 Commonwealth Games because of a stress fracture in her left ankle, Stanford is determined to secure Olympic qualification in Chicago.
"If I can get early selection it would mean I could have a far more relaxed winter which would hopefully prepare me better for August," Stanford said.
