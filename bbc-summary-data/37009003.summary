The 27-year-old former QPR and Hull man scored 25 goals in 48 appearances for League Two Orient last season.
"Both clubs are talking and it's in the hands of the financial directors at Orient and my chairman," said Brown.
"It's a case of watch this space. I'm hopeful that I'll improve the squad, not just in that area but in others."
Southend lost 3-1  to Gillingham in their first game of the season on on Saturday, having taken the lead early on through Stephen McLaughlin.
Brown told BBC Essex: "I think we're still probably three players short and I've been working hard to get players in.
"I had a meeting with the chairman on Sunday morning, which is not a typical one, but is down to the fact that the second-half performance was so alarmingly poor."
