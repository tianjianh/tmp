Norovirus patients at Dumfries hospital suffer relapse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some hospital patients affected by a norovirus outbreak have suffered a relapse after 48 hours without symptoms, according to the NHS.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of 46 patients and 12 staff members at Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary have contracted the sickness and diarrhoea bug.
Ward 14 remains closed while three others have reopened.
Infection control manager Elaine Ross said the "unpleasant virus" is spread easily when people are together.
She added:  "In this outbreak, vomiting is more of a feature and this makes it much more easy to transmit which is why we are seeing higher numbers affected in hospital.
"We regret having to take such measures as restricting visiting, particularly over  a holiday period, but thank the public and our staff for their continued support and patience as we endeavour to minimise the impact of this horrible bug."
