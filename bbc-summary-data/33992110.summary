David Jones, 53, of Mockbeggar Drive, Wallasey, admitted at a previous Liverpool Magistrates hearing to uploading 12 images.
The woman said she felt "complete terror" when the photos appeared online and "totally violated".
It is the first "revenge pornography" case in Merseyside, a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) spokeswoman said.
Jones was given a restraining order to prevent him making contact with the victim.
Nicki Collins, from CPS, added: "I hope today's outcome brings some form of closure to this victim but also encourages other victims of these malicious crimes to report them to the police and help us bring such offenders to justice."
In April, it became a criminal offence in England and Wales to share private sexual photographs or films without the consent of the person, or people, under Section 33 the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015.
The new "revenge porn" laws include social networks and sending pictures via text.
