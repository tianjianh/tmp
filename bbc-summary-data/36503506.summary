The 31-year-old forward will link up with former team-mate Steve Saviano who signed for the Giants last week.
Both players iced for HC Bolzano of the Austrian Hockey League last season and Foster is excited to join the team.
"I have heard nothing but great things about the fans, the hockey and the city from former team-mates and this was an offer I just could not turn down," Foster stated.
Foster played Division One NCAA hockey for Bowling Green State University, where he was named in the Second All-Star team following 82 points scored in 72 games played.
Following University, Foster spent six seasons in Toronto and posted 163 points in 337 games played for the Marlies where he captained the American Hockey League organisation and also earned himself a call-up to the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs in 2008.
"Whatever needs to be done - I am willing to step up and do that," he said.
"I fully plan to be looked on to win games, be on the powerplay as well as involved in any last-minute situations."
