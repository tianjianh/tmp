Real were far from convincing against their newly promoted neighbours until Bale latched on to Isco's pass to open the scoring.
The Wales forward got a second on the stroke of half-time after bundling the ball over from close range.
Alvaro Morata added the third after the interval.
Relive the action from the Bernabeu
Zinedine Zidane's side moved five points clear of second-placed Barcelona, who are in action later on Sunday away to third-placed Sevilla (19:45 GMT).
Yet Real, who blew a 2-0 lead to draw 3-3 at Legia Warsaw in the Champions League in midweek, struggled against their lowly opponents before Bale broke the deadlock seven minutes before half-time.
He raced on to a through ball from Isco that split the visiting defence and rounded goalkeeper Jon Serantes to tuck the ball inside the near post from a tight angle.
Bale then took advantage of poor defending from a free-kick to hit the second. Even then Real looked vulnerable.
It required a finger-tip save by Keylor Navas to deny Alexander Szymanowski before Morata, standing in for the injured Karim Benzema, made it 3-0.
A big plus for Zidane is the return from the bench of midfielder Luka Modric after injury.
The Real manager's options will be boosted further when Brazilian midfielder Casemiro returns from injury in the near future.
He will be needed.
Real's first game after the international break is away at neighbours Atletico Madrid, while the first El Clasico of the season against Barcelona is on 3 December.
