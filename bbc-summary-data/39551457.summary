Goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski says Swansea City's own performances and results will decide their Premier League fate.

Swansea remain in the relegation zone and two points from safety following the 1-0 defeat at fellow strugglers West Ham United.
But with six games remaining and without a win in five games, Fabianski admits the situation is critical.
"We're really desperate now to win games," Fabianksi said.
"We have to be positive and we have to continue to fight. There's six games to go and 18 points to play for."
Swansea are two points behind Hull City after Saturday's defeat by West Ham, who eased their own relegation fears to end a five-game losing run.

Hull had moved above the Swans in midweek but their 3-1 loss at Manchester City means they remain only two points ahead of the Welsh side.
Fabianksi says Swansea - who next face Watford away on Saturday, 15 April - must concentrate on themselves.
"I don't really want to look at others," the Poland international added.
"What we have to do is focus on our performances and getting the maximum from every single game.
"For me personally it's just approaching each game as it comes,"
"Every single game until the end of the season are big ones. [Watford] is another opportunity for us to get a results and put ourselves in contention to survive in the Premier League.
