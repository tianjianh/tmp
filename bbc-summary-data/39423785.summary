Wesley Lennon was stabbed in the chest after trying to break up an altercation between two groups in Eccles, Greater Manchester, on 29 August.
The 26-year-old became the focus of animosity from the group and was assaulted in Cambrai Crescent, Winton.
Adam Akhtar, 19, from Eccles, denied murder but was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court.
He was ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years.
A further detainment of 12 months will run concurrently for possession of an offensive weapon.
Greater Manchester Police said a fight broke out between the groups shortly before midnight and Mr Lennon tried to intervene.
He was killed when Akhtar, of Somerset Road, ran to assist his friends and attacked the victim before fleeing the scene.
Det Ch Insp Richard Eales said: "This is a terrible incident where a young man has lost his life after he tried to do the right thing and stop an escalating and violent fight."
