The band were playing a gig at the Bataclan concert hall when gunmen stormed the building killing 90 people.
The band returned to Paris last week to play a song with U2 and will play the city's Olympia Theatre in February.
Singer Jesse Hughes said: "The people of Paris have always been incredible to us... not returning to finish our set was never an option."
Fans who were at the Bataclan show on 13 November will be entitled to a free ticket for the rescheduled date at the Olympia on 16 February.
The Bataclan will not be open again in time for the band's return.
In his statement, Hughes - who paid his respects outside the venue on his return to Paris earlier this month - said: "Our feeling of love towards this beautiful city and its people has been reinforced a million times over this past month.
"Hearing the stories of the survivors, the injured and those who have lost loved ones has been overwhelming. Not returning to finish our set was never an option.
"We look forward to coming back in February and continuing our mission to bring rock 'n' roll to the world."
Eagles Of Death Metal also announced they will return to the UK to play the Reading and Leeds festivals next year.
