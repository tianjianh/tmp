[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The friend of a man who died after allegedly being set upon by a gang has told a court about the attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shane Tunney, 24, suffered severe head injuries during the assault on Norton High Street on 27 June and later died.
Anthony Kirk told Teesside Crown Court that he and Mr Tunney were kicked and beaten by the group, which ran off when a passing motorist stopped.
Seven defendants, aged between 16 and 18, deny murder and attempted grievous bodily harm.
Mr Kirk said food had been thrown at the pair from the roof of a Tesco store as they were using a cash machine.
A short time later they were set upon by a group, and Mr Kirk was stuck on the side of the head with a metal pole, and then kicked and punched while on the ground.
When the group ran off he found Mr Tunney unconscious.
Four 18-year olds, Kearon Terry Davis, Kieran Harry Davis, Jake Douglas and Brandon Pitt, are in the dock alongside two 17-year-olds and one 16-year-old who cannot be named.
The trial continues.
