[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 1-2 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonathan Meades headed home in stoppage time to hand AFC Wimbledon victory at Bury in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neil Danns put the hosts in front with a 27th-minute penalty, which was cancelled out by Lyle Taylor after 39 minutes.
Meades then struck at the death to stretch the Dons' unbeaten run to eight games while condemning Bury to a fifth straight defeat.
Persistent rain contributed to a poor start at Gigg Lane, with the first chance not coming until the penalty incident.
Paul Robinson tripped James Vaughan in the box and Danns side-footed the spot-kick into the bottom corner.
But the visitors equalised when Andy Barcham jinked to the byline and crossed for an unmarked Taylor to head home.
Bury's Zeli Ismail then fired over before the break, while Barcham had a shot deflected wide.
The game improved as the rain subsided after half-time, with Dean Parrett testing home keeper Ben Williams and Bury's Danny Mayor twice going close from 20 yards.
Bury substitute Tom Walker curled a late free-kick just over, but Meades had the final say, heading home from a Jake Reeves corner.
