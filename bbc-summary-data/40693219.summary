T20 Blast: No David Miller debut for Glamorgan as rain hits Essex match

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South African batsman David Miller was made to wait for his Glamorgan debut as Sunday's T20 Blast match at home to Essex was abandoned due to rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Miller, 28, has signed for six matches and was set to replace Nick Selman.
But heavy rain throughout the day in Cardiff meant the match was abandoned without a ball being bowled.
A second successive abandonment means Glamorgan have seven points from six matches, two points ahead of Essex with a game in hand.
The top four teams from each of the two groups qualify for the knock-out stage, with Glamorgan currently third in the South Group.
