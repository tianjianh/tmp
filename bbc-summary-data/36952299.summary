British boxer Tyson Fury is suing UK Anti-Doping over allegations he used a performance-enhancing drug.

The Sunday Mirror reported on 26 June that traces of banned substance nandrolone were found in a urine sample taken from Fury in February 2015.
He denied the claim and his legal team says the result of tests from March and May 2015 were contradictory.
The 27-year-old beat Wladimir Klitschko to win the WBA and WBO heavyweight titles in November.
The newspaper said Fury's cousin and fellow boxer Hughie had also been charged.
The legal team for the pair said "Team Fury" had issued proceedings in the High Court.
A statement from lawyer Lewis Power read: "The two boxers strenuously deny taking any performance-enhancing drugs.
"However, during the last five weeks, leaks about these charges have appeared in the press and both boxers have been the targets of continual abusive language on Twitter."
Fury's legal team said an interim judgment was expected before Fury's rematch with Ukrainian Klitschko in October.
The bout had been scheduled to take place in Manchester on 9 July but Fury pulled out with an ankle injury.
UK Anti-Doping declined to comment.
