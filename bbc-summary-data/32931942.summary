[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 71-year-old rhythm and blues and jazz artist - real name Clive Powell - will have a star added to Believe Square at Leigh Town Hall later.
He is the third recipient following Leigh Centurions rugby league team and rugby league great Alex Murphy.
Fame is also playing a gig at Leigh Sports Village for Leigh Centurions player Steve Maden's testimonial.
Believe Square is a walk of fame established by Wigan Council to honour the achievements of Leigh's citizens.
Fame is the only British star to have had three UK numbers ones from his only three top 10 hits -   Yeh, Yeh in 1964, Get Away in 1966 and The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde in 1967.
He learned to play the piano at the former Leigh Central County Secondary School.
Fame's fame came aged 16 touring with names including Marty Wilde and Eddie Cochran.
He also had hits with his own band Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames.
Over the years he has collaborated with Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, Wigan's own The Verve and is a founder member of Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings.
