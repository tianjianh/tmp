Wright, 20, had been with former club Chelsea since the age of 10, and signed a professional deal in 2013.
Injuries hampered his first-team progress at Stamford Bridge, although the full-back did play youth team, reserve and under-21 games.
"It's very exciting for me, it's been a long journey since I left Chelsea," Wright told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"I'm excited and in love with the fans and the club already."
The Waltham Forest-born player has been on trial at Carlisle for some time, and is joined at Brunton Park by the returning Alexander McQueen, who has also agreed a short-term contract.
Wright admits his Chelsea departure was tough to take, having been so close to the club since childhood.
"It was quite upsetting because it was a big part of my life for so long,"
"That said, I was also ready to take the next step and start pushing for first-team football because that's my end goal."
