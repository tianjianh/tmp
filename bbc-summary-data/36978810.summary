[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jack Adcock death: Nurse Isabel Amaro struck off register

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse convicted of the manslaughter of a boy who was "seriously neglected" has been struck off the register.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isabel Amaro was found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence alongside doctor Hadiza Bawa-Garba last year over the death of Jack Adcock.
Six-year-old Jack died of a cardiac arrest after he developed sepsis in 2011.
Amaro will no longer be able to work as a nurse or midwife in the UK.
The Nursing & Midwifery Council confirmed Amaro's fate following a hearing on Thursday.
Jack's mother, Nicola Adcock, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, called the verdict "absolutely fantastic".
"We're never going to be able to get Jack back but it's given us a bit more justice," she said.
Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with vomiting and diarrhoea. He died 11 hours later from a cardiac arrest caused by sepsis triggered by pneumonia.
A trial heard Jack's death was caused by "serious neglect" by staff who failed to recognise his body was "shutting down" and close to death.
On the day of his death, Bawa-Garba, of Leicester, stopped performing CPR after wrongly assuming Jack was subject to a do-not-resuscitate order.
Bawa-Garba and Amaro were both given two-year terms, suspended for two years. Bawa-Garba is currently seeking leave to appeal her conviction.
