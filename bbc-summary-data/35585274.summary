[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yacht rescue off coast of Tiree in 'testing' conditions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A yachtsman has been airlifted to safety after his vessel got into difficulty off the west coast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man made a distress call just after midnight after his 40ft boat hit rocks near the Skerryvore lighthouse, to the south west of Tiree.
The rescue effort was carried out in very rough seas and severe gale force winds, according to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.
They said the man was not injured and required no hospital treatment.
A commercial cable-laying vessel provided some shelter from the weather during the rescue mission.
Two RNLI lifeboats were also involved. The Islay attempted to secure a line to the yacht and a vessel from Barra was also sent to assist.
Angus MacIver, the UK Coastguard maritime operations controller, said both rescue vessels were being returned to base.
He added: "The winds in the area were gusting at severe gale force with very rough seas which created a very testing environment in which this rescue could be carried out."
