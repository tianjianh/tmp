Worcester Warriors winger Sam Smith has retired from rugby, at the age of 26.

A recurring quadriceps muscle injury has forced the former Harlequins player to quit.
Smith joined Warriors from Quins in the summer of 2014, going on to play a key part in Dean Ryan's Championship promotion-winning team, scoring 15 tries in 19 appearances.
But he has not featured since the first Championship play-off semi-final against London Scottish in May 2015.
He spent most of last season on the sidelines, including a loan spell back in the Championship with Scottish in February, which also ended in injury.
"Our staff have worked hard to try and get Sam back to full fitness," said Warriors' high performance director Nick Johnston.
"Unfortunately it hasn't worked out for him and he's decided to focus on a different pathway in life. Sometimes that's the way it works out.
Aside from helping Warriors win promotion back to the Premiership, Smith enjoyed his best days in rugby during his five years with Quins, scoring 25 tries in 69 games and helping them win the Premiership in 2012.
Smith, who has recently attained a first-class honours degree in politics and economics, is to concentrate now on his new business - a speciality coffee shop, which is scheduled to open in Worcester city centre in September.
"I am obviously devastated to be moving on from rugby, a game that has given me so many amazing memories, opportunities and lifelong friends," he said.
"I've tried everything I can to get back to full fitness but it's become clear that now is the time for me to focus on my new path in life.
"I love Worcester. Despite only living here for two years it's where I now call home and I'm excited to be setting up my dream in the heart of the city."
