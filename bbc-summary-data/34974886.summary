United have only kept two clean sheets this season and lost 2-1 at at home to Hamilton to slip seven points adrift at the foot of the Premiership.
"When you look defensively, our display against Hamilton it was solid," explained Paatelainen.
"We were comfortable, so from that respect the players get plenty belief."
Despite suffering a sixth loss from the seven games he has overseen since replacing Jackie McNamara, the Finn saw other positives in the performance against Accies.
"Attacking-wise we created loads of chances and clear-cut opportunities," he added.
"We just need to erase those stupid mistakes and we have no problem at all."
In their next four matches United face the teams directly above them starting with a trip to Rugby Park on Saturday to take on Kilmarnock.
Paatelainen said the aim is simply to collect as many points as possible.
"We will try and win every match," he continued. "It's a very tough challenge but that's our target, absolutely.
"The way we have played in the last couple of matches has given us belief. Those teams, they are fighting like us and they won't be easy matches but that's our target, to win them all."
Paatelainen confirmed that the club has received international clearance for Florent Sinama Pongolle but was non-committal on when the former Liverpool forward and fellow new arrival Guy Demel would be fit for first-team duties.
