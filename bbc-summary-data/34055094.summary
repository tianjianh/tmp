The Adventurer of the Year 2015, 24, of Colwyn Bay, Conwy, became the first person to walk across Mongolia solo in 2014.
In September, he will set off on the 1,800-mile (2,900-km) trek through the middle of the Indian Ocean island, before crossing eight mountains.
"I'm determined to see it through," Mr Dykes said.
No-one has ever completed such a challenge, according to adventure tour expert Gilles Gautier.
Legendary adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes said: "It will be a real test of perseverance but I have no doubt he has the grit, determination and stamina to see it through. It will be a remarkable achievement."
A YouTube video has previewed the four-month expedition, which will see Mr Dykes set off from the island's most southern point, Cap Sainte Marie.
He will trek across the southern desert and hack his way through dense jungle and deciduous forests.
Mr Dykes will also tackle the deep gorges and high cliffs of the Ankarana limestone.
The remainder of his journey will be spent following the mountainous ridge that spans almost the entire length of Madagascar, taking on its highest peak - Maromokotro, which is 2,876m (9,436ft) high.
He will then continue north to the tip of Cap d'Ambre, the island's most northerly point.
Mr Dykes will face harsh terrain, volatile weather and a host of animal hazards such as crocodile-infested rivers, snakes, scorpions and deadly spiders.
"It's a challenge I feel I'm ready for, I've prepared for. I've taken on big challenges before - I'm excited," the adventurer said.
He hopes to learn more about Madagascar's diverse flora and fauna, including the work being done to protect its lemurs, the world's most endangered group of mammals.
Mr Dykes will also take the opportunity to search for one of the rarest primates, the northern sportive lemur - which has a population estimated at just 50 - and spend time with indigenous tribes.
"Madagascar is a magical and largely unexplored island. This expedition is an opportunity to showcase its outstanding natural beauty whilst challenging and pushing myself to the limits in every way," he said.
"Its terrain is unforgiving and conditions unpredictable, making it a tough challenge, but I'm determined to see it through.
"It's an opportunity to unlock Madagascar's mystery and share stories of its people and wildlife that would otherwise never be known."
