Children's commissioner Keith Towler 'frustrated' at job delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The selection process to appoint a new children's champion for Wales has been "less than perfect", the outgoing commissioner has said.

Keith Towler told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement show it was "frustrating" his replacement had not been chosen a month before he leaves.
Last year a panel failed to agree on the appointment and the selection process started again.
But Mr Towler added an announcement was expected very soon.
When asked why it had taken so long to appoint a new commissioner, Mr Towler replied: "I think you'll have to talk to Welsh government about that.
"It's quite frustrating from my point of view, and of course my team is as desperate as you to know who the next commissioner will be."
Mr Towler said the short handover period "was not great".
"My understanding is that we should get an announcement pretty shortly," he said.
"That would be great. If there's a gap between the end of my term and the beginning of the next term then my deputy will fill that gap.
"I don't think it'll be that long but... it's less than perfect but it is what it is, I guess, so you just have to work with it."
Last October the Welsh government said the reason the selection process had been halted was because of a cabinet reshuffle.
