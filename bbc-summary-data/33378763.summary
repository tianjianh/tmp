On average, almost 200 drivers a day were caught.
With a minimum £45 fine imposed, it means more than £50,000 will be gathered in just seven days.
The crackdown began on 22 June, with the introduction of six new bus lane cameras in the city centre and a mobile detection unit.
Since then, a total of 1,273 drivers have been caught.
The fixed cameras are positioned at:
The mobile detection unit is monitoring main roads into the city including the Shore Road, Lisburn Road and Ormeau Road.
Anyone caught breaching bus lane rules is fined £90, but the total is reduced to £45 if paid within two weeks.
A spokesperson for the department for regional development said 1273 penalty charge notices (PCNs) had been issued to motorists for driving in bus lanes or bus-only streets in the week commencing 22 June.
"Drivers are entitled to challenge their PCN through the process detailed on the back of all PCNs," the spokesperson added.
