Wales 3-1 Belgium: How did players rate in Wales' historic quarter-final win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales are into the semi-finals of Euro 2016 after a superb 3-1 victory over Belgium in Lille.

Chris Coleman's side fought back from an early Radja Nainggolan goal to triumph thanks to goals from Ashley Williams, Hal Robson-Kanu and Sam Vokes.
The Welsh fairytale in France continues - they now face Portugal in the semi-finals - this is how BBC Sport rated their players at Stade Pierre Mauroy.
Made an excellent early stop from Yannick Carrasco before being beaten from distance by Nainggolan's screamer. Looked like he would be in for a busy evening at that stage but, for all their late pressure, Belgium barely tested him after the break.
Needed help to cope with Eden Hazard down the Welsh right in the first 15 minutes but the Belgian blitz did not last. Kept venturing forward and got his reward with the cross for Sam Vokes' goal.
Another to look shaky at the start, especially when he picked up a booking for fouling Kevin de Bruyne, but like his team-mates he grew in confidence and composure as the game went on. Suspended for the semi-finals after being booked.
Has not looked himself up to now in France but this was the Wales captain at his best. Heading is not his strength but that did not stop him nodding the equaliser and he seemed to be in the right place whenever the ball came into the Wales box.
He and Gunter were given the task of shackling Hazard, and came out on top - the Chelsea forward only cut inside with any real menace once. Made some vital interceptions and blocks.
One of the Wales players to put his body on the line to stop what seemed like certain Belgium goals in the opening minutes. Like Gunter, kept going forward and was unlucky not to score before half-time.
Another tireless tackler who also used the ball simply and effectively to help Wales establish a degree of control in midfield as the game went on.
His passing radar was initially off - he surrendered possession for the move that led to Belgium's opener. But his work-rate never faltered and he gave everything to protect his centre-halves.
Belgium gave him time and space in their half and he punished them for it. Set up two of the three goals and now has four assists for the tournament but his second-half booking for handball means he will miss the semi-final. He did not stop running after that, and Wales will miss him massively too.
An open game suited him and his runs gave Belgium plenty to worry about. He continued to menace their defenders in the second half. No goals or assists this time but he will not care one bit.
What can you say? Amazing. His industry and effort are well-known but the skill he showed to turn half the Belgium defence and put Wales ahead is not. Without a club, for now, but part of Welsh footballing folklore for sure. The fans did not stop singing his name.
Came on to give Wales more legs in midfield when Ledley had used all his energy - did not let anyone down.
Legendary Wales striker John Hartson told me before the game that a Vokes goal was coming and boy was he right. Took the pressure off in the closing minutes with a trademark header.
Too late to earn a mark but will surely play a part against Portugal with Davies suspended.
