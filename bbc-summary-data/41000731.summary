The 2005 world champion will play Luca Brecel in Tuesday's final.
Murphy, who is ranked number eight in the world, trailed 4-2 in Guangzhou before winning four frames in a row to take the semi-final 6-4.
Belgian Brecel saw off home favourite Li Hang 6-5 in the second semi-final, after his shock quarter-final win over Ronnie O'Sullivan.
"I have a terrible record against Ali, it's a long time since I have beaten him," Murphy said.
"At 4-2 down I was just trying to hang on to his coat tails. Some of the safety play was very high quality, but we both missed chances."
The winner of the China Championship will earn Â£150,000.
