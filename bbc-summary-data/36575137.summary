London Irish players Theo Brophy Clews and Alex Lewington will both miss the start of next season after suffering serious injuries on international duty.

Both have undergone operations, with Lewington, 24, having required knee ligament reconstruction surgery.
The winger is expected to be out of action for the majority of the season.
Brophy Clews, 19, had to go off with a foot injury after just 34 minutes of England under-20's World Rugby Championship game against Italy.
The fly-half will miss the first part of the season, but has set his sights on returning before Christmas.
Lewington, who scored five Premiership tries for The Exiles last season, was injured during England Saxons' 32-24 first Test victory against South Africa A.
"I'm really disappointed with the outcome of the injury," he said.
"But, I'm fully focussed on making a full recovery and contributing to London Irish later on in the season as we look to make an immediate return to the Premiership."
