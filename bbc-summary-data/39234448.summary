[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ricardo Rodrigues-Fortes-Gomes, 19, was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court of two counts of rape and will be initially detained in a young offenders' institute.
He attacked her at the top of stairs leading to a canal path in Manchester city centre at about 07:00 on 23 July as she shouted: "Stop, it's not right!"
Police were alerted by a witness.
Rodrigues-Fortes-Gomes, of Old Hall Drive, Gorton was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life and pay a Â£170 victim surcharge.
The witness heard the teenager begging Rodrigues-Fortes-Gomes to stop.
The witness then heard her shout: "If I tell you I don't want to do this, then you stop."
Greater Manchester Police said the attack continued for some time before he fled the scene as officers arrived.
He was arrested later that same morning.
Det Con Dave Jones said: "Rodrigues-Fortes-Gomes is now behind bars and unable to force himself upon people for his own selfish sexual gratification.
"Not only did he subject his victim to a horrifically prolonged attack, he made her endure the distress of a trial by denying his involvement."
