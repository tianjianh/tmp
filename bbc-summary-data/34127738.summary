[SN]TITLE[SN]
Great Fire of London exhibition to mark 350 years of the disaster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new exhibition will display rare artefacts from the Great Fire of London in 1666 to mark its 350th anniversary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Museum of London display will include the personal stories of Londoners who were there during the fire and will look at the city, before and after the blaze.
It will also look at the fire's causes, how London was rebuilt afterwards and compare modern fire fighting techniques to those employed at the time.
Fire! Fire! opens on 23 July next year.
An unfinished piece of embroidery, reputed to have been saved from a house in Cheapside at the time of the fire will be on display for the first time.
Director of the museum Sharon Ament said the fire was an "iconic moment" in the capital's history.
She added: "Whilst it is a potent story there are many myths about the Great Fire and there is a compelling story to tell from catastrophe to the reshaping of the city."
