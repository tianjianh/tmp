Ashes 2015: Mitchell Johnson hopes to reopen England scars

Fast bowler Mitchell Johnson says Australia's attack can reopen the scars of England's batting struggles from their 5-0 Ashes whitewash down under.

Australia are in a commanding position after two days of the second Test at Lord's as they look to square the series after England's win in Cardiff.
Johnson, 33, was named man of the series following Australia's Ashes win in 2013-14 when he took 37 wickets.
"I hope so. That'd be nice, to have those scars come back out," he said.
Left-arm paceman Johnson had a chastening time at the first Test in Cardiff as he finished with match figures of 2-180.
But he looked back to something like his best at Lord's with 2-16 from a six-over spell as England recovered from 30-4 to reach 85-4 after Australia had declared on 566-8.
"Nothing's changed for me. It's always nice to go out there and perform and to bowl at good pace," Johnson added.
"The ball's been swinging over here too and I've really enjoyed that. When the ball swings at good pace it makes it a little more difficult."
He also appeared to make light of England's talk of playing a more attacking style of cricket under new coach Trevor Bayliss.
"We were hoping they would come out and play the aggressive brand they've been talking about," he said. "We hope they come out in the morning and do the same thing."
And he added: "I guess Ben Stokes is a very aggressive player anyway so we'd like to see him play some shots and hopefully get a couple of quick wickets in the morning.
"I can't decide for them, if they want to play aggressive cricket or if they want to go the other way."
England paceman Stuart Broad, who took four for 83 in Australia's first innings, accepted his side had succumbed to the pressure of the tourists' huge total.
"It's always a tricky period when you've conceded a lot of runs to then go out and bat for 30 overs," he said.
"It's always a big test for you and I think mentally we didn't switch on for 20 minutes - and lost four wickets.
"We'll have a few batsmen in that changing room wishing they could face their balls again and play them pretty differently, I think."
