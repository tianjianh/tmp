[SN]TITLE[SN]
Neil Robertson beaten by Barry Hawkins at World Grand Prix in Preston

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former world champion Neil Robertson had a busy day at the World Grand Prix in Preston - beating Ronnie O'Sullivan before losing to Barry Hawkins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Australian beat O'Sullivan 4-1 in the afternoon before losing 4-2 to Hawkins on Thursday evening.
O'Sullivan - who gave a bizarre post-match interview after his first-round win on Wednesday - made a top break of 52 in a scrappy defeat.
Hawkins will now face Joe Perry or Liang Wenbo in the semi-finals.
Hawkins had earlier beaten Judd Trump 4-1, leaving world number six Shaun Murphy as the highest-ranked player left in the draw.
World number one Mark Selby was knocked out in the first round by Martin Gould.
