Chat: What are you doing in the summer holidays?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The summer has arrived!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lots of schools have now broken up for the summer holidays - so that means a few weeks of fun!
We want to know what you've got planned for the holidays - will you be seeing a film at the cinema or trying to read as many funny story books as you can?
Perhaps you're going on a holiday or plan to build a den in your garden with your friends or family?
This chat is now closed, here is a selection of your comments.

In the summer holidays I am going to Tenerife. I am going with all my family. I am most looking forward to going on the beach because then I can play cricket.
