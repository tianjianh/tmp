[SN]TITLE[SN]
Celtic 4-2 Inverness CT

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic's commanding performance was enough to dismantle the resolve of Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The champions established a four-goal lead, with Mikael Lustig and Leigh Griffiths both scoring headers in the opening half.
Stuart Armstrong then struck twice after the interval to cap another impressive display.
Celtic will be concerned, though, by late slackness that allowed Ryan Christie and Dani Lopez to score.
The home side's control was immediately asserted and the onus for Inverness was to try to restrain them.
The visitors were organised and industrious, but a rearranged defence was vulnerable to cross balls and Celtic took full advantage.
They established a two-goal lead in four minutes, with Lustig heading Stefan Johansen's free-kick past Owain Fon Williams, the Inverness goalkeeper.
The next cross came from the left, where the excellent Nir Bitton showed neat footwork to make space before delivering the ball to the back post, where Griffiths rose highest to head into the corner.
It was chastening for Inverness since Celtic were creating chances at will and the home side should have scored a third, with Johansen's shot pushed away by Fon Williams and then Armstrong's shot from the rebound cleared off the line by Ross Draper.
With Scott Brown prominent in central midfield - a typically strong and driving performance - there were passages of play in which every player but Craig Gordon, the Celtic goalkeeper, was in the Inverness half.
Even a crowded defence could barely keep Celtic at bay, with Emilio Izaguirre delivering an outstanding through ball between the Inverness centre-backs for Griffiths, whose shot was blocked by Fon Williams.
The visitors never lost heart and Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo hit one shot from distance that Gordon had to tip over.
That was a rare foray upfield, though, and the pattern was repeated at least at the outset of the second-half.
Inverness's defence remained deeply vulnerable and Celtic added to their lead with relative ease. Armstrong had too much time and space inside the area to measure a curling shot over Fon Williams.
The midfielder took advantage again when Danny Devine tried to pass the ball out of defence but instead sent it straight to Armstrong, who skipped past two challenges before shooting past the goalkeeper.
Celtic manager Ronny Deila made a series of substitutes to keep his key players fresh for the visit of Malmo in the Champions League on Wednesday, but the consequence was an element of carelessness entering Celtic's play.
It might have been the changes in personnel, or complacency due to the four-goal lead, but Celtic were twice caught out by their own poor play.
First, they surrendered possession in their own half to Nat Wedderburn, who played in Christie and his shot flashed past Gordon.
Then similar uncertainty in defence allowed the ball to reach Inverness substitute Lopez on the edge of the area and he steered his effort past Gordon.
The late goals by Inverness were an irritant to Celtic, but otherwise it was a solid performance, and the fans were lifted even before kick-off with new signing Scott Allan being introduced to the crowd.
