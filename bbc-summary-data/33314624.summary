[SN]TITLE[SN]
Companies to appeal Lough Neagh sand order

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Companies that had been told to stop taking sand from the bed of Lough Neagh or face prosecution are to appeal the order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They have lodged an appeal with the Planning Appeals Commission.
The Earl of Shaftesbury, who owns the bed of the lough, has joined the sand companies in appealing the enforcement notice.
In May, Environment Minister Mark H Durkan told them to stop until they had submitted a planning application.
The deadline for the companies to comply with the ministerial order had been due to run out on Tuesday.
Under the legislation, the appeal means they can continue to extract sand pending the outcome of the case, or its withdrawal.
It is estimated that about 1.7m tonnes of sand are being extracted from the bed of the lough every year.
It supplies about a quarter of Northern Ireland's construction needs annually.
Environmentalists have complained that it is taking place without planning permission in an internationally recognised bird habitat with EU protection.
Mr Durkan has declined to comment.
His department said there would be no statement as the case was a "live enforcement issue".
