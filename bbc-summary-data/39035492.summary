Plymouth Argyle 0-1 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County upset second-placed Plymouth at Home Park to edge further away from the League Two relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jorge Grant netted his third goal in four matches as County, now unbeaten in five matches, moved eight points clear of danger.
Grant scored the winner in the 21st minute after a defensive mix-up caused by an under-hit Yann Songo'o back pass, with Jonathan Forte's initial effort initially blocked and in-form Grant first to react.
In first half stoppage-time on-loan Forest striker Grant should have claimed his second of the game but fired wide from 10 yards after his first strike was bravely blocked by right-back Oscar Threlkeld.
Plymouth striker Ryan Taylor's spectacular volley at the start of the second half had to be tipped over by goalkeeper Adam Collin.
In the 65th minute County substitute Jon Stead headed wide from Marc Bola's deep cross into the six-yard box.
Argyle almost secured a point but substitute Jordan Slew volleyed over 10 minutes from time after Collin's poor punch landed at his feet.
