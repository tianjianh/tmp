Scotland: SNP 63, Conservative 31, Labour 24, Greens 6, Lib Dem 5
The SNP is claiming a "historic victory" but it did not win enough seats to form a majority government. The Conservatives, in a move that would been unthinkable in the past, pushed Labour into third place in Scotland, with leader Ruth Davidson winning her seat from the SNP. The Greens overtook the Lib Dems.
Wales: Labour 29, Plaid Cymru 12, Conservatives 11, UKIP 7, Lib Dems 1
UKIP had a good night and have won their first assembly seats, getting 12.5% of votes. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood picked up a key seat from Labour, who remain the largest party but have just missed out on a majority.
England: Labour 58 councils won, Conservatives 38, Lib Dems 4
Labour had a mixed night in council elections, holding on to some key authorities that it had been expected to lose but facing criticism that it had not done well enough to suggest victory in the 2020 general election. With all 124 council results in, Labour was down 18 councillors on the last time these seats were contested, in 2012. The Conservatives were down 48 councillors on 2012 while the Lib Dems - who won control of one council, Watford - and UKIP had gained 45 and 25 councillors respectively. The Greens are down three.
Police and crime commissioners in England and Wales: Party candidates swept aside most of the independents that took control of police areas in the first PCC elections four years ago.  The number of independents went down from 12 to three, with the Conservatives going from 16 to 20 PCCs. Labour increased its number of PCCs from 12 to 15. Plaid Cymru was the only other party to get a look-in, with two PCCs, although UKIP ran the Conservatives a close second in a couple of areas. Turnout was up by more than 20% up on 2012, when it was among the lowest for any elections ever held. It was lowest in areas where local elections were not being held.
Northern Ireland: Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has 38 seats, Sinn FÃ©in 28, Ulster Unionists 16, SDLP 12 and the Alliance Party eight. First minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster topped the poll in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The Greens and People Before Profit Alliance have two seats each. The TUV leader Jim Allister remains its sole representative. In South Down, John McCallister became the first high-profile MLA to lose his seat.
London: Sadiq Khan has been elected the new Mayor of London, beating Conservative Zac Goldsmith by 1,310,143 votes to 994,614. Labour remains largest party on the London Assembly.

Analysis - By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor
Jeremy Corbyn's party has swerved universal disaster - losses so far in England are fewer than some had feared. But with meltdown in Scotland, and losses where there should traditionally be gains, Labour would be foolish to take much comfort from the results.
There is little to suggest that voters believe the Labour Party on its current performance is on its way to a general election victory. Mr Corbyn's internal enemies are not likely to wield the knife, but there are already calls for more decisive leadership, more appeals to go to the centre ground.
