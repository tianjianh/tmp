Mexicans tell Trump: 'You're not welcome'

The surprise announcement by US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that he will fly to Mexico on Wednesday has led to a flood of tweets from Mexicans, most of them expressing their anger at the visit.

Mr Trump, of course, is no stranger to Twitter himself and it came as no surprise that he should have announced his visit on the social media platform.
But it is his previous tweets about the US's southern neighbour which has turned many Mexicans against Mr Trump.
Many of them date back to last year and are far from flattering.
His controversial plan to build a wall between the two neighbours to keep undocumented Mexican immigrants from crossing into the US also featured in this tweets early on.
It seems Mexicans could do nothing right in the eyes of Mr Trump, as he took advantage of Mexican director Alejandro G Inarritu's success at the 2015 Oscars to slam Mexico for "ripping off the US".
And of course there have been other comments, not all of them on Twitter, which have made Mexicans' blood boil -  such as this one made in a speech in June 2015: "They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people, but I speak to border guards, and they tell us what we are getting."
Former Mexican President Vicente Fox was among the first Mexican politicians to react to the news of Mr Trump's visit, saying that there was no "turning back".
"Trump, your offensive behaviour towards Mexicans, Muslims and others have put you in the hole you're now in. Bye bye, Trump!"
Most Mexicans who took to Twitter demanded Mr Trump apologise for his previous comments.
Historian Enrique Krauze addressed Mr Trump directly in English.
The presidential candidate for the opposition Pan party, Margarita Zavala, did not hold back either, telling Mr Trump that "even though you have been invited, you should know you're not welcome".
"Mexicans have dignity and reject your hateful discourse," she added.
A former Mexican ambassador to the US, Arturo Sarukhan, was more worried about the message that the invite by President Enrique Pena Nieto sent.
Historian Hector Aguilar Camin meanwhile commented on the risk taken by President Pena Nieto by inviting Mr Trump.
He tweeted: "Tomorrow's dilemma is that either Trump apologises to Mexicans or Pena Nieto loses the support he still has."
Some Mexicans expressed their anger and frustration with their president's invite to Mr Trump under the hashtag #YouAreNotWelcome and, in Spanish, #NoEresBienvenidoTrump.
Others opted for simplicity:
