Forty models will be dotted around the streets and waterfront as part of the "Pigs Gone Wild" art trail in summer 2016, in aid of St Elizabeth Hospice.
The animals, chosen to "celebrate Suffolk's rich agricultural heritage", will be decorated by local artists.
The production company behind Norwich's gorilla art trail is also involved.
Organisers said the sculpture trail would be the town's "biggest-ever mass participation public art event".

The hospice revealed its first sculpture, Tally-ho Trotters, at the Suffolk Show on Wednesday.
"We're extremely excited to start talking to local businesses and artists about sponsoring and creating the other sculptures," said the hospice's special projects manager Norman Lloyd.
The full-grown pigs will be joined by litters of piglet sculptures, decorated by school students and teachers, which will go on display in town centre stores for the 10-week project.
