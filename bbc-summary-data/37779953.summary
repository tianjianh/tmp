Three budding photographers from the same Scottish town have scooped top prizes in the UK Landscape Photographer of the Year awards.

Lesley Smith and young winners Hannah Faith Jackson and Henry Memmott all hail from Strathaven in South Lanarkshire.
The coincidence was only discovered when Lesley, 45, revealed her win on town's community Facebook page.
"There's no connection between us at all," she said.
"I only realised after they announced the winners."
Medical secretary Lesley won the Urban view category for her photo of the demolition of Glasgow's Red Road Flats.
"I waited five and a half hours to get the shot," she said. "I found the only hole in the fence for my camera and didn't want to lose my spot."
Henry, 17, won two awards in the youth category for his photos of Glasgow at night and Glengavel Reservoir in Strathaven.
He says his hometown produced three winners because the scenery makes people want to pick up a camera.
"Strathaven is one of the most beautiful places I've seen. The landscape here really inspires you," he said.
Henry, who studies Ecology at St Andrews University, honed his skills when he took Higher Photography at Strathaven Academy.
Hannah, 15, is at the same school. She won the overall Young Landscape Photographer of the Year 2016 prize for her shot of a bar window in Glasgow's West End.
She said she has always been interested in taking pictures, as are her dad and sister.
Hannah said: "I have contacted the Queen to tell her about my winning the competition but she's probably already read it in the newspaper or something.
"I've sent her a letter. I also said I'm going to take some pictures of Buckingham Palace when we are down in London.
"I haven't had a response back yet."
An exhibition of all the winning photographs will be held at London's Waterloo station from 21 November.
