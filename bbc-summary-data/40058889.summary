Cheese-rolling veteran hopes to match all-time record

A champion cheese-roller is hoping to match the all-time record for the most cheeses won when he takes part in this year's festival in Gloucestershire.

Chris Anderson has taken home 17 double Gloucester cheeses in 12 years, after chasing the hefty 8lb (3.6kg) cheeses down Cooper's Hill.
The 29-year-old is now three races shy of current record holder Stephen Gyde.
Mr Anderson said: "I've been up a few times because I was worried I'd lose my bottle but I feel quite good."
Each year thousands of spectators turn out to watch thrill-seekers hurl themselves down the 1:2 gradient, chasing wheels of double Gloucester cheese.
However, injuries are inevitable for competitors chasing a 70mph cheese down a rough, uneven hillside.
In 2005, Mr Anderson won the race but broke his ankle and in 2007 he suffered "quite bad concussion".
"You go slower if you stay on your feet," he said.
"You have to stay on your on feet to about halfway down and once you fall you have to pick yourself up and start running again."
With his quickest time clocked at eight seconds, Mr Anderson's reward - as with all winners - is to take the cheese home with him.
"I don't really like double Gloucester, it's too strong so I give it out around the family," he admits.
With the prospect of matching the all-time record on Monday, the cheese-rolling champion said it was actually more important to "keep a local person winning".
"I'm getting older and wising up - I don't want to get injured," he said.
"It's a bit worse each year but this year I do feel quite good."
