Traffic on the A1 heading towards Hillsborough and Lisburn is backed up to Dromore.
A number of other lorries are reported as being stuck because of the snow - two at Sprucefield, Lisburn, two on the Saintfield Road, near Dobbies and one on the Rock Road in Lisburn.
Other areas affected by the snow are Newtownstewart, Drumbo, Dromara, Hillsborough, Castlederg, Portaferry and Portavogie.
Two schools in County Tyrone are closed because of the snow - St Joseph's Primary School, Galbally and Ardstraw Primary School, Newtownstewart.
People texting into @BBCgmu reported that heavy snow was making driving conditions very difficult on the Upper Hightown Road in Mallusk, the Ligoniel Road in north Belfast, Killyleagh and in Omagh.
Drivers can keep up to date @BBCNITravel.
The Kerr family in Cloughey, County Down, had time to build a snowman before the children set off for school.
