TV is influential and the major terrestrial networks, including market leaders KBS and MBC, command the lion's share of viewing and advertising. Most South Koreans subscribe to digital cable and satellite.

South Korean TV soaps are popular across the region, including in China. They are part of the "Korean Wave" - the export of South Korean popular culture across Asia.
Newspaper readership is high and there are more than 100 national and local dailies. The press is often critical of the government. Many newspapers are controlled by industrial conglomerates.
The government has stepped up pressure on TV channels that are seen as over-critical, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) notes. Nevertheless, South Korea is one of the few Asian nations where there is real news pluralism, it says.
South Korea is at the leading edge of the digital revolution. It is a trailblazer for high-speed and wireless internet. Around 41.5 million South Koreans were online by the end of 2013 (InternetWorldStats).
The country is a pioneer of TV via mobile devices and the internet (IPTV). Online gaming is a national passion.
The government has "put in place the means to scrutinise online news", says RSF. Scores of web users, including a well-known blogger, have been arrested following complaints from the government or individuals.
Twitter is a popular medium for political debate and campaigning. Use of the platform is twice the world average, a study has said.
South Korea has one of the world's biggest blogging communities, second only to China.
