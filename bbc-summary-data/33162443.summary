A footpath unveiled by Sir David Attenborough has been forced to close three days after opening because a bird has taken up residence there.

An oystercatcher has made its home on "Attenborough's Walk" at Cley Marshes, which was opened on 12 June.
The path connects the marshes with another Norfolk Wildlife Trust site, Salthouse Marshes.
The protected bird's chicks are expected to fledge "in a couple of weeks", when the path will reopen.
"Oystercatchers are large black and white wading birds with a long, orange-red bill and reddish-pink legs," said Salthouse Marshes warden Adam Pimble.
"It has chosen to nest on the path and as it is a protected bird this means we have had to close the footpath."
Norfolk Wildlife Trust bought the stretch of land in 5 miles (8km) of protected coastal sites in 2012 following a Â£900,000 public appeal and a Heritage Lottery Fund grant.
