[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A licence for a late-night Cuban-themed restaurant and bar has been granted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Revolucion De Cuba, part of the Revolution chain, will open in the former HMV store in Friar Street, Reading, which closed in 2011.
Reading Borough Council attached a number of conditions, including limiting capacity to 500 and restricting weekend opening hours.
Objections were raised by police and borough councillors over the increased risk of crime and disorder in the area.
Revolucion De Cuba already has venues in Cardiff, Derby, Manchester, Sheffield and Norwich.
It had applied for a capacity of 650 and opening hours until 02:00 between Thursday and Saturday.
The council requested the venue close at 01:00 between Thursday and Saturday and 00:30 Sunday to Wednesday.
Police concerns centred on the potential dispersal of people on to town centre streets at the same time with a number of nearby venues operating similar late-night hours.
