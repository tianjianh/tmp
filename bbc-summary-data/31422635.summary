Police said they were alerted to Laura Hewlett-Conway driving erratically along Widney Manor Road in Solihull last month by residents who heard a "loud screeching noise".
She was found on a driveway nearby in her pyjamas and "unsteady on her feet", claiming the wheel had just come off.
The 33-year-old from Solihull was banned from driving for 17 months.
She admitted drink-driving and dangerous driving and received an 18-month supervision order and 180 hours' community service at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Monday.
She must also pass an extended driving test in order to get back her licence.
The hairdresser, of Ravenswood Drive, registered 78 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath, more than twice the legal limit, when she was stopped on 23 January, police said.
Officers said they found a trail of damaged asphalt, caused by her Ford Ka, stretching for about 2.7 miles (4.8km).
Pc Tony Winter from West Midlands Police, said: "The car was making a deafening noise as it scraped its way along the road.
"One person who called police said they thought the car was dragging a wheel clamp with it.
"It's incredible she managed to drive so far without colliding with other vehicles or causing a serious accident.
"It was extremely dangerous driving and beggars belief she couldn't have known there was something seriously wrong with the car."
