The Aberdeen Tour Series event on 25 May will involve a 1.2km circuit in the city centre.
It will form round eight of the Tour Series, a UK-wide criterium racing competition challenging cyclists to complete several laps of a circuit.
Aberdeen City Council has uploaded a map and details of the city's circuit to its website.
Aberdeen is one of two Scottish venues hosting rounds of series, with Motherwell hosting round seven on 23 May.
It will be the third time that the event has visited the North Lanarkshire venue.
George Adam, the lord provost of Aberdeen, said: "This event will ignite the city's heart as the cyclists are put to the test racing past some of Aberdeen's historic landmarks, such as Aberdeen Art Gallery, His Majesty's Theatre with the start and finish on the city's iconic Union Street.
"We are also encouraging the public to take part in a fun-filled day of activities that will see the city centre brought to life by this unique cycling spectacle."
Tour Series race director Mick Bennett said: "We are looking forward to bringing the Tour Series to Aberdeen this May.
"The circuit will showcase the heart of Aberdeen combining a very fast, flowing opening half of the lap with a more technical finale, including the slow last corner and a deceptive drag to the finish line on Union Street."
