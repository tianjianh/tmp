The 30-year-old midfielder embarks on a move to the two-time Coupe de France winners having also played in Kazakhstan and Sweden.
"I'm delighted to sign for Guingamp and I'm really looking forward to joining a club of their stature," Nwabuoku told BBC Sport.
"Football in France is totally different from what I have experienced elsewhere but I'm ready to give my best."
Guingamp announced on its website that signing the free agent Nigerian is in line with its desire to build a very competitive women's team next season.
Nwabuoku, who has 49 caps for Nigeria, captained the Super Falcons to the 2014 African Women Championship title and at last year's Fifa Women's World in Canada.
More success followed at club level when she helped Biik Kazygurt retain the Kazakhstan Women Premier league in 2015 before switching to Swedish club Ã–stersunds DFF in April. But six weeks after arriving in Sweden she left the club by mutual consent.
And Guingamp's first summer signing said she was excited at the prospect of playing alongside international teammate Desire Oparanozie.
Oparanozie emerged as the French league's sixth top goalscorer in the 2015/16 season, scoring 11 goals in 22 games as Guingamp finished eighth in the league.
"I've joined an ambitious club and it will be a tremendous experience to reunite with my compatriot and sister Oparanozie," Nwabuoku said.
"I will be doing all I can, and working as hard as possible, to bring more success to the club."
