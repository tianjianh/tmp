A Chelsea supporter suspected of racist chanting on the Paris Metro is challenging a possible football banning order on the grounds of jurisdiction.

Scotland Yard is seeking the order under the Football Spectators Act 1989, which applies to England and Wales.
Richard Barklie, who lives in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, is one of five Chelsea supporters facing the order.
A judge at Thames Magistrates' Court said he would hear the point on 7 July.
District Judge Gareth Branston said this would happen ahead of a full hearing at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on 15 and 16 July.
In February some Chelsea fans were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let a black man on the Paris Metro ahead of the west London club's match against Paris St Germain.
Several Chelsea supporters chanted: "We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it."
Police are applying for banning orders to be imposed on five men who they believe were involved.
They are: Mr Barklie, 50, of Victoria Street, Carrickfergus; Dean Callis, 32, of Liverpool Road, Islington, north London; Jordan Munday, 30, of Ellenborough Road, Sidcup, south-east London; Josh Parsons, 20, of Woodhouse Place, Dorking and William Simpson, 26, of Hengrove Crescent, Ashford, Surrey.
An earlier hearing at Waltham Forest was told the men oppose the orders, which are designed as a preventative measure to stop potential troublemakers from travelling to football matches at home and abroad.
The man kept off the train, Souleymane S, has claimed what happened "destroyed" him and left him unable to work or travel on public transport.
Mr Barklie's lawyer Nick Scott said: "He vehemently denies all the allegations made against him.
"His work in human rights healing the scars of the troubles in Northern Ireland shows what a man of compassion he is."
