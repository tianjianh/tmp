Melinda Rose Woodward - known as Linda - died earlier this month after suffering from cancer.
The couple, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, were married for 59 years.
Sir Tom said: "So many beautiful and meaningful things were said and reading these genuine and lovely messages has lifted us all."
The couple started dating at 15 and used to meet at a phone box at the end of Sir Tom's street in Treforest.
They married when they were 16 in 1957 and later had the phone box moved to their home in Los Angeles.
Lady Woodward died in Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on 10 April.
Their son, Mark, is Sir Tom's manager.
Under the heading "A little note from Tom," on his website, Sir Tom said: "A heartfelt thank you to all who sent notes of their sympathy and support to me and my family over the last couple of weeks.
"So many beautiful and meaningful things were said and reading these genuine and lovely messages has lifted us all. See you soon."
The singer, who had his first number one hit in 1965 with It's Not Unusual, cancelled a series of concerts when his wife fell ill.
According to his website, his next scheduled tour date is at the Hampton Court Palace Festival in London on 8 June, followed by a number of performances in the UK, Norway and Spain.
