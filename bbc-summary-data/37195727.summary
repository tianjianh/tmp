The work, which celebrates the Thai heritage of the club's owners, has been painted onto the side of the Grade-II* Newarke Houses Museum.
There had been opposition to the work from Historic England but it was approved by the city council.
The Foxes shocked the football world in May when they won the Premier League at odds of 5,000/1.
The six murals, showcasing different elements of the title win, were commissioned by Leicester City Council.
Artist Leigh Drummond said: "I've painted on this scale for a few years, but I think this may have been the largest one I've done in Leicester though.
"It has been really nice [to be a part of], there has been lots of positive comments."
Historic England had been concerned it would "harm the appreciation and understanding" of the building.
Other murals round the city celebrate some of the Foxes' memorable 2015-16 matches, the atmosphere at King Power Stadium and manager Claudio Ranieri.
They can be seen on East Bond Street, Oxford Street, St Nicholas Circle, Burnmoor Street and Tudor Road.
