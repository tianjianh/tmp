The Borussia Dortmund player has been strongly linked with a move to Manchester City this summer, when Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola will take over at Etihad Stadium.
On Friday, Dortmund tweeted the player had suffered a serious injury.
Gundogan, 25, injured his back in 2013 and has also had several knee problems.
He has featured 25 times for Dortmund in the Bundesliga this season and played in four Euro 2016 qualifiers, scoring the winner in September's 3-2 victory over Scotland at Hampden Park.
