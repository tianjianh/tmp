Oxford United manager Michael Appleton said his side created enough chances to win "four or five games" in their 2-2 draw at Plymouth Argyle.

"Although we didn't take the three points, I'm sure the fans are delighted with the performance," he said.
The U's twice led their fellow League Two promotion chasers but were denied a fourth successive league win by Craig Tanner's equaliser at Home Park.
Oxford sit level on points with Plymouth in second place.
"I'm delighted with the way we've played, coming here and putting on a performance," Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford.
"We've got to be positive for the remaining 11 games. We looked like we'd score every time we attacked."
Oxford's five remaining league games in March see them face four teams in the bottom half of the table and just one midweek fixture following seven games in three weeks.
"We've got a little bit of a break now for the first time in a while, so hopefully we'll be ready for Leyton Orient on Saturday," Appleton added.
"It's nice sometimes to refresh the mind and for 24 to 48 hours have some down time before refocusing."
