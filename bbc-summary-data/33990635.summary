[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new surf lagoon in Snowdonia will have to be completely drained after closing due to a "mechanical fault".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Surf Snowdonia announced on Wednesday the lagoon will shut for "several days" while engineers make repairs.
The lagoon was filled with more than six million gallons (33,000 cubic metres) of filtered rainwater for its opening earlier this month.
The centre, at Dolgarrog in the Conwy Valley, apologised to customers "for the disruption and disappointment".
