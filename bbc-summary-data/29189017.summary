Stabbed Kell Brook wants a contest with British rival Amir Khan in early 2015 and potentially Floyd Mayweather as he continues his recovery.

The IBF welterweight champion was stabbed in the leg with a machete while on holiday in Tenerife on 4 September.
Brook told the Daily Mail he was the "victim of an unprovoked attack".
Despite his injuries, the 28-year-old from Sheffield said nothing will stop him from returning to the ring to defend his title.
Unbeaten Brook claimed the IBF title following a majority points win over Shawn Porter in California last month.
But after losing significant amounts of blood in the attack in a Tenerife apartment and an emergency operation in hospital, Brook admitted fearing for his life.
Revealing the extent of his injuries, he said: "Around the (wound) area there is no feeling.
"The doctor said it might never come back.
"It is numb, like when you go to the dentist, but I believe in thinking positive and think I will make a full recovery.
"The knife went through two muscles, but the operation was a success and blood is getting to those muscles."
Settling a score with Khan is top of the agenda for Brook once he does return to boxing.
But he admits he would relish a bout with pound-for-pound superstar Floyd Mayweather, who will face Argentine Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas on Saturday night.
"I'm thinking positive because I have to, but believe me, I will get better and then I'll smash Amir Khan," he added.
"Nothing will stop me from coming back and defending (my belt). Nothing.
"The dream scenario would then be to fight Floyd Mayweather.
"I'm a young lion and I believe I can be one of the greats."
