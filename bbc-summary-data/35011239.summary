About 2,000 people in the Republic of Ireland have been left without power and some flights have been diverted as Storm Desmond hits the country.

The power cuts are mainly along the west of Ireland.
A gust of 118km/h (73mph) was recorded at Mace Head off County Galway as Desmond, the fourth named storm of the winter, reached the west coast.
In Northern Ireland, strong wind and heavy rain warnings are in force for Friday night.
In counties Down and Tyrone, roads were closed due to fallen trees.
The wet and windy weather is expected to continue on Saturday.
