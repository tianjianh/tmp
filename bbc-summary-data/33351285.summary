More than 70 firefighters were called to the blaze on Montague Road, in Leytonstone, which started at about 17:48 BST, London Fire Brigade said.
About 100 people were evacuated from the surrounding area, taking shelter in a local church.
The fire, which affected two car workshops containing about 15 cars, was under control by 20:34 BST.
Photos showed thick black smoke billowing from the fire, which also affected a neighbouring garden and scrapyard.
Jabril Roberts, who lives nearby, said: "It was frantic. It seemed out of control"
"The smoke was thick and black from the tyres of the garage burning."
Leytonstone High Road London Overground station, which is near to the fire, was closed, while there is no service between South Tottenham and Barking.
