[SN]TITLE[SN]
Firm fined over Stoke-on-Trent man's cooker death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A food waste recycling company has been fined after a worker died carrying out repairs inside an industrial cooker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Bullock, 50, from Stoke-on-Trent, died after he was badly scalded when steam from elsewhere in the system fed into the area where he was working.
John Pointon and Sons was fined Â£660,000 at Stafford Crown Court after admitting health and safety breaches.
The firm was also ordered to pay Â£187,000 in costs following Mr Bullock's death in 2011.
Health and Safety Executive Inspector Wayne Owen said: "The cookers in operation at the company form the core part of the business.
"Precautions should have been taken to ensure all avenues which had the potential to allow steam to be fed back into the cooker had been suitably isolated."
