Gregor Townsend hopes Saturday's "emotional" Champions Cup clash between Munster and Glasgow Warriors will bring out the best in both sides.

The match in Limerick comes less than a week after the sudden death of Munster head coach Anthony Foley.
"It'll be a great occasion," said Townsend. "There will be a lot of emotion at the game.
"It's a game to remember all of what Anthony did and helped create at Munster."
Townsend admits it's been tough to lift his players in training this week after the news broke of Foley's passing.
"It's been a tough week for world rugby," he explained. "You saw the reaction from all over the world, not just in rugby but in sport, it's such a loss for our game.
"A huge loss for Munster Rugby and our thoughts go with them and Anthony's family.
"It's been different. It's certainly been much more subdued around the place, just the shock that everybody felt over the weekend.
"The players have gone about their jobs and worked hard. Beginning of the week we didn't know if the game would be on but we prepared as if it would be played.
"Our players appreciate the enormity of what's happened and being involved in the game will hopefully bring out the best in both teams."
Having opened their Champions Cup campaign with a memorable thrashing of Leicester Tigers at Scotstoun last weekend, Warriors have a chance to take another step towards making the quarter-finals for the first time.
"We always knew going into this game it was going to be a huge occasion," said Townsend. "Munster in the Champions Cup are a different team.
"Thomond Park is full of people, they play at a much more intense level, so I'd imagine this will be a huge game now in terms of crowd support."
