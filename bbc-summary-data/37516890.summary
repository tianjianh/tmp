The Reds ran in 10 tries as they recorded their biggest win of the season and their first away victory.
"The boys were awesome, and we're probably a bit disappointed that it wasn't more," he told BBC Cornwall.
"We've set quite high standards this year and we've probably expected a bit more from ourselves."
The bonus-point win sees Redruth move up to fourth in the division, seven points behind leaders Taunton.
"It was important that we got that first win on the road," added Churcher. "We wanted to play a fast, open, physical game of rugby and we did that straight from the off."
