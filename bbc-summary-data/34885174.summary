The gunman fired a number of shots at their vehicle which was parked near at shop on the Monagh Road.
It happened at about 16:15 GMT on Friday.  The gunman left the scene on foot.
Det Insp Mary White said police inquiries are "currently ongoing to establish a motive for the shooting".
Sinn FÃ©in MLA for West Belfast, Pat Sheehan, condemned the attack and expressed concern that it was the second gun attack in as many days in the area.
On Thursday, a man was shot in the head in Rossnareen Avenue and remains in a critical condition in hospital.
Mr Sheehan said: "It is too early to state whether these attacks are linked but whoever thinks they can take guns onto the streets and put our communities at risk is wrong."
