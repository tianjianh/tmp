Dele Alli: Tottenham midfielder like a wild horse - Mauricio Pochettino

Dele Alli is like "a wild horse" that cannot be tamed, according to his Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino.

The England midfielder's temperament was questioned last season after he was given a three-match ban for punching West Brom's Claudio Yacob.
But Alli, 20, has impressed this term and has just one booking from 14 games.
"He is a big talent but he was a bit wild," said Pochettino. "Now he is more domesticated. You can't lose that side - it might make him a special player."
Alli also made headlines for another incident last season when he was lucky to escape punishment when he kicked Fiorentina defender Nenad Tomovic in a Europa League fixture.
"It is like when you have a wild horse and you need to put it in a box and domesticate it, no?" added Tottenham's Argentine manager.
"It is all a process with the younger lads to be more mature, with more experience, now more focused on playing football.
"He is special, a great guy. We have a very good relationship. He is a very emotional person and we all love him."
Pochettino wants Vincent Janssen to stop putting himself under pressure, and insists the summer signing will score goals.
Since joining Spurs from Dutch side AZ Alkmaar for Â£17m, the 22-year-old has scored once in 12 appearances.
"It is true we and he would be happier if he was scoring, but it's a normal process," said Pochettino.
"He wants to show he has the quality to score and maybe he puts a lot of pressure on himself."
Janssen scored 27 goals in the Dutch Eredivisie last season and won the Johan Cruyff Trophy, awarded to the division's young player of the year.
Pochettino added: "In the end, we need to calm him, say: 'Yes, good, don't worry, work hard, keep going and you will ensure you will score'."
Janssen has featured in all six games England striker Harry Kane has missed since injuring an ankle on 18 September, playing over an hour in five of them.
His only goal since moving to London came in the first game of that spell, a penalty in a 5-0 EFL Cup win over Gillingham.
"He is not frustrated, he is disappointed," added Pochettino, whose side are third in the Premier League.
"He's come from Holland and always those players from outside need time. He only needs time."
Tottenham will go top of the Premier League if they win at Bournemouth on Saturday, as leaders Manchester City and second-placed Arsenal play later in the weekend.
Pochettino will again be without Kane but believes the chance to take top spot means "it is impossible to have better motivation".
