The break-in happened at Barnham Broom Golf Club, near Norwich, in the early hours of Monday.
Half of the batteries were left behind after the thieves were disturbed loading them into a white VW van.
Police said they are linking the crime with another raid on nearby Bawburgh Golf Club on 1 March. James Goose, from the club, said it seemed organised.

Norfolk Police said the batteries contain lead that can be sold for scrap.
In the Bawburgh incident, thieves removed the batteries from four buggies.
Mr Goose, the operations manager at Bawburgh Golf Club, said: "It certainly seems organised, if you hadn't been to the course before, you wouldn't have known the direct route to where the buggies are kept.
"It seems a lot of effort to go to for what the police are stating is the lead in the batteries.
"It's frustrating for us and also worrying in the fact they might come back."
Officers are reviewing CCTV and are appealing for information.
