President Barack Obama has announced ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday that there is no "specific or credible" threat of a terrorist attack in the US.

In the wake of the deadly Paris attacks, he said it is understandable that Americans fear something similar happening in the US.
"We know of no specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland," he said.
He said the US is doing everything it can to keep Americans safe.
There have been more than 8,000 airstrikes on strongholds of the so-called Islamic State, he said, and work is continuing to stop the terrorist group's financing and supply lines.
Mr Obama and French President Francois Hollande agreed on Tuesday to step up co-ordination on airstrikes.
"I want the American people to know entering the holidays that the combined resources of our military, our intelligence and our homeland security agencies are on the case. They are vigilant, relentless and effective," said Mr Obama.
He said that in the event of a threat, the American public would be informed.
IS had released videos threatening attacks on the US in New York City and Washington following the Paris attacks that left 130 people dead and scores injured.
Mr Obama reiterated security measures the US has taken since 9/11 and said the country continues to adjust tactics to fight terrorism as necessary.
He urged people to report it to authorities if they see something suspicious.
"While the threat of terrorism is a troubling reality of our age, we are both equipped to prevent attacks and we are resilient in the face of those who try to do us harm and that's something we can all be thankful for," he said.
