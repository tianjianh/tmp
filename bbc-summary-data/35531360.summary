The 28-year-old joined the club in the summer from French side Marseille in a deal worth more than £10m.
The France international has excelled this season, scoring six goals in 22 appearances to help the Hammers to sixth in the Premier League.
The new deal - replacing Payet's previous five-year contract - lasts until summer 2021.
Earlier this week, the club denied media reports that Payet had made demands over a new contract.
Speaking after West Ham's 2-1 FA Cup win over Liverpool on Tuesday, manager Slaven Bilic said: "We must do everything we can to keep our best players - and he is our best player."
Hammers co-owner David Sullivan recently described Payet as the "signing of the season".
"He's the best player I've signed in 25 years," said the 67-year-old.
"He's a £30m player. He's a supreme footballer. He makes every player in our side play better. On his day, he's world class, he's unstoppable."
