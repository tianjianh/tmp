David Byrne was shot dead when gunmen opened fire at a boxing weigh-in event at the Regency Hotel on 5 February.
On Wednesday, three AK 47 rifles were discovered when armed officers stopped a car near Slane in County Meath.
The arrested man is from County Donegal and he is also understood to have links to dissident republicanism.
Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰ said the guns were now being examined to establish if they were used in the Dublin shooting.
A police (Garda) spokesman confirmed that a 39-year-old man had been detained in County Meath on Wednesday under the Offences Against the State Act.
However, he said no further information about the arrested was available for "operational reasons".
