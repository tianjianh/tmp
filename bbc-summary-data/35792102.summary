Greg Docherty had put Accies in front early on with a powerful 12-yard shot.
But Frenchman Pogba popped up at the back post to neatly nod in a measured Steven Lawless delivery.
And the turnaround was complete late on as substitute Kris Doolan crossed for Edwards to head home his first Jags goal.
The Australian was not even meant to be starting the match, but was drafted in as a late replacement for Liam Lindsay, who injured himself in the warm-up.
His match-winning contribution means Partick Thistle jump above Dundee into seventh place, and Jags fans will surely be allowing themselves to dream of a late surge into the top six, rather than worry about any relegation threat.
That is still a concern for Accies though, who failed to make the most of another Kilmarnock defeat - by Celtic earlier in the day - with player-manager Martin Canning undoubtedly tearing his hair out at how to seal a victory in front of the club's own fans.
Docherty, who has been with Hamilton since the age of nine, is developing a habit of scoring against Partick Thistle.
This strike was only the third of the 19-year-old's career, but it's the second time the Jags have been victim to him popping up in the right place at the right time.
His effort - which hit the roof of the net after taking a slight deflection on its way in - owed much to the industry of Gramoz Kurtaj on the left hand side. The German held the ball up well before rolling it diagonally towards the penalty spot for Docherty to convert emphatically.
The visitors took most of the first half to adjust to losing Lindsay and could have been two goals down had Eamonn Brophy not strayed offside before collecting Docherty's pass and finishing into the far corner.
Partick Thistle made the perfect start to the second half, though.
Paul Pogba scored at the Allianz Arena for Juventus against Bayern Munich in the Champions League during the week, but in South Lanarkshire brother Mathias equalised for the Jags versus Hamilton.
It was a neat downward header past Michael McGovern at the back post and came about thanks to an excellently weighted cross by Lawless from the left.
Brophy, in for the suspended Carlton Morris, remained lively for the hosts and watched his angled shot flash over.
But it was Partick Thistle who had the last laugh, snatching their first win in four attempts when Edwards' positive run met Doolan's centre.
