Rahul, who lives in Barnet, beat his nine-year-old opponent - Ronan - 10-4 in the programme's final.
Rahul, who has an IQ high enough to be a member of Mensa, fought off competition from 19 children aged eight to 12 in the week-long show.
He clinched the title by answering a question on 19th Century artists William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais.
This series of Child Genius started on Monday and was screened every evening this week. It was Channel 4's most watched programme each day, with an average audience of 1.8 million tuning in for the final.
In the final, Rahul's chosen subject was Edward Jenner's medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. He and Ronan both scored 15 in their specialist fields.
He had been expecting to face 11-year-old Joshua in Saturday's final but Ronan's knowledge of 1666 London saw him get the place.

Rahul had impressed audiences and quizmaster Richard Osman in the first round on Monday by answering every question he was asked correctly.
Rahul's father, Minesh, entered him into the competition and called his success a "phenomenal achievement".
Although the show has been criticised for putting children under pressure, the host said he "didn't mind people going through a bit of trauma".
"I don't mind people going through difficulty," Osman told the Radio Times.
"I don't mind people crying. Because that happens in life."
