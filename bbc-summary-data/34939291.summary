The donation is from its American foundation. NTS needs to raise £175,000 for the project.
The monument in Burns' birthplace of Alloway was designed by the architect Thomas Hamilton and was built in 1823.
It was the world's first memorial dedicated to the poet.
Nat Edwards from NTS said he was "very grateful for this outstanding generosity from across the Atlantic Ocean" and said it demonstrated "Burns' continuing appeal after more than 250 years and continues a legacy of philanthropy in preserving his legacy".
