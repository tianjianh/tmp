The boy was assaulted in a communal garden behind flats in Cockenzie Street, in the Greenfield area, near Shettleston, at about 20:30 on Monday.
He is being treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
Police said the suspect was described as white, about 18 or 19 years old and spoke with a local accent.
The attack took place after the 14-year-old became separated from friends.
Officers have been carrying out door-to-door inquiries in the area and are gathering CCTV images.
Det Sgt Shirley Carr said the motive for the attack was unknown.
"This is a largely residential area and it's possible someone may have seen or heard something and didn't realise a young boy had been attacked," she said.
"I am appealing to local residents to get in touch with us and pass on any information they may have.
"You may think your information won't be relevant but a minor detail could be enough to help us trace the man responsible for this attack."
