A 32-year-old man has been arrested after a Glasgow shopkeeper was killed in what Police Scotland are treating as a "religiously prejudiced" attack.

Asad Shah, 40, was found seriously injured in Minard Road, Shawlands, at about 21:05 GMT on Thursday. He died in hospital.
The incident happened hours after he apparently posted social media messages wishing his customers a happy Easter.
Police said both Mr Shah and the arrested man were Muslims.
A post on Thursday from an account that appears to be Mr Shah's said: "Good Friday and very happy Easter, especially to my beloved Christian nation x!"
Mr Shah was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
Floral tributes have been placed at the scene and people have been taking part in a silent vigil there in memory of the shopkeeper.
Residents told BBC Scotland they were shocked and saddened by Mr Shah's death and described the shopkeeper as a "gentleman".
Brothers Qaiser and Omar Khan said they knew Mr Shah well and had repaired his cars in the past. They described him as "a humble, sweet person".
Omar Khan added: "I've known him since I was a wee boy so this is shocking news.
"He was a very straight-forward, humble person who was very good with his customers. He cared about his family a lot."
Robert Maitland, said: "He was very friendly. Every morning we shook hands and said 'have a nice day'. He was just a pleasant, lovely lad."
Isabella Graham, 64, said Mr Shah employed her daughter at the shop when she was younger.
"He was an amazing, wonderful man, he couldn't do enough for you," she said.
"He wouldn't hurt anybody. Nobody in Shawlands would have a bad word to say about him. I can't believe he's gone."
Earlier forensic officers placed a white tent outside his shop, Shah's Newsagent and Convenience Store. Another white tent was placed some metres down the road.
One card left at the cordon read: "Thank you for being the nicest guy on the planet."
Another read: "A good man, much loved and a pillar of the community. You'll be sorely missed."
