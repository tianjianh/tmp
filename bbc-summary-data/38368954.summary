The young girls from Orkney won the Loganair contest for each of the Britten Norman Islander aircraft used on the inter-isles service.
One leg is the 1.7 mile jump between Westray and Papa Westray.
Danni Muir, 11, and Erynn Stevenson, 14, were the winners.
Erynn, from Stronsay Junior High, was selected for her pastel artwork of a sunset.
Danni, from Dounby Community School, took first prize for the primary school age category, creating an illustration of an Orcadian skyline which includes two puffins.
Both won a pair of return tickets to any destination in Loganair's Scottish network.
Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair's managing director, said: "Firstly let me extend my congratulations to our two winning artists - it's a marvellous achievement to stave off competition from more than 500 other entries.
"Your designs will be seen in the skies above Orkney, which really is a prize money can't buy.
"The quality of the artworks we received was extremely impressive and it was pretty difficult to narrow down a short-list, never mind select an overall winner."
The shortest leg should take two minutes, but can be done in 47 seconds if the wind helps.
The inter-island air service in Orkney recently welcomed its one millionth passenger.
