The 18-year-old is a product of the Women's Super League One club's John Madejski Academy college programme.
Estcourt, who has won 15 international caps, had a three-month spell on loan at Bristol City Women last season.
"I'm very proud. Reading are a very ambitious club and so am I, so I hope to help them achieve their targets," Estcourt told Reading's club website.
