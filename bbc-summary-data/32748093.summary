Inspectors have found serious failings at a care home that was told to make improvements last year.

The Hallcroft care home in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, was visited without notice by Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors in February.
They found poor relationships between staff and managers, incomplete records and residents left "socially isolated".
Owner Four Seasons Health Care said it had since "substantially improved the quality of care".
Issues at the home in Croft Avenue were first raised in 2014.
This year CQC inspectors found little progress had been made and rated the home "inadequate" in many areas.
Their report highlighted other issues including a lack of support for staff and agency staff inadequately trained, residents not being given showers and baths when they wanted and nursing call bells going unanswered for long periods of time.
A spokeswoman from Four Seasons Health Care said the wellbeing of residents was a "priority" and since the inspection the firm had put together an improvement plan.
"We are committed to providing person-centred care that meets the individual needs and preferences of all our residents," she said.
"We are confident that we have substantially improved the quality of care being provided."
The company said staff had been given additional training and regular meetings were taking place between residents and their relatives to update them on progress.
