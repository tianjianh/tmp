The 21-year-old collided with the barriers in the women's Tour of Italy.
She was flown to hospital in Benevento on 7 July and was initially critical but stable with serious head and shoulder injuries.
Her mother Laura Bianchi told BBC Sport: "Yesterday she began to try to speak. We are very, very glad."
After the crash her team, Valcar-PBM, said she had required surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain.
"Claudia came out from the induced coma last week. She quickly began to open her eyes and move her body. The doctors seem optimistic," said her mother.
"Her rehab will take a long time, but she is strong."
The cyclist has been listening to audio messages and looking at photos on her phone.
She is expected to be transferred to a rehabilitation centre closer to home to continue her recovery.
