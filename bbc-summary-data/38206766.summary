European Challenge Cup: Cardiff Blues 28-3 Bath

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues maintained their 100% record in the European Challenge Cup as they inflicted a first defeat on Bath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tries early in the second half by full-back Matthew Morgan and wing Alex Cuthbert put the Blues in control after a tight opening 40 minutes.
A much-changed Bath side put up a fight in the first half but had only Tom Homer's penalty to show for it against three by Steven Shingler.
Scott Andrews' late opportunist try emphasised Blues' superiority.
The win saw Blues open a five point lead at the top of Pool Four and they face Bath again on Thursday, 15 December at the Recreation Ground.
The Welsh region dominated the early stages with Shingler nailing two early kicks before Homer hit-back for Bath.
The under-strength English visitors had their chances, with England wing Semesa Rokoduguni going close.
Former Scarlets fly-half Shingler kicked a third penalty but another long-range effort fell short and Bath survived a Blues breakout led by Rey Lee-Lo and Alex Cuthbert which saw Josh Navidi hauled down just short of the try line on the stroke of half-time.
Blues head coach Danny Wilson said: "We've come of age a little bit in terms of maturity and game plan today.
"We've played a kicking game and fed off their loose kicks with Matthew Morgan, so it's a pleasing pleasing result in very difficult conditions at a time when we needed a win.
"We've taken a lot of criticism that we haven't defended well but that was a good shift today to hold that team to three points."
