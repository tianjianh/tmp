[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wrexham had the best of the first half, but could not break down a stubborn Spitfires defence.
Eastleigh goalkeeper Ross Flitney saved at John Rooney's feet and substitute Callum Powell saw his curling shot go just wide.
The game petered out after the break, with an injury to defender Curtis Tilt a concern for Wrexham boss Gary Mills.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills: "I thought we were excellent today, different class. Excellent at the back, excellent in midfield, excellent. I loved watching my lads today.
"It is a good point against a good side, but we were the better team. The players want to play for each other."
