[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire took three early Derbyshire wickets, but opener Luis Reece fought back with an unbeaten half-century on a rain-hit opening day.

When play finally got under way at 16:00 BST because of a wet outfield at Derby, visiting captain Joe Leach bowled Ben Slater in the first over.
Jack Shantry removed Shiv Thakor (23) and teenage paceman Josh Tongue tempted Wayne Madsen to edge behind for 11.
But 26-year-old Reece finished on 53 as Derbyshire closed on 111-3.
Meanwhile Derbyshire director of cricket Kim Barnett has revealed they will be without South African fast bowler Hardus Viljoen until the end of June with a hip injury.
"We had a meeting yesterday when it was decided he wasn't fully fit and I think he knew that. We just want him to do himself justice," Barnett said.
"It's no use him going out at 70% fit and not bowling to his standards so we must get him fully fit and healthy to do what he can do when he comes back."
Viljoen, 28, was expected to make his Derbyshire Championship debut, after featuring in five of their One-Day Cup group games.
Worcestershire batting coach Kevin Sharp:
"It was probably just about even. Our lads have been a bit unfortunate because they bowled quite well and perhaps on another day they would have got the nicks.
"It's a used pitch so there could have been an argument to say you want to bat first but there's been so much dampness over the last two days and since our One-Day Cup game here on Tuesday night the pitch has been pretty much covered up.
"We are all excited about Josh Tongue. He's a young man with a very good attitude, he's got a very good repetitive action, he hits the seam and he hits the splice which are all very good attributes to have."
