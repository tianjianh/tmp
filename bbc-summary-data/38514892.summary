Reading 0-1 Queens Park Rangers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Mackie scored the winner against his old club Reading to give QPR their third consecutive Championship victory.

In an otherwise drab first half, Mackie was left unmarked at the back post to lash home from Ryan Manning's touch.
The Royals piled forward after the break but struggled to create openings, with Idrissa Sylla having two goalbound shots blocked for the visitors.
Jaap Stam's side almost equalised when Yann Kermorgant headed Garath McCleary's cross against the bar.
The R's are now up to 15th place, eight points clear of the relegation zone, but third-placed Reading missed the chance to close the gap on leading pair Brighton and Newcastle.
Mackie's goal is his first since suffering ankle ligament damage in training, which kept him out for eight months.
Only Newcastle have secured more points at home this season than Reading, but Garath McCleary's half-volley over the bar was the closest they came before a late surge.
It could have been worse for the Royals as goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi rushed off his line and looked to make contact on the edge of his area with QPR midfielder Pawel Wszolek, who stayed on his feet.
The result means Ian Holloway's side have completed back-to-back wins on the road for the first time since August 2015.
Reading meanwhile are yet to win a league match on a Thursday since December 1991, drawing three and losing six since.
Reading manager Jaap Stam told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"It's disappointing, but we need to be realistic as just because we're playing QPR at home, it's not going to be an easy win.
"You want to win games at home, but you're playing against a side that defended really well and came out strong on the counter-attack.
"We lost the ball too much in the first half and they capitalised and scored. After that, they sat deeper.
"We need to be patient and make the right choices on the ball in those situations. We did that better in the second half, but it's hard not to give away more chances when you're chasing the game like that."
QPR boss Ian Holloway told BBC Radio London:
"We talked about what we were going to do - I looked at their play and I felt we needed to stop that, but it was a delight - it could have gone either way if we'd let one in early.
"I know [Kazenga] LuaLua will add to us - our fans are already singing his name, it's wonderful.
"Jamie Mackie epitomises everything that I'm believing and he's got where he's got because that's in his DNA - what a wonderful example."
