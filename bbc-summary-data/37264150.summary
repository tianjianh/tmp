[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Championship: Dunfermline Athletic 1-3 Dundee United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cammy Bell made three first-half penalty saves to help Dundee United beat Dunfermline Athletic despite being reduced to 10 men at East End Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The goalkeeper had already stopped a Gavin Reilly spot-kick before Simon Murray's close-range opener for United.
Bell kept out penalties from Nicky Clark and Paul McMullan and Tony Andreu's drive extended the lead.
Michael Paton fired a reply before Paul Dixon's second yellow card, after which Andreu secured the 10 men's victory.
United's Frank van der Struijk was twice the culprit for the penalties, fouling Nicky Clark and then handling the ball in the box, for the second and third spot-kicks, the latter offence incurring a booking.
The win keeps United in fourth place in the Scottish Championship and leaves the Pars with only one win in their five games since promotion.
