[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crane operator Victor Rees home after Haiti arrest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A crane operator from Pembrokeshire who was arrested in Haiti has returned to Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victor Rees from Hundleton was working in the Caribbean when he was arrested on 21 May, and his partner Jade Laville told BBC Wales he was "petrified".
The reason for the arrest was not clear - police had ordered all machinery at the site to be turned off, but Mr Rees stopped to make his crane safe first.
Ms Laville said it was "a relief" to have him home.
The Foreign Office said at the time embassy staff in Haiti were providing support.
