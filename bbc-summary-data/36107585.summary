The Lions forward, 25, will play in the Challenge Cup semi-final in Montpellier despite injuring his eye in the derby defeat at Cardiff Blues.
Faletau's inclusion means the Dragons are unchanged from the team that beat Gloucester in the quarter-final.
The Dragons are hoping to win a first title since becoming a region in 2003.
Faletau came off against the Blues but the 57-cap back-rower has been passed fit for the Dragons' game in France.
Head coach Kingsley Jones is relishing the prospect of Faletau facing Montpellier's former South Africa number eight Pierre Spies.
"I know which number eight I prefer to have playing for us and that's Taulupe Faletau," said Jones.
Montpellier are second behind Clermont Auvergne in the French Top 14 table while only Italian clubs Zebre and Treviso are below Dragons in the Pro12.
Dragons have lost their last eight Pro12 games but shocked defending Challenge Cup champions Gloucester in the quarter-finals.
It is the first game for the Welsh region since their director of rugby Lyn Jones departed, and Kingsley Jones will take charge of the team following a disrupted build-up.
Former Wales Under-20 international Jack Dixon returns to the replacements' bench as the 21-year-old centre has recovered from a kidney injury.
