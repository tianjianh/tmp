Premier League club West Ham were close to signing Barton after his release by Queens Park Rangers this summer.
But Clarets boss Sean Dyche confirmed on Thursday they had been in talks with the 32-year-old for eight weeks before announcing he had arrived at Turf Moor.
Barton said he had no hesitation in wanting to work with Dyche, adding: "He's the most impressive guy I've sat in front of for a long, long time."
The ex-Manchester City and Newcastle player had a spell on loan at Marseille during 2012-13 and earned an England cap in 2007.
"I'm delighted we have Joey on board," Dyche told the club website.
"He was very respectful when speaking about us at the end of last season and during the summer.
"He is player who is in demand and who others think highly of.
"I know there is other stuff to his life and character, but on the pitch I think everyone speaks well of him."
The club revealed that the deal was sealed after Dyche cooked lunch for Barton on Wednesday.
Barton added: "We spoke at length about football over lunch. I knew as soon as I left his house that I wanted to play for Burnley."
