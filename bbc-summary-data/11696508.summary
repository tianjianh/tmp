The men were condemned as "sexual predators" by the judge after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex.
Some of the defendants wept in the dock at Sheffield Crown Court as the sentences were handed out.
Three other men, were found not guilty of sex offences against girls aged between 12 and 16.
Zafran Ramzan, 21, was jailed for nine years after being found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in her own home and two counts of sexual activity with a child.
The other four men were convicted of sexual activity with a child.
Razwan Razaq, 30, was jailed for a total of 11 years. Umar Razaq, 24, for four and a half years.  Both Adil Hussain, 20, and Mohsin Khan, 21, were sentenced to four years in prison.
The five, who are all from Rotherham, have been placed on the sex offenders register.
Judge Peter Kelson QC said "I've listened to the backdrop of some of you sobbing - I have to say your weeping cuts no ice with me at all.
"The message must go out loud and clear that our society will not tolerate sexual predators preying on children."
The jury heard how the men developed relationships with three teenage girls - having sex with them in cars and parks in the Rotherham area.
The girls believed they were in relationships with the men.
The authorities were alerted after changes were noted in the behaviour of the teenage victims.
