Roy Galvin, 69, from Alverstoke, who was being treated for a head injury following the incident in Gosport on Sunday, died in hospital on Wednesday .
A 28-year-old man from Gosport initially charged with causing grievous bodily harm is now facing a charge of manslaughter.
He remains in custody and is due before Portsmouth Crown Court on 31 October.
A Hampshire police spokesman said: "We can now confirm that, sadly, the 69-year-old man who hit his head on the road following a dispute on the one-way system on Bury Road in Gosport at around 5.50pm on Sunday has died.
"Roy Galvin, from the Alverstoke area of Gosport, was being treated at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham for a serious head injury, but sadly passed away at 8.15am this morning."
Mr Galvin was with his wife Deborah, who was in a wheelchair, when he was allegedly pushed to the ground.
In a statement, Mrs Galvin said: "Roy was my total companion and we had a lot of fun sharing our lives together.
"He was incredibly intelligent and very, very funny. He just loved life and was my best friend in the world.
"Roy retired from the Royal Navy in 1987 and had so many friends in the local area. Everybody knew him when he walked the poodles.
"He was my entire world and was very loyal."
Mrs Galvin said her husband had also been a wonderful brother and uncle and "thought the world of his nephew, Grant".
"We will all miss him very much," she added.
