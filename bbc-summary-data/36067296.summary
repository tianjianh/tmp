Onlookers said the men were prisoners but this has yet to be confirmed.
Fire engines are at the scene but Mid and West Wales Fire Service would not give any details of an incident. South Wales Police said it is not involved.
Bob Griffiths, from Bridgend, who saw the men on the roof, said: "They are shouting at each other and the other prisoners are shouting from the cells."
He said there were initially three men on the roof but one had come down.
