Brighton's i360 tower has been forced to close for the third time in eight months due to a temporary fault.

The ride, which has been plagued with problems since it opened last August, was closed on Sunday and is not due to reopen until Wednesday.
It comes less than a month after it closed for four days when a damaged data cable caused passengers to be stuck for more than an hour.
In September, the observation pod broke down three times within five days.
A private party of 180 people, including a heavily pregnant woman, was stuck for two hours with no proper toilet facilities.

In a later breakdown, 200 passengers were stuck at ground level for more than an hour when one of the sensors around the pod docking stations became loose.
Two hours later, there was a second technical fault leaving another group of visitors stuck in the pod.
The 531ft (161m) tower - branded the world's thinnest tall building - offers views of up to 26 miles of the Sussex coastline, with visitors ascending  450ft (137m) in a 360-degree curved-glass pod.
Bosses originally said the attraction would be reopening on Tuesday, but it has now been pushed back to Wednesday.
