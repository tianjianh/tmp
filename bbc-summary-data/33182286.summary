The New Zealand international will play five matches as a replacement for Kiwi Corey Anderson, who was injured in the recent Test series against England.
The 34-year-old has scored 263 runs in 15 T20 internationals at an average of 32.87 while he averages 29.45 in ODIs with a highest score of 170 not out.
"Luke is a quality player with plenty of international experience," said director of cricket Matt Maynard.
Ronchi will join Somerset ahead of the T20 Blast match at Middlesex on 26 June.
He will also be available for selection for the home fixtures against Glamorgan (28 June) and Gloucestershire (3 July) and the away games at Kent (10 July) and Surrey (17 July).
