The famous Cold War nuclear warplane crossed Woodford Aerodrome near Stockport, where it was made in the 1960s, at about 15:20 BST.
It will be grounded later this month after backers withdrew support.
Huge crowds have gathered to catch a last glimpse of the plane on the first of a two-day tour of the UK .
The bomber, introduced as part of the UK's nuclear programme during the Cold War, saw action during the 1982 Falklands War.
A part of the RAF since 1952, the last remaining model left service in 1993 according to organisers Vulcan to the Sky.
The XH558 bomber will make a flypast tour over the southern half of the UK on October 11 as police warned against making efforts to see it take off and land at Robin Hood Airport near Doncaster.
It will then make one final flight towards the end of October, details of which are yet to be confirmed.
