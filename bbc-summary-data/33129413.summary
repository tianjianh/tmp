England v New Zealand: We will still attack - Eoin Morgan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Eoin Morgan says England will continue with their new positive approach to one-day cricket despite a three-wicket defeat by New Zealand.

The hosts were bowled out for 303 in 45.2 overs before the Kiwis chased the target to take a 2-1 series lead.
"We could have batted 50 overs, got 250 and I would have been very furious," Morgan told BBC Test Match Special.
"I was happy we scored 300 in the manner that we did and want to continue playing with that attacking mindset."
After a dismal World Cup, England's new-found aggressive style has seen them make their highest ever limited-overs score in the first ODI against the Black Caps and almost pull off a remarkable run-chase in the second.
However, a collapse of five wickets for 14 runs saw them fall short of an imposing target in the third match in Southampton, as New Zealand got home with an over to spare thanks to centuries from Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor.
"There's a bigger picture here, we've a lot of young guys," said 28-year-old Morgan, who made 71. "Because we're changing the mindset, it will take longer than one series to do so.
"We'll maintain that through this series and the rest of the summer. We're competing and we've won one game so far, which is a big bonus for us."
Williamson and Taylor compiled a third-wicket stand of 206, the largest partnership for New Zealand in an ODI against England, taking advantage of three dropped catches.
Dubliner Morgan said the missed opportunities in the field were more costly to his side than batting errors.
"The dropped catches were more critical," said Morgan. "Not batting the overs didn't really bother me.
"It would have taken something special with the ball to win this game and it was a matter of breaking one crucial partnership."
