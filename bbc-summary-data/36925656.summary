Hibernian manager Neil Lennon has confirmed that he is hoping to sign Israel goalkeeper Ofir Marciano and Celtic midfielder Liam Henderson.

The Scottish Championship club are in talks with 26-year-old Marciano, who was recently with Royal Mouscron in the Belgian Pro League.
Henderson spent last season on loan with Hibs from the Scottish champions.
"We have made an inquiry and we are no further than that really," Lennon said of the 20-year-old.
Henderson made 48 appearances for the Edinburgh side having had previous loan spells with Hearts and Rosenborg.
The Scotland Under-21 midfielder returned to Celtic and, although he featured in pre-season friendlies, he has not made any competitive appearances under new manager Brendan Rodgers in their Champions League qualifiers.
"He is a fine young player," Lennon told BBC Scotland. "Obviously Brendan will still be assessing his squad, so we'll wait and see if there's anything going to come of that.
Following the release of Conrad Logan, Mark Oxley and Sean Brennan, Hibs have signed Ross Laidlaw from Raith Rovers this summer, but Lennon is still looking for another goalkeeper.
Marciano, who has 10 international caps, started his career with hometown club Ashdod but left the Israeli Premier League outfit to join Mouscron last summer.
However, although he only made six appearances for the Belgian side, Lennon thinks it would be a coup for Hibs to sign the Israeli.
"Obviously there have been reports linking us with Marciano and hopefully we are well down the line with that one," he added.
"We are hoping we will get some confirmation maybe not over the weekend but maybe next week.
"I think he is a fine goalkeeper and he is a consistent international goalkeeper as well."
Lennon is hoping a deal can be concluded soon so that the 6ft 4in goalkeeper can be available for the opening game of the Championship next Saturday against Falkirk.
