President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan received a ceremonial welcome in the capital ahead of a state banquet on Tuesday evening.
At Buckingham Palace the president was sitting between the Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge, who was making her state banquet debut.
The Queen hailed the "milestone" visit and declared Anglo-Chinese ties were being taken to "ambitious" new heights.
Before the banquet, the Chinese leader met the Duke of Cambridge, and then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Prince William was scheduled to spend about 30 minutes with the Chinese leader in the 1844 Room of the palace.
Before heading to Buckingham Palace, Mr Xi had afternoon tea with the duke's father, the Prince of Wales, and the Duchess of Cornwall, at Clarence House. Prince Charles had already met President Xi several times during the course of the day.
President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan viewed an exhibition of items from the Royal Collection after having lunch with the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace.
One of Mr Xi's engagements on the four-day visit included addressing MPs and peers in Parliament's Royal Gallery during which he said he believed his visit would lift UK-China relations to a "new height".
Earlier in the day the Queen and Mr Xi visited Buckingham Palace, arriving in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, while China's First Lady Madame Peng and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, travelled to the palace in the horse-drawn Australian State Coach.
Thousands of supporters lined The Mall hoping to watch the cavalry parade and catch a glimpse of the president and Queen as they travelled to Buckingham Palace.
Across the capital colourful lanterns, flags and dragons brightened up the streets to mark the visit.
But not all were pleased about the visit with some protests breaking out on Parliament Square and The Mall over China's human rights record.
Members of the ceremonial guard underwent an inspection at Horse Guards Parade before the Chinese president arrived.
The state visitors and dignitaries came together during the official welcome ceremony at Horse Guards Parade.
Prime Minster David Cameron made the most of being able to talk to the Queen while they and many dignitaries waited for Mr Xi and his wife to arrive at the royal pavilion on Horse Guards Parade.
