Lloyd Garratt, 32, encouraged the teenager to send him naked selfies and also sent the girl images of his naked body.
He also kissed the girl in his car and begged her to run away with him to New York so the pair could have sex, prosecutors said.
Garratt, of Buckshaw Village, Chorley, was jailed for 14 months at Preston Crown Court.
He admitted causing a child to engage in sexual activity, causing or inciting a child to send indecent images and sexual activity with a child.
The former head of creative arts at Garstang Community Academy told police he fell in love with the girl during a time of stress at work.
Joanna Rodrikis, defending, told the court the sex talk was "pure fantasy" and no trip to New York was ever booked or paid for.
A victim impact statement from the girl's mother said her daughter had always been a happy, carefree, child but after the offences came to light she became withdrawn and had been prescribed medication for anxiety.
Lancashire Police said Garratt had "betrayed" his profession.
Senior crown prosecutor for the North West Claire Hilton said:  "He took advantage of a young and impressionable girl by trying to make her feel special.
"He showed utter disregard for any long term impact his actions could have on her."
