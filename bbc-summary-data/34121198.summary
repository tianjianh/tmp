Saido Berahino: Spurs target hints at West Brom displeasure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom striker Saido Berahino has suggested he will never play for the club again under chairman Jeremy Peace, after the Baggies turned down a fourth bid for him from Tottenham.

Spurs had two transfer deadline day bids turned down for the 22-year-old.
Peace criticised Spurs' "antics" in trying to get the player "cheaply".
Berahino tweeted that he was "sad" not to be able to say "exactly how the club has treated me" during transfer negotiations with Tottenham.
West Brom have told BBC Sport that the forward has not yet been fined for his comment on social media but will be spoken to in due course.
Spurs also had two other bids for the forward rejected in the summer, while Berahino had a transfer request rejected after the Baggies turned down the first offer.
Peace told the club's website: "We have a key player who has been very unsettled by antics which were designed to get him out of our club cheaply.
"Those tactics have continued despite my making our position clear in my first conversation with Daniel Levy on this subject in mid-August.
"I said selling Saido so late in the window was not on our agenda."
Berahino has been left out of West Brom's last two Premier League games and Capital One Cup tie with Port Vale, with manager Tony Pulis saying he was not in the right frame of mind to play.
Peace added: "Saido has been unsettled to the point where our head coach has not felt able to select him for our last three games.
"We are now left with the task of repairing the damage created by this unfortunate episode."
Alan Fisher, Tottenham On My Mind: "Spurs' failure to sign another striker or an experienced midfielder signals a deplorable lack of ambition that could stifle the development of a young squad full of potential and leaves us vulnerable to competitors.
"The right men in these two positions could make a significant difference but chairman Daniel Levy, the so-called shrewd negotiator, catastrophically misjudged a market flush with TV cash. Teams no longer have to cave in because they just don't need the money. Another window, yet another missed opportunity.
"Today's desperate Berahino or bust shambles obscures concerns that Spurs' overhaul of scouting and recruitment failed to find alternatives. The club site's pathetic attempt to solve the problem by reclassifying Heung-Min Son as a striker did not play well with frustrated and furious fans."
