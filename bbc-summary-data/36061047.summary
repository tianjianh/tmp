Partick Thistle 1-2 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee continued their dominance over Partick Thistle at Firhill with a third away win against the Jags this season.

The teams were separated only by goal difference before the match and that was reflected in the closeness of the contest.
The difference was the presence of a proven match-winner in the visiting ranks.
Kane Hemmings' 24th and 25th goals of the season rendered Kris Doolan's effort meaningless.
The win moves Paul Hartley's side three points clear in seventh place, with the Premiership now split in two for the final weeks of the campaign.

Hemmings' first goal came marginally against the run of play, with Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain having earlier had to move sharply off his line to block Ryan Edwards' goal-bound shot.
But after Gary Harkins skewed a shot wide, team-mate Hemmings showed typically predatory skills to put his side ahead.
He darted towards the near post as Paul McGinn burst down the right, but as the cross came in, Hemmings checked his run and tapped in unmarked from close range.
Thistle were always well in the game and Doolan was denied by the impressive Bain, who tipped the striker's shot round the post.
But the Thistle frontman did notch his 10th goal of the season 20 minutes before the end to give his side hope of victory.
Abdul Osman drifted a cross in from the Thistle left and Doolan headed past Bain to the delight of the home fans.
But they were to be disappointed before the end as the excellent Greg Stewart played a perfectly-weighted pass in behind the Thistle defence, allowing Hemmings to race through and slip a shot between the legs of keeper Ryan Scully.
David Amoo blasted over the bar from point-blank range in injury-time when he should have earned his side a draw, as Dundee again left Glasgow's west end with all three points.
