Passengers using Glasgow's Queen Street Station are being urged to allow extra time for their journeys as work gets under way on a major tunnel renovation.

A high-level tunnel used by Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Stirling services shuts on Sunday for five months.
Customers will have to be escorted to the trains from marquees outside the station building.
Most journeys will be approximately 25 minutes longer as trains are diverted to a lower tunnel or Glasgow Central.
The Â£60m upgrade will allow faster, longer trains to operate from the station.
Tracks which are more than 40 years old will be replaced and power lines installed to allow electric trains to operate on the Edinburgh-Glasgow route from December 2016.
The work involves the removal of 10,000 tonnes of existing concrete slabs and the installation of 4,000m of new rails.
It forms part of the Glasgow and Edinburgh Improvement Project which, in the longer term, will see a major revamp of the station buildings.
On Friday, Transport Minister Derek Mackay inspected preparations for the tunnel closure.
He said: "They are absolutely necessary works, of course there's the inevitable disruption we are trying to minimise, this is why we have put so many contingency plans in place.
"It's the tracks that are being upgraded and repaired, upgraded not for a few years but for a generation.
"The next phase is the Glasgow and Edinburgh Improvement Project, that's massive investment in rolling stock and the trains, and then after that full refurbishment and redesign of Queen Street Station."
ScotRail senior customer manager John McBrinn said: "All the information that people need is available on our website.
"We will have extra staff in the stations to answer questions and help get you to the train."
