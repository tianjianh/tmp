In the first ODI between the teams since Australia won the World Cup final in March last year, Martin Guptill hit five sixes in his 90 from 76 balls.
There were 13 sixes in total as the Black Caps posted 307-8 after being put in at Auckland's Eden Park.
Australia, who recently lost a Twenty20 series 3-0 to India, were 41-6 after nine overs and all out for 148.
It was a fifth successive limited-overs defeat for the Australians, who also lost the last of a five-match one-day international series with India.
They are without coach Darren Lehmann, who will miss the series as he recovers from deep vein thrombosis.
New Zealand scored only one run in the opening two overs before skipper Brendon McCullum, in his final appearance at Eden Park before retirement, hit 20 in four balls from Josh Hazlewood.
After McCullum fell for 44, Guptill moved to 50 from 47 balls with a six and a four in consecutive deliveries, but was denied an 11th ODI century when he was run out by a direct hit from Glenn Maxwell in the 25th over.
In Australia's reply, Black Caps paceman Matt Henry - overlooked for the World Twenty20 - took 3-20 in his first four overs, including the wicket of captain Steve Smith, who was bowled off the inside edge for 18.
Trent Boult, meanwhile, took 3-21 in his opening five overs, dismissing Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh in the same over.
He also removed key opener David Warner lbw for 12, a decision not reviewed by the Australians though replays showed the ball would have missed the stumps.
The second match of the series takes place in Wellington on Saturday.
