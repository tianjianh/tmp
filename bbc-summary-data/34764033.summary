Abandoned dog, Archie, 'only responds to French accent'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An abandoned dog has become so used to one shelter's volunteer he only responds to commands in a French accent, according to the home's staff.

Archie the Jack Russell terrier was found abandoned earlier this year and spends most weekends with London nursery teacher Marie-Hélène Léoni.
The Dogs Trust centre at Harefield says when he returns to the shelter he only obeys commands delivered in her accent.
Staff have been forced to mimic her voice when interacting with Archie.
Miss Léoni, 57, is originally from Savoie in the French Alps.
She has been taking four-year-old Archie out regularly for day trips and for walks near her home in Maida Vale, west London, for the past eight months.
She explained: "I'd sing him classic French children's songs, like 'À la Volette', 'Meunier tu dors' and 'Il était un petit navire'.
"I call him 'Poupounette' too, which translates as 'lovely doggie' and 'mon petit chou', meaning 'my little darling', and after that he started trusting me more and more."
Lizzie Smith, a canine carer at Dogs Trust, added: "She does have a lovely French accent, and it's astonishing to see the way Archie will only react when he hears it - which means during the week when he's back with us, the staff try to replicate Marie-Hélène's accent."
She admitted that their attempts showed "varying degrees of success".
Miss Leoni's work and other commitments mean she is unable to look after Archie full-time.
Staff at the Dogs Trust centre say Archie is now ready to find a loving new home and say it would be a "bonus" if his new owner can speak à la Française.
