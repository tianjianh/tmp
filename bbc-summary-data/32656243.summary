Smith, 28, made his 100th appearance for Town in the final game of the season against Stevenage last weekend.
The former York and Swindon player, who played 35 times for the Hatters in League Two this season, has the option to extend that to a fourth year.
"If there is one player that epitomises Luton Town it is Jonathan Smith," boss John Still told the club website.
