On Monday a crane was brought in to remove the plane, which crashed on to the A27 on Saturday during a stunt display.
The crane took away parts of the Hawker Hunter jet. Police have said the death toll is likely to rise after all the wreckage is removed.
The vintage jet fell after failing to complete a loop-the-loop manoeuvre.
The crash created a huge fireball. Ailish Southall, who was driving along the road with her children, said: "There were huge amounts of fire and we ran from the car to avoid the debris."
Eyewitness Gairo Gomez, who was in a building nearby, told the BBC: "I saw the plane going down. I heard a huge bang and the glass was shaking and the doors were banging, the whole building was shaking."
The A27 was shut in both directions as emergency services attended. Police have said the road will have to be repaired before it can be re-opened.
The Civil Aviation Authority has announced significant restrictions on vintage jets in air shows, including a ban on aerobatics over land. Some have criticised how close the show was to the road.
Floral tributes have been left near the scene of the crash, and families have named some of the victims.
On top of the 11 people thought to have died, a further 14 people were injured in the crash.
The vintage plane was being flown by pilot Andy Hill.
Mr Hill, pictured above before a flight at Silverstone race course in Northamptonshire in 2009, is in a critical condition in hospital.
Ground staff from Brighton and Hove Albion FC arrived with tributes to one of the victims, Matt Grimstone, who worked at the club.
West Sussex coroner Penny Schofield warned that work to identify the victims would be a "slow and painstaking operation".
