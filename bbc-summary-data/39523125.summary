[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford City 1-0 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford took another step towards the League One play-offs with a nervy win over Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicky Law scored the winner in the 59th minute of his first start since February following a lay-off with a knee injury.
The visitors failed to deal with a left-wing cross from Mark Marshall and Law poked the ball into the net when Charlie Wyke's glancing header landed into his path.
The result leaves Bradford six points ahead of seventh-placed Southend, but they had little to spare against hard-working Oxford.
Conor McAleny, on loan from Everton, posed the most danger, forcing diving saves from Bradford goalkeeper Colin Doyle as the visitors made a determined bid for an equaliser.
But Simon Eastwood also had to be at his best to keep out second-half efforts from Wyke and did well to block a close-range header from defender Nathaniel Knight-Percival in the 15th minute.
