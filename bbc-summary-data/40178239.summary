[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jack Tector scored a patient 75 as Leinster Lightning built a first innings lead of 55 runs over the Northern Knights in their Inter-Provincial Championship match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite the early departures of Ed Joyce and John Anderson, Tector, 20, helped the visitors reach 288 runs.
Tector, Andy Balbirnie and Eddie Richardson scored half-centuries for the Lightning ahead of the final day.
Gary Kidd was the pick of the Knights' bowlers with figures of 3-70.
After an unbeaten century from James McCollum on the opening day had given the Knights some hope of upsetting the defending champions, the home side looked to be in control after Joyce was bowled by Graeme McCarter shortly after the start of the morning's action.
The dismissal of Anderson for just three runs left the Lightning struggling on 47-2 before a third wicket stand between Tector and Balbirnie revived their chances.
Some powerful hitting from Richardson at the end of the innings pushed the visitors into a decisive lead before play was halted because of rain.
It means there is a potential 104 overs of play on the final day, with all results still possible.
Northern Knights 233 (85.4 overs): J McCollum 119 no, R McKinley 29, E Richardson 4-33, P Chase 3-41.
Leinster Lightning 288 (95.0 overs): J Tector 75, A Balbirnie 56; G Kidd 3-70, G McCarter 2-44.
