Glasgow head coach Gregor Townsend has predicted Friday's win over Leinster will be their best of the campaign.

Concussion forced off three backs in the first half, stretching Glasgow's squad as they won 12-6 in an important game in the Pro12 play-offs race.
The Warriors now sit sixth, level on points with fifth-placed Munster having played a game fewer.
"No matter what happens before the end of the season, that's probably our best win of this season," said Townsend.
"The character we showed in the second half to get ahead, but also to repel Leinster at the end, was a credit to the players and the club."
Wing Rory Hughes, full-back and captain Peter Murchie, and centre Sam Johnson all departed
Hughes was the first of the backline trio to depart for a head injury assessment at Scotstoun. Townsend was irked by the collision that felled the winger, and the lack of review, or punishment, for the hit.
"I felt disappointed with the challenge," he said. "The TMO can't see everything, but we've got the benefit of the replay.
"It was a shoulder charge to the head and it's disappointing that it's forced a player off injured."
Hughes and his colleagues will undergo graduated return to play protocols, and injuries to forwards Gordon Reid and Simone Favaro are not likely to result in long-term lay-offs.
Fly-half Rory Clegg had, in Townsend's words, "the sum total of one training session" prior to kick-off having returned in midweek from French side Oyonnax.
Clegg had not played since a European Champions Cup drubbing at Ulster for the Top 14's bottom side in late January.
"I got sent the plays on Wednesday night when I found out I was coming back," he said.
"I had Thursday to run through them, and we had an extended team run so I could get back to grips with it. The calls came flooding back once everyone started shouting at me."
Hooker Fraser Brown, meanwhile, a converted flanker, was shifted back to the open-side when Favaro was replaced nursing a hip knock.
The breakdown proved a crucial battleground as both sides slogged in search of penalties and field position.
"We had to be really savvy in resourcing the breakdown, and there were still quite a few opportunities we got wrong and gave them easy steals," said Brown.
"Our philosophy is to go hard at the breakdown - almost suffocate them with pressure.
"You've got be smart and pick your opportunities. There are times in the 22 where the first couple of phases, they have so many guys in the breakdown clearing that you're not going to be able to get in there.
"But maybe after four or five phases they get a little bit more tired; it's literally half a second you've got to get in there and that's what you've got to target."
