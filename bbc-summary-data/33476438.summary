[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A proposal to allow live music on the roof of Portsmouth's new Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR) headquarters has been criticised by residents.

The eight-storey development forms part of an Â£80m British bid to win the America's Cup for the first in the sailing trophy's 164-year history.
But under new proposals music could now be allowed outside until 23:00.
Alan Richards, 61, who lives nearby, said: "With amplified music you'll get a 'boom-boom' beat all the time."
The Camber Dock development, with top floors arranged as roof terraces, was initially given planning permission as a place of work.
Mr Richards added: "There are some exceptional properties round here.
"Lots of them have balconies of their own and with this kind of proposal they're going to suffer greatly.
"Loud music should be contained inside the building where they can close off doors."
David Higham, from the Camber Action Group, said: "The music's going to be heard from a long way away.
"If the licensing committee wouldn't allow it for an organisation that earns its living from music and liquor licensing, they shouldn't for Ben Ainslie.
"BAR say they want to be good neighbours. Let's hope they will be."
BAR chief operating officer Andy Hindley said he sympathised with objectors and had pared back the plans.
He said: "We'll be mindful of our neighbours and make sure we won't be upsetting anybody.
"We want to share the space, we don't want to take it over.
"People think we're opening a rave here fairly soon, that's absolutely not going to happen."
Portsmouth City Council's licensing department is due to make a decision within 20 days.
