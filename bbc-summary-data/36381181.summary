[SN]TITLE[SN]
Holyrood First Minister's Questions sessions extended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Parliament's weekly First Minister's Questions session has been extended to 45 minutes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon called for a longer session, as well as more chances for committees to quiz her, following her election as first minister.
MSPs voted unanimously to approve longer sessions for the next two weeks.
The change will then be evaluated ahead of a decision on extending the question times on a longer term basis.
The first question session of the new parliamentary term will be held on Thursday, 2 June.
Ms Sturgeon said: "I'm pleased that parliament has agreed with my suggestion to extend the weekly First Minister's Questions sessions to up to 45 minutes.
"I would like backbenchers to have as much opportunity as possible to ask questions, while also protecting the time allocated to party leaders - and I look forward to these new measures now being put in place."
