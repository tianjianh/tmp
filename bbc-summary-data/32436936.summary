[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-CIA head David Petraeus sentenced over military leak

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Petraeus, a retired US four-star general and former CIA director, has been put on probation and fined for leaking material to his mistress.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Petraeus resigned from his post at the CIA in 2012, after it emerged he was having an affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.
He could have faced a year in prison, after his guilty plea two months ago.
He led the 2007 troop surge in the Iraq war and served as commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan.
Mr Petraeus reached a plea bargain with prosecutors after admitting to leaking sensitive material to Ms Broadwell while she was working on a book about him.
Prosecutors said that he gave her eight binders of classified material in 2011, which he had improperly kept from his time leading the war in Afghanistan.
In a federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, he was sentenced to two years of probation and ordered to pay a $100,000 (Â£66,400).
Prosecutors recommended the same length of probation, but a smaller fine of $40,000.
Judge David Kessler raised the fine to "reflect the seriousness of the offence".
Appearing in court before the sentencing, Mr Petraeus apologised for his actions.
And when he left court, he thanked those who had supported him and added: "I look forward to moving on to the next phase in my life."
