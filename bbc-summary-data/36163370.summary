Katy Pancott, 19, was struck between the Eynsham and Wolvercote roundabouts after midnight on 9 October.
The court heard that Ms Pancott, from Kidlington, had been due to go on holiday on the day of her death.
Darren Salter at Oxford Coroner's Court recorded a verdict that she died as a result of a road traffic collision.

Thames Valley Police officers said Ms Pancott was a passenger in a black C63 Mercedes, which was stationary at the time, and got out of her own accord.
She was then struck by a silver Ford Focus travelling along the A40, and suffered multiple injuries.
In a statement read out in court, the driver of the Focus said he was travelling home with his wife at the 50mph speed limit when he struck Ms Pancott, who appeared in front of his car.
Andi Rama, Ms Pancott's boyfriend, told police he had picked her up from Oxford where she had been drinking with friends.
But they argued on the way to Witney and she opened the car door, saying she was going to get out.
He said he pulled into a side road where she got out and ended up in the carriageway.
Mr Rama was breathalysed and provided a negative test, the court heard.
Speaking after the verdict, David Griffin, Ms Pancott's father, called her a "lovely daughter" who "doted on her brothers and sister".
He added: "It's been very difficult, I don't think it's going to get much easier... all I can ask is that people don't forget my daughter."
