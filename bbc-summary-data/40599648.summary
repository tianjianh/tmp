[SN]TITLE[SN]
League of Ireland: St Patrick's Athletic 2-1 Derry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City fell to a disappointing defeat as relegation-threatened St Patrick's Athletic came from behind to secure their first win in eight games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronan Curtis headed Derry City into the lead three minutes before half-time.
St Pat's pulled level through Kurtis Byrne's 66th-minute penalty which had been awarded for hand ball against right-back Harry Monaghan.
Midfielder Graham Kelly netted the winner 13 minutes from time with a fine finish from Conan Byrne's pull back.
Derry, seeking back-to-back wins for the first time since winning their first four at the start of the Premier Division campaign, will be unhappy with their second-half display.
Victory at Richmond Park would have put them up two places into third and they seemed to be on course for all three points when Curtis netted a looping header with home keeper Conor O'Malley off his line.
But St Pat's came storming back in a spirited manner which belied their one-from-bottom league standing.
Derry protested when referee Ron Rogers gave the spot-kick for hands, but Monaghan got a yellow card and Byrne netted.
St Pat's scented a rare victory and they clinched it when Kelly finished emphatically in the 77th minute.
