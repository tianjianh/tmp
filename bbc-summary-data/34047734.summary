Police withdrew a charge against Harun Causevic, 18, of conspiring to commit a terror act, due to lack of evidence.
He is expected to plead guilty to minor weapons charges, local media reported.
Causevic was one of five teenagers arrested over an alleged plot to carry out an attack during the annual Anzac Day march in Melbourne in April.
In July, a 15-year-old boy from Lancashire in the UK, admitted he was involved in the plot to kill police officers at the parade.
The Old Bailey heard the boy, who was 14 at the time, sent thousands of instant messages to 18-year-old Sevdet Besim in Australia over a 10-day period in March.
They both supported the Islamic State militant group, the court was told.
The UK boy sent a message to the older teenager suggesting he get his "first taste of beheading," prosecutor Paul Greaney QC said, to which Besim replied that this seemed "risky".
