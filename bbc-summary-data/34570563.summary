Canada election: PM Stephen Harper's final stand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper prepared to address a crowd of blue-clad, thunderstick-banging supporters gathered at a Conservative Party rally in a conference hall on the outskirts of Toronto Saturday night, a small band of protestors gathered in the near-freezing temperatures to offer him a different sort of welcome.

There was a giant papier mache version of the prime minister waving a "be afraid" sign, a group of placard-carrying Marxists and a small band of folk singers led by Tony Turner, who performed a song he penned for the election.
"Harperman, it's time for you to go," was the refrain.
Mr Harper, Turner says, "has undermined government in so many different ways".
And if the prime minister's Conservative party loses on Monday night?
"I'll crack open a bottle of champagne," Turner laughs.
But Mr Harper isn't going to go down without a fight. On Saturday night, he and fellow Conservatives offered some of the most pointed attacks on Liberal party leader Justin Trudeau and his plan to run a budget deficit and raise taxes on the wealthy to fund new spending.
Mr Trudeau and his fellow Liberals "will absolutely destroy this country," said Doug Ford, the former Toronto city councillor who hosted the Harper rally. He was joined by his his controversial brother, former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who infamously admitted to smoking crack cocaine in 2013.
Although Mr Harper had distanced himself from the Ford brothers in the past, their support in the final days of the campaign could be the key to winning closely contested parliamentary races in the suburbs of Toronto.
A black-track-suit-clad Rob Ford watched from the crowd as Mr Harper took the stage and wasted little time continuing the attack, explaining what he saw as the Liberal philosophy: "You make it, they'll take it, and they'll spend it".
He then brought out Sanjib Bhattacharya, who made headlines after mocking Mr Trudeau for having "nice hair" in a Conservative campaign commercial.
While Mr Harper detailed what he said were the high costs of Mr Trudeau's tax proposals, Bhattacharya handed over piles of money to the sound of a cash register clanging.
Mr Harper's sketch-comedy criticisms of Liberal economic policy go fist in glove with the closing theme of his campaign - that Mr Trudeau is "just not ready" to be prime minster, as Bhattacharya's television advert bluntly put it.
After the rally, Conservative supporters in attendance echoed that line of attack - although they did confess some unease.
"You hear the polls, and you hope they're all wrong," says Eli Kantor. "We can't have a Liberal government. Trudeau is just not ready."
Nelly Eiven says Mr Trudeau is a good drama teacher, referring to the Liberal leader's career before he followed in the political footsteps of his father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. "But to run the country? I don't think so."
"I hope we win, but I feel that there were some mistakes made in the campaign and some of these things that they're bringing up now should have been brought up a little earlier," she continues.
And how are these themes playing out among a broader Canadian public that is less involved in the political process?
Earlier on Saturday, a crowd gathered in Toronto for a different reason - to watch a play-off baseball game between the home town Blue Jays and the Kansas City Royals on a jumbo television screen set up in front of city hall.
Some attendees said they were more emotionally invested in who won the game than which political party triumphed in Monday's general election - but among those who cared, their allegiances were split.
"I think this election is more about change than who is ready," says Bryan Loubert of London, Ontario. "Maybe the real question should be; is Stephen Harper ready to continue for another four years?" Mr Loubert says he's voting for change.
Lisa Tiqui of Whitbey, Ontario says that while she thinks Mr Trudeau is ready to lead and she likes him personally, she's still leaning toward Mr Harper and the economic leadership he displayed during the 2008 global recession.
"I can't seem to get that out of my mind that Canada did so well during the bad times," she says.
Despite challenging poll numbers, could the Conservatives pull out an upset on Monday night? Eric Grenier, founder of the polling analysis website ThreeHundredEight.com, writes for CBC News that Mr Harper's closing gambit may still pay off.
Opinion surveys could be under-representing the prime minister's vote due to a "shy Tory" effect - where those polled are unwilling to express their true Conservative allegiances. John Major's surprising win in the 1992 UK general election is cited as a prime example of this phenomenon.
A well-funded Harper-backed get-out-the-vote campaign and Conservative-backing elderly voters who cast ballots in disproportionately high numbers could also prove decisive, he writes.
But if Mr Harper does accrue enough votes to win a plurality, he'll still likely have to confront a parliament where Liberal and left-leaning New Democratic Party MPs could unite to topple his government.
As Mr Harper left the stage on Saturday night, Collective Soul's song Better Now blared over the loudspeakers - an interesting choice that could be viewed as revealing a bit too much about the Conservative prime minister's closing strategy.
"Oh, I'm newly calibrated," the lyrics go. "All shiny and clean. I'm your recent adaptation. Time to redefine me."
But after nine years of Harper rule, it may be too late for redefinitions.
If there is a path to victory on Monday for the prime minister making his last stand, it will be a long and narrow one.
