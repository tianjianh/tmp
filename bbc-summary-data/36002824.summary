Charlton keeper Nick Pope made a fine double save to deny Tom Ince and Chris Martin as Derby edged the first half.
Igor Vetokele hit a post and Jorge Teixeira had a Charlton goal disallowed after the break, before Johnny Russell headed Derby in front.
Jordan Cousins fired wide for the hosts as they pushed for an equaliser, but Derby held on for a third straight win.
The result leaves Charlton second bottom of the table, 11 points adrift of safety with only four games remaining this season.
Derby remain fifth, nine points ahead of Cardiff City, who are just outside the play-off places in seventh.
Jose Riga's side matched the Rams for long periods, but their hard work was undone as they conceded a league-high 25th set-piece goal, Russell heading in after they failed to clear Ince's corner.
The goal came moments after Teixeira appeared to have given the Addicks the lead, only for his effort to be ruled out for a foul on Derby keeper Scott Carson.
Charlton's Simon Makienok missed a late header as Darren Wassall's Derby held on.

"We know we had to face a big squad and big team. Just look at their results, but we did not see any difference between a team fighting for promotion and one fighting against relegation.
"It shows we can do something with this team.
"I'm very proud with what they can give. I'm proud of my team, all the squad, that's what I was repeating."
Derby head coach Darren Wassall:

"Our home form has been magnificent and we needed to win that away from home.
"It's four wins out of five. The response to defeat against Cardiff has been magnificent. We're starting to build momentum.
"I'm elated as it was a really big day for us. We've not secured a play-off place but that's the first time we've secured three on the trot since we've been here.
"It is close. We cannot rest on our laurels, we've not secured it yet."
