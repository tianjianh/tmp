Duns butcher creates scotch egg with chocolate twist

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Borders butcher has created an "eggsperimental" delicacy to mark Easter.

On sale at Foston's Fine Meats in Duns are scotch eggs - with a chocolate twist.
For butcher Greg Foston has replaced the traditional hens' eggs with Cadbury's Creme Eggs.
He has wrapped the Easter treats with sweet chilli pork meat which, he claims, compliments the chocolate "perfectly".
It is the latest in a series of peculiar products created by Mr Foston.
He said a cracked black pepper and strawberry sausage produced to mark Wimbledon was a great success.
"We are always discussing new flavours and combinations and wanted to come up with some way of combining chocolate eggs into one of our products," he said.
"We did some experimenting with a plain pork sausage meat with the Creme Egg in the middle which we found was very tasty but needed something else.
"So we decided upon sweet chilli pork sausage meat around the egg and found it complimented the chocolate perfectly.
"The eggs are best eaten warmed up so the egg is melted in the middle."
He estimated that they contain about 300 calories.
Mr Foston added: "We are also concocting a pork sausage with whole Cadburys mini eggs actually inside the sausage."
