Conte announced last week he will step down from his position with the national team in the summer.
And the 46-year-old has been heavily linked with the managerial vacancy at Chelsea.
"At this moment, nothing interests me," he said. "I'm the coach of the national team and it's an experience which has taught me so much."
Conte was appointed Italy manager in August 2014 shortly after resigning as coach of Juventus.
"It's been a fantastic, extraordinary experience and I've always envied coaches who have taken part at a World Cup or a European Championship," he added.
Conte, whose contract ends after Euro 2016 in France, said he had been asked to clarify his position by Italian Football Federation president Carlo Tavecchio.
"I have thought about it and weighed up my decision and when I had no more doubts, I informed the president - the one who chose me and wanted me here," he added.
"I feel a great desire to work. I'm excited about the competition in June, I am raring to go.
"These are experiences that happen once in a lifetime and I feel a great responsibility."
