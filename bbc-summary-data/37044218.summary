Megan Duffy, 19, phoned police to report an assault and when they arrived to investigate she told them she "wanted her fags."
When the officers told her they could not help, Duffy lashed out at the officers and spat at them.
Her solicitor told a court that it was a "particularly horrible" incident.
Depute fiscal Bill Kermode told Perth Sheriff Court: "Police were contacted by her on the 101 number to say she had been grabbed by the hair.
"Due to her slurred speech it was hard to get details from her.
"The officers went to investigate and she stated she 'wanted her fags' from within the property where she had been living."
A woman at the flat said she did not want Duffy to return there because of her demeanour.
Mr Kermode said: "They explained to her that there was nothing belonging to her in the flat and that she wasn't allowed to stay there anymore.
"She was put in a police van and was up and down in her behaviour.
"It took three officers to hold her to calm her down."
The court heard Duffy assaulted two officers and spat on the charge bar before being placed in an observation cell.
When Duffy sobered up, she apologised to the officers and said: "I spat on her, that's disgusting."
Duffy admitted two charges of assault and a charge of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner on 16 July at addresses in Coupar Angus and Perth.
Solicitor Steve Lafferty, defending, said: "She recognises she has a problem with alcohol and it is up to her to get it sorted.
"She did apologise. It is particularly horrible to spit on an officer."
