Phil Bardsley: Stoke City defender hopes for new contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke City defender Phil Bardsley hopes to be offered a new deal when his current contract expires at the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old former Sunderland full-back has not been a regular this season, making just 15 starts so far.
He said there had been brief chats with the club about his future but "nothing concrete".
"The club is going in the right direction and I want to be part of that," Bardsley said.
"It is the club's hands. I want to stay. But if it is not meant to be, it is not meant to be and you move on. We'll see."
