[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Junel Miah, 28, of Magazine Road, Ashford, was convicted of causing the death by dangerous driving of Danyl Ponsford, 26, following a trial at Canterbury Crown Court.
Miah was driving at 75mph in a 30mph zone when his Volkswagen Golf collided with Mr Ponsford's Toyota Celica in Ashford on 30 September 2013.
He will be sentenced in January.
Det Sgt Scott Lynch said: "If [Miah] had been driving at the correct speed, and obeying the law, the collision would never have taken place.
"Miah's driving that night was a significant risk to other road users and his indifference to others has cost a young man his life.
"Danyl was a well-known and popular young man in his community who had everything to live for but his life was tragically cut short."
