France midfielder Pogba has not scored or set up a goal in four games since his summer return to Old Trafford from Italian champions Juventus.
However, Mourinho says he is "full of trust" in the 23-year-old and insists his performances will improve.
"The world-record player is always a question, but I want Paul to forget that," said the Portuguese.
"He played in the Euro 2016 final, went on holiday, then had no pre-season. It is normal after the first game he has a little decrease.
"I am full of trust because I know he is a good guy with a lot of ambition, so the form will come naturally."

Meanwhile, Pogba's team-mate Ander Herrera has described Mourinho as the "perfect" manager for the club.
United have lost their past two matches against Manchester City in the Premier League and Feyenoord in the Europa League, and defeat at Watford on Sunday would mark the team's worst run since December.
But Herrera said: "Players like Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic came partly because this is a massive club - but also because Mourinho is here.
"His way of thinking is what this club wants.
"If you are an honest player, he is going to be an honest manager with you."
