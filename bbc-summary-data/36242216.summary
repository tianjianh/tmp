Sir David joined the BBC after serving in the Royal Navy from 1947 to 1949 and launched Zoo Quest in 1954.
A string of successful natural history programmes followed including Life On Earth, The Living Planet, The Trials Of Life, The Blue Planet and Planet Earth.
Cameraman Gavin Thurston, who has worked with Sir David for many years, described him as "an amazing man".
BBC Springwatch presenter Michaela Strachan said Sir David was the "god of wildlife programmes and presenters".
"He's up there and we are all really proud of him and have all been inspired by him," she said.
"And he is unbelievably intelligent, not just on wildlife but on many other subjects as well.
"I don't know anybody that doesn't like David Attenborough. I know lots of people that don't like us but everyone loves him."
Fellow presenter Chris Packham said: "He told us stories, that's the great thing."
CBBC wildlife star Steve Backshall said Sir David "completely transformed my view of the wild world".
The BBC has a special page celebrating Sir David's extraordinary career in natural history, including:
There will be a special programme on BBC One at 19:00 BST on Sunday in which he shares highlights of his life and career with broadcaster Kirsty Young.
The Natural History Museum tweeted: "Very happy birthday wishes to #SirDavidAttenborough! Many thanks for inspiring us all w/ your work."
The Zoological Society of London tweeted: "We want to wish the world's greatest ambassador for animals a very happy 90th birthday."
Wishing Sir David a happy birthday, BBC Three has him providing commentary to "nature's most curious species" - the human being.
The hashtag #Attenborough90 has been trending on Twitter.
Kat Hartwell Goose tweeted: "A guiding light and inspiration, I feel truly honoured to have met him, happy birthday!!"
