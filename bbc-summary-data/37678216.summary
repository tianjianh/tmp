[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Rose, 67, of Gloucester, is recovering after donating his kidney to Ian Wright, 58, who has been battling kidney disease since his teens.
The pair have been friends for 25 years and when Mr Wright's condition deteriorated and he began dialysis. Mr Rose said: "I just had to help him."
Mr Wright said: "What he has done is incredible. He is an amazing man."
"He was a healthy bloke and he has selflessly put himself through major surgery to help me and my family," he added.
The families first became close when their children attended the same school.
Mr Rose said: "I probably should have checked with my wife Marlane, but he was my friend and he was in trouble and needed a kidney and I just offered him it.
"Everybody calls me names like 'hero' or 'incredible' but I don't feel like that."
Mr Wright said: "I will forever be grateful to David."
"Him and Marlane are wonderful people who would do anything for anyone," he added.
Mr Wright is now looking forward to the birth of his second grandchild and the annual Christmas Eve party at the Roses'.
