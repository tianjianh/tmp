The Jersey FA say they are talking to "a couple of candidates" about replacing Brian Little as manager.

Ex-Aston Villa boss Little stepped down from the role in June after helping Jersey to Muratti Vase final victory.
The team was led by ex-St Paul's manager Martin Cassidy in their recent friendly draw with Clyde, and is one of those in talks about the vacant role.
"It (the announcement) will be soon but we're not rushing into it," JFA vice-president Kerry Petulla told BBC Sport.
"As a board we're been considering what the role should be, and making sure we've got that right - that's why there's been a bit of a delay.
"We're working behind the scenes and speaking to a couple of candidates at the moment - it's fair to everybody that we do it in a reasonable time."
Meanwhile, the JFA say there is a "full intention" to take both a men's and women's football team to the 2017 Island Games in Gotland.
There had been doubts about whether the men's side would compete due to uncertainty over costs, but players will meet to finalise plans.
"The women's team always came out with a very positive statement to try to defend their gold medal, and that's respected," added Petulla.
"Our position is yes, we want to send a men's team - there's no question mark.
"We're still waiting for the details on the final cost. It could be anything up to Â£1,500 per player - that's a very rough figure, not a set figure."
