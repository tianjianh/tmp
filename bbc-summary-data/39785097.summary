Robocrop: Growing barley with robots and drones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A team at Harper Adams University are trying to grow and then harvest a field of barley using only robots and drones. If they succeed it will be a world first and we're following their progress.

Last time we watched as the team from Harper Adams started to prepare for this year long experiment.
They were using a small robot, not much bigger than a toy car, to refine the steering system they wanted to use.
But at that point they were still waiting on their tractor to be delivered and couldn't find a suitable combine harvester.
Since then things have moved on pretty quickly with triumphs and also some sleepless nights.
A tractor was sourced and fitted with the team's self-driving technology.
The Hands Free Hectare team - Kit Franklin, Jonathan Gill and Martin Abell - have managed to spray off the weeds on their field and then successfully plant the barley using a compact seed drill that was actually designed for use in vineyards.
The hectare itself is now surrounded by a safety fence and only the machines are allowed inside. Well, that's the theory.
In practise the safety system on the robot tractor has proved a bit over zealous.
It has shut the tractor engine down on a couple of occasions which meant the team had to go into the field to restart the machine.
To avoid even this limited access to the field in the future it's hoped to get a remote starter for the tractor.
Nevertheless all this is a huge achievement.
It is extraordinary to watch a tractor happily rolling a field of barley with no one at the wheel.
It's one of the points of this experiment to show you don't need to spend millions on bespoke cutting-edge tech to do all this but that you can instead grow and harvest a cereal crop using affordable, off-the-shelf parts and software.
Of course the team now have a growing crop to worry about.
