The man was pulled from the water at Wells-next-the-Sea at about 09:30 GMT but could not be saved.
Coastguards said the "tragic incident" was a reminder that quaysides have various trip hazards.
A spokesman said: "A member of the public called the coastguard to say that they had seen a man stumble and fall in to the sea from the quayside."
Mike Puplett, from Humber Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre, said: "This man was unresponsive when he was pulled from the water.
"This tragic incident serves as a timely reminder that quaysides, harbours and pontoons are working areas where ropes, fishing baskets and other equipment can get under your feet as you walk along."
Norfolk police said officers were investigating the circumstances around the death.
