The Room star will also produce and star in the movie, which will begin filming in October, Variety reports.
The film is about a woman called Kit who moves back in with her parents and then receives a mysterious invitation.
Larson previously co-wrote and co-directed short film The Arm, which won the jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012.
Unicorn Store is based on an original screenplay by Samantha McIntyre.
The project was originally to have been directed by Miguel Arteta, with Rebel Wilson set to star, but the timing didn't work out, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
Larson's other upcoming acting work includes Kong: Skull Island, the Captain Marvel movie, coming-of-age drama The Glass Castle and Ben Wheatley crime thriller Free Fire.
She was awarded the Academy Award for best actress earlier this year for her portrayal of a young mother held captive with her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) in Room.
When preparing for her role, Larson decided to isolate herself from the outside world.
"I stayed at home for a month," the US actress explained. "I was excited to see what would come up if I tuned out for a while."
