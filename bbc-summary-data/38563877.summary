The integration of immigrants in Britain should "not be a two-way street", the author of a government report told MPs.

Dame Louise Casey told the Commons Communities and Local Government Committee that the "host community" should not have to "give as much" as immigrants.
Questioned by Labour's Rushanara Ali, she compared integration to drivers entering a motorway via a slip road, saying: "People in the middle of the motorway need to accommodate and be gentle and kind to people coming in from the outside lane but we're all heading in the same direction."
Last month Dame Louise's report warned segregation and social exclusion were at "worrying levels" and fuelling inequality in some areas of Britain.
