[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oops I forgot - library book returned after 80 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A library book has been returned to Navan library in the Republic of Ireland ... 80 years late.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A mystery borrower slipped the book discreetly through the letterbox at the county library at the weekend.
It was checked out in 1932.
County librarian Ciaran Mangan said he was just delighted to see it back.
''It was an item that had been out on loan effectively since it was published and put into stock and the system in 1932," he explained.
"As good Christians, we decided we would waive the fine if the person appears in person and confesses to having returned the book."
There are no details on the original borrower because the library's computerised records only date back to 1994.
However, someone may have had their conscience pricked because the overdue book is a pictorial record of the 31st International Eucharistic Congress in Dublin in 1932.
The 50th International Eucharistic Congress takes place in Dublin next month.
The book has generated a lot of interest.
"We believe it was well cared for and was probably shelved with the family's collection, getting lost among their own books," said Mr Mangan.
"We have it on display as it is attracting a lot of attraction."
