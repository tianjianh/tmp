A video posted online showing a number of youths setting fire to a derelict factory is being investigated by police in Aberdeen.

The footage, which appeared on YouTube last week, shows several teenagers lighting a fire in the Broadford Works.
Police Scotland have appealed for information about the fire, the date of the incident and who was involved.
The former textile mill is a regular target for vandalism and for the setting of fires.
Gordon Riddel, from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said: "Anyone who deliberately sets a fire is committing a serious crime that endangers themselves, innocent members of the public and emergency responders.
"Dealing with deliberate fires can take a significant amount of time and resources and it could delay our attendance at a real emergency.
"Flames, heat and toxic smoke all spread incredibly quickly and people who set fires can't know how they will develop.
"What begins as a small fire in a derelict building or on waste ground can easily grow to engulf homes or businesses, putting at risk anyone who happens to be in its path."
