Jackie Downie parked his Lothian Bus before helping the man, who was using a walking stick, whom he feared might trip and fall on his untied laces.
A passenger on the bus took a picture of the driver crouching down at the man's shoes.
Lothian Buses praised their driver's "initiative".
Leah-ashley Brown posted the photograph on to the company's official Facebook page and it reshared the post, writing: "Well done Jackie."
Alongside the photograph, Leah wrote: "Kudos to the driver on bus service number three for getting off to tie this elderly gentleman's shoe lace."
Facebook user Jennie Brown said: "Good to see. Only takes two minutes but I bet this gentleman appreciated for rest of his day."
Ryan Mcglone wrote: "Now that's the type drivers I like to see on every bus."
Greta Tiffney said: "Good on you. Still some good people in this world."
And Stephanie Laptucha wrote: "Well done to driver. Such lovely thing to do."
Leah-ashley Brown said of the bus driver: "He is a lovely man and on the route a lot.
"Recently I was on crutches and Jackie would wait until I sat down until he moved off.
"Same with the elderly gentleman, he is always so nice and patient with passengers."
Lothian buses said Mr Downie had been working for the company for 41 years.
A spokeswoman for Lothian buses said: "We're very proud of Jackie for taking the initiative to help this gentleman, he is a true asset to our business and it's great to see that his act of kindness didn't go unnoticed."
