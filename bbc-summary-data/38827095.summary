[SN]TITLE[SN]
Collapsed Wrexham building site to be turned into flats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The site of a derelict building which collapsed into a road in Wrexham is to be redeveloped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The area at Pen Y Bryn will be turned into commercial space and flats and work is expected to take nine months.
A former chapel on Chester Road in Wrexham will also be redeveloped for residential use.
One driver had a near-miss when the building crashed moments after they drove past it in January 2015.
Councillor Neil Rogers said the work - costing more than Â£500,000 - showed the "confidence that developers and landlords have in the town".
