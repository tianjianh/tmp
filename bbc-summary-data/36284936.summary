But forwards Louis Longridge and Alex D'Acol, defenders Jesus Garcia Tena and Lucas, plus midfielder Danny Redmond, are to be offered new contracts.
And player-manager Martin Canning would like to re-sign on-loan Norwich City striker Carlton Morris next season.
"Carlton Morris will be going back to Norwich and we will be speaking to them in due course," said Canning.
"He has done great for us this season. He has developed from the young kid that came in to leave a young man and has developed on the pitch as well.
"And, as far as I am aware, Carlton has enjoyed it. It has been a good experience for him."
The 20-year-old Englishman, who has scored eight goals in 33 Hamilton appearances, will return to a Canaries outfit still managed by former Accies boss Alex Neil but who have been relegated to England's second tier.
"I am pretty sure his first focus will be to go back down and try to make an impact at Norwich and that would be my wishes for him - that is the whole purpose of being here," said Canning.
"But if that wasn't to be the case then we would be looking to bring him back up if the opportunity was there."
Frenchman Diaby, the 26-year-old who was previously with Levski Sofia, has made only one start and five substitute appearances for Accies since signing in February.
Curacao international Agustien, the former Swansea City, Crystal Palace and Brighton 29-year-old who was previously with Vendsyssel, has made one start and one substitute appearance after arriving in March.
Meanwhile, 23-year-old Mandiangu, a former Germany Under-18 international previously with Eindhoven, made one substitute appearance shortly after signing in January.
Garcia Tena and Lucas have been regular starters for Accies, while D'Acol and Redmond have found themselves mainly on the bench.
Longridge has spent the second half of the season on loan to Raith Rovers in the Scottish Championship.
