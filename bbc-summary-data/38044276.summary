Jessica Whelan's illness was brought to public attention when her father Andy published an image showing her in pain as she battled her terminal condition.
The four-year-old, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, was diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma in September 2015.
Her death on Sunday was announced by Mr Whelan on Facebook.
Posting on the "Jessica Whelan - A fight against Neuroblastoma" page, he said: "I feel both sadness and relief in informing you all that Jessica finally found peace at seven o'clock this morning."
In a second post, he said: "Fly high my beautiful princess. Ride free on horses in heaven and enjoy being with loved ones and free from your pain.
"I will never forget you and I am honoured to call you my daughter.
"I love you more than words can convey, much more than you will ever know."
Neuroblastoma is an aggressive cancer of the nervous system.
A 'Creating happiness for Jessica' fundraising page was created on 7 October to give Jessica "as much happiness and enjoyment as possible" in the remainder of her life.
The image of her grimacing in pain as she battled her terminal condition was published on Facebook two days later, resulting in an initial Â£20,000 target being smashed.
By the time the page was closed earlier this month due to Jessica's deteriorating condition, it had raised Â£97,307.
Her family said the donations will be passed to charities that will "further research into childhood cancer".
On posting the picture, Mr Whelan said it was the "hardest photograph I have ever made... in a moment that we as parents could offer her no comfort, her pushing us away whilst she rode out this searing pain in solitude".
He said he wanted to raise awareness of the "darkness that is childhood cancer" adding: "I do not mean to offend or upset, I do mean however to educate and shock those that see it in its context."
One Direction singer Harry Styles also offered to make a recording for Jessica after seeing the photo, Mr Whelan said on Facebook.
