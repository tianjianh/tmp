The incident happened near New Pitsligo overnight between Sunday and Monday.
Blaze, an 18-year-old female pony, had to be put down following the incident.
In a Facebook post, the horse's owner, Zoe Wright, said Blaze had been stabbed twice in the chest and "sexually violated". She has offered a Â£1,000 reward for anyone who provides information which leads to an arrest.
Ms Wright, 30, urged other horse owners in the area to check their animals for suspicious cuts, and to contact the police if they see anything or anyone suspicious.
She added: "My lovely Blaze was the nicest pony, she has been part of our family for 18 years, the complete low life scum who did this to her needs to face justice for what they have done."
Police Scotland confirmed it had received a report of a horse being injured and was investigating. Officers have appealed for any witnesses to contact them.
