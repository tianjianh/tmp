IPCC investigates after arrested man dies in Bedford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The death of a 48-year-old man who died after being pinned down by plain-clothed police officers is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, named locally as Carl Brunner, was arrested on Midland Road, Bedford, at about 12:35 BST on Wednesday.
The IPCC said he was taken to Bedford Hospital and pronounced dead at 13:17.
Bedfordshire Police said the man "became unwell" and that officers gave him first aid.
The IPCC said it had footage of the incident from CCTV and the body cams of two of the officers involved. Alleged footage of the incident has also been posted online.
IPCC commissioner Mary Cunneen said: "My thoughts are with this man's family and friends at this time and I can assure them, and the local community, that we will carry out a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding his death."
Bedfordshire Police said it "immediately" referred the incident to the IPCC, in line with procedure with the death of a person in recent contact with police.
In a statement, it said: "A man became unwell in Midland Road at approximately 12.35pm. First aid was given at the scene by police officers and the ambulance service also attended. However, the man was sadly pronounced dead."
Deputy Chief Constable Mark Collins said: "First and foremost I would like to say that our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the man at this tragic time.
"An IPCC independent investigation is now under way which we will be fully cooperating with, and as such it would be inappropriate to comment further."
A post-mortem examination has yet to take place and the man has not been formally identified.
