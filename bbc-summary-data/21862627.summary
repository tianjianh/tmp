The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has announced it will release documents related to the prosecution of internet activist Aaron Swartz, who killed himself in January.

He was accused of illegally downloading academic documents using MIT networks.
MIT president L Rafael Reif said in an email that university employees' names would be blacked out for their safety.
Lawyers for Mr Swartz's estate filed a motion in a US federal court last week, requesting the documents' release.
The documents will be released at the same time as the findings of an internal inquiry into the university's role in the case, led by computer science professor Hal Abelson.
Mr Reif wrote: "In the time since Aaron Swartz's suicide, we have seen a pattern of harassment and personal threats," .
"In this volatile atmosphere, I have the responsibility to protect the privacy and safety of those members of our community who have become involved in this matter in the course of doing their jobs for MIT, and to ensure a safe environment for all of us who call MIT home."
According to MIT, more than 70GB of data were downloaded from JStor, a subscription service for academic journals.
If convicted, Mr Swartz, 26, could have faced up to 35 years in prison and a fine of more than $1m (Â£630,000).
Mr Swartz's family says the actions of both MIT and the Massachusetts US Attorney's office contributed to his death.
"Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach," they said in an earlier statement.
