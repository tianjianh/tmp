[SN]TITLE[SN]
Exeter City 0-2 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from Jon Stead were enough for Notts County to claim victory at Exeter that moved them into the League Two play-off places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
County got off to a dream start with a goal inside two minutes.
Exeter's Luke Croll missed his tackle, Alex Rodman ran through on goal and unselfishly squared for Stead to roll the ball into an empty net.
The Grecians were struggling to do anything of note, with County containing them easily, and the away side doubled their lead on 34 minutes.
A free-kick into the box was not dealt with by the Exeter defence and Stead was on hand to poke home the loose ball from close range.
Jake Taylor turned and shot wide for Exeter, while Reuben Reid saw a deflected shot gathered by Adam Collin as Exeter toiled, but they were struggling to break down a well-drilled County backline.
Reid almost bagged a consolation for Exeter, but his free-kick was brilliantly saved by Collin.
The Magpies were happy to sit in and soak up pressure and the win was enough to see John Sheridan's men move into the top seven. For Exeter, they slip ever closer to the bottom two.
