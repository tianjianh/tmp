Durham fast bowler Mark Wood misses out because of a heel injury, with Steven Finn on standby.
Essex batsman Tom Westley will also make his debut at number three.
Uncapped Middlesex batsman Dawid Malan is in the 13-man squad, but England will not name their side until they have seen the pitch.
Rain on Wednesday meant the covers remained on, preventing England from assessing the surface.
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis said pace bowler Kagiso Rabada, who was suspended for the second Test, will return.
The four-Test series is level at 1-1 after South Africa beat England at Trent Bridge following their defeat at Lord's.
Roland-Jones, 29, has taken 22 wickets at an average of 35 in the County Championship Division One this year and averages 23 with the bat.
He made his one-day international debut against South Africa in May.
England captain Joe Root said: "Consistency is a massive reason why he's highly thought of.
"He has taken a lot of wickets and he's been banging the door down.
"It's great for him to get his opportunity. He bowls consistent areas at good pace and gets the ball to move around, which is exactly what we're looking for."
Westley, 28, has scored 478 runs at an average of 53.11, including two centuries, for County Championship leaders Essex this season.
"He's been very calm over the past couple of days and been very specific in his practice," said Root.
"He looks like a strong character that has a very good all-round game."
Wood has played 10 Tests for England, taking 26 wickets at an average of 40, but has only one wicket in two matches in the current series.
Root said: "We want Mark Wood bowling at 90mph at his absolute best.
"He's a strong character and works incredibly hard at his game. He's desperate to bounce back and make a contribution when he gets his chance."
Middlesex pace bowler Finn played the most recent of his 35 Tests against Bangladesh in October 2016.
England were heavily criticised following the 340-run defeat defeat in the second Test, with former captain Michael Vaughan saying the players did not "respect" Test cricket.
Root said: "It's his job to be opinionated and give his view on what he sees. No one agrees on everything all the time.
"They are entitled to their opinions. They are entitled to speak out and say things how they see it.
"It's important that we, as a side, remain true to each other. We know we weren't good enough last week but effort has never been the issue.
"The guys do really care. They are desperate to win and perform well in an England shirt. They don't want to let anyone down.
"It's a great opportunity this week for us to show what it means to play for England."
Rabada was banned for one Test after using "inappropriate language" towards Ben Stokes in the series opener.
Du Plessis said: "The time off makes you hungry and that we did well in the previous game will add to his motivation.
"He'll be raring to get that ball in his hand."
Du Plessis added: "It's a nice place for us to be in. All teams do not want to feel pressure when they don't play their best cricket."
