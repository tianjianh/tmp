Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said the message from the US central bank was "the US economy is firing, but inflation is not going to be an issue. It's in no hurry to raise rates - and that is good news for equities."
As well as raising rates on Wednesday, the Fed also indicated it planned two more rate rises this year. However, that was not as aggressive as some had feared, with some having predicted a further three increases in 2017.
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, said: "A less aggressive Fed was clearly the message the markets wanted to hear and indeed acted accordingly."
Yet Wall Street slid in afternoon trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 15 points, or 0.07%, at 20,934.85. The broader S&P 500 index also shed 0.12%.

Interest rates were kept on hold at 0.25% as expected, but minutes of the meeting showed that one policymaker had voted for a rate rise, the first time since July last year that the vote had not been unanimous.
The minutes also indicated some other committee members might be close to voting for a rate rise
However, Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said: "Despite the more hawkish tone of today's minutes, rates look set to remain on hold for some time to come.
"A rate rise towards the end of 2018 seems more likely to us - provided that growth remains relatively resilient, as we expect."
