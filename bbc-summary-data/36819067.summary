The body of 59-year-old Fiona Southwell was found at Grange Farm in Goxhill Lane, near Seaton, at about 19:00 BST on Friday.
A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is being held in police custody.
Her death is being treated as "suspicious", Humberside Police said.
Det Ch Insp Tony Cockeril appealed for witnesses to come forward.
He particularly wants to speak to anyone who may have used an old railway track which runs past the farm on Friday.
It runs between Hull and Hornsea.
He said: "The track passes the farm and is well used by cyclists and walkers and would urge people using the track to call us think if they can help.
"Your information no matter how small could hold the key to establishing the circumstances of Fiona Southwell's death."
