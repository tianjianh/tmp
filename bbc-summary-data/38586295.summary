The visitors from France struck first as Curtis Browning went over and Mike Harris converted.
Tries from Dan Baker and Kieron Fonotia put Ospreys ahead by the break and Hanno Dirksen crossed soon after.
James King, Dan Evans, Justin Tipuric and replacement Adam Beard followed and Dan Biggar added six conversions, but they lost wing Keelan Giles to injury.
Full-back Evans' try was among the highlights with slick handling sending him over.
Tipuric's ball control also stood out for his try on the pitch Ospreys share with Premier League side Swansea City.
Steve Tandy's side go to Newcastle for their final pool game on Saturday with only Gloucester, in Pool One, able to beat them to top seeding for the knock-out stages.
Ospreys will have home advantage in their quarter-final, which will take place some time between 30 March-2 April.
Ospreys coach Steve Tandy told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It was pleasing to get the bonus point win at home.
"In fairness, in the first half, I thought Lyon made it really difficult for us, but the the first ten minutes of the second half took the game away from them."
