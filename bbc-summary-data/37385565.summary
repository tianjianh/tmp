Mike Phelan says he has been offered the manager's job at Hull City.

The 53-year-old, caretaker boss since Steve Bruce's departure in July, was named Premier League manager of the month for August.
But, with a takeover of the club pending, Phelan's long-term future at the club has been uncertain.
"It's a case now of sifting through the offer and getting down to what hopefully will be further discussions," he told BBC Radio Humberside.
"I don't want to talk about the money, I don't want to talk about what the contract entails because, to be frank, it's nobody else's business.
"You do want parity with the Premier League, and going forward hopefully that's what will happen."
Despite starting the season with just 13 fit first-team players, Phelan guided the Tigers to an opening-day win over champions Leicester City, followed by a victory at Swansea.
Only an injury-time Marcus Rashford goal prevented Hull getting a point against Manchester United, before last week's draw at Burnley.
Phelan said there was "no great rush" to agree the deal, adding he was focusing on Saturday's Premier League game against Arsenal (15:00 BST).
"I would like to have got it done weeks ago," said Phelan.
"But it's only in this last 24 hours we've ended up in this state of affairs with pounds, shillings and pence."
Phelan was Manchester United's first-team coach until 2008, when he became assistant manager to Sir Alex Ferguson.
He left Old Trafford in 2013 and spent a year with Norwich City before joining Hull in 2015 as assistant manager.
A takeover of the club by a Chinese consortium recently fell through but Chinese-American businessman Chien Lee is reportedly interested.
Owner Assem Allam, who took charge in 2010, put Hull up for sale in 2014.
"There's still the takeover in the background and I find myself in the middle of that, trying to sort out my future," Phelan added.
"I don't know who is involved any more and how far discussions have gone. It is possibly a frustrating thing from my point of view."
