The 35-year-old has made 40 appearances for the club since joining from Nottingham in 2013.
"I'm very disappointed to have to call time on my playing career," Rouse said. "London Irish is a club that is very close to my heart."
Injury has meant Rouse has been unable to make a Premiership appearance for the Exiles this season.
"I'm now looking forward to the future challenges post rugby," he added.
