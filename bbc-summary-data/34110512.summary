Celtic striker Stefan Scepovic joins Getafe on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stefan Scepovic has left Celtic to join the Spanish La Liga club Getafe on a season-long loan deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old Serbia striker arrived at Celtic from Sporting Gijon on deadline day last August.
But he has failed to become a first-team regular, making only one substitute appearance this season.
And the arrival this summer of Nadir Ciftci from Dundee United was a further indication that the Â£2.3m signing's future may lie elsewhere.
Scepovic has made 26 appearances for Celtic and scored six times.
