Tim Swinson: Glasgow Warriors lock banned for four weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors lock Tim Swinson will miss Sunday's Champions Cup quarter-final against Saracens after his red card against Connacht was upheld.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warriors challenged the dismissal, which was handed out by referee Ian Davies for using a swinging arm in a tackle on Dave Heffernan on Saturday.
The Scotland lock will be suspended until 24 April.
Glasgow won the match 35-24 and they travel to face Saracens in Warriors' first Champions Cup last-eight tie.
A statement following the Pro12 disciplinary panel read: "The foul play merited a mid-range entry point which carries a suspension of six weeks.
"There were no off-field aggravating factors but after considering mitigating factors, the committee reduced the final suspension to four weeks.
"The ban was therefore reduced by two weeks leaving the player free to resume playing on Monday, April 24, 2017.
"He was reminded of his right to appeal."
