Temi Fagbenle, recently drafted by WNBA team the Minnesota Lynx, returns after missing the past four qualifiers because of US college commitments.
A defeat in Lucca almost certainly eliminates GB, who qualified for the previous three European finals but are ranked third in their qualifying group.
They are also awaiting decisions on future funding for GB basketball teams.
"As players, we're trying not to worry about the funding side," said leading scorer Johannah Leedham at the team's training camp in Manchester.
"We're here representing our country, trying to do family and everyone in the country proud and get the win.

"And if we do, hopefully the funding will jump on board."
Fagbenle and captain Stef Collins were both absent from the team that lost to Italy in Manchester a year ago, but are in the squad for both Saturday's game, and Wednesday's in Tirana, Albania.
"We learned a lot from that - it was a game we felt we should have won," said Collins. "I feel like we're in a good position right now."
Only the top team in each of the nine qualifying groups is certain to qualify for Eurobasket 2017, with the six best second-placed teams joining them.
GB lost in Montenegro and at home to Italy before securing victory over Albania and a thrilling comeback win over Montenegro.
"We've got to work off the momentum we got from the Montenegro game," said Leedham. "It was huge, so it's another opportunity for us to do something special and everyone's excited about it."
Great Britain's best path to qualification (assuming they and Montenegro beat Albania):
