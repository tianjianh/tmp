McDonald will join the Renegades during the English off-season, with their first game taking place on 22 December.
"I'm really looking forward for that period of time to come round, but first and foremost we've got a job to do here," he told BBC Radio Leicester.
"The focus is fully on Leicestershire and the end of the season."
