Rotherham striker Peter Odemwingie took to Twitter to apologise for his red card in the 2-1 defeat by Leeds - while the game was still going on.

The forward was sent off after appearing to elbow Liam Cooper in the 29th-minute of the Championship game.
"I was unlucky with the red card," the former West Brom striker, 35, tweeted midway through the second half.
"We all normally jump with our hands up to protect each other and expected his to be up as well."
He added: "I didn't mean to but caught the player and accept the referee had no choice. Hope the boys get something out of the game. Ups and downs."
Unfortunately for Odemwingie, who famously tried to engineer his own transfer from West Bromwich Albion to Queens Park Rangers on deadline day in the 2013 winter transfer window, his side, who are eight points adrift at the bottom of the Championship table, failed to get something out of the game.
"Great effort from the boys. Had the chances to equalise. Proud of them giving us hope for the season. Second half performance was top class," he tweeted after the full-time whistle.
Millers manager Kenny Jackett agreed with Odemwingie's interpretation of the incident.
"He's made contact first and my impression is that he hasn't set out, and isn't that type of player or lad at all, but he's put his arm up to protect himself and caught the centre-half," Jackett told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"We can't really complain with the referee's interpretation of the incident."
Rotherham, who are 11 points from safety, have only won once in the league all season.
