Dave Ward, South East managing director for Network Rail, told BBC London's transport correspondent Tom Edwards: "We thought we would be presenting a new station and a new method of operation after several months of misery and that hasn't happened and I am deeply regretful for that."
Thousands of commuters have had their rush hour journeys disrupted unable to get through entrance gates and onto already delayed trains.
