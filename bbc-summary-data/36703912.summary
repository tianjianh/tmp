Chester have signed Walsall goalkeeper Liam Roberts on a season-long loan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Walsall-born Roberts, 21, has made one appearance for the Saddlers, in a 3-0 League One home defeat by Millwall in February.
He is the fourth signing made by Chester boss Jon McCarthy, since he was appointed as Steve Burr's successor in May.
Chester have also brought in defenders Blaine Hudson and Ross Killock, as well as winger Elliott Durrell.
The National League club, who finished 17th last season, have also signed up left-back Johnny Hunt, midfielders Luke George, Jordan Chapell and strikers Kane Richards and James Alabi on new contracts.
But they have lost last season's top scorer Ross Hannah (Barrow), midfield linkman John Rooney (Wrexham) and defender Ben Heneghan to Motherwell.
