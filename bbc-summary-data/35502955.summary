[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South African Tokyo Sexwale's bid to become the next Fifa president has failed to win the support of the Confederation of Africa Football.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Caf announced after a meeting in Rwanda on Friday that it would back Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman in the 26 February elections.
Sheikh Salman should now gain the votes of Africa's 54 federations.
It appears to bring an end to Sexwale's hopes of becoming the first African to hold the office of Fifa president.

Sexwale had been aiming to get the support of his own continent but has recently been under pressure to withdraw.
BBC Sport has been told by a senior South African Football Association official that the 62-year-old should end his campaign.
