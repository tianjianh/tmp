Stena Line said two flagship vessels used on the Cairnryan-Belfast service were included in the upgrade.
Most of the work was carried out at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.
Paul Grant, the company's Irish Sea north route manager said: "Over the last five years alone Stena Line has invested more than £250m in its Irish Sea business."
He added: "The latest investment commitment of £6m is to help keep our Belfast fleet operating at optimum performance levels and ensures that our leisure and freight customers continue to benefit from award winning facilities and service."
In addition to the Cairnryan route, the ferries also sail from Liverpool and from Heysham to Belfast.
