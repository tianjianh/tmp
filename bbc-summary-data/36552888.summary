Gareth Bale put Chris Coleman's side ahead before Jamie Vardy equalised and Daniel Sturridge scored a 91st-minute winner to take Roy Hodgson's team top of Group B with four points.
Chief football writer Phil McNulty assesses England's performance, while BBC Wales Sport's Dafydd Pritchard rates the Wales team after their dramatic encounter in Lens.
Shocking attempt to keep out Gareth Bale's free-kick. Poor.
Excellent attacking option. He has made the right-back spot his own and played his part as the pressure grew.
Almost scored a first-half goal and was comfortable when defensive work needed to be done.
Had very few uncomfortable moments as Wales failed to gather any real attacking momentum.
Some shaky moments but again was an attacking force after the break as England pressed.
Very solid presence in midfield. Looks right at home in the defensive holding role. Can improve his passing, though.
Determined but with little real impact. However, still a class act in the making. Must keep out of trouble.
Creative, one of England's better players in that dreadful first half and warmly applauded by the fans when he was substituted.
England's best and most composed player again. Very consistent in the first two games of Euro 2016. Huge influence on the team.
Looks tired and off the pace after a long season. Place now surely at risk against Slovakia.
Missed an early chance and got worse after that with his confidence seemingly low. Hooked at half-time and rightly so.
Energetic and got the goal that brought England to life as they finally found some attacking impetus.
The match winner. Always willing to try things and has the talent to be a Euro 2016 star.
Fearless in his cameo and showed some lovely touches. A golden future.
Having missed the first game with a back spasm, the Crystal Palace keeper made some decent saves but could not stop Vardy and Sturridge's goals.
Tactically disciplined as England poured forward, his defensive duties made it almost impossible to help in attack.
Arguably the best player in Wales' five-man defence, making several important interceptions, tackles and blocks.
Early mistake almost gifted England a goal in the first minute, and it was his header which led to Vardy's equaliser.
Perhaps lucky to avoid conceding a penalty for handball but gave a solid defensive display overall.
Had his hands full with Kyle Walker and Adam Lallana on England's right. Defended sensibly and tried to give Wales an outlet on the left.
Screened the defence expertly and made good use of the precious little possession Wales had.
Starting only 40 days after breaking his leg, the Crystal Palace midfielder was typically industrious.
Worked tremendously hard, sacrificing his attacking instincts to play a pivotal role in a determined Welsh defensive effort.
Not at his elusive best, the Real Madrid forward nevertheless struck with another free-kick and kept England's defence on their toes.
Recalled after scoring from the bench against Slovakia, he made himself a nuisance as he harried England's defenders, albeit without offering an attacking threat.
Replaced Ledley and ensured his work ethic was not missed with a similarly committed display.
Like Edwards, ran relentlessly but did not have much of an opportunity to threaten in attack.
