[SN]TITLE[SN]
Early checks planned on Dumfries and Galloway College

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A condition survey has been brought forward at a multi-million pound college site after 17 schools were shut over safety fears in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway College was built by Miller Construction which was involved with a number of the schools.
Regular condition surveys are carried out at the Dumfries building with the most recent a little over a year ago.
However, the college confirmed that in light of recent events a further survey would take place earlier than planned.
Helen Pedley, director of organisational development and facilities, said: "As part of the college's normal maintenance programme regular condition surveys are conducted with the most recent in February 2015.
"In light of recent information the college will undertake a further survey earlier than planned."
