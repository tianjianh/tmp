Crystal Palace have signed Yohan Cabaye from French champions Paris St-Germain for a club-record transfer fee of £10m.

The 29-year-old midfielder joins on a three-year deal, with the fee possibly rising to around £13m with add-ons.
Cabaye joined PSG from Newcastle for £19m in January 2014 but started just 13 matches as Laurent Blanc's side won a domestic Treble last season.
Palace's previous transfer record was £7m, paid in 2014 to Wigan for 27-year-old Scottish midfielder James McArthur.
Palace manager Alan Pardew signed Cabaye from Lille in 2011 during his time as Newcastle boss, with the France international going on to score 18 goals in 93 appearances for the Magpies.
Cabaye said he was focused on his "new life" and believed that Palace could "compete to get into the top eight".
He said: "I also know the gaffer and have worked with him before and I'm confident with him. I want to do my best for him because he's made a big effort to get me to come here, as well as the chairman."
Last year the form of Thiago Motta, Javier Pastore, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi meant Cabaye, who has 38 international caps, was used largely as a substitute at PSG.
The French club won the Ligue 1 title, the French cup and the French league cup last season.
