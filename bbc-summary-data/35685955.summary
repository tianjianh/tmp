[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Voting has opened to name Reading's new bridge which cost £5.9m to build.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge, which crosses the River Thames, opened in September and allows cyclists and pedestrians from Caversham to access Reading Station and the town centre.
Residents can vote for one of four names until 21 March.
The 400ft (120m) bridge was met with a mixed response from cycle campaigners who wanted a dedicated lane for cyclists.
The bridge, which was funded by Reading Borough Council, is made of 455 tonnes of steel and has a mast which was imported from the Netherlands.
Councillor Tony Page said: "The new bridge is already established as a key landmark for Reading.
"The shortlist of names selected reflects public feedback received, both before and after the bridge opened. It includes both historical names, as well as names which reflect the bridge surroundings."
The winning name will be announced at a council meeting on 22 March.
