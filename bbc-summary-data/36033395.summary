East Lindsey District Council re-instates free all-day parking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Free all-day car parking has been re-instated at 10 sites in Lincolnshire, three years after it was scrapped to save money.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
East Lindsey council introduced charges at 13 sites in 2013 in a bid to offset government funding cuts.
The authority is now consulting on the introduction of an overnight parking charge across all its managed sites.
Deputy leader Graham Marsh said free parking was re-instated after feedback from businesses and the public.

He said: "I can see the logic for it [charging] - trying to get a consistent strategy across the district - but it didn't work and different areas have different needs."
Mr Marsh said it was hoped the changes would be a permanent measure.
The council announced in December it was considering a Â£2 overnight parking charge on all paid car parks in the district, but this is yet to be implemented.
Mr Marsh added: "We need to assess what impact it will have, and realistically will it raise sufficient money for what it costs?"
The authority is currently trying to make savings of Â£6m by 2019/20.
