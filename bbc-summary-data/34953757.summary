The Glasgow pub where 10 people died after a police helicopter crashed through its roof is to pay tribute two years on from the tragedy.

On 29 November 2013, seven people in the Clutha Bar and three in the helicopter died as a result of the crash.
The pub will shut its doors early as a mark of respect to those who lost their lives and will remain in darkness.
Then, on Monday, Scottish singer Sandi Thom will play in the pub.
The gig is being held to raise money for the Clutha Trust which was set up in the aftermath of the crash.
It aims to enable disadvantaged children and young people to become involved in the arts.
The Clutha will shut its doors on Sunday at 21:00 GMT and remain in darkness until the next day.
Owner Alan Crossan said: "We will be closing at 9pm on Sunday night. It's difficult situation, and we thought that would be best.
"But we will be open all day for people to pay their respects - some have already been down, including some of the families involved and some of the injured.
Mr Crossan also echoed criticisms of a report into the crash, which some said did not reach a clear enough conclusion.
"We still want to get proper answers to bring some closure to this - it's something we'll keep pushing for," he said.
