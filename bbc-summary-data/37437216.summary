UDA Resolve scheme 'heads for government recognition'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An east Belfast community restorative justice group with links to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) has taken the first step towards being fully recognised by the government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Resolve scheme is less than two years old.
It is thought to be the first of its kind to emerge that is linked to the loyalist paramilitary organisation.
Criminal Justice Inspection's Brendan McGuigan said the scheme was making a useful contribution.
"It is very significant in the sense that it is the first of the schemes to come forward with links from the UDA constituency," he said.
"Community-based restorative justice schemes have been operating now for approximately 16 to 17 years, but have only been formally accredited over the last nine years."
"Some of them are from republican backgrounds, others are from loyalist backgrounds, but mainly the UVF (Ulster Volunteer Force) constituency as opposed to the UDA."
