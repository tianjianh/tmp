[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has been threatened with a £2,500 fine for flying an "unapproved" Santa flag outside her suburban home without planning permission.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Janis Patterson, 64, from Chilwell, Nottinghamshire, put up an 18ft (5.5m) high pole in October and has flown poppy and Father Christmas designs.
Broxtowe Borough Council said her flags were not on an approved list, but admitted the rules sounded "barmy".
Ms Patterson said: "I can't imagine how my flags are causing any offence".
She told the Nottingham Post as an RAF veteran she had been around flags all her life.
She was bought the pole and flags as a present.

The council's letter came as a complete surprise to Ms Patterson.
"I was just so shocked. First of all I never considered myself to be a criminal in my life," she said.
"And then a £2,500 fine when I'm on a state pension - I wouldn't know how I'd get the money for that.
"But I can't see that these flags are advertising.
"All they are is a bright colourful display on a gloomy day."
Council leader Richard Jackson said there had been a complaint and officials were obliged to enforce the law.
"It does sound a bit barmy to regard a Santa flag as advertising but those are the rules.
"But we are really keen to work with Ms Paterson to see if there is a way to get planning permission," he said.
