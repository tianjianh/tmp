[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Hinckley Jr, the man who tried to assassinate US President Ronald Reagan, has been released from a psychiatric hospital after 35 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Reagan and three others were injured in the shooting outside a hotel in Washington in March 1981.
Mr Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity but was sent for treatment to a Washington hospital.
In July, a judge ruled that Mr Hinckley, now 61, was not a danger to himself or the public.
Mr Hinckley had already been spending 17 days a month at his mother's home in Virginia under strict conditions.
Associated Press reported that he had arrived at her home having been freed on Saturday.

The court order and opinion available on the website of the US District Court for the District of Columbia spell out the terms of Mr Hinckley's release, and detail his psychiatric history and treatment:
