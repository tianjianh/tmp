Gemma Arterton on her French cinema debut in Madame Bovary update

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The daydream of many affluent Londoners is to trade the treadmill of city life for an idyllic existence in rural France.

It's a scenario that's brought to life in Gemma Bovery, a re-imagining of Gustave Flaubert's 19th Century classic Madame Bovary.
Gemma Arterton, who was born in Kent and who, until this production, did not speak a word of French, takes the title role of naive young Londoner Gemma who, with her older husband Charles, moves to Normandy, just a few miles from where Flaubert's book is set.
Since the novel's publication in 1856, Emma Bovary has become one of literature's classic heroines - a woman who brings about her own ruin by having adulterous affairs and getting deeply into debt while attempting to cope with the boredom of provincial life.
Arterton believes that modern twists on classic literature "can be deeply satisfying and very relevant, because they can still be the original characters, but you can see their motivations more clearly in the modern context.
"You can see, for example, that Gemma Bovery isn't bad," she tells the BBC. "She's just not ready to settle down yet, and she's chosen the wrong man."
The 29-year-old, known for her roles in James Bond film Quantum of Solace and the West End musical Made in Dagenham, says she sees "plenty of real-life modern-day Madame Bovarys".
"But I'm not sure if we can blame the man, the Charles Bovary figure, if a woman is bored in her relationship and life."
Directed by Coco Before Chanel's Anne Fontaine, Gemma Bovery is an adaptation of a 2000 graphic novel of the same name by British author Posy Simmonds, that was first serialised in The Guardian.
Simmonds, 70, claims she was inspired to write it "by seeing a woman in a cafe overloaded with designer handbags and treating her boyfriend like a dog. He had no idea how to make her happy. I thought, 'Emma Bovary, right there.'"
Simmonds is also the author of Tamara Drewe, another graphic novel that became a film in 2010 in which Arterton also starred. "I was initially reluctant to consider doing [Gemma Bovery]," the actress admits.
"But I really wanted to experience learning French and working in French film. Anne Fontaine is the most French of French film directors - she's scarily chic."
Just over 170,000 British ex-pats currently live in France - a figure that has dropped since the beginning of the 21st Century, when areas of rural Aquitaine were nicknamed "Dordogneshire" because of the number of British people buying property there.
Fontaine describes the movie as "Woody Allen" in tone. "It investigates the British belief that France is a green haven and the French puzzlement and suspicion when they arrive in town," she says.
"It plays on the British dream of the French rural idyll," Arterton continues. "We loved every minute of filming it, but I'm not sure about the reality of countryside living - it could get boring.
"But I suppose I have signed up in part for the French dream myself, since I now live in Paris as well as London. This film literally did change my life."
Arterton insists her French skills were non-existent before filming began in the summer of 2013. Now, though, she speaks it fluently.
The actress moves between London and the Paris home she shares with her director boyfriend Franklin Ohanessian - a two-city existence, she says, that "works really well".
"What London lacks Paris has, and vice versa," she explains - though she refuses to be drawn on which is better, saying "you can't compare the two".
The French media appear to have taken Arterton to their hearts, with one magazine describing her as "la Brit girl qu'on adore" (the British girl we love).
Could she become the next Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, an actress able to move easily between French and English roles? Possibly: her current projects include Orpheline, a French comedy-drama co-starring Adele Exarchopoulos.
"I'm so grateful for the new doors that are opening to me," says Arterton. "I love French cinema. That sounds really pretentious, but it's not a job to them.
"Everyone in the crew seems to be really invested, and also they're really well-dressed. The cashmere quota is probably the major difference between working in France and England."
Gemma Bovery is out in the UK on 21 August.
