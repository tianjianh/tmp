Swansea City have pledged up to £3,000 to a fund for a terminally ill young Sunderland fan.

Bradley Lowery, five, from Blackhall, County Durham, has been taken under the wing of Black Cats players.
The Swans visit the Stadium of Light on Saturday and the club said £1 would be donated to Bradley's fund for every food and drink voucher its fans redeem.
Bradley is in hospital and is being considered for a cell therapy trial to treat his neuroblastoma.
Doctors hope to slow down the speed at which tumours are growing inside his body.
Bradley, who turns six in June, has led out the England team at Wembley as well as his home team.
He has developed a friendship with Jermain Defoe after the striker and other Sunderland players Vito Mannone, John O'Shea and Sebastian Larsson visited him in hospital.
Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer of unknown cause which affects babies and young children.
Bradley returned to hospital in April, with doctors fearing his cancer could be progressing.
Earlier last month, his family revealed his latest and final round of treatment had failed.
His mother, Gemma, said: "Bradley is not good. He has been in horrendous pain with his leg since yesterday to the point [where] he couldn't move in bed."
Swansea can avoid relegation if they win on Saturday and Hull City lose at Crystal Palace on Sunday.
The Swans players have paid for 3,000 match tickets for supporters to attend the game.
The club has also paid for food vouchers for fans to be exchanged at the match, of which every one used will see £1 donated.
