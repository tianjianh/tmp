The winner is chosen and voted for entirely by children.
Apple and Raid by Sarah Crossan won the books for older readers prize, while Viviane Schwarz's Is There A Dog In This Book? won for younger children.
Previous winners include Oliver Jeffers and Drew Daywalt, Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler; and Michael Morpurgo.
Butchart and Flintham's book initially won the category for books for younger readers before going on to win the overall prize. They also won the Blue Peter story awards in 2015, for their book The Spy Who Loved School Dinners.
The Children's Book Award is the only national award for children's books that is voted for entirely by children and has been won a record three times by Morpurgo.
It is now in its 35th year, and is run by the Federation of Children's Book Groups, set up as a charity by Anne Wood, the originator of The Teletubbies.
