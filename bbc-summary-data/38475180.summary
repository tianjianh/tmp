[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 3-2 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mike Ihiekwe scored twice as Tranmere edged out Sutton 3-2 at Prenton Park to move level on points with National League leaders Lincoln.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers, who stay second on goal difference, took the lead in the 29th minute when Adam Buxton whipped over a fine first-time cross and Ihiekwe jumped above his marker to head home.
The hosts went close again early in the second half when the influential Buxton struck the inside of a post with a fine free-kick, and they managed to double their lead when Craig Eastmond scored an unfortunate own goal.
Jack Jebb pulled one back for Sutton in the 77th minute and they were back on level terms when Pape Gueye got the final touch in the 81st minute.
However, Ihiekwe had the final say with a great strike to seal all three points for Rovers.
