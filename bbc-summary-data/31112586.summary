It is believed the man, named locally as Michael Hill, a coach at Latymer Upper School, fell into the river from a coaching boat near Putney Embankment, at about 19:20 GMT on Monday.
Police said the search was ongoing with high tide and low tide being utilised.
The missing man has not been named by officers searching for him.
In a letter to members of Thames Rowing Club, Phil McGee, head of rowing at Latymer School, said it was a "tragic incident".
Mr Hill has coached at Thames Rowing Club and at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, instructing the women's squad.
RNLI, Metropolitan Police and London Fire Brigade boats have all been involved in the search.
A spokesman for the Port of London Authority said a stretch some miles upstream and downstream was being searched, close to Putney Pier.
