Swansea-based Thomas won bronze and silver medals earlier in the week and was delighted to retain her 100m title.
"I've been working my way up through the week; a bronze, a silver and now the gold so pretty happy," said the 26-year-old.
"We had a really solid cycle of work. It's nice to see it coming together."
Welsh Olympic swimmer Chloe Tutton was fourth in the final of the 100m breaststroke.
