[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lib Dems plot political comeback at party conference

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's a Welsh Liberal Democrat riddle. The leader's predecessor is also his successor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceredigion MP Mark Williams became leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats after the resignation of Kirsty Williams (no relation) following the party's near wipe-out in May's Welsh Assembly elections. She is now officially his deputy, taking on a role he previously filled.
This makes Kirsty Williams her namesake's predecessor in the Welsh leader role and successor in the deputy position
Mr Williams acknowledges this unusual consequence of the Welsh Lib Dems' constitution, that "the party of home rule" is now led from Westminster.
But with only two elected politicians at UK or Welsh level there is no alternative, short of opening the leadership up to Westminster-based unelected peers.
The elections were expensive for the party. They lost deposits and staff, although Kirsty Williams is now education secretary in the Labour-run Welsh Government - and the most powerful Liberal Democrat in Britain.
She has been given star billing at the party's conference in Brighton - taking part in both a Q&A session with members and delivering a "keynote" speech.  Mark Williams hasn't even been given a speaking slot.
Ms Williams is expected to use her speech to both criticise the Conservatives' education policy in England - there'll be no grammar schools on her watch - and to highlight her own priorities in Wales.
These are expected to include a commitment to double the early years pupil deprivation grant, paid to schools for three and four-year-olds "to help tackle the effects of poverty on attainment" although, with Welsh Government budget negotiations continuing, do not expect a firm timetable.
The Welsh Lib Dems say they've had a post-Brexit bounce in membership numbers. They are targeting next year's council elections as part of their "fightback" plans and point to a July by-election in Newport as evidence that they are making progress.
Mr Williams believes co-operation with other parties could be the solution at Westminster. No fan of the last coalition, he fears the Conservatives could be in power for a long time unless "progressive centre-left" politicians work together more.
He told the Sunday Politics Wales: "There was a positive from the referendum, even for those of us that lost it, in that progressive politicians were working together on a really important issue and I think that dialogue should be extended on other issues too.
"I'm not talking about deals. What I am talking about is an emerging picture, and it's buttressed by the announcement on the boundary changes that could saddle this country with an in-built Conservative majority for a long time.
"I think there should be discussion and I think there should be dialogue between progressive forces.
"I use it as loosely as that at this juncture but I think there is common interest in political parties on the progressive centre-left of politics."
Expect more talk of co-operation with other parties on the conference fringe in Brighton as the Lib Dems plot their political comeback.
