Wilkinson, 24, who was playing for non-league Shaw Lane, died in hospital on Monday after collapsing during a match.
Shaw Lane officials are talking to the players family and team-mates about how best to pay tribute.
Brighouse Town, Shaw Lane's opponents on Monday, have postponed Saturday's game against Colne FC.
Harrogate AFC, where Wilkinson spent time on loan, observed a minute's silence before their game against Stalybridge Celtic on Tuesday.
Hull have asked supporters at the KCOM stadium this weekend to observe the silence before kick-off.
The club said: "He was a popular member of the Tigers' youth team squad that won the Youth Alliance North East Conference title in 2010.
"We ask supporters to join us in remembering Daniel on Saturday during a period of silence, which will start and end on referee Roger East's whistle."
The Evo-Stik Northern Premier League, in which Shaw Lane play, has asked fans, players and officials to observe a minute's silence at fixtures this week to mark Wilkinson's death.
After leaving Hull, Wilkinson went on to play for North Ferriby United, Scarborough Athletic, Harrogate Town, Goole Town and Rushall Olympic, before joining Shaw in the summer.
