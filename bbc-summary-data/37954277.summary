The singer's latest album, The Heavy Entertainment Show, has debuted at number one on this week's chart.
It is his 12th album to reach the summit - and pushes him ahead of David Bowie, who has 11 number one albums to his name.
Williams said: "I'm chuffed that this album is number one and I'm humbled by these amazing statistics and facts."
The singer now has as many number one albums as Madonna, but remains behind The Beatles, (who have 15), and Elvis Presley (13).
The Heavy Entertainment Show beat the new collaborative album by Michael Ball and Alfie Boe, Together, which debuted at number two.
Bon Jovi's This House Is Not For Sale was the only other new entry in the top 10, landing at number five.
Last week's number one album by James Arthur, Back from the Edge, dropped to number six this week.
Alicia Keys's latest album, Here, debuted at number 21, her seventh top 40 album.
On the singles chart, Clean Bandit's Rockabye - which features guest vocals from Anne Marie and Sean Paul - climbed two places to reach the summit.
Clean Bandit said: "Rockabye is a song that means a lot to us and it means even more to us that so many people are listening to it and liking it."
Rockabye is the band's sixth top five hit and second number one - following 2014's Rather Be, which featured Jess Glynne.
The success of the single comes two months after violinist and founding member Neil Milan left the band.
Rockabye dethroned Little Mix's Shout Out To My Ex, which dropped to number two.
Elsewhere, Bruno Mars's 24K Magic climbed into the top five for the first time, while Maroon 5's Don't Wanna Know, featuring Kendrick Lamar, rose to number seven to give the band their ninth UK top 40.
