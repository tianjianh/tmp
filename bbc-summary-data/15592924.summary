Radio is important in Papua New Guinea, which has scattered, isolated settlements and low levels of literacy.

The government operates a national network and provincial stations. News coverage is said to be balanced. But funding problems have taken some regional radios off the air.
Television coverage is limited mainly to Port Moresby and the provincial capitals.
Two daily newspapers are foreign-owned. The private press, including weeklies and monthlies, reports on corruption and other sensitive matters.
BBC World Service (106.7) and Radio Australia broadcast on FM in the capital.
By June 2010 there were 125,000 internet users (InternetWorldStats). There is a burgeoning blogging scene. Radio Australia says the platform gives locals a chance to vent their frustration with politicians, bureaucrats and the police.
Social media - including blogs, Facebook and Twitter - emerged as platforms for debate during elections in 2012. One blogger observed that smartphone use was ironing out disparities in social media access between rural and urban voters.
