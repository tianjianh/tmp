Named as Chris Harper Mercer, the gunman opened fire on Thursday inside a classroom at Umpqua Community College.
Mercer was shot and killed by police officers who arrived at the scene.
President Barack Obama has expressed frustration over the "routine" response to mass shootings, saying the US had become "numb" to such attacks.
Stacy Boylan, who's daughter survived the shooting, told US television network CNN that his daughter described to him how the gunman asked his victims to state their religion before shooting them.
"'Are you a Christian?' he would ask them, 'and if you are a Christian stand up,'" the father recalled.
Mr Boylan said the gunman told the victims: "because you're a Christian you're going to see God in just about one second".
Another student who survived the shooting, Kortney Moore, gave a similar account to a local newspaper, The News-Review.
The attacker was identified by unnamed officers, as local police refused to release his name.
Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said he did not wish to give the gunman "the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act".
However, the sheriff has come under fire for his stance opposing gun control measures in the past.
Hours after the attack, President Obama reiterated demands for tighter gun laws, saying prayers are "no longer enough".
"We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people.
"But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these mass shootings every few months."
Referring to a BBC interview in which he talked about this, he said countries like the UK and Australia showed that effective legislation was possible.
Candidates vying to replace Mr Obama in office have begun to weigh in as well.
Shortly after the shooting, Republican front-runner Donald Trump called the Washington Post and described the "terrible tragedy" as sounding like "another mental health problem". He added that it appeared mass shootings were more frequent.
The Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said "we are seeing these mass murders happen again and again and again" and called on people in the US to "get the political will to do everything we can to keep people safe".

Suspect's father speaks out -  Ian Mercer says he is shocked and appealed for privacy.
The gunman was reportedly born in the UK and moved to the US as a young boy.
A man identified as the gunman's father, Ian Mercer, told US media he was "just as shocked as everybody" by his son's actions.
The killer's motive is not known, although police said they were investigating reports that he had warned of his intentions on social media.
Lorie Andrews, who lives opposite the campus, said she heard what sounded like fireworks and when she came out of her home she saw students streaming out.
"One girl came out wrapped in a blanket with blood on her," she said.
Hannah Miles, 19, said that she and fellow students were led to a nearby bookshop, where they hid in a back room.
The 3,000-student school is located in Roseburg, Oregon, a rural area about 175 miles (280 km) south of Portland.
Hundreds of people gathered for a vigil in a Roseburg park on Thursday evening.
In audio from police radio channels an officer can be heard saying the suspect was down and that there were "multiple gunshot wounds", and calling for multiple ambulances to go the scene.
The suspect supposedly used a "long gun".
According to Umpqua Community College's website, the average age of students is about 38.
