Manchester council considers plan for 'anti-wee' paint

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High-tech "anti-wee" paint could be introduced across Manchester city centre in order to deter drunken men from urinating in the streets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Manchester City Council is considering coating public areas with the revolutionary paint, which simply bounces back anything sprayed at it.
The idea has been raised after the success of a similar scheme in the German city of Hamburg.
A councillor has begun talks with a company which supplies the paint.
Called Ultra-Ever Dry, the maker claims it will "completely repel almost any liquid".
The paint was introduced in several public areas in Hamburg's red light district earlier this year.
