The flight search engine website reported revenues of Â£120m for 2015, up 28% on the previous year.
The company saw gross bookings of $11.2bn, up 49% on 2014, with visitors to the website up 48%. On average, 50m people used the website each month.
Company founder and chief executive Gareth Williams said the company had seen "excellent growth".
He said: "2015 was another strong year for Skyscanner, showing solid progress in our strategy of expansion beyond our home market, into mobile and beyond flights.
"Our first-half focus on investing in our product drove momentum for the business in the second half. We also saw excellent growth in travellers planning their trips on Skyscanner all around the world, especially on mobile and in the important regions of Asia Pacific and the Americas."
The Edinburgh-based company saw a rise in the number of people using its mobile app, with 40m downloads and an increase of 24% in mobile bookings.
Particular growth was recorded in the Asia-Pacific region, while visits in China were up 67% after Skyscanner bought a Chinese search firm in 2014.
The company opened new offices in London and Sofia as well as expanding existing operations in Budapest and Miami, increasing its global staff to 770.
