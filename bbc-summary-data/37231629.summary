After the first crash, near Urquhart Castle, south of Drumnadrochit, a man was airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness by a coastguard helicopter.
The man's motorbike was involved in a collision with a car at about 11:15.
A second rider came off his bike near Invermoriston, about 11 miles from the first incident, at about 14:50.
Police Scotland said no other vehicle was involved.
The A82 was closed for about 26 miles (42km) between Invergarry and Drumnadrochit and a 120-mile (193km) diversion was put in place. The road has since been reopened.
In the earlier the crash, firefighters used ropes to reach the motorcyclist who had fallen down an embankment.
Three Scottish Fire and Rescue Service appliances, police and a Stornoway Coastguard helicopter assisted in the rescue effort.
