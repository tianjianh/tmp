Jean Hoggart, 56, and her seven-year-old grandson Mikey Dawson were hit by a train at Moor Bridge crossing in Nottinghamshire in 2008.
Lindsey Inger, 13, was killed by a tram at the crossing in 2012.
Relatives and the community campaigned for a footbridge, which was installed in 2013, but they said that was not enough and demanded lighting too.
Sherwood MP Mark Spencer, who campaigned with them, said: "Finally people can cross in safety, they can feel confident in crossing.
"It puts the whole thing to bed really, I hope, and we won't be burdened by another tragedy of another accident."
Other people have died at the crossing but these have been suicides rather than accidents.
Nottinghamshire County Council is installing the lighting over the weekend.
The council said there had been a delay because of complications of working by a live line.
