[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The "racist and Islamophobic" attack took place as the 22-year-old victim travelled on the number 50 bus along Alcester Road in Moseley, Birmingham, police said.
The man repeatedly lit a lighter towards the end of the abuse, that lasted half an hour.
West Midlands Police said a 49-year-old man had been arrested.
The woman was not injured as a result of the threats on Tuesday at 13:50 GMT.
But she was badly shaken and got off the bus two stops early as she feared for her own safety, police said.
Det Con Nigel Box said: "Following the appeal, we received a huge number of calls from the public, which led directly to [a man's] quick arrest."
