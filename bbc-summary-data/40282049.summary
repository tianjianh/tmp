The Royal Tank Regiment soldier died on Thursday after being injured at Castlemartin Range on Wednesday.
Three seriously injured soldiers have been taken to hospital in Swansea, Cardiff and Birmingham.
Minister for People and Veterans, Tobias Ellwood, said the soldier died with his family "by his bedside".
BBC Wales understands the soldier died at Morriston Hospital.
One injured soldier is in Morriston Hospital, Swansea, another at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, and the third was airlifted to a hospital in Birmingham.
The MoD, Dyfed-Powys Police and the Health and Safety Executive are investigating the incident.
Mr Ellwood said: "It is with deep sadness that I can confirm the death of a soldier from the Royal Tank Regiment who died as a result of injuries sustained in an incident at Castlemartin Range.
"His next of kin were by his bedside and we will be respecting their privacy before further details are released.
"Three other soldiers have also been wounded and our thoughts remain with the friends and families of all those involved.
"The safety of our personnel is our absolute priority and a full investigation is underway to understand the details of this tragic incident."
The Army's website says the regiment is "preparing for a live fire exercise at Castlemartin in Wales" which was scheduled to take place at the range between Monday and Friday.
The range, opened by the War Office in 1938, covers 5,900 acres on the south Pembrokeshire coast.
In May 2012, Ranger Michael Maguire died during a live firing exercise at the training base. An inquest later found he was unlawfully killed.
The 1st and 2nd Royal Tank Regiments merged in August 2014 to form The Royal Tank Regiment, which is based in Tidworth, Wiltshire.
