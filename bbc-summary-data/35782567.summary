Dr Ed Southall from Totnes in Devon was on a flight from Gatwick to Thessaloniki, Greece in January when he was asked to help an elderly woman.
He said all he got in thanks was a free hot drink despite a number of requests.
Easyjet said it was "grateful" for his help and has now offered him a free flight.
Dr Southall said: "I looked after the woman and a cabin crew offered me a free coffee but said I would have to pay for a Kit Kat.
"It did not seem quite right."
He made a series of requests to the airline for their policy on rewarding people in similar situations but all he received was an offer of taking his baggage for free.
He also got a "badly written email" from customer services.
After writing to travel reporter Simon Calder he was offered a free flight and was given an apology.
"An apology was all I wanted - you would think an airline would encourage people to help," he said.
Easyjet said: "Easyet is grateful for the assistance Dr Southall provided to our crew and to all of the doctors and medical professionals who assist passengers onboard each year.
"We are sorry we didn't get this right on this occasion and would like to offer Dr Southall a free flight as a gesture of goodwill."
