Luke Cresswell and Steve McNicholas founded the group, who use everyday objects as musical instruments, in Brighton in 1991.
They have since performed across the world and were part of the 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony.
The honorary Doctor of Arts degrees were presented on Monday at a graduation ceremony at Brighton Dome.
The ceremony was the first of five days of degree presentations to more than 5,300 students.
Cresswell and McNicholas own the Old Market Theatre in Brighton, the first venue where they performed together, which they bought in 2010.
They said they were "humbled" to have been recognised for their work.
The university also awarded a Master of Letters degree to journalist and broadcaster Kathryn Flett.
