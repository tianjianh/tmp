The 26-year-old had a loan spell at Stanley in 2014, making three appearances, and played five games with Bristol Rovers last term.
Despite joining the Spireites on a permanent basis in May 2013, Chapman played just one first-team game.
"It's strange to be back but it's nice," Chapman told the club website.
"I knew the goalkeepers from last season had gone on to pastures new and the manager [John Coleman] gave me a call asking if I was interested in coming back and I was delighted to."
Coleman added: "It's a key position and I'm hopeful of bringing another keeper in over the next few days - and the aim is to get two good goalkeepers fighting for one place."
