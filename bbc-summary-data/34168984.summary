[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Another point, another clean sheet but Wales were made to wait as they edge towards Euro 2016 in France.

Gareth Bale could have been the hero again but struck his free-kick over the bar as the home game against Israel ended goalless.
Centre-back Ashley Williams was a rock in the heart of the defence once again.
So how did the Wales players fare overall? BBC Wales Sport's Dafydd Pritchard runs the rule over the players on duty in Cardiff.
Had precious little to do as Israel spent almost the entire match in their own half.
Another assured display from the Fulham defender who has made the right wing-back role his own. Sound on the ball and solid defensively.
Seldom tested defensively, the Reading player was efficient in possession and played his part in a fifth straight clean sheet for Wales.
Led Wales with typical coolness and authority, intercepting any rare dangerous passes a pragmatic Israeli side mustered.
Like Gunter, the Tottenham man was hardly troubled by Israel and was his usual calm self in possession.
Pushed forward to offer Wales width on the left flank, combining well with Ramsey and the other midfielders as the hosts dominated early on.
An industrious display at the base of the Welsh midfield, denying Israel possession and using the ball wisely.
Offered an attacking threat with his runs into the Israeli penalty area but might be disappointed not to have converted either of his clear scoring opportunities.
Wales' most influential player as they dominated possession, the Arsenal playmaker looked the most likely to carve Israel's defence open.
Started well and worked exceptionally hard as he always does, but lacked the cutting edge when he found himself in space in the Israeli box.
A relatively subdued display from the Real Madrid forward, although he always kept Israel's defenders on their toes.
Buzzed with energy as he came on for the similarly busy Robson-Kanu and was denied a dramatic injury-time winner as his header was from an offside position.
Impact was limited by the brevity of his appearance, though he competed well in the air.
