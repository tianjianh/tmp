The 34-year-old excelled as an amateur before winning IBF inter-continental titles after turning professional.
O'Kane's last fight was a defeat on points to Tureano Johnson in a final world title eliminator last year.
"After listening to my family and also my body, I have decided it's time I hang them up," he said on Monday.
O'Kane's gold medal was won in Delhi with the Northern Ireland team captain securing a 16-4 victory over England's Anthony Ogogo in the final.
"I am retiring from the sport I have loved and taken part in since being a teenager," he added.
"After a much-needed rest from the Johnson fight I picked up an injury to my neck while getting ready to do it all again.
"It has been a very hard decision to make and one I have fought with but one that ultimately I feel is the best one to make."
