The Queen was joined by several members of the Royal Family at the Cenotaph for Remembrance Sunday.
The country observed a two-minute silence as Big Ben struck the eleventh hour.
British forces across the world - including 9,500 soldiers in Afghanistan - also stood silent to remember.
The Queen laid a wreath, followed by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duke of Cambridge.
The former chief of the defence staff, Lord Guthrie, laid a wreath on behalf of the Prince of Wales, who is in Auckland, New Zealand.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague laid a wreath on behalf of all those in the armed forces across the commonwealth who have fallen.
Veterans' representatives laid wreaths at the Cenotaph before nearly 10,000 ex-servicemen and women marched past to commemorate their fallen comrades.
This year's commemoration is the first to take place since the death of the last veteran to serve during World War I on either side, according to the Royal British Legion.
There was warm applause from the crowd as the parade marched past the war memorial, inscribed to The Glorious Dead.
The Royal British Legion's head of remembrance, Helen Hill, said the number of veterans marching had increased by 3,000 in the past five years.
"The numbers are going up, not down. There are an increasing number of associations looking after the veteran community. More and more people want to participate in the activities," she said.
Other remembrance events were held across the UK:
British servicemen and women in Helmand Province were able to attend services at remote patrol bases or checkpoints.

The air was cold and clear, the sky a cobalt blue and Whitehall with the Cenotaph at its heart was lined with the ranks of those who serve and those who once served.
Watching from behind the barriers around the MoD, a solitary figure pausing from his duties talking to the media. His silhouette against the sunlight throwing into sharp relief the dark metal of his prosthetic legs, lost in a roadside explosion in Afghanistan five years ago.
The two minutes silence was immaculately observed, the only thing to break the quiet the crying of gulls wheeling in the air.
The wreaths were placed gently around the base of the cenotaph and then the march past.
A glittering parade of polish and steel, of khaki, blue and black - Royal Marines and Gurkhas, Submariners and Gunners and many more in uniform.
Then thousands of veterans, men and women in civilian clothes, but with medals on their chests and cap badges gleaming on berets.
On each lapel a splash of colour, a Poppy, the symbol of remembrance, of sacrifice and thanksgiving.
Lt-Col Zac Stenning, a serving soldier, attended the Remembrance service in London for the first time.
He told BBC News he was "immensely struck by both the dignity and pride and the solemnity of the service".
He added he had lost 10 men from his Army unit in the last six months in Afghanistan, and this in particular made this Sunday an important day.
"It is that single day in the year when we stand together and as a nation we remember the commitment of our men and women of the armed forces not only as soldiers today but of the past."
Corporal of Horse Alistair Grice, from the Blues and Royals Household Cavalry Regiment, said it was a "day of remembering and a celebration of what we have and what we are fortunate to have".
The 35-year-old, from Coppull in Lancashire, who served in conflicts from Bosnia onwards said he would be remembering comrades from his unit including Trooper James Munday, who died in an explosion in Afghanistan on 15 October 2008 and Lance Corporal Jonathan Woodgate, 26, who was killed on 26 March 2010.
Cpl Grice added: "It's amazing to see how many people, not just British but foreign as well, who are here to support the British Armed Forces and what we have done in the past."
This year, Remembrance Sunday falls on 11 November itself, the date of the armistice which brought World War I to an end.
The prime minister of the Republic of Ireland and his deputy took part in Remembrance Sunday services in Northern Ireland.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny was in Enniskillen and Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore was in Belfast, where First Minister Peter Robinson and Secretary of State Theresa Villiers led the wreathlaying.
Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones led Wales in its Remembrance Sunday commemorations in Cardiff.
Meanwhile, First Minister Alex Salmond paid tribute to the courage and commitment of Scotland's servicemen and women in Edinburgh.
