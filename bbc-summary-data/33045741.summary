Amnesty International report claims Irish abortion law 'treats women like vessels'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Irish abortion law treats women like "child-bearing vessels", Amnesty International has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The human rights organisation has said women in the Republic of Ireland should have access to safe, legal abortions.
A report, She is not a Criminal: The Impact of Ireland's Abortion Law, claims pregnant women risk putting their health and lives in danger if they remain in Ireland.
The report is part of Amnesty's campaign, My Body My Rights.
"The human rights of women are violated on a daily basis because of a constitution that treats them like child-bearing vessels," said Amnesty's Secretary General, Salil Shetty.
"Women who need abortions are treated like criminals, stigmatised and forced to travel abroad, taking a serious toll on their mental and physical health.
"The Irish state can no longer ignore this reality, and the appalling impact it is having on thousands of people every year."
Amnesty is calling for a change in the law so that women can have abortions in cases of rape, severe or fatal foetal impairment, or a risk to their health. at least.
Irish law on abortion was clarified in 2014.
The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act allows terminations where there is a threat to the life of the mother.
It is also allowed where doctors agree the expectant mother may take her own life over her pregnancy.
According to the Amnesty report, at least 4,000 women leave the Republic of Ireland for an abortion every year.
The report includes case studies of women who have been denied healthcare to prioritise the life of the foetus, which is protected by an amendment to the Republic of Ireland's constitution.
One woman who was carrying a foetus that had no heartbeat for 14 weeks, told Amnesty that she had to travel to her home country of Spain for medical treatment.
"I didn't feel safe at all," she said. "I was really scared. It became clear that if any complication was raised, these people would let me die."
The Amnesty International report said: "Ireland must amend the constitution and remove the protection of the foetus."
A referendum would be required to amend the constitution.
