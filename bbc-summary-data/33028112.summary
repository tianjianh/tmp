A 75-year-old Pembrokeshire man who abused three children over a 15-year period has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reginald Henry Turner, from Pembroke Dock, carried out the sexual assaults between the early 1990s and 2008, Swansea Crown Court heard.
He was found guilty on 15 May of 20 charges of historical sex abuse involving three different girls who were as young as six.
Turner must serve a minimum of almost nine years before applying for parole.
Judge Huw Davies QC said he continued to represent a danger and had expressed no remorse.
The offences included four counts of rape involving two separate girls, indecent assault, indecency with a child and sexual touching.
The court heard his three victims were not connected to each other and "they had no reason whatsoever to make up the allegations against him".
Patrick Griffiths, prosecuting, said Turner was arrested after one of the complainants, who is now a teenager, went to the police in 2013.
When the media covered his first magistrates' court appearance, other victims came forward.
Mr Griffiths told the court one victim said: "From the age of five she never felt safe. She still suffers with nightmares."
He summarised a second victim's statement: "The abuse started when she was a young, innocent child. She feels her innocence was taken off her. She gets flashbacks to what happened to her as a child."
