Kelmendi, 25, overpowered Italy's Odette Giuffrida with a yuko to claim victory at her second Games, having represented Albania at London 2012.
There was a surprise in the men's -66kg as Fabio Basile of Italy beat South Korea's An Baul in emphatic fashion.
The unseeded Basile dominated his opponent to win Italy's first gold medal of these Games.
Japan's Misato Nakamura and Russia's Natalia Kuziutina won bronze in the women's event, while Masashi Ebinuma of Japan and Uzbekistan's Rishod Sobirov also secured bronze in the men's.
Kosovo's Olympic Committee was established in 1992 but only recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 2014. The disputed territory declared independence from Serbia in 2008.
