However, it did not bring as much disruption as predicted. The storm was not expected to be as severe as Storm Desmond, which brought gales and heavy rain on 5 and 6 December.
A number of trees were toppled - including a Christmas tree in Banbrige - but no major roads were blocked on Thursday morning.
Storm Eva mostly affected western counties, bringing some severe winds to coastal areas.
In the Republic of Ireland, Met Ã‰ireann issued a number of weather warnings on Wednesday.
The Republic's electricity provider, ESB Networks, said that around 6,000 customers were left without power as a result of the storm.
