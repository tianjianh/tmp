England, who can play up front, on the wing or in central midfield, has been capped by England up to under-23 level.
The 19-year-old has made 21 appearances for the Blues since signing from Doncaster in 2016, scoring five goals.
"There's more to learn, more experience to gain, and I'm really happy," she told the club website.
"I know I'm in the best place to keep working on my performance and picking up a new position as a wing-back."
