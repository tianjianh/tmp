The former Republic of Ireland Under-21 international moves to Molineux on a three-and-a-half-year contract.
Mason, 24, scored 22 goals in 60 league starts for Cardiff, who he joined from Plymouth in July 2011 for £250,000.
"We've looked at him for a while, and particularly back in August, but the deal couldn't get done," said Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett.
"I like his work rate, I like his football, and I think he's a natural to play behind the striker in my ideal 4-2-3-1 formation."
Cardiff are under a transfer embargo, while Wolves were in need of attacking reinforcements following the loss of three players to injury.
Wales international Dave Edwards has had surgery on a foot injury, recent signing Michal Zyro faces up to eight weeks out with a calf injury and winger Jordan Graham has had an operation on his torn anterior cruciate ligament.
Wolves also sold Benik Afobe to Bournemouth earlier in January for an undisclosed club record fee, thought to be about £10m.
Wanderers have agreed a deal to sign Newcastle United defender Mike Williamson, who was on loan at Molineux earlier in the season while defender Scott Golbourne has joined Bristol City.
