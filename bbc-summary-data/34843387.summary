Katari Anuradha was shot and stabbed by at least three men wearing burkas, Indian media reported, quoting police. A motive has yet to be established.
Her husband, who was with her, is in a critical condition with bullet and stab injuries.
The attack took place at the Chittoor Municipal Corporation office, where the staff tried to stop the attackers.
Senior police official G Srinivas told the Indian Express newspaper that they were exploring several angles, including old rivalry and new enemies.
The assailants fled the scene after the attack, although reports say two people later handed themselves into police.
The attackers had been wearing burkas, one-piece veils that cover the face and body, as they forced their way into Ms Anuradha's office, media reports said.
Security has been tightened in Chittoor and state police are closing borders with neighbouring Tamil Nadu state in an attempt to find the killers.
