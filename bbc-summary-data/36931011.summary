Dundee United 1-1 Queen of the South

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fine individual goal from Nick van der Velden rescued a point for Dundee United against Queen of the South.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Millar, who failed to score in two years as a Dundee United player, took great pleasure in firing in one against his former club.
However, Van der Velden's composure and ability saw him flick the ball over two defenders in the penalty area before a controlled shot levelled the game.
United should have gone on to win it, but could not find a winner.
New Tannadice team manager Ray McKinnon warned his team that every point in the lower league would have to be earned, but there was a surprising lack of intensity or urgency about Dundee United's play during an opening period where they rarely troubled the visitors goal.
Queen's goalkeeper Lee Robinson hardly had a save to make in that flat first 45 minutes apart from a header from Mark Durnan that was aimed straight at him from a Van der Velden's free kick.
The Dutch midfielder kept drifting into intelligent areas to pick up possession, but the link-up from middle to front was poor despite the pace of Cammy Smith and Tope Obedayi down the flanks.
Queen's looked more composed going forward with Lyndon Dykes causing problems breaking from left midfield and it was no surprise when he was key in breaking the deadlock.
The Aussie made space for a shot that goalkeeper Cammy Bell could only parry, and when the ball was worked back to Millar he swept a shot into the net from 12 yards.
It took that outrageous bit of skill from Van der Velden to really spark McKinnon's side into life as he flicked the ball over two opponents in a tight space before guiding a shot beyond Robinson.
Former Rangers goalkeeper Bell became much busier after that equaliser and proved just how sharp his reflexes are with two crucial saves as the defenders in front of him struggled to cope with the dramatically increased threat.
Experienced right back Jamie Hamill in particular found it tough to deal with the pace of Tope Obedayi and in 65 minutes the former Kilmarnock striker's shot was tipped on to the post by Robinson.
Then within seconds Aberdeen's on loan striker Smith made space for a shot from the edge of the area and was only denied a goal by an impressive full stretch save by the goalkeeper.
Smith than missed an easier chance; deflecting Van der Velden's near post cross wide of the target while Queen of the South's only real chance of a winner fell to a returning hero.
Stephen Dobbie scored 54 times in 103 games in his first spell at Palmerston and it took a Bell block to prevent the former Bolton striker marking his short appearance as substitute with a goal.
