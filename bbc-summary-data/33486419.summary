[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jury urged to convict UDA murder plot accused

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prosecutor has told a jury there was "considerable and compelling evidence" that three men conspired to murder former Loyalist leader Johnny "Mad Dog" Adair.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Advocate depute Paul Kearney was making his closing speech in the trial.
Antoin Duffy, 39, his cousin Martin Hughes, 36, and Paul Sands, 32, deny being involved in a murder plot against Mr Adair and Sam McCrory.
Mr Adair and Mr McCrory were once high profile figures in the UDA.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Mr Kearney told the jury: "You must put aside all emotion and act like judges."
The prosecutor said: "The two subjects of this conspiracy are not nice men. They are convicted terrorists."
He told the jury that audio evidence was "compelling".
The jury has heard that Mr Hughes and Mr Duffy drove from Glasgow to Ayrshire on October 1, 2013.
Undercover police also followed Mr Hughes' car, which had been bugged by police, and saw Mr Sands get into the car with them. They were heard to chat about guns and the best places to shoot Mr Adair and Mr McCrory as they drove around the area where Mr McCrory lived.
Mr Kearney said: "It is the clearest evidence of agreement of a conspiracy. It can't be denied what was said. It is a lengthy and detailed discussion of a plan to murder while they drive round the area.
"There is mention of Adair and McCrory. There is a discussion about what order it would be better to carry out the murders, what weapons to use. There is considerable and compelling evidence that all three men are conspirators."
Two other men Craig Convery, 37, and Gordon Brown, 29, are also on trial accused of charges of being involved in organised crime. They deny the charges against them.
The trial before judge Lady Scott continues.
