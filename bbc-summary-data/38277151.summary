Sol Bamba: Cardiff City defender charged by Football Association

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City defender Sol Bamba has been charged by the Football Association for alleged insulting and/or threatening behaviour in the draw at Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old has already received a two-game ban for his red card - and now faces more matches on the sidelines.
Bamba confronted the referee, fourth official and Neil Warnock as he reacted angrily to a Jonathan Douglas tackle.
He has until 18:00 GMT on Friday to respond to the charge.
Ivory Coast international Bamba, who has apologised, will not play in Cardiff's next home match against Barnsley, having missed the 2-1 win over Wolves on Tuesday.
Cardiff boss Warnock has not ruled out the club taking disciplinary action, saying: "You can't condone that [Bamba's reaction].
"I've not seen that part of him before, but he was absolutely furious. He'll get violent conduct and banned for three games and quite rightly so.
"He was a bit big for me. I could not get him around the neck.  I'll have to grow a bit. But he is distraught in there, and quite rightly so."
Warnock blamed referee James Adcock for trying to play advantage when Douglas had originally fouled Bamba.
"When you look at the video, the lad, Douglas, he knows what he's doing," said Warnock.
"He's left his foot in which wasn't spotted by anybody, but that does not condone what he has done.
"The ref should have just blown for a foul. It would have saved a man getting sent off, it would have saved 20 minutes of bedlam, it would have saved me a lot of hassle.
"He [the referee] said he wanted to give us the advantage, which it did, but we don't want it there. When Sol goes down like that, he does not go down for nothing, you've got to stop the game and learn from it. I hope the referee has learned from that."
Bamba apologised for his conduct in a statement released by the club.
"I want to apologise to the Cardiff City supporters, my team-mates and manager for my conduct during Saturday's game at Ipswich," he said.
"Whilst I was extremely angry with the challenge on me at the time, it did (sic) not condone my reaction and I accept that the referee had no choice but to show me a red card.
"I've spoken to my manager and team-mates and apologised to them in person.
"I've had a fantastic time at Cardiff City since joining in October and I look forward to returning. My intention will then be to make further amends with my performances on the pitch."
