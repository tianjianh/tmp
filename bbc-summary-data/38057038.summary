MLAs 'spend a penny' to fund toilet twinning scheme

You may have heard of towns across the world being twinned with each other but Stormont has gone one step further.

The All-Party group on International Development (APGID) has launched a toilet twinning initiative.
As a result, two toilets have been twinned with two newly built latrines in Uganda - funded by MLAs.
SDLP MLA Claire Hanna, who chairs the group, explained the idea behind the unusual concept.
"In Northern Ireland we generally take the availability of toilets for granted but, in many parts of the world, a lack of adequate water and sanitation leads to disease and can prevent girls, in particular, from accessing education," she said.
"By twinning these toilets we hope to remind MLAs, staff and visitors to the building of this need around the world," she added.
