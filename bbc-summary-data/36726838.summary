He was found just after midnight in the accident and emergency unit at Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, said police.
Security staff at the hospital in Wigan discovered the baby, who was then resuscitated by medical staff. Police said the infant was "now doing well".
A 31-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Police have appealed for witnesses.
Det Insp Martin Reddington of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) thanked the hospital staff whose "heroic actions saved the life of this newborn baby".
"This is an awful situation," he added. "I am just so happy I am able to say that the baby boy is doing well.
"We have made an arrest and we will be thoroughly investigating how this happened."
He appealed for anyone who saw a man and a woman in or around the A&E toilets between 19:00 BST on Tuesday and midnight to contact them.
Andrew Foster, chief executive of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, said: "I would like to thank all staff who were involved for their professionalism and calmness during the incident, particularly the diligent member of staff who discovered the baby and raised the alarm.
"I'm very proud of the way our staff worked - their quick response without doubt saved the baby's life."
The A&E department was closed overnight but has now reopened and is operating as usual, police said.
