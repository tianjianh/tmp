[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 2-5 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln City twice came from behind to end Chester's nine-game unbeaten National League run by handing out the hosts' heaviest defeat of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Big centre-half Ryan Astles was left unmarked to score his first goal of the campaign when Chester went in front against the run of play after 33 minutes.
That kicked off a frenetic 15-minute burst of five goals either side of half-time, Lincoln's Matt Rhead equalising with his eighth of the season four minutes before the break.
Chester skipper Tom Shaw's penalty put the hosts back in front on 44 minutes, but Sean Raggett levelled again for Lincoln in first-half stoppage time.
Rhead then gave Lincoln the lead for the first time three minutes after the interval, coolly slotting home a loose ball after Nathan Arnold's free-kick.
Substitute Jack Muldoon and Harry Anderson made it 5-2 with late goals as the visitors spectacularly ended Chester's run of just one goal conceded in nine National League matches.
The Imps climb to second in the table, while Chester remain 12th - now eight points adrift of the play-off places.
