[SN]TITLE[SN]
Levante 2-1 Atl√©tico Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Atletico Madrid can no longer win the Spanish title following a surprise 2-1 defeat at bottom club Levante.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They trail leaders Barcelona by three points with one game to go, and Barca have the better head-to-head record so would win if points are level.
Champions League finalists Atletico went 1-0 up through Fernando Torres.
But Levante, who are relegated, hit back with goals from Victor Casadesus and a last-minute Giuseppe Rossi strike.
Relive the drama of the penultimate weeked of the La Liga title race
Plaudits have been paid to Diego Simeone and his Atletico players since they overcame Bayern Munich to set up a 28 May Champions League final with Real Madrid in Milan.
Yet their midweek exploits looked to have caught up with them as they failed to overcome La Liga's bottom club.
It had looked to be going to plan when Torres finished well following Koke's clever pass.
Atletico had kept clean sheets in their previous four league games, three of which had ended 1-0.
But Casadesus' equaliser and Rossi's late breakaway at the Ciutat de Valencia means 2014 champions Atletico, who started with inspirational central defender Diego Godin and top scorer Antoine Griezmann on the bench, now cannot overhaul Barca.
