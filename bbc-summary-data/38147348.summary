Long Eaton couple living metres from HS2 get no compensation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple who will be able to see a HS2 viaduct from their home say they will not be entitled to compensation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elizabeth Cleaver and Stephen Wilkinson live near a railway line in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, and say the 15m (49ft) viaduct will have "drastic impact".
But they miss out on compensation because they live outside the eligible area - while people living opposite will get a payout.
HS2 said it was working on a compensation scheme for residents.
The government published its preferred route for the high speed rail link earlier this month, with a possible new design for Long Eaton.
However, the couple who live 42m (138ft) away, say they knew nothing about this beforehand.
"We always knew it [HS2] was coming down this particular track, so we knew it would come this close," he said.
"But we now know it is going to be elevated and on a viaduct."

They fear the new proposals will devalue their home of 16 years.
"At the moment it is quite peaceful but this new line will have drastic impact," he added.
"It will look straight into the top floor windows and will be noisier because of the speed. It's absolutely gutting."
Homes opposite are being demolished and residents are being offered the value of their home plus 10% and legal fees.
Mr Wilkinson and Ms Cleaver say they are not entitled to anything.
A spokesman for HS2 Ltd said it recognised people were concerned about the impact of the project but it was working to minimise that.
He said it had a scheme in place to help anyone living in the street to sell their homes and it was consulting on compensation schemes.
