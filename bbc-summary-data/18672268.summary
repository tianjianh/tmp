Trump International has signed up to The Whisky Ambassador scheme aiming to promote the tourism, whisky and hospitality industries.
It is hoped workers at the complex will soon be able to explain the different characteristics of Scottish whiskies.
The Â£750m development on the Menie estate is due to open next week.
Mr Trump has chosen Glendronach distillery, near Huntly, to create a limited edition 26-year-old malt whisky to commemorate the opening.
Adam Philp, Trump International's food and drink manager, said training staff to become whisky ambassadors was important to the company.
He added: "We are committed to promoting Scottish culture and heritage and helping make the country the toast of tourists.
"Whisky is just as much a part of Scotland's story as its golf, and we will offer the very best of both."
Sue Beatt, from The Whisky Ambassador, added: "We are thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Trump International Golf Links in the home of golf and the home of whisky to help customers learn about our national drink.
"So many people stick to selling and drinking only the best known brands but there is a whole world of wonderful whiskies out there to explore. Our partnership should give weary golfers the perfect tonic at the 19th hole."
The course will be provided at the Trump International Golf Links in conjunction with the British Institute of Innkeeping Awarding Body (BIIAB) and Aberdeen's leading licensing solicitors James and George Collie.
