Prosecuting James Curtis QC said the footage showed two men getting out of a Renault Megane outside the Direct Source 3 warehouse in Digbeth at about 18:30 GMT on 3 February.
He said the men, armed with handguns, one with a silencer, were Mr Zarif and Mr Mistry.
They rounded up staff before taking Mr Javeed, a grandfather from east London, out into a corridor, with his hands bound, Birmingham Crown Court heard.
"Both gunmen are pointing guns directly at him," he said.
The CCTV footage then showed him stood in the hallway of the premises with one of the men pointing a gun at him before shots are fired.
"He has been wounded and yet he fights back," he said.
Mr Javeed was shot in the mouth, throat, leg and foot.
His family left the court room before the footage was shown and the public gallery was cleared.
Mr Mistry, of Laundon Way, Leicester, and Mr Wali, of Osmaston Park Road, Derby, are also accused of conspiracy to rob the warehouse and possession of a pistol with intent to cause fear or violence.
Mr Curtis said Mr Wali was driving the getaway vehicle from the scene.
The trial continues.
