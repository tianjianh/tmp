A scholarship for fresh talent entering the oil and gas industry, as a legacy of the Piper Alpha disaster, has been unveiled.

The 1988 North Sea oil platform tragedy saw 167 men die, the world's worst such incident.
The new programme has been launched by industry skills and safety body Opito.
Survivor Ed Punchard said: "It is important for us to remember the events of that night in a way which is about the future rather than the past."
He explained: "I believe that we need to empower a new generation of young people who will be involved in the oil and gas industry in the future, so that they will be fully aware of the dangers inherent in the industry and the need for safety to be a priority at every level."
David Doig, group chief executive of Aberdeen-based Opito, said: "Piper Alpha was a significant turning point for the oil and gas industry, not just here in the North Sea but far beyond.
"It is vital that the lessons learned are not forgotten but are passed on to the next generation of offshore workers and managers, many of whom weren't even born when the disaster happened."
The first three recipients are Olusola Olusuyi, known as Sola, Pal Bipin, and Ada Bolu.
