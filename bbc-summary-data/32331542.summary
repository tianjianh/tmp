On Thursday's debate
Labour leader Ed Miliband on David Cameron not taking part: "I think if you are applying for the job of prime minister, the very least people expect if for you to turn up to the job interview."
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon: ""I am hugely looking forward to this debate, because it is another opportunity to take the SNP's positive message on the progressive policies we believe in to people right across the whole of the UK."
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood: "I'm looking forward to the opportunity to go in there and put the case again for Wales, but also make clear that we've got a message that will resonate with other communities right throughout the UK, especially in terms of putting the alternative to austerity."
Green leader Natalie Bennett: "I'm very much looking forward to tonight. We went through the last one which I actually really enjoyed. Lots of people were telling me to enjoy it beforehand. I wasn't sure if I would, but I did, and so really looking forward to tonight."
Conservative leader David Cameron: "Together, they pose a clear threat to the future of our United Kingdom. A coalition of chaos.  The SNP acting as the chain to Labour's wrecking ball, running right through our economic recovery - and it will be you who pays the price."
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg: "Instead of Liberal Democrats holding the balance of power and using it to keep the government in the centre ground, Nigel Farage and his friends in the Conservatives and the DUP would drag Britain further and further to the right."
