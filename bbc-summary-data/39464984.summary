[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 3-2 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Hughes scored twice as Accrington hit back from two goals down to extend their 13-game unbeaten run courtesy of a 3-2 victory over Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crewe looked set to hand Stanley their first defeat in two months after first-half goals from Callum Cooke and Chris Dagnall.
But the hosts came roaring back and a double from defender Hughes either side of Shay McCartan's strike handed them a win that keeps alive an outside chance of reaching the League Two play-offs.
Middlesbrough loanee Cooke opened the scoring on the quarter of an hour with a brilliant 25-yard effort, his fourth goal for Crewe since he signed at the end of January.
Crewe continued to create the better chances and George Cooper's ball in on 41 minutes found Dagnall, who dinked home his 13th goal of the campaign.
Stanley got one back on 57 minutes when Hughes scrambled the ball home from close range from a Sean McConville corner.
Four minutes later, Stanley won a free-kick on the edge of the area and McCartan fired it home - the front man has scored five of his 10 goals this season from free-kicks.
Hughes made the comeback complete on 79 minutes when Crewe failed to clear another McConville corner and he was there at the far post to fire home - his first goals of the season.
