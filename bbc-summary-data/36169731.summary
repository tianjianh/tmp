Football fans have paid tribute to the "justice for the 96" campaign at Swansea City's game against Liverpool.

Ninety-six football fans died as a result of a crush in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.
After a 27-year campaign by victims' families, the behaviour of Liverpool fans was exonerated on Tuesday after an inquest concluded they were unlawfully killed.
A minute's applause was held at the Liberty Stadium before the kick-off.
The teams presented a floral tribute in memory of those who died to Barry Devonside, who lost his son, Christopher, in the tragedy.
Match day announcer and club chaplain Kevin Johns was also due to speak as part of the tribute at Sunday's game.
Welsh fans John McBrien, 18, from Holywell, Flintshire, and David Steven Brown, 25, from Wrexham, were among those who died.
A Swansea City spokesman said: "Everyone has seen the display of courage and strength from the families over the last 27 years. It must have been such a difficult time for them and we think, like the rest of the football family, that their fight has been justified.
"As a football club, we wanted to stand together and show our support for those families who lost loved ones."
