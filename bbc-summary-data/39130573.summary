Bury Council's chief executive has been suspended over claims he and others failed to follow procedures in their handling of a safeguarding case.

The Manchester Evening News reported it related to a councillor who admitted making indecent images of children.
Mike Owen and two senior officers have been suspended following an external review of the case, a spokeswoman said.
Council leader Rishi Shori said the suspensions would allow the three to "focus on responding" to the case.
He said they were "a neutral act".
The council had commissioned the review by childcare expert Malcolm Newsam after it "received allegations that there were failures to act appropriately in following safeguarding procedures in respect of an individual case," he added.
Deputy chief executive Pat Jones-Greenhalgh will replace Mr Owen until the council's own investigation is concluded, the authority's spokeswoman said.
