[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On-loan Fulham man Joronen's long punt was badly misjudged by away keeper Matt Ingram and the ball bounced in.
Armand Gnanduillet hit the bar with a header, but it was 2-0 after the break when Gnanduillet did net with a header.
Max Kretzschmar turned in Michael Harriman's cross to give the away side hope, but Stevenage held on despite some strong late pressure.

"There's different ways to win a football match. Today we had to really dig in and grind, and make sure that we held firm. I was delighted with the way we did.
"We got ourselves in front by a little bit of luck, and then got ourselves further in front with a very well worked goal.
"Still, we had to hang on in to the last couple of minutes and defend with our lives."
Wycombe Manager manager Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"It was a real spirited second-half performance, especially the last 20 to 25 minutes. I thought we were definitely going to get the equaliser.
"There was nothing in the game at all, apart from two extremely poor goals that we conceded.
"The first one was an absolute freak, and we're going to be seeing that on the bloopers channel for years to come. The second was a poor goal for us to concede by our standards.
"There was not much in the game at all. I'm not too down on the boys. I think we had some energy towards the end, and if we can take that in to Tuesday's game (at home to Newport) then we'll be fine."
