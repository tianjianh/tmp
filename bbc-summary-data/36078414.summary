The hosts added 170 to their overnight 110-1 at Bristol before Norwell (102) fell lbw to Chesney Hughes after making his maiden first-class century.
Hughes bowled Dent to end his 312-ball knock on 180, but Hamish Marshall (72) helped keep Gloucestershire on top.
Kieran Noema-Barnett also added 58 from 52 balls as the home side were all out for 563 at stumps, a lead of 119.
Gloucestershire bowler Liam Norwell told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:
"I just thought, 'try and bat a few overs, just frustrate them, score 15, 20 if you can' and I'm still a bit shocked, in all honestly. It's my first hundred in any cricket, so I'm quite happy with that.
"Last year wasn't a great year with the bat. This winter, I worked with the coaching team to just stay still when I'm batting and watch the ball, to stay relaxed when I'm batting. It went OK today.
"Hopefully I can kick on and start to be a bit more consistent down the lower end of the order."
