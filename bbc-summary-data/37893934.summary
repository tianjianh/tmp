Scott Diver, 16, was last seen at about 14:45 on Saturday 17 September at his home in Second Avenue.
Police Scotland said a body found in a wooded area at Old Kilpatrick last week had been identified as the missing teenager.
The death is not being treated as suspicious and a report has been sent to the procurator fiscal.
In a statement, Police Scotland said: "Around 13:00 hours on Thursday 3 November, police were called to a report of the body of a young man found within a wooded area near to Old Kilpatrick.
"Sadly, the body has now been formally identified as that of Scott Diver who had been missing from his home in Clydebank since Saturday 17 September. Relatives are aware."
Scott, who moved to Scotland from the Isle of Man three years ago, was captured on CCTV walking through nearby Dalmuir Park on the afternoon of his disappearance.
His family later made public appeals for him to get in touch.
