The Washington Hotel on East Parade, Llandudno, was most recently a nightclub until it closed in 2012.
Dylan's restaurant chain, which has two other premises in north Wales, hopes to reopen it in 2017 after renovation work, creating 40 jobs.
The building first opened in 1885 but was rebuilt in 1925 after being destroyed in a fire.
