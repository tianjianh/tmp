The BBC asked forces which items had been stolen between 2011/12 to 2015/16.
The cannabis plant was stolen from Staffordshire Police, which also reported the theft of some cigars.
A first aid kit, CS spray, a flag, handcuffs and "clothing (not underwear)" were among items stolen from Warwickshire Police.
Thefts from West Mercia Police included the barbecue and garden gates.
Emergency vehicles, dustbins and horses were also among items stolen from the force.
The horses were not police horses, but ones that had been rounded up when found to be loose on a Shropshire road. They had been held by a third party on behalf of police when they were stolen, the force said.
Money believed to be about Â£113,000 was stolen from former Warwickshire Police headquarters between June 2009 and September 2011, the force said.
Ex-police officer Paul Andrew Greaves, 57, from Belvoir Lodge, Carlton, Nottinghamshire, was found not guilty of theft at Birmingham Crown Court in July this year. The case "remains open," police said.
The money had originally been seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act in 2009, the force said.
The information was revealed following a request under the Freedom of Information Act.
