Three armed and masked men entered a house in Donaghbrook Drive at 21:40 BST on Monday.
The man, who was in his 70s, was hit on the head by one of the gang.
After tying the couple up, the gang left with a what has been described as a substantial sum of money in a car.
The man managed to break free and released his wife who went to a neighbour's house.
Her husband was treated in hospital but has since been discharged.
Det Con Brennan said: "There were also reports of shots fired coming from the Ballybrakes area around this time and I am appealing to anyone who may have heard a sound like shots, to contact us.
"We are also appealing to anyone that may have witnessed any suspicious activity or vehicles in the area to contact detectives."
The North Antrim DUP MLA, Mervyn Storey, described the incident as "extremely disturbing and worrying".
"Those responsible are creating a sense of fear and I utterly condemn their behaviour," he said.
"This incident was undoubtedly a frightening experience for the family involved and I unreservedly condemn this attack on a local family."
