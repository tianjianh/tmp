Eastleigh 1-1 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green missed the chance to go level on points with National League leaders Lincoln as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers took a 24th-minute lead at the Silverlake Stadium when Christian Doidge sweetly headed in Keanu Marsh-Brown's cross from the right for his 14th league goal of the season.
Eastleigh twice went close before Ayo Obileye levelled 10 minutes later, bundling in Luke Coulson's teasing corner at the back post.
Towards the end of an exciting first half, Forest Green's Dale Bennett made a fine block from Hakeem Odoffin's shot.
Eastleigh introduced newly-signed striker Darius Henderson at half-time but Rovers initially threatened most, although Ben Strevens headed just wide with 12 minutes to go amid late chances for both teams.
