Guiseley 1-2 North Ferriby United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Ferriby gave their survival hopes a boost with a vital win at 10-man Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Lockwood's side took the lead when Will Hatfield netted with an outstanding strike from outside the penalty area, the effort veering past an unsighted Rory Watson.
The visitors refused to buckle though and Reece Thompson nearly equalised early in the second half when his deflected effort hit the post.
The same player did eventually level just shy of the hour with a fabulous long-range lob.
Things went downhill for Guiseley when Danny Lowe was sent off, as Jake Skelton duly capitalised for the away side with a crisp left-footed finish three minutes from time.
