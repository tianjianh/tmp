Four appliances were called to the Blue Lagoon on Gordon Street, next to the main entrance to Central Station, at about 13:40.
The fire was extinguished a short time later. One woman suffered slight smoke inhalation but did not require hospital treatment.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze was confined to the takeaway.
In October 2012, firefighters tackled a fire at the same premises.
