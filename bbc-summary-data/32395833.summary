Eurotunnel delay after power failure shuts tunnel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An electrical fault has caused delays of up to four hours for travellers using the Channel Tunnel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Part of one of the tunnels was closed due to a power supply problem, which was fixed about 14:30 BST.
Eurotunnel said it was working to reduce delays, which built up to four hours for services from Folkestone and two hours from Calais.
People who did not need to travel were earlier advised to reschedule their journeys to another day.
Eurostar also apologised to passengers affected by delays to its services.
Eurostar also said that due to a national strike in Belgium its services on the Brussels route would only operate to and from Lille Europe on Wednesday, with no services to or from Brussels Midi.
