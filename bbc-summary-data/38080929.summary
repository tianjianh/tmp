Owen Williams: Leicester Tigers hope to sign fly-half to new contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill is "very keen" to sign fly-half Owen Williams to a new contract.

Williams, who has made 74 appearances for Tigers since joining from Scarlets ahead of the 2014-15 season, is nearing the end of his current deal.
The 24-year-old was linked with a return to his former club before re-signing with Leicester in January 2015.
"Every indication so far is that he's keen to stay," Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
"It's down to him whether he feels that this is the place for him, but as he plays every week we'd like to think that that would be the case."
Williams has yet to win a Test cap, with the so-called 'Gatland's law' meaning only three players playing outside of Wales can be selected.
But Cockerill believes the Neath-born player, who can also play at centre, can fulfil his international ambitions without joining a Welsh club.
"Ultimately any player in any position, if you're good enough, you will play for your country," Cockerill continued.
"Owen's a very good player, I've got no doubt that he could play at Test level tomorrow and do a very good job.
"[Wales backs coach] Rob Howley has go to decide whether he's their best 10 or their best 12 to do what they need to do.
"There's different laws or stipulations around that. I'm not sure Owen playing in Wales would guarantee him a place in the Wales team at this point. "
