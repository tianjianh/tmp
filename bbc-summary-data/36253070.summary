Scotland Stronger in Europe's event will feature the chairwoman of its advisory group, Prof Mona Siddiqui.
It coincides with the publication of a survey by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce indicating its members' support for EU membership.
Meanwhile, former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars has called on nationalists to vote against the EU.
Prof Siddiqui has pledged to ensure Scotland Stronger in Europe makes a "positive, factual, people-based" case for the EU.
The campaign group has said it will not include any serving politicians, allowing political parties to run their own campaigns.
The Scottish Chambers of Commerce organisation has published a survey of its members' opinions on the EU.
A total of 350 members responded. Continuing EU membership was backed by 68% of them, and opposed by 22%.
A UK-wide Chambers of Commerce survey also indicated backing for the remain case, although by a narrower margin.
The campaign to leave the EU has been backed by veteran nationalist Jim Sillars.
Writing for Common Space, Mr Sillars described EU membership as "a barrier to our aspirations rather than a facilitator of them".
He added: "The question at the heart of this referendum is simple: do we want to continue being governed by an organisation we do not elect and cannot reject or do we want to bring democracy home, in exactly the way generations of nationalists have urged us to?
"If the UK comes out of the EU, then Scotland will be free of all EU interference in our domestic affairs, including on the issue of independence, where their past interventions have damaged our cause."
