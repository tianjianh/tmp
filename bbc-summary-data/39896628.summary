Paul Lambert's role as Wolves head coach is in doubt because of a dispute over who has the final say in signing players, reports BBC Radio 5 live.

The 47-year-old, who was appointed in November after Walter Zenga's sacking, has concerns about agent Jorge Mendes' involvement in the recruitment process.
Wolves started well under Zenga after making 12 summer signings, several of which were arranged by Mendes.
But the Italian left after 14 games and Wolves finished 15th under Lambert.
Former Norwich, Aston Villa and Blackburn boss Lambert guided Wolves to Championship survival, mainly thanks to a five-game winning run from March to early April.

Lambert and Wolves could part company soon because Lambert believes he is going to lose control over recruiting players, with renowned agent Mendes winning the power battle.
Mendes advises Wolves' Chinese owners Fosun and brought a number of players to the club last summer when Fosun took over. But many of them were failures. The standout success was Helder Costa and Lambert recognises Mendes got that one right.
He is happy to use Mendes' contacts and recommendations, as long as Lambert has the final say. Lambert said at Tuesday's end-of-season awards what a privilege it is to manage Wolves, but he has clear ideas about the sort of players he wants to buy this summer - mostly British.
But his recommendations are being knocked back as Fosun continue to back agent rather than manager.
