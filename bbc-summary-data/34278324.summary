UK mortgage lending back from slump

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UK mortgage lending in the first eight months of the year has exceeded annual lending as a whole during the credit crunch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A total of £138.6bn has been borrowed so far this year, including £20bn in August, latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) show.
This is higher than mortgage lending for the whole of 2010 (£133.8bn) and the whole of 2011 (£138.3bn).
The CML said lending was "enjoying its best spell since 2008".
Activity has been driven, in part, by homeowners remortgaging to secure a low rate, fearing that the Bank of England will increase interest rates in the coming months.
Mortgage lending in August was 12% higher than in August last year, when new rules were slowing the application process. The total was 8% lower than in July - as is often the case as people head off on summer holidays.
The CML represents banks, building societies and other lenders who together undertake around 95% of all residential mortgage lending in the UK.
