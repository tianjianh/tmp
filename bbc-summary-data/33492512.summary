James McElvar, a singer in the band Rewind, fell ill after wearing 12 layers of clothing to avoid paying the Â£45 extra baggage fee.
McElvar threw up and was given oxygen during the Easyjet flight travelling from Stansted to Glasgow.
The airline said it had one of the most generous cabin bag allowances, with no upper weight limit.
The 19-year-old, from Cumbernauld, had intended to take a suitcase and a small rucksack on board, but the airline only permits passengers to have one piece of hand luggage.
After being told he would be charged an additional fee to take the extra bag on board, he emptied the rucksack and wore the contents.
McElvar was wearing four jumpers, six T-shirts, three pairs of jeans, two pairs of jogging bottoms, two jackets and two hats when he collapsed.
Paramedics reportedly told him he was "lucky to be alive".
After the incident the band took to social media to reassure their worried fans. They tweeted: "For everyone asking James is ok. He is being looked after in hospital now back home safe in Glasgow. He sends you all his love."
Twelve hours later, Rewind tweeted: "James is much better now! Still in a bit of shock but he's recovered from last night! And the other boys are fine and home safe! #rewindHQ"
Fans of the band have wished the frontman a speedy recovery, while rival airline Ryanair tweeted: "Hey James (@rewind_music) before you get hot under the collar, rewind, book #Ryanair & get 2 free bags. "
