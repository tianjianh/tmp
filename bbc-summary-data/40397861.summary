Officers were called to an address at Fort Terrace shortly before 06:00 BST.
During a search, police said they found a car linked to the suspect with a drunk woman inside.  They forced open the car and found a "machete-type" knife in the vehicle.
A short time later, police arrested a 31-year-old man who remains in custody.
A police spokeswoman said the woman is "believed to have willingly travelled to the area in the vehicle as a passenger and is not suspected of involvement in any alleged crime at present".
