Demolition work on one of Cardiff city centre's "eyesores" has started, paving the way for a major new transport hub.

Hoardings have been put up around Marland House - a rundown block of shops and offices which greets visitors at Cardiff Central railway station.
Work has started to flatten the building, along with the adjoining Wood Street NCP multi-storey car park.
The Central Transport Interchange will then be built in Central Square - the base for the city's new bus station.
It has been designed around an enclosed public concourse, with a large waiting area.
There will also be walkways to the adjacent railway station, a bicycle hub, shops and restaurants.
Cardiff council said the site perimeter would start going up around "eyesore" Marland House on Tuesday, followed by preparatory works for the demolition, which is scheduled to be completed later this year.
Pedestrian access to the train station will change while the building work is carried out, with council staff on hand to help commuters.
"The removal of Marland House is another important milestone in the progress of the Central Square regeneration project that is quickly delivering a modern high-quality gateway into the city," the council added.
Central Square's overhaul will include new offices and shops and it will also provide the new home for BBC Wales' headquarters.
Meanwhile, St David's House, near the Principality Stadium, is also scheduled for demolition in 2017.
