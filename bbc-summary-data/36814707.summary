Batley Community Choir release Jo Cox MP memorial single

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A memorial single has been released in memory of MP Jo Cox, who was shot and stabbed to death a month ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Batley Community Choir has recorded a version of the 1979 Bette Midler song "The Rose".
All proceeds will be donated to the Jo Cox Fund, which supports three causes she had supported.
The Batley and Spen MP 41, was attacked before she was due to hold a constituency surgery in Birstall, West Yorkshire on 16 June.
Gary Skyrme, the choir's musical director, said: "The Rose is such a fitting song - it's about love and hope - and Jo, who was our own Yorkshire Rose, epitomised those values."
The three causes supported by the fund are the Royal Voluntary Service, Hope not Hate and the White Helmets.
An inquest into Mrs Cox's death was opened and adjourned last month after hearing she died from multiple stab and gunshot wounds.
Thomas Mair, 52, has appeared at the Old Bailey in central London charged with murdering Mrs Cox. He is also charged with grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon.
He was remanded in custody and is due to go on trial in November.
