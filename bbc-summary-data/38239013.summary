Cousins Keith Smith, 30, and Peter McMurray, 25, had earlier admitted forcing their way into Ekundayo Badamas' flat in Leith in August 2016.
During a struggle, Smith fired a warning shot with a rifle but instead hit McMurray in the leg.
Smith was jailed for seven years and eight months while McMurray was given six years and eight months.
They  appeared at the High Court in Glasgow having earlier admitted trying to rob 50 year-old Mr Badamas.
Lord Beckett told them: "This must have been terrifying for the victim and those living nearby."
Both will be monitored for a further five years on their release.
The previous hearing had heard how McMurray stabbed Mr Badamas with a knife during an initial struggle.
Smith then took a rifle from a bag and fired "an attempted warning shot".
However, he hit his cousin, who ended up needing several operations to remove bullet fragments.
Mr Badamas managed to bundle the pair out of his home.
Smith put the gun back in the holdall, but the rifle went off again as he had forgotten to use the safety catch.
McMurray was later found on the pavement writhing in pain. He claimed he had been shot by someone in a white car.
Smith was later arrested by armed police days later.
The court heard Mr Badamas needed 14 stitches to a head wound and has been left permanently scarred.
Det Insp Alan O'Brien, of Police Scotland, said: "The reckless actions of these men endangered lives and could have easily ended in tragic consequences.
"However, following a swift and effective investigation we successfully recovered the weapon as well as those involved and ensured they could not pose any further risk to the public."
