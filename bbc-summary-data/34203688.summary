Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 FK Qarabag

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham began their Europa League campaign with victory over Qarabag as Son Heung-min shone on his home debut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Spurs debutant Kieran Trippier conceded an early penalty, converted by Richard Almeida, before Son prodded in the first of his two goals.
The South Korean swept home minutes later after lovely footwork from the impressive Dele Alli.
Erik Lamela, unlucky to strike the post after an Alli through ball, added a third with a chipped finish.
Tottenham have scored only four goals in their first five matches of the Premier League season and Harry Kane, who is yet to find the net at club level this season, was on the bench.
Son started up front as the lone striker and any doubts over whether he could handle the role were addressed with gusto in the space of two first-half minutes.
The 23-year-old - signed for £22m from Bayer Leverkusen in August - was sharp to stab home amid static defending before finishing with confidence to put Spurs ahead.
However, that goal was all about Alli. Signed from MK Dons in January for an initial £5m fee, the 19-year-old showed brilliant footwork to turn in the box and create space for the pass - the high point of an excellent all-round performance.
Alli could have had a hat-trick of assists had Lamela's finishing been better, and he delighted the home fans with his trickery, determination and invention.
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino praised Son's performance and highlighted his value to the team.
"He scored twice and played one hour," said the Argentine.
"You can see I am very pleased with him, very happy. His adaptation to the club has been good from the beginning.
"I explained before the Sunderland game that Son can play like a striker. He can also play wider. He has the quality to play in different positions on the pitch."
It was not all brilliant from the home side. Had Qarabag been as clinical in attack as Spurs were sloppy at the back, the Azerbaijani champions might well have been celebrating themselves.
Danny Rose twice gave the ball away in dangerous positions but was spared first by Afran Ismayilov's wasteful finish before Toby Alderweireld cut out a dangerous ball across goal.
Trippier, making his Spurs debut, was at fault for the penalty, conceded by body-checking Ansi Agolli, and there was a familiar nervousness in the closing stages.
But Lamela's late finish effectively ended the contest before Alli saw a stabbed effort creep wide.
Tottenham's other Group J opponents, Anderlecht and Monaco, drew 1-1 in Belgium, with striker Lacina Traore equalising for the away side in the 85th minute.
Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli, speaking to BT Sport: "It was a solid performance from us. We were unfortunate to give away the first goal but it was a good overall display.
"They made us work for the win - they're not a bad side. They did well. I'm happy for Son that he got two goals and that I played a part. It's always good to help the team."
