Images have been released of a proposed new water park in Rhyl, which it is hoped will help rejuvenate the town's promenade.

Rhyl's landmark Sun Centre was demolished in September to pave way for the regeneration, despite calls to save it.
Denbighshire council approved plans for the new leisure facility in January.
The development will create 60 jobs and attract 350,000 additional visitors to the town every year, the council said.
The proposal is for a 12,916 sq ft (1,200 sq m) water space, with indoor and outdoor slides, a children's play area, climbing facilities and an outside splash pool, cafe terraces and a bar.
Detailed plans are now being prepared and will be submitted to the council's planning department in April.
If permission is granted, work will begin in September 2017, with the new facilities opening in early 2019.
As part of the redevelopment, Rhyl's skate park and paddling pool will be moved.
The council said it would consult with young people on the design of the park.
Council leader Hugh Evans said: "The development is an essential element of efforts to increase footfall in the town, create jobs and increase spend in the local economy.
"There is a lot of anticipation into how the new water park will look and we hope this really gives people a flavour of the ambitious and exciting development that is being proposed."
