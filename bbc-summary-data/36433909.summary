Former Swansea City boss Garry Monk has been appointed as Leeds United's new head coach.

The 37-year-old has signed a one-year rolling contract with the Championship club to replace Steve Evans, who left his position on Tuesday.
Monk was sacked by the Swans in December 2015 after 18 months in charge of the Premier League side.
He was a fighter as a player and now he's the same as a manager - as we saw when he did very well at Swansea City
"I want to be challenged and really get my teeth into a big project," he told the club website.
"That was the underlying factor throughout the whole process and that's the reason why I'm here today."
Monk, who spent 10 years at Swansea as a player, becomes the sixth full-time head coach appointed by Leeds owner Massimo Cellino since June 2014.
Evans guided the club to 13th in the Championship but did not have his contract renewed by the Italian.
MK Dons boss Karl Robinson and Bristol Rovers manager Darrell Clarke have both previously turned down the role.
Monk will be tasked with attempting to lead the club back to the top flight of English football for the first time since they were relegated 2004.
Leeds have already promised to give fans who buy a season ticket for 2016-17 a refund of up to 50% if they fail to reach the Championship play-offs.
Cellino said: "Garry is part of a new generation of coaches in England and has a lot of potential to develop, which is something we were targeting for the new season.
"I believe he's very suited to continuing the growth of our young and improving team. He will bring new strengths and a lot of energy to the squad.
"He was a fighter as a player and now he's the same as a manager - as we saw when he did very well at Swansea City. I feel he can really bring the best out of the team."
