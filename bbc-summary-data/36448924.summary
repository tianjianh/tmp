A spate of adder bites has been reported in north Wales, a health board has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said there had been "several cases" in the last few weeks.
Adders are the only wild venomous snakes found in the UK.
Dr Linda Dykes, of Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd emergency department, advised people to keep children and dogs out of sand dunes, stay away from high-risk areas and avoid touching the snakes.
"They're very quick, I don't think people realise how fast they are, and their bites can be very unpleasant and dangerous," she said.
