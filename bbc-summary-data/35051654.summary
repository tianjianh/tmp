Welsh language funding cut 'undermines commitment'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cuts in funding for the Welsh language have prompted campaigners to call for an emergency meeting with the first minister.

Support for the language will fall by 5.9% to £25.6m in the Welsh budget.
The Dyfodol i'r Iaith (Future for the Language) campaign group said it "totally undermines" ministerial promises on the matter.
But a Welsh government spokesperson said it remained "committed to securing the future of the language".
Dyfodol i'r Iaith chair Heini Gruffudd said: "We can never reach the goal of a bilingual Wales without the government's enthusiastic support.
"We will be pushing for a meeting with the first minister as soon as possible to secure a full explanation of the situation and to emphasise the importance of this funding to the growth of the Welsh language."
Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (the Welsh Language Society) also said it was concerned about the cuts and called for at least 1% of the Welsh budget - around £150m - to be spent on language projects.
A Welsh government spokesman said £1.2m had been allocated to support Welsh in the community, despite the overall cut.
"We are prioritising all activity on increasing the use of Welsh," the spokesman said.
"Funding alone however does not ensure that the language continues to thrive, and we will continue to work closely with partner organisations to secure a strong foundation for the language in the future."
