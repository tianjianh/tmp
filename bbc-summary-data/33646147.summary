Hampshire ram-raid victim calls for rural crime action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A businessman has claimed there is "mob rule" in parts of rural Hampshire after he was targeted by ram-raiders twice in the past 18 months.

Mike Garwood's business lost Â£25,000 last month when thieves reversed a stolen Land Rover into his agriculture store in Alton to steal chainsaws.
He wants more support for police to tackle rural crime after the gang escaped despite an alarm going off.
The Hampshire force said it was investigating.
Mr Garwood, who also said he had been burgled "numerous" times, managed to capture the gang of eight on CCTV but they fled in three vehicles before officers arrived.
He said: "They smashed in the doors, they stole whatever they could get. They then set fire to the Land Rover.
"It's really upsetting when you see it. It's very difficult to get the police here in time. It's mob rule isn't it?"
Mr Garwood has taken his case to Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner Simon Hayes.
Mr Hayes has lobbied MPs, warning that future government cuts could leave police dangerously stretched.
He said: "We set up a rural policing strategy in July 2014 to raise the profile of crime in rural areas, and also to raise the attention it gets from Hampshire Constabulary, and that is happening."
Hampshire Constabulary, which is yet to make an arrest over the ram-raids, said rural crime had fewer witnesses and offered greater opportunities for criminals to target isolated sites.
A spokesman said: "We have been working... to make significant improvements to our approach to rural policing and make the area a hostile place for criminals."
Insurers NFU Mutual reported an 8% rise in rural crime in the county in 2013, costing the local economy about Â£1m.
Figures out next month will show a further "alarming" rise in 2014 making Hampshire the third biggest victim in the UK, according to the insurers.
