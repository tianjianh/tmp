Scotland boss Gordon Strachan says he is not thinking about himself despite coming under increasing pressure following a 3-0 World Cup qualifying loss in Slovakia.

Scotland now sit fourth in Group F with four points from three games after Tuesday's defeat in Trnava.
"The people who I feel sorry for are the players," said Strachan. "They're the ones I'm thinking about.
"I'm proud of them. The second group you feel sorry for are the supporters."
Strachan believes Scotland can still compete for second place in the group, despite taking just one point from their October double-header against Slovakia and Lithuania, who earned a 1-1 draw at Hampden on Saturday.
The Scots face group leaders England at Wembley on 11 November.
"Form can change in a couple of weeks and this campaign is played over a year," said Strachan, who has been in charge since January 2013.
"Every time I get together with these guys, they rejuvenate me. We've given it our best shot in the last couple of games in terms of doing what we think is right, trying to pick the right side.
"I'm happy with the response from the lads every time. We'd like to be better off but we are one point off a play-off place."
Two goals from Robert Mak and a third by Adam Nemec have Slovakia victory.
Their first goal was controversial, with the visitors believing there was a foul by Jan Durica on Steven Fletcher prior to the move that ended with Mak's finish.
Mak and then Nemec were both afforded too much space in Scotland's penalty box as they increased the home side's advantage in the second half.
"Just when they need a break, the decision being on their side, it goes against them," Strachan said of the incident involving Fletcher.
He praised his players for being "brave on the ball" and for "trying to make chances" but the second goal proved crucial.
"It was uphill after that," said Strachan, who succeeded Craig Levein.
