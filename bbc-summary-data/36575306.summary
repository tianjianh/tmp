Australia v England: Andrew Johns helps Eddie Jones' squad

Australian rugby league great Andrew Johns helped England with their "attacking detail" as Eddie Jones' side trained before the third Test against the Wallabies in Sydney.

England are aiming to complete a 3-0 series whitewash this weekend.
"He has got a lot of knowledge, a lot he can teach people," Jones said.
"We have two outstanding young number 10s in Owen Farrell and George Ford and we want them to keep learning. They'll definitely learn things [from Johns]."
Australian Jones, who took England to train at his old club Randwick, added: "For those guys to have that lesson this afternoon is invaluable, they will remember it for the rest of their lives."
Earlier this year Jones recruited former Wallaby flanker George Smith as a breakdown consultant, while another former Australia player, Glen Ella, is working as England's skills coach on the tour.
Jones believes "100%" that rugby union players can learn from the 13-a-side game - and a more permanent role for former Australia Test half-back Johns is a possibility.
"Guys like Andrew Johns touched the ball 50 or 60 times in a game, had to fix defenders, knew when to drift and be straight, how to use your eyes, where to position your hands," Jones added.
"I've always admired his skills as a player, and we've been chatting for a while about the possibility of him coming in and doing a little bit of work."
Only flanker James Haskell and winger Jack Nowell were unable to take part as England trained in Sydney.
Haskell has a foot injury and is a major doubt to be fit for Saturday, but Jones says the Wasps forward has an "amazing capacity to absorb pain" and could yet be in contention.
Winger Nowell is going through return-to-play protocols after concussion, with Jones set to name his 23-man squad on Thursday.
"In terms of selection we always pick our best 23, and we will be doing that. It's the third Test of the series so we are going to need energetic, physically aggressive players."
