Louise Wright death: Cyclist 'dragged underneath lorry'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cyclist was killed when she was dragged under a lorry which failed to indicate, Nottingham Crown Court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Haywood, 30, of North Street, Langley Mill, denies causing 29-year-old Louise Wright's death by careless driving in Nottingham on 3 July 2014.
A jury was told Ms Wright was crossing the junction of Lower Parliament Street and Pennyfoot Street when she died.
She suffered "catastrophic" injuries as a result of the collision.

The court heard that after waiting 17 seconds at the traffic lights, Ms Wright moved forward and the lorry Mr Haywood was driving, turned left.
The prosecution alleges Mr Haywood did not indicate and he collided with the bicycle's rear wheel. Ms Wright then became stuck underneath the delivery vehicle.
Witness Lucinda Tuxford, who was driving her black Range Rover nearby, said she saw the cyclist and lorry close together at the lights before the impact.
She told the court: "I knew he had got her... but I didn't know where she was."
Ms Tuxford said she heard a "scraping" sound as the vehicle continued along the road and had tried beeping to get Mr Haywood's attention.
The court was told Mr Haywood "failed to indicate, failed to see Ms Wright while they were stationary at the lights and failed to respond to the collision soon enough to prevent her from being killed".
He denies the charges. The case continues.
