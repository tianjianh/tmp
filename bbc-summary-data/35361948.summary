A clock on the Isle of Man, which is believed to date back to the 16th Century, has been reinstalled after a four-year restoration project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Castle Rushen time piece had been in continual use in Castletown for more than 400 years until it was removed for repairs in 2011.
It was raised back into position by an abseiling team working with Manx National Heritage (MNH).
An MNH spokesman said the restoration project cost about ??5,000.
He said many of the parts had been replaced.
"In a turret clock such as this, the movement of the big wheels is transferred one to another by little ones called pinions.
"These pinions take a lot of the stress during the operation of the clock and tend to wear out.
"We replaced all six pinions with superior, bespoke cast iron leaf more in keeping with the age of the clock."
