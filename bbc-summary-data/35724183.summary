Pro12: Ospreys lose prop Aaron Jarvis to Clermont

Jarvis, 29, joined Ospreys from Bath in 2011 and has since won 16 Wales caps, but Moldovan Dmitri Arhip has often been preferred to him this season.
He will leave the club as Rhodri Jones joins from Scarlets.
Jarvis said: "I'll be giving it everything to ensure I finish on a high before moving on to a fresh challenge."
The Exeter-born player graduated to professional rugby via the Bath academy, and played for England Under-16s and U19s.
But he successfully pursued Wales honours via Ospreys, having been eligible because of his Merthyr Tydfil-born grandmother.
As well as losing his Ospreys place to Arhip, Jarvis has seen Scarlets' Samson Lee and Exeter's Tomas Francis rise above him at international level in the wake of Adam Jones' international retirement.
Jarvis is a member of Wales' 2016 Six Nations squad and made his last Test appearance against Australia at the 2015 World Cup.
He has started six Wales games, coming off the bench for the remainder of his caps.
