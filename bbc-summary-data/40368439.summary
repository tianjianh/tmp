Manchester homeless man John lends boots to diner 'in need'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A diner who was turned away from a restaurant for wearing sandals had his evening saved by a homeless man who offered him his boots.

Akbar Badshah, from Bradford, drove "for an hour" to celebrate his wife's birthday at Fazenda's in Manchester but was told he needed different footwear.
He turned to nearby rough sleeper John, who said he would be "happy" to help and lend him his boots.
Mr Badshah now intends to thank John with a meal at the restaurant.
Mr Badshah, who also wanted to break his Ramadan fast, told BBC Radio 5 live: "The [staff] said, 'unfortunately we have to turn you away - do you have any spare shoes?'
"I said, 'I don't, I've driven an hour to get here, I'm starving, I've not eaten all day.'"
He and his wife Rozmin - who had previously suggested her husband should wear shoes - left the restaurant and later struck up a conversation with John, who had recently received a new pair of boots from an outreach shelter.
"We had a little chat and I just asked John, 'What shoe size are you?'," Mr Badshah said.
"He said, 'I'm a 14,' and I said, 'I'm a size 9, I'm in a bit of predicament... can I borrow your shoes?'
"He goes, 'Yes certainly, I'll be happy to lend you my shoes.'"
The couple went on to enjoy their meal as planned, then returned the boots to John, who told Mr Badshah he had just wanted "to help another human being out".
Mr Badshah said John only accepted a Â£10 note in thanks "on the third attempt".
Another man, who overheard the conversation between the pair, then gave John a Â£50 note, which Mr Badshah said was "good karma".
Mr Badshah said he now hopes to return to the restaurant with John for a meal.
