American Johnson recovered from letting slip his three-shot overnight lead to card a five-under-par 67 and finish on 23 under.
Casey, who also went round in 67, was three shots back, with American Roberto Castro third on 17 under.
Defending champion and world number one Jason Day withdrew after eight holes with a lower back injury.
Scotland's Russell Knox, who shot a 71, finished tied for 17th on eight under and England's Justin Rose tied for 25th on six under after a 68.
Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell went round in level par to finish joint 42nd on three under.
Johnson's victory lifted him to the top of the FedEx Cup standings with one event to go.
It was the US Open champion's third win in his past eight tournaments and his 12th PGA title since 2008. Only Tiger Woods (18) has won more in that period, while Rory McIlroy has also claimed 12.
"I've got a lot of confidence in every part of my game - especially all the work I've put in on my wedges, which has really paid off this year - and this week a new putter that really worked," said Johnson.
After a second successive runner-up finish, Casey said he "ran into a buzz saw" against Johnson, who made six birdies and an eagle in his final round.
The top 30 players in the standings will now fight it out at the Tour Championship in Atlanta on 22-25 September for the $10m (Â£7.54m) winner's prize.
