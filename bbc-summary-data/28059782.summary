The Liverpool striker, 27, cannot take part in any football-related activity until the end of October.
He is not allowed to train with his club or enter a football stadium.
Yet La Liga side Barca, who already have Argentina forward Lionel Messi and Brazil playmaker Neymar, would consider signing Suarez for the right price.
Liverpool bought Suarez from Ajax for Â£25m in January 2011.
He missed the start of last season after being handed a 10-match ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013, but returned to score 31 Premier League goals as the Reds finished second in the table.
His performances also earned him the Professional Footballers' Association and Football Writers' player of the year awards.
Suarez was found guilty of biting Chiellini on the left shoulder during Tuesday's World Cup group match, which Uruguay won 1-0 to qualify for the last 16 in Brazil.
The forward denied the allegations, claiming Chiellini bumped into him.
But Fifa decided the former Ajax player had bitten the Italian defender, and banned him for four months as well as nine international matches.
Chiellini says the four-month ban given to Suarez is excessive. and has "no feelings of joy, revenge or anger against Suarez".
Suarez has also lost his role as a worldwide ambassador of online gambling firm 888poker, which said it had "decided to terminate its relationship" with "immediate effect".
It is the third time Suarez has been suspended for biting an opponent.
Prior to being banned for biting Ivanovic, he was suspended for seven games for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal in 2010.
Suarez has flown to Uruguay after leaving his team's hotel in Brazil.
A large group of people gathered at Carrasco International Airport near Montevideo on Thursday in the hope of welcoming him back to his homeland, but he is thought to have avoided the crowds.
