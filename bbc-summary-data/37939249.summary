[SN]TITLE[SN]
Same leak forced pilots to make two emergency landings at Edinburgh Airport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plane bound for Chicago which was forced to make an emergency landing at Edinburgh Airport had a fuel leak in the same place on the next flight despite it being "repaired".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The United Airlines flight from Heathrow was forced to land in Edinburgh on 12 July.
It landed safely and repairs were carried out.
However, when it took off the next day there was another leak on the same wing and a second emergency was declared.
The fuel filler cap was replaced after the first emergency but after the second emergency it was found a damaged O-ring in the over-wing fuelling port was causing the fuel leak.
The Air Accident Investigations Branch (AAIB) has described it as as a "serious incident".
The first flight had 130 people onboard and the plane was forced to dump fuel before landing.
However, the second flight the following day only had staff onboard so it was light enough to land without dumping fuel.
An investigation report said: "The aircraft maintenance records showed that the last heavy maintenance check was accomplished in June 2015, but there was no reference to maintenance having been performed on the over-wing fuelling port at that time, nor since."
