The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said it had received reports of several washing up.
Dr Peter Richardson from the charity said these sightings could be a sign more are coming. He asked people to report any sightings.
The last significant strandings of men-of-war was in 2009 and 2012.
He said: "With the earlier strandings in Ireland, these recent sightings could herald the arrival of more of the creatures as they get blown in from the Atlantic."
The Portuguese man-of-war is not a jellyfish but is closely related, and consists of a floating colony of tiny marine organisms living together.
Dr Richardson said a transparent purple float, the same shape as a Cornish pasty is visible on the water's surface with a blue, tentacle like polyp hanging below the water.
He said: "It's the tentacle-like polyps that can give an agonising and potentially lethal sting."
One was found at Portheras Cove in Cornwall, the same place as a sighting at the same time in 2015.
