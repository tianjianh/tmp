Aberdeen terror accused 'wants to become a doctor'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A final year medical student accused of terrorism charges has told a court he wants to clear his name and become a doctor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yousif Badri, 29, denies being involved in conduct "with the intention of committing acts of terrorism".
Mr Badri's flat in Aberdeen's Ashgrove Road was raided by police on 6 June 2013 - the day after he sat and passed his final medical exams.
The Aberdeen University student denies two charges under the Terrorism Act.
During the raid on Mr Badri's flat, his computer and an external hard drive were seized and hundreds of thousands of files were found.
They included dozens which featured troops being killed by snipers and an Al Qaeda training manual and magazines which included articles about bomb making.
Mr Badri claims he was researching the material in order to refute the ways it used the Koran to advocate violence.
At the High Court in Glasgow he was asked by defence QC Murdo Macleod: "What are your plans for the future?" and replied: "I'm here to explain my position and hopefully clear my name and I want to become what I've trained for eight years to be - a doctor."
Mr Badri was also asked how his arrest and trial had affected his family and said: "We are normally quite a happy family. This has been very difficult for my parents and for my sisters. It's been two years since I was arrested."
Under cross-examination by advocate depute Richard Goddard, prosecuting, he denied that he had tried to keep the files found by police secret.
He said: "It was on my computer. It was free for anyone to access. There was no password. I used Google to access all the material."
The court has heard that Mr Badri was arrested before he was able to graduate as a doctor.
The offences are said to have been carried out at two places in Aberdeen - Mr Badri's former flat in Ashgrove Road and in Berryden Retail Park.
His current address in Halifax, West Yorkshire, also features in the alleged offences.
Prosecutors claim that between 2007 and 2013 Mr Badri collected or made a record of information likely to be useful to a person "committing or preparing an act of terrorism".
This allegedly included footage of terror attacks as well as instructions on "urban assassinations" and "guerrilla tactics".
A  second charge alleges that Mr Badri "with the intention of committing acts of terrorism" engaged in various actions between 2006 and 2013.
Accusations listed in the indictment include a claim he had an "equipment list" for attending a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan.
He is also said to have possessed "advice for those involved in conducting terrorist attack planning operations".
The charge further alleges that he had documents, recordings and files containing "extreme ideology".
The trial continues.
