Police Scotland is investigating information passed to it by BBC Scotland in connection with the murder of Nairn banker Alistair Wilson.

The information was received by Radio Scotland's Beattie programme during coverage of the 12th anniversary of the killing.
The case remains unsolved, but police continue to actively investigate the shooting of the father-of-two.
Mr Wilson, 30, was shot at his home on 28 November 2004.
He later died in hospital.
Det Supt Gary Cunningham said: "The investigation into the murder of Alistair Wilson remains active and ongoing.
"We will continue to consider all forensic and investigative opportunities as well as appeal to anyone who has any information about Alistair's death which could help this inquiry to come forward.
"We remain absolutely committed to tracing the person responsible and remain in regular contact with Alistair's family through a family liaison officer and provide support and updates as the investigation continues."
Mr Wilson's killer - a stocky man with a baseball cap - handed him an envelope before shooting him with a German-made handgun.
A massive police inquiry was launched at the time.
The gun involved in the shooting was found in December 2004 in a drain on Seabank Road, Nairn, by council workers carrying out gully cleaning.
Forensic analysis identified it as the murder weapon but tests on the gun failed to extract any DNA.
