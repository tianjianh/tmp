Savita Halappanavar death: Hospital staff disciplined

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nine hospital staff have been disciplined over the death of pregnant woman Savita Halappanavar in the Republic of Ireland in October 2012.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old was 17 weeks' pregnant and miscarrying when she was admitted to University Hospital Galway.
She had asked for a termination, but staff refused. Days later, she died as a result of septic shock from an E coli infection.
A review found 21 out of 30 staff had no case to answer over her death.
The Health Service Executive (HSE) said warnings, including written warnings, were issued to some of the nine staff at University College Galway who were disciplined.
Others received training and mentoring.
Last October, a report on her death and related issues found there was a failure to provide the most basic elements of care in her case.
The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) found there were many missed opportunities, that if acted on might have changed the outcome for her.
It said there was a failure to recognise she was developing an infection and to act on her deteriorating condition.
It found that University Hospital Galway did not have effective arrangements to regularly record and monitor her condition and that the management of the delivery of maternity services was not consistent with best practices.
