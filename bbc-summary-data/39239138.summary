It is understood a prisoner clambered onto the pitched roof of one of the house blocks at HMP Guys Marsh, took off his clothes and set fire to them.
The fire is believed to have damaged the roof and inmates in the block were taken to a secure area.
The prisoner has been brought down from the roof and the Prison Service said there was no risk to the public.
BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it is believed the prisoner was drunk and was protesting at changes to the prison regime.
A source said the protest started around 17:00 GMT and hours later the prisoner started ripping off roof tiles before setting his clothes alight.
The inmate was treated by paramedics as a precautionary measure but had not been arrested.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "There is no danger to the public and staff are working to bring the incident to a safe conclusion as quickly as possible."
The emergency services were called to a report of a fire at the prison at around 20:00 GMT on Friday.
Officers attended and discovered the fire on the roof of a building within the prison, which is believed to have been started deliberately.
A total of 64 prisoners were evacuated from the affected area and were being held in a secure zone within the prison overnight.
Dorset Police said all prisoners and staff were accounted for and that the South Western Ambulance Service was also at the scene as a precaution.
One prisoner who was reported to be on the roof of the prison building during the incident has been brought back down to safety and is being checked over by paramedics as a precaution.
Supt Caroline Naughton said: "This was an isolated incident. An investigation is now under way to establish the exact cause of the fire. These enquiries remain ongoing.
"We would like to reassure members of the community that there is no immediate risk to those living in the surrounding area and that the incident is under control."
At the prison's last inspection, managers and staff at Guys Marsh were found to have "all but lost control".
It was described as being in "crisis" with gangs found to be operating openly in the prison.
In the 2015 report, levels of violence linked to the drug "Spice" and alcohol were "very high" with inmates living in fear.
