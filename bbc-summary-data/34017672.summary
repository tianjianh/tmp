Michael Barrymore: Pool death victim's father welcomes legal action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The father of a man who died at Michael Barrymore's home has welcomed the ex-TV presenter's decision to sue police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Lubbock, 31, was found dead in the pool at Mr Barrymore's former home in Roydon, Essex, in 2001.
The former star, who was questioned but not charged, is taking action against Essex Police for damages to his reputation and career.
Mr Lubbock's father Terry said the legal action was a "gigantic opportunity" to expose the truth.
He has campaigned to find out how his son died and had 36 complaints and allegations upheld by an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) inquiry.
Post-mortem tests found Mr Lubbock had suffered severe internal injuries indicating sexual assault and his bloodstream contained ecstasy, cocaine and alcohol.
No-one has been charged over his death.
"I do feel that it's my chance now to speak out and say the whole thing was covered up or... the police didn't do their job properly at the start," Mr Lubbock told the BBC.
Essex Police said: "The IPCC considered the investigation generally competent and well considered.
"The report released in 2009 made a number of recommendations which were accepted and acted upon at the time.
"As civil proceedings are currently on-going it would be inappropriate for Essex Police to comment further."
Mr Barrymore's solicitors declined to comment.
The IPCC found while there were failings in Essex Police's handling of the case it was "not borne out" that "the entire investigation was incompetent".
The commission upheld a number of the Lubbock family's complaints, including that the scene was not effectively preserved by police, that unauthorised people were allowed to stay at the scene and that the investigation was suspended prematurely.
