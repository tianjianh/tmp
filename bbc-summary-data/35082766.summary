An air conditioning unit is believed to have caught fire, police said. No injuries were reported.
Chiltern Railways services leaving the station were temporarily suspended.
Light smoke could be seen on the concourse and appeared to be coming from platform one, BBC World Service presenter Danny Cox said.
The station was evacuated shortly after 21:00 GMT and five fire crews were called to the station.
"There's been nothing but calm from the start", Mr Cox said.
Chiltern Railways services to the Home Counties and West Midlands were affected until the early hours of Saturday, and have now returned to normal.
Twenty-five firefighters from Paddington, Soho, Kensington and Euston fire stations attended the incident.
The fire service initially said up to 700 people had been evacuated but later confirmed the number was 500.
London Fire Brigade station manager Paul Hobbs said: "The fire was affecting one of the train's carriages but crews worked quickly to put it out."
An investigation into the cause of the fire has been launched.
