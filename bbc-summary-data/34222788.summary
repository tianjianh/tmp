[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dingwall rapist to considered for lifelong restriction order

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Appeal judges have ruled that a colleague used the incorrect legal procedure when sentencing a rapist to life in jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lady Paton, Lady Dorrian and Lord Eassie concluded that Lord Uist was wrong to hand John MacIntosh, 47, a discretionary life sentence last year.
They have ordered that MacIntosh, of Dingwall, be assessed for an order for lifelong restriction (OLR).
MacIntosh attempted to rape a nine-year-old girl and raped three women.
An OLR means that he would only be released from custody when the parole board decides he no longer poses a threat to the community.
MacIntosh was sentenced at the High Court in Aberdeen in August last year.
Lord Uist said MacIntosh, who had previously been jailed for seven years for having sex with 13 and 14-year-old girls, was a "sexual fiend" who targeted vulnerable females.
The offences heard at the High Court in Aberdeen happened in the Inverness and Dingwall areas between 1996 and 2004.
