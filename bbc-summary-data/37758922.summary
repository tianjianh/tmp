Scottish Cup: Forfar Athletic 0-1 Edinburgh City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh City won their first game of the season as Ross Allum's second-half strike knocked Forfar Athletic out of the Scottish Cup at Station Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two sides had drawn 1-1 at the same venue on Saturday in League Two, when Danny Denholm's equaliser cancelled out an opener from Ouzy See.
But this time there was no way back for the League Two leaders, who have now gone six games without a win.
City are away to League One side East Fife in the third round.
The Edinburgh side had gone 17 league and cup games without a win since beating East Stirlingshire in the play-off to win promotion from the Lowland League.
