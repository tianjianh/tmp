The children's bathing pool closed by the winter's storms is due to reopen in time for the summer holidays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three Victorian seawater pools were badly damaged by large granite boulders thrown up to 40ft (12m) by the waves.
The ladies' pool has already reopened and the children's pool is due to open next month.
Culture and leisure minister Mike O'Hara said the work, involving stonemasonry and barrier replacement, cost about Â£15,000.
He said there was currently no repair plan for the gents' pool, which suffered more damage.
Deputy O'Hara said: "It's a completely different thing and something we're still looking at... we're waiting on a full survey to be completed."
Alison, who takes her two young children to the pools, said: "It's good that they're sorting it out and we'll be able to use it again shortly. In the mean time we'll just come down the bigger pool.
"It's good to come down after school. It's nice and quick for us and sometimes you just like a nice, quick sand-free alternative to the beach."
Gosia, a regular sunbather at the pools, described them as a good place to meet friends and perfect for families.
