Mr Hussain, 33, was found dead the day after he made an emergency call asking for an ambulance.

Staffordshire Police said following the stabbing at the couple's flat in Bromley Court, Hanley on the evening of 30 May, Mr Hussain had made a 999 call asking for an ambulance.

Miss Butler remained inside the flat all night, police said, refusing to answer the door to ambulance staff or police.
Emergency services staff were not able to get into the flat until the afternoon of the following day where Mr Hussain's body was found.
Butler pleaded guilty to manslaughter at Leicester Crown Court and was jailed for six years and three months.
Det Ch Insp David Giles of Staffordshire Police said: "Their relationship was volatile and the court heard how domestic abuse was a toxic feature which undoubtedly contributed to an unhealthy relationship and ultimately this untimely death.
"Miss Butler presented evidence to the court in which she described how living in an abusive relationship had had a corrosive effect on her mental health."
