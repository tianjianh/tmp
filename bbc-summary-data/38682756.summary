The 19-year-old has played four times for Rovers' first team, after making his debut in August against Burton.
"He's a left-footed centre-half that's been blooded into their first team so it's not much of a gamble," boss Shaun Derry told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"With the loss of Tom Dallison and Josh Coulson out for the rest of the season we knew that position was paramount."
