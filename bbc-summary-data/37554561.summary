Matt Sherratt: Wales call surprised Cardiff Blues backs coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues backs coach Matt Sherratt admits he was surprised by his call-up to join Rob Howley's Wales coaching team for the autumn internationals.

Sherratt has the attack coach role while ex-Wales nine Howley is in charge when Warren Gatland is on 2017 British and Irish Lions tour duty.
"I'll be honest and say it was a surprise," he said.
Sherratt, 40, is in his first season at Cardiff Arms Park after joining from Bristol in the summer.

Sherratt added: "I've come in to do my best for Cardiff Blues and am committed to do that, so it was a bonus for me.
"I'm looking forward to working with the Welsh players and the coaching staff, but continue to contribute fully to the Cardiff Blues too."
That means helping the Blues prepare for the first Welsh derby of the season against Ospreys on Friday.
The Blues had their unbeaten start to the season ended by Leinster in a tense 13-16 defeat on Saturday, and face an Ospreys team who have lost on their last two outings - away to Ulster and Leinster.

The Swansea-based region have won their last 10 games against the Blues, and Sherratt has been impressed by their defence which denied Ulster a try in a 9-7 defeat in Belfast.
"It's a big challenge," he added.
"Defence has been a strength of theirs for a few years - it's changed slightly.
"It's fairly similar to Leinster's defence and that was the toughest we've faced this season.
"I'm massively looking forward to a first Welsh derby and come team run on Thursday and Friday, I expect we'll see a difference in the players then."
