[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dorset lifeboat station has had an overwhelming response to an appeal to raise money for its new boathouse.

The RNLI station at Swanage started a two-year appeal in 2013 to raise £200,000 towards the building needed to house a new larger lifeboat.
The station said more than double the amount had been raised in response.
Swanage RNLI operation manager Neil Hardy said: "We've had the generosity of the local community and various benefactors; it's just great."
The money from the appeal will avoid the station having to use central funding from the charity for the build.
The £3.5m lifeboat station, which is being rebuilt on the site of the original boathouse in Peveril Point Road, is due for completion in the summer.
In April the crew will get a Shannon class lifeboat costing £1.5m to replace its current Mersey class lifeboat Robert Charles Brown.
The lifeboat is being kept on a mooring point while the new station is being built.
