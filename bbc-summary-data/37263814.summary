[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 1-2 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nathan Thomas scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner as Hartlepool came from behind to beat Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas struck an unstoppable 25-yard curling effort past goalkeeper Artur Krysiak having earlier drawn the visitors level after Matt Butcher had given the Glovers the lead.
Yeovil were booed off at full time following a fifth straight league defeat that leaves them in the League Two relegation zone.
Having dominated possession, Yeovil took a deserved lead after 56 minutes when Butcher found time and space in the box to turn and shoot past Trevor Carson from Matt Dolan's corner.
Pools responded and equalised 11 minutes later when Carson launched a long kick upfield that somehow evaded the Glovers defence and left Thomas through on goal and with an easy finish.
The game looked as though it was petering out into a draw entering time added on, but Thomas had the final say as he decided the match with a superb strike.
