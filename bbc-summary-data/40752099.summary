Thousands of people from across Scotland commemorated the centenary of the Battle of Passchendaele in World War One.

The conflict claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, including many thousands of Scots.
About 200 of their descendents travelled to Belgium for commemorations at the Menin Gate Memorial in Ypres.
There was also a parade in Crieff, supported by armed forces charity Legion Scotland.
Officially known as the Third Battle of Ypres, Passchendaele was fought from 31 July to 6 November 1917 in the West Flanders region of northern Belgium.
It is remembered as one of the harshest battles of the war, with heavy rain contributing to the Allies gaining only five miles of ground in three months.
About 325,000 Allied troops and 260,000 Germans died in the battle, which poet Siegfried Sassoon described as "hell".
There was a massive Scottish presence at Passchendaele, with more than 50 battalions from Scotland fighting.
Descendants of those who died attended commemorations in Belgium on Sunday.
A service for them included the traditional bugle call and wreath laying as well as music by the National Youth Choir of Scotland.
A short reception followed with live performances from artists including Dame Helen Mirren, Alfie Boe, and the cast of War Horse.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney represented the Scottish government at the commemorations.
In Perthshire, more than 150 veterans and serving soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland paraded through Crieff in memory of those who died.
Also taking part in the parade was a group of cyclists, representing The Black Watch (3 SCOTS).
They arrived in the town having cycled more than 600 miles to Passchendaele.
Black Watch soldiers were involved in the Battle of Passchendaele, which is one of the many reasons why Crieff has such strong connections to the conflict.
The cyclists carried their bikes as a tribute to their fallen comrades from another era.
Also attending was James McCabe, from Crieff, whose great-uncle, David Watson McDonald McCabe, fought and was wounded during the 2nd Battle of Ypres which took place two years before Passchendaele.
He returned to the battlefield, but was seriously wounded and died as the Battle of Passchendaele loomed.
David McCabe's great-great-great nephew David McInally was on parade as a member of the Royal Regiment of Scotland band.
A wreath-laying ceremony was attended by Lieutenant General Sir Alistair Irwin KCB CBE, the President of Legion Scotland and Poppyscotland.
Festivals Crieff Chairman Alastair McClymont said: "There's a real buzz about the town at the moment and we are delighted to have Legion Scotland's significant input to the launch of our Crieff Remembers programme.
"As well as today's wonderful parade, we also have the official opening of a truly unique exhibition of First World War material loaned from local families."
The exhibition is being held at Strathearn Artspace, Comrie Street, until Saturday 12 August.
