Leeds, who are now without a win in four games, took a deserved lead with 20 minutes left as Chris Wood netted his first goal since 29 December.
However, Giuseppe Bellusci failed to catch Sebastian Polter as he burst into the box and bundled over the German.
Chery, who has scored six goals in his last nine outings, made no mistake from the spot.
The hosts did much of the early running and the recalled Stuart Dallas, Wood and Mustapha Carayol all missed half chances.
But the first half offered few clear-cut opportunities and Junior Hoilett was forced to wait until just before the break to register QPR's first effort, as his curling strike went over the bar.
Steve Evans' side made a marked improvement after the break and when Luke Murphy floated the ball into the box, the visitors' keeper Alex Smithies' hesitation proved costly as Wood nipped in.
After a calamitous ending to the weekend's match against Rotherham, Leeds looked to be heading for three points but Bellusci was once again at the centre of poor decision making that allowed QPR to level with three minutes to play.
Both sides remain mid-table with the threat of relegation and hope of promotion having disappeared with six games remaining.
Leeds boss Steve Evans: "Giuseppe Bellusci is a very good player and has had a couple of games where he's done things you would expect better of him.
"I tell you what he is, he's a man. He walked into the dressing room and was very humble to everyone. He did the same at Rotherham. He's an honest man who doesn't take things lightly.
"We have a tight-knit dressing room where we support all our players.
"I would (pick him with confidence) on Saturday. There are other good centre-halves who have cost me more."

QPR boss Jimmy Floyd-Hasselbaink: "The game was not how I expected it to be. We had two strikers on the pitch, they changed their side.
"We thought they would play with two strikers but they made it difficult for us to be fluent and have passes and be dominant. Fair play to them.
"Nobody had any chances in the first half, nobody dominated the play, my goalkeeper and their goalkeeper did not have much to do. I always felt we were going to finish stronger than them in the last 15 minutes."
