The Renegades had posted 222-4 in Australia's Twenty20 competition but their rivals chased it down with 223-8.
Ben McDermott, 22, set up the victory with 114 from 52 balls for Hobart.
Needing 16 off the last over to win, Broad hit 11 from four balls - including two fours before a single off the last ball in a dramatic finish.
Victory boosts the Hurricanes' chances of reaching the semi-finals. They move up to fifth in the standings, with the top four progressing.
