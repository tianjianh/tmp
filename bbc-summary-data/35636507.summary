"Let's sit down in the summer and see where we go from there," the 58-year-old Welshman told BBC WM.
"The most important thing is to keep the club in the Premier League," added Pulis, who signed a two-and-half-year deal when he took over in January 2015.
Following Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round defeat at Reading, Albion are 14th, eight points above the relegation zone.
Having maintained his record of having never been relegated last season, the former Stoke City and Crystal Palace boss looks likely to help keep the Baggies clear of the drop again this term.
But he has been criticised by fans for his team's playing style. And, according to former Albion striker and fellow Welshman John Hartson, speaking on Talksport on Tuesday morning, he has also been worn down by the long-drawn-out internal conflict over Saido Berahino's future.
Asked whether he would consider his own future, he reiterated: "Let's get through the season and then see were we go from there. I'll sit down with Jeremy and we'll take it from there then."
