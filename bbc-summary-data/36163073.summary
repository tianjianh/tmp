Dates revealed for Europa League and promotion/relegation play-offs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The dates have been revealed for the Irish League's upcoming Europa League and promotion/relegation play-offs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cliftonville will face Ballymena United, if the latter finish seventh, and Coleraine will play Glentoran in the Europa League semi-finals on 6 May.
The final will be played on Tuesday 10 May, with a 19:45 BST kick-off.
The promotion/relegation play-off will be played over two legs in early May, the exact dates depending on which Championship One club will contest it.
If Ards or Institute are involved, the first leg will take place on Friday 6 May and the second leg on Tuesday 10 May, because both sides have reached the Intermediate Cup final on 2 May.
If Larne are in the play-off, the first leg will be played on Tuesday 3 May, with the second leg three days later.
Any of four Premiership clubs, Portadown, Ballinamallard United, Warrenpoint Town or Carrick Rangers, could be involved in the play-off, depending on the results of Saturday's final set of fixtures in Section B.
Ballymena need to beat Portadown in their final match of the regular season and hope that Dungannon Swifts, who currently lie seventh but have not applied for a European licence, fail to overcome Warrenpoint Town, if they are to take part in the play-offs.
If they fail to finish above the Swifts, Cliftonville will advance straight to the final and will enjoy home advantage against either Coleraine or Glenavon.
Home advantage in each of the Europa League ties will be given to the club with the highest ranking following 38 league games.
