The 29-year-old former Southport player has signed a deal he was offered by the club in February.
"I know it's been on the table for a while, but it wasn't a case of dragging things out," Rutherford said.
"I just wanted to carry on with the football side, then get it over the line, once the season had finished."
Rutherford follows Mark Carrington and goalkeeper Chris Dunn in signing new contracts with the north Wales club.
Manager Dean Keates has also made his first signing of the close season with versatile full-back James Hurst joining on a one-year contract.
