Review of 2014: England's big features

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Kegworth air disaster, lost football grounds and the maze of tunnels beneath London. These were just some examples of the in-depth journalism produced by BBC News England during 2014.

The first Zeppelin attacks of WW1, the rise of the parking vigilante and the discovery that pagans had been commonplace in medieval churches were also featured.
Take a look at some of the articles you may have missed:
Kegworth air disaster: Plane crash survivors' stories
"Your brain says: 'What? It can't be. It can't be.' Then you think: 'I'm about to die."
In January, survivors of the Kegworth air disaster told their harrowing tales of the day a Boeing 737 crashed into the M1 in 1989.
Forty-seven people were killed but a remarkable number of passengers survived.
For many, a long recovery followed, with some still suffering from the effects today.
What lies beneath London?
A rare glance into the pitch black labyrinth of unseen tunnels below England's capital revealed deep-level air raid shelters and the city's railway of the future.
A trip with the air ambulance service also provided telling insights into the team's daily life-and-death pressures, as well as some stunning images of London's skyline.
What happened to England's abandoned mansions?
From a hall used as a military headquarters during World War Two to a stately home used as a girls' school, England's impressive empty mansions have colourful pasts.
Despite many looking lonely and rundown now, with mysterious goings-on, a plasterer bludgeoned to death and devastating fires causing havoc in years gone-by, every mansion has a memorable tale.
Halloween: England's strange and ancient winter rituals
England has many quirky and barmy traditions including men carrying flaming barrels of tar through a crowded street, apple wassailing and traditional plays involving sword fights.
Across the country, traditions to ward off evil spirits are as big and popular as ever.
Mysteries of medieval graffiti in England's churches
Medieval graffiti of straw kings, pentagrams, crosses and ships offer a tantalising glimpse into life in the Middle Ages.
The inscriptions have been found in churches in East Anglia and some have been linked to pagan beliefs, still surviving after centuries of Christianity.
What happened to England's lost football grounds?
Many former football grounds may be gone but they are certainly not forgotten by die-hard fans.
From Chelsea fans living in a stand at London rivals Arsenal's former Highbury ground to meeting Sir Alex Ferguson at Oxford United, this feature was full of colourful stories and fans' memories.
The public response was so great a follow-up - or second leg, if you will - was quickly delivered.
The rise of the parking vigilantes
A succession of websites, blogs, Facebook pages and Twitter feeds have sprung up seeking to expose the worst parking examples across the country.
Those behind the campaigns started them after getting fed-up of "horrific, dangerous, selfish and illegal parking".
World War One: How the German Zeppelin wrought terror
The airships killed more than 500 people and injured more than a thousand in the east of the country during World War One.
Doris Cobban, 102, from Bedfordshire, said she remembered seeing a Zeppelin over London which looked "like a huge cigar".
Bayeux Tapestry: The islanders who finished the final scenes
Since the tapestry was "rediscovered", the original final scenes of arguably the most famous piece of embroidery in history have been missing.
That was until a team of Alderney stitchers worked tirelessly for 12 months to finish the final scenes which have since been displayed next to the original tapestry in Normandy.
Why does Bristol never build anything?
Despite Bristol being deemed "one of the best cities to live in Britain" and European Green Capital 2015, one thing it has failed to deliver are major buildings.
Rival city Cardiff has a string of projects under its belt, but for Bristol, two stadiums and a concert venue have failed to get past the planning phase. Why?
Tour de France: The disastrous 1974 Plymouth stage
The competition's first visit to the UK was fraught with problems.
One rider arriving in England claimed they "were treated like illegal immigrants" by custom officials and had lengthy delays when they tried to leave the country.
The insipid route of the stage was also unpopular with riders, one of whom pointed out the A38 Plympton bypass was hardly the Champs Elysees.
