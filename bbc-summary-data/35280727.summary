The 22-year-old, who can play as a winger or full-back and has joined Batley Bulldogs from Doncaster for the 2016 season, is the 12th winner of the Dave Valentine Award.
It is based on performances in Scotland's 2015 international campaign.
Scotland head coach Steve McCormack said: "Davie was outstanding for us."
Scott started playing rugby league at Easterhouse Panthers and joined Featherstone Rovers in 2013.
He was loaned to Doncaster, made the switch permanent in 2014 and will play in the second-tier English Championship for Batley in the coming season.
Scott made 28 appearances for Doncaster, scoring two tries and 36 conversions.
He played for Scotland in the 2013 World Cup and their recent European Cup campaigns.
"He is the perfect example to all the kids coming through, showing there is a pathway for teenage players in Scotland," added McCormack.
