The rescuers shouted: "She's alive!" as they carried the girl, named Giulia, from the ruins of a building in the town of Pescara del Tronto.
Giulia is now being looked after at a nearby hospital.
More than 240 people have been killed following a 6.2-magnitude earthquake that happened early on Wednesday morning.
