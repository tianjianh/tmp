The uncapped Bristol City striker, 21, is the surprise name in the 29-man squad that will travel to Portugal on 23 May.
"I found out when everyone else found out," Burns said.
"It was a bit of a shock when I found out. I was actually having my hair cut at the time."
Burns added: "I had texts from my dad and my mum saying 'have you seen the squad announcement?'"
Manager Chris Coleman will name his final 23-man squad for the tournament on Tuesday, 31 May.
Burns scored one goal in 17 appearances for City before ending the season on loan at Fleetwood Town, where he netted five goals in 14 games.
Cardiff-born Burns says his call-up to the Wales training squad is a "massive opportunity" to impress Coleman and his coaching staff.
"If I do well in the training camp in Portugal hopefully I can book my seat book my seat on the plane to France," Burns told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I think it's on everyone's mind as soon as they've seen the squad.
"All 29 players will be thinking they've got a chance to get to France.
"I don't think I'm a million miles away.
"I've got to make sure that when I do go to the training camp that I work hard and knuckle down and show the gaffer what I can do.
"I know a couple of the young lads who are in the squad like George Williams, Tom Lawrence and Jonny Williams.
"I've played with them before in the Wales set-up
"It just shows Wales are building a pathway from the Under-21 set-up into the first team, which is great."
