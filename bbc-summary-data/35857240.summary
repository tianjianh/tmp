The 27-year-old pulled away from the chasing group to catch and then pass long-time leader Jolanda Neff (Stockli Pro) in the last 3 kms in Italy.
She crossed the line one second in front of American Boels-Dolmans team-mate Megan Guarnier with Neff third.
It is the fifth successive victory for Armitstead in races she has completed.
The road race world champion began her season by winning Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and followed it up with victory in the opening race of UCI World Tour season - the Italian one-day classic Strade Bianche in Tuscany.
She then abandoned the second World Tour event after around 50 km of the Ronde van Drenthe, apparently feeling sick.
But back to full health in Italy, Armitstead controlled the 112 km race on an undulating route that made for aggressive racing.
The peloton split and reformed several times, before Amitstead and a seven-strong elite group, that also included Dutch World Tour standings leader Anna van der Breggen (Rabobnk - Liv), broke away on the penultimate lap.
Neff made a break for victory, building up a 30-second lead at one stage, but Armitstead and Guarnier gradually reeled her in and the Swiss rider offered no resistance on the finishing straight.
Armitstead now sits top of the World Tour standings, ahead of Van der Breggen who finished sixth.
The World Tour consists of 18 races throughout the year and is a mix of one-day and stage races. It replaces the World Cup which was a series of 10 one-day races.
