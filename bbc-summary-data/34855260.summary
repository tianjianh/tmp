The former Strictly Come Dancing host underwent a procedure on an abdominal aortic aneurysm last Thursday.
"It is anticipated, given the minimally invasive nature of this operation, he will make a speedy recovery," his manager said.
The 87-year-old's condition was discovered after he had extensive medical checks following a recent fall.
"It is not connected in any way with the fall itself from which Sir Bruce has made a full recovery - indeed, he recorded Strictly Come Dancing's Children In Need Special with Tess Daly, which aired last Friday," his manager added.
Sir Bruce teamed up with Daly for the charity special which saw Call The Midwife star Laura Main and professional dancer Brendan Cole win on the night.
The surgery is not expected to prevent the veteran entertainer from fronting the show's upcoming festive edition.
A BBC rep said: "We anticipate that Bruce will still very much be a part of the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special."
