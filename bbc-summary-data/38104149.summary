Wilfried Bony: Stoke boss Mark Hughes reveals China sale clause

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke manager Mark Hughes says on-loan striker Wilfried Bony has a clause in his contract allowing him to be sold to Chinese Super League clubs in January.

However, Hughes expects the 27-year-old, who joined the club on a season-long deal from Manchester City in the summer, to stay with the Potters.
"I think that may well be true," said Hughes when asked about the clause.
"A lot of things have come to the fore to make that happen, not least that Wilf needs to want to go himself."
He added: "I don't think he will want to. I think he sees himself very much as a Premier League player this year and in the years to follow."
Bony's two goals for Stoke in 10 appearances so far this season came in a win over his former club Swansea.
Hughes also confirmed the Potters do not have a set fee agreed with City to sign the Ivory Coast international on a permanent basis as part of the loan deal.
"Sometimes you can do that but that's clearly not what Manchester City wanted," said the 53-year-old Welshman.
"We're delighted that he's here until the end of the season in our view. We'll look at it again."
