Four in running for £50m A96 contract in Moray

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four bidders are in the running for a £50m contract to design a stretch of the proposed A96 dual carriageway in Moray.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-mile section runs from Hardmuir, near Nairn, to Fochabers.
It is expected the contract will be awarded in the spring, with the next stage of route assessment then getting under way.
The work forms part of a wider project to build 88 miles of dual carriageway between Inverness and Aberdeen.
Infrastructure Secretary Keith Brown said: "This major contract marks a further milestone towards the dualling of the A96 with all the investment and improvements that will bring to the Highlands and north east of Scotland."
Last year, a £30m contract was awarded to design 19 miles of dual carriageway between Inverness and Nairn.
