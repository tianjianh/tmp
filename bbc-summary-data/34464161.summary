Wales: Football? Rugby? Or can it be both?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The debate over whether Wales is a football or rugby nation has intensified ahead of Saturday's huge day for Welsh sport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh rugby team takes on Australia to see who they face in the Rugby World Cup quarter final.
Later, Wales' footballers aim to pick up the point they need against Bosnia to qualify for their first major tournament in 58 years.
When you look at attendances for the national teams over the last year or so, the rugby team has been playing in front of sell-out crowds at the 74,500-capacity Millennium Stadium for the Six Nations.
Up until the two previous Euro 2016 qualifiers at the Cardiff City Stadium, which holds 33,000, it has been easy to get a ticket for the football.
But now that is not the case with Tuesday's Andorra match also sold out. There was even talk of switching the final group games to the Millennium Stadium, where Wales have played before.
With rugby winning the national game statistically, when it comes to the domestic games, football is the winner.
Last season, Premier League Swansea City and Championship side Cardiff City both had average home attendances for league matches of just over 20,000, with the Swans' Liberty Stadium home regularly sold out.
For the four rugby regions, their combined Pro12 league average following was almost 28,000 but the Ospreys had the highest single average at just over 8,300.
But what do people think? We asked a footballer and a rugby player for their views.
Football or rugby - or both?
"At this moment in time, there's a real feel good factor around football but I would probably have to say there's more rugby fans in Wales than football fans.
"Historically the rugby team has excelled in terms of what it has achieved and the players it produces but I don't think you can ignore the fact football has produced some of the best players in the world.
"With Wales, we've had barren years. I've played in front of 5,400 at the Millennium Stadium and in front of 74,500. The football fans come out when the national team is doing well.
"I think I share a lot of people's opinion that rugby is the number one sport in Wales.
"But everybody will get behind the national team if they are doing well, particularly the football.
"I remember watching Wales [football] 18 months ago in front of 11,000 and now you can't get a ticket. If the team is not performing, the fans don't turn up and I can't blame them.
"I just feel with the rugby even if the team is not doing well they will still come and support the national team."
International rugby attendances are bigger than those at football, but it is the other way around domestically. Why?
"When you've got a Premier League side in Swansea and Cardiff who have come up and down in recent years there's people who are going to be supporting the football.
"I know a lot of rugby supporters who support the Ospreys have swapped their season tickets for the Swans.
"In terms of right now, football has overtaken the regions."
Football or rugby - or both?
"Why does there have to be a debate? For me it's always going to be there especially when we are looking forward to Saturday when both sides are looking to be successful in huge competitions.
"It always makes me laugh when this debate comes up. As a kid I grew up playing both. I know most rugby fans will watch football and most football fans will watch the rugby.
"For some reason the rugby international matches grab the nation more and there's only a certain number of games per year so it brings people together."
He said that the success of Welsh rugby during the 1970s had led to the view of the nation as a rugby stronghold.
"If you look at what gives the country a lift, like Wales beating England the other week, then it's rugby," he said.
"If the football qualifies for France, there's more people playing soccer [at grassroots level] and when you are looking at numbers [in terms of support and participation in the game] it's probably football."
International rugby attendances are bigger than those at football, but it is the other way around domestically. Why?
"If you look at [attendances for] Cardiff and Swansea [football games], it's crazy and it's massive compared to the [rugby] regions.
"The rugby would love those numbers [of fans] who participate in football and maybe it's the spectacle and occasion.
"It's not a great spectacle [in rugby regional games]. They've got to ramp it up otherwise I can't see [the attendances] improving.
"But sometimes it comes down to success. Wales are doing well in football and the crowds are coming out. Fans are very fickle."
