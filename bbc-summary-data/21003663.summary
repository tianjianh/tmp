Mr Schreyer, who previously worked for Audi and Volkswagen,  will streamline the design operation and seek synergy between the two Korean brands.
Three weeks ago the German was named Kia's first foreign president.
Hyundai's Woong-Chul Yang said the move was "imperative to secure long-term competitiveness" and to help "enhance our brand value".
Kia was bought by Hyundai Motor in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis, and has been expanding sales at a faster pace than Hyundai in the US and Europe.
Mr Schreyer spent a decade with VW Group as head of Audi and head of Volkswagen design.
"Mr. Schreyer brings a wealth of experience in design from the global auto industry and has a deep understanding of the Hyundai Motor Group." said Mr Yang.
"These valuable qualities will help build the foundation needed to make Hyundai and Kia leading global top automakers," added Mr Yang.
Hyundai-Kia sold a total of 7.12 million vehicles around the globe last year,, up 8% on 2011.
