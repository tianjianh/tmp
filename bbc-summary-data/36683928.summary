Russia's men's quadruple sculls team have been disqualified from the Rio Olympics after one member tested positive for a banned substance.

Sergei Fedorovtsev tested positive for Trimetazidine in a routine test by Russia's Anti-Doping Agency on 17 May, the World Rowing Federation (WRF) said.
Fedorovtsev, 36, competed a week later at Olympic qualifying in Lucerne, where Russia finished first to qualify.
New Zealand, who were third, will now take Russia's sculls place in Rio.
Following the positive test, the WRF announced "the results of all competitions in which the rower participated after 17 May 2016 are therefore automatically disqualified".
The WRF said the rower's 'A' and 'B' samples both contained the substance, which is a banned metabolic modulator.
The International Olympic Committee last week announced prospective Olympians from Russia in track and field disciplines would have to pass individual anti-doping assessments before being considered eligible for competition.
