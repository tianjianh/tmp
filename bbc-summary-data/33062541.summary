[SN]TITLE[SN]
Neath Rugby Club owner Geraint Hawkes 'unfit' to be director

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of Neath Rugby Club has been found to be unfit to be a company director.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a reserved judgement it was decided the conduct of Geraint Hawkes, along with his mother Janis Hawkes, made them unfit to be concerned in the management of a company.
A judge said Mr Hawkes' evidence concerning VAT was "wholly incredible".
A hearing on 1 July will formally hand down the judgement and decide the length of their disqualification.
Mr Hawkes' solicitor, Trevor Francis, said: "We are still considering our client's position, so comment at this stage would be premature."
