Myanmar election: Asian press applauds vote but warns of challenges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Papers in Myanmar and its neighbours have hailed the historic win by Aung San Suu Kyi's opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) - but warn of possible political hurdles ahead in working with the military.

The Myanmar Times says that while there appears to have been a clear political decision, questions remain over the future role and influence of Ms Suu Kyi.
"Will the country's military obey this new president? " the newspaper asks. "These are puzzles for the NLD and Daw [Aunt] Aung San Suu Kyi to solveâ€¦ As someone who has finally tamed Myanmar's military masters, it should be a cinch."
The Irrawaddy says that all eyes will be on the NLD leader and how she manages the military in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
"National reconciliation across ethnic, political and institutional lines is key to Burma's future," it says. "All will be watching to see that the establishment's old authoritarian tactics do not resurface.
In Thailand and Bangladesh - who share borders with Myanmar - commentators also express concern over whether the military will allow the NLD to take the helm, recalling the 1990 elections when the junta ignored the party's victory.
"The fears of a reprisal are not without foundation," writes a commentator in Dhaka's Daily Star.
But The Bangkok Post says "all indications are that the army realises the country has gone too far with political reform to step backward," adding that Myanmar has an "excellent" chance now to "break free of repression and advance on the democratic front".
However, a columnist in The Malaysian Insider reminds the NLD that it must put right the military's wrongs.
"Integration and inclusivity are two important elements that can stabilise democracy," it writes. "Therefore the onus is on them to grant the [minority Muslim] Rohingyas equal rights."
Chinese official media are downplaying Myanmar's poll, saying that China should develop its own style of democracy.
The state-run Beijing Times warns that Myanmar is still "in the infancy of democracy", adding that its new and inexperienced leaders will face problems dealing with the country's economic and ethnic problems.
But Hong Kong's Apple Daily notes that Myanmar's poll does pose a dilemma for Beijing, quoting a lawyer as saying that the military government gave "only a tiny bit of freedom to people but still managed to hold a peaceful, orderly and competitive election".
The South China Morning Post predicts that the NLD will have to "work pragmatically within existing confines" in tacking the country's challenges and furthering democracy. "All will not be smooth," it says.
Other Asian papers hope their countries will strengthenn ties with Myanmar and help it on its path to democracy.
Indonesia's Jakarta Post urges its government as an ASEAN member to send a clear message of engagement with Yangon. "Indonesia should be much more proactiveâ€¦ in encouraging both the winner and the loser of Myanmar's election to accept the people's choice," it says. "The question is do we dare take the risk?"
But Indian papers look forward to helping the NLD work with the military, noting that Delhi maintained ties with the junta even when the West imposed sanctions.
"India too must seize the opportunity to launch a new partnership with a much neglected neighbour that is also its only link and gateway to the East," The Hindu says.
Australia's Sydney Morning Herald says that the NLD will need to negotiate with minor parties and find a "workable relationship" with the ruling military-backed Union Solidarity Development Party (USDP).
"Even if all the formidable political hurdles can be overcome, it might not turn out to be the fairytale government we all want to believe inâ€¦Ms Suu Kyi will need to be every bit as formidable and extraordinary as she has so far shown herself to be."
