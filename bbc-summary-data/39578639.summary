A football belonging to an Aberdeen club has been found more than 1,000 miles away, washed up off the far north coast of Norway.

The under 19s team ball went over a fence at Banks o' Dee FC's ground into the River Dee.
It is thought to have been swept into the North Sea and drifted around the coast of Norway to the island of Vanna.
The club was emailed to say the ball, with its name on the side, had been found.
News of its far-off resting place came from Johnny Mikalsen, who tracked down the owners of the ball from the club's name scrawled in pen on the side of it.
"Hi! You properly have one of the best long distance kickers in the world," he wrote. "A friend of mine found a football with your club name on by the seaside.
"It has travelled quite a distance. We are located 1,800km (1,118 miles) north of Aberdeen, on an island called Vanna, 10km [six miles] north of Tromso, the capital of North Norway.
"The football is just a little bit dirty after such a long distance, but fully useable. See enclosed picture."
Mr Mikalsen said the ball had been found between driftwood.
He told BBC Scotland he is planning to visit Scotland, adding: "Maybe it's possible to bring it over. That would be nice."
Banks o' Dee secretary Tom Ewan said the news came as a pleasant surprise.
"It's the Norse saga of the long distance football," he said.
Mr Ewan said most of the balls that go into the river are never seen again.
The club hopes to be reunited with this one - and may invite its Norwegian finders to be guests of honour at a game.
