Mr Panesar "used to try and build bridges across the communities in Bradford, Leeds, Halifax and across the country", Mr Singh said.
Mr Panesar, who had been very active on social media was "a doer and role model", he added.
A Just Giving page in his memory has raised almost Â£1,700 for an international disaster relief charity.
Mr Panesar was born in India but moved as a teenager to Halifax in the 1960s and had studied civil engineering at King's College, London.
He had specialised in lecturing on Sikhism and tutoring religious studies.
He was a former president of the Council for Sikh Gurdwaras and a member of several inter-faith groups.
