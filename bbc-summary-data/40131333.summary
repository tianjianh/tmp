[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A multi-million pound repair project at a flagship council facility in Dumfries has made "significant progress" as its timetable reaches the half-way stage.

The DG One centre shut in October 2014 but work did not get under way on site until September 2016.
It was estimated at the time the work would take about 18 months to complete and half that time has now elapsed.
A Dumfries and Galloway Council spokesman said it was now in the "reinstatement phase" of the work.
"The building works at DG One continue with significant progress made," he said.
"Currently, extensive work is being done on the rotunda.
"Following demolition of a number of internal structures, we're now in the reinstatement phase of the project."
He said a report outlining detailed progress would be "presented shortly to the appropriate council committee".
The Â£17m centre opened in 2008 but suffered a string of problems which led to its complete closure in 2014.
The total cost of repairing the issues uncovered is just short of Â£10m and contractors McLaughlin and Harvey started site work on 5 September last year - exactly nine months ago.
The initial timescale reported would see the project completed by spring next year.
