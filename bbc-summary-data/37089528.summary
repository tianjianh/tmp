It happened at 01:00 local  time (07:00 BST) on Monday.
Local media reported that up to 16 men had been abducted.
"Seven or eight armed men stormed the restaurant and told the customers to lie on the ground. We don't really know what happened after that," said Puerto Vallarta's Security Commissioner Jesus Jose Rodrigo Campoy.
Security guards apparently ran away as they saw the gang approaching the restaurant, El Informador newspaper reported.
