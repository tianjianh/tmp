Manager Roberto Martinez has no plan B at Everton and defeat in the FA Cup on Saturday would make it difficult for him to stay at the club, says former Toffees striker Paul Rideout.

Everton play Manchester United in the semi-finals at Wembley.
They go into the game after a 4-0 defeat by Liverpool, which manager Martinez described as "horrific".
Rideout, scorer of Everton's winning goal in 1995 FA Cup final, said: "I think he knows he is in trouble."
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, he added: "I like the way he plays the game. I just think you have to have a little bit of the other side and I don't think he has shown that.
"You have to realise that it isn't working after several games and change it. As soon as Everton concede it is like 'oh, it is going to be one of those games'."
Everton travel to London hoping to win their first major piece of silverware since that 1995 final.
As on Saturday, the Toffees played Manchester United at Wembley that day, having just avoided relegation. The Red Devils, meanwhile, had missed out on the Premier League title to Blackburn.
"It was a great day," said Rideout. "I am still living off it after all these years.
"We were happy to avoid relegation and we were enjoying our day out, but we knew we had a chance and went there in a confident mood.
"After we scored we knew we would be in for a tough 60 minutes but we hung in there."
