Ms Lees' brother Lee Hunter said on Facebook she would "never ever [be] forgotten".
Ms Howe's stepson Jordan Howe said was "caring" and "beautiful".
Their daughters are believed to be safe.
Royton North councillor James Larkin tweeted that a book of condolence had been opened at Royton Town Hall and specialist staff would be on hand to support people in the area.
The two women were among 22 people who were killed in the explosion.
A further 59 people, including children, were injured and taken to hospital after the concert.
