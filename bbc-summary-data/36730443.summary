How did their players rate in the biggest match in the history of Welsh football?
Coped well with Portugal's early flurry of crosses but was powerless to deny Cristiano Ronaldo for Portugal's opening goal. The Crystal Palace player was unfortunate to be wrong-footed by Nani's deflection for the second goal.
Watchful against the threat of Ronaldo cutting inside from Portugal's left, the Reading defender was kept busy by the likes of Renato Sanches and Nani and struggled to influence the game in attack.
Switched to the left side of Wales' three centre-backs in Ben Davies' absence, the West Brom man timed his advances well to make interceptions. Beaten by Ronaldo for Portugal's opening goal but won a team-high eight aerial duels.
Made some strong early challenges, particularly on Cristiano Ronaldo, to assert his authority on the game. The Swansea City skipper led by example, winning 100% of his 50-50 contests with Portugal players.
Making his first international start since March 2015, he competed well in the air as Portugal sought to make the most of Ronaldo's aerial prowess. Wales might have missed Ben Davies' distribution but his replacement was solid defensively.
Like Gunter, kept on the back foot by Portugal's attacking players. Pushed forward but, when he got into promising positions, struggled to provide quality crosses.
An early booking for a foul on Nani made his job of protecting Wales' defence difficult, but still the Liverpool midfielder buzzed around with intent. Typically sound in possession but not as influential as he has been earlier in the tournament.
Showed imagination with a low corner which led to a chance for Gareth Bale but had only limited influence in open play before being replaced by Sam Vokes shortly after Portugal's second goal.
Made some characteristic runs into the Portugal penalty area but could not make the crucial connections. Forced deeper as Portugal's midfield gained control in the second half, the Leicester Premier League winner had to curb his attacking instincts.
Trademark runs from deep and at a startling pace had Portugal's defenders backtracking in the first half but his influence waned in the second period. The Real Madrid forward's audacious long-range shot was Wales' last effort.
Brimming with confidence following his stunning goal in the quarter-final win over Belgium, the free agent stretched Portugal's defence with his powerful running. He was starved of the ball in the second half, however, as the match wore on.
Brought on shortly after Wales fell 2-0 behind, the Burnley striker failed to connect meaningfully with any of the crosses which came his way.
Did not see much of the ball and, when he did, was not in a position to cause Portugal any problems.
Tried making his usual probing runs between the opponents' midfield and defence but found himself crowded out.
