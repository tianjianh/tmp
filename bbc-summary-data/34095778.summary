Burnley-born Sir Ian, a leading LGBT rights campaigner, is grand marshal of the event, which began at 13:00 BST.
Pride's chief executive Mark Fletcher said "much work has been achieved" over the years but more needs to be done.
The festival began in 1990 as a collection of bring-and-buy stalls outside a pub to champion gay rights.
It has since expanded to a parade and festival, with a weekend of live music and a candlelit vigil to commemorate those who have died after contracting HIV, or are living with the condition.
This year, Texas, Danni Minogue, Alesha Dixon and DJ Fresh are among the musicians performing.
The parade set off down Deansgate from Liverpool Road, turning up Peter Street, on to Oxford Street, Portland Street and Princess Street.
As grand marshal, the 76-year-old actor, who came out in 1988, was at its head through the city's streets.
Around 2,500 people from across Greater Manchester took part with around 100 entries from small community groups to large commercial organisations, all unified in their support for the LGBT community.
Mr Fletcher said the festival is vital in raising awareness, adding: "We have come a long way in 25 years, there's still have a long way to go.
"Barriers and boundaries are being been broken down but there's still more needs to be done."
He said the parade is a family-friendly event and last year there was tens of thousands of people who came out to show support including "proud straight allies."
