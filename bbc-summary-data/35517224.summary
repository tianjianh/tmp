Ireland captain Rory Best admitted the 16-16 draw against Wales was not exactly how they wanted to start their defence of the Six Nations title.

"No-one's happy with a draw, but it took character to come back after going behind for the first time with five minutes left on the clock," he said.
"We got the good start we wanted, but then let them score 10 points in the last 10 minutes of the first half.
"We will digest the result and then assess how happy we are with it."
Ulster hooker Best added that although it was not the result Ireland wanted, "there are things we can be happy with".
"There are a lot of positives and we haven't lost, but we will take a quick look back on this to make sure we go forward," he continued.
"It is all about recovery because we have a short turnaround before going to France."
Ireland's South African-born debutant CJ Stander was named man of the match.
"It is a proud day for me and my family," said the 25-year-old flanker.
"The support from the Irish fans has been unreal and I was emotional during the anthems.
"It is mixed emotions. We could have done more perhaps, but we have a point on the board."
