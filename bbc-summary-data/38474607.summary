Daryl Murphy put the visitors ahead early on with his first goal for the club - and only the second by the Magpies in their past six FA Cup ties.
They had Aleksandar Mitrovic carried off before Jutkiewicz turned in Jonathan Grounds' low cross to level.
But he twice missed late chances to steal victory for the hosts.
Both sides rang the changes with Newcastle making eight to Birmingham's five, but it was the Magpies who sent their 4,671 travelling fans into raptures, in an all-Championship meeting of 13th against second, when Murphy scored from close range five minutes into his second start for Rafael Benitez's side.
However, it came at a cost as fellow striker Mitrovic suffered a badly cut leg in the build-up.
The visitors had chances to extend their lead, with sub Yoan Gouffran firing wide before Grant Hanley headed just over.
Che Adams went close with a long-range shot for Blues prior to Jutkiewicz's equaliser and Grounds could have put the home side in front by the break, with his fierce half-volley flying just over.
Blues are yet to win in five matches under Zola, but it was the Italian's side that came closest to a winner against his Spanish counterpart Benitez, who lifted the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006.
Although Matt Ritchie made an impact for Newcastle off the bench, it was Jutkiewicz who should have won it, steering a free header wide from a cross by Josh Dacres-Cogley from six yards, before then going close again.
Birmingham were beaten 4-0 at St James' Park in December, but when they played there in an FA Cup third-round replay 10 years ago, they won 5-1.
Birmingham boss Gianfranco Zola told BBC WM: "We had good chances to win it. But Lukas does not need to apologise. Next time they will go in.
"It was important that we got something out of it. It will give big belief to the players. It is the best we have played in terms of consistency.
"You could see at the beginning. We were a bit edgy and there were nerves on the bench too, but I am now more optimistic. The players are now starting to understand more what we are trying to do.
"A win would be massive. You can do good things on the pitch but you need to win. Without confidence, you can't do anything."
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez told BBC Sport: "A replay is not ideal, for them or us. We made a lot of changes and changed the system but we had started well and had control before the injury to Mitrovic.
"Daryl Murphy put in a tremendous effort. I'm really pleased with him and the fact that he scored too. He's a great professional.
"I always approach every game looking to win. For me, the FA Cup is a massive competition. I won it with Liverpool in 2006 and I will try to do it with this squad too."
