Andrew Platten, 55, from Bingley, died at the scene in Cottingley Cliffe Road in the town on Tuesday.ã€€
West Yorkshire Police said officers had tried to stop the car after seeing the driver "acting suspiciously".
Police said the car then "sped off and collided" with Dr Platten a short distance away.
The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
A 22-year-old Bradford man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been released on bail.
Dr Platten worked at Leeds Beckett University. Its website describes him as an associate dean for international and collaborative provision in the Faculty of Arts, Environment and Technology.
In a statement, his family said: "Andrew excelled as a respected and dedicated academic, with a love for art, poetry and music. For anyone that knew him, cycling was his true passion as he became a recognised competitive rider on the roads. ã€€
"Most importantly he was a loved friend, loyal brother and uncle, loving partner and a truly inspirational father. He will be deeply missed, but he has left his stamp on all who met him.
"He will always be cherished and never forgotten, living on in all our hearts."
