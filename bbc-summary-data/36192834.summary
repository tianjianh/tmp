Speaking in Bermondsey in central London, Mr Khan warned that if his Conservative opponent wins the election there will be "no change" on housing in London.
He said the Housing and Planning Bill currently before Parliament "is a disaster for affordable housing in London, and Zac Goldsmith has defended it at every step of the way".
Mr Goldsmith pledged Â£1m of funding for local community groups helping to tackle violence against women and girls, which he said would come from the "town centres and communities fund" outlined in his manifesto.
He also repeated his promise that he will be a champion for commuters and that Mr Khan's plan for a fare freeze would be "dangerous" for TfL.
He has been criticised over an article he wrote for the Mail on Sunday which was printed below a picture of the bus which was bombed in the 7/7 attacks. He later said the image was "inappropriate" and he had not been consulted on its use.
Separately, a Labour candidate for the London Assembly, Murad Qureshi, was forced to apologise for retweeting a comment from a journalist which stated "you can get away with deeply offending anyone in this country as long as they're not Jewish".
He said: "The views it contained were wrong and do not reflect my own."
