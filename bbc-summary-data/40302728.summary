The 23-year-old went missing after a night out at Styx nightclub in his home town of Glenrothes on 3 November 2013.
His parents have repeatedly stated they believe he has been murdered and that his killer is at large.
Police are searching a house in Barnton Place, Glenrothes. His father said he hopes the search yields answers.
Allan Bryant Sr told BBC Scotland: "My family have been waiting for something like this for a long, long time. We just hope there are some answers at the end of it.
"All we want to do is find out what has happened to our son Allan and get the closure we actually need, which we have been fighting for for over three and a half years.
"The only thing that matters to us is actually finding out what has happened to Allan."
Det Insp Stuart Wilson, of Police Scotland, said: "Officers executed a search warrant at an address in Barnton Place, Glenrothes, on Friday 16th June in connection with the ongoing investigation into missing man, Allan Bryant.
"We remain committed to getting answers for the Bryant family and any information we receive from the community will be assessed and further action taken wherever appropriate.
"Anyone who may have information about Allan's movements after he left Styx nightclub in Caskieberran Road in the early hours of 3 November 2013 is urged to get in touch as soon as possible."
In a post on social media, Mr Bryant added: "To everyone who knows what has happened to our son Allan let this be a warning to you, the major investigation team and the police are doing everything to find out what has happened to our son."
