It was previously believed the 71-year-old had broken an ankle in an incident involving a door at Pinewood Studios on 12 June.
"His surgery was successful and he will begin rehab shortly," continued Ina Treciokas in a statement.
"He's doing well and looks forward to returning to work."
Ford, who is reprising his role as Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode VII, was airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after the accident.
The BBC understands he was injured while filming a scene involving a door on the Millennium Falcon, Solo's beloved spaceship.
Last week a spokesman for the Lucasfilm production company said the actor had "sustained an ankle injury" and shooting would continue while he recuperated.
A spokesman for Thames Valley Police confirmed officers had been called to the studio in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, just after 17:00 BST following reports of a man being injured in an incident involving a garage door.
A spokeswoman for South Central Ambulance Service said they were called to an incident involving "a door that had fallen".
Ford is among a number of original Star Wars cast members who are working on JJ Abrams' film, set for release in December 2015.
