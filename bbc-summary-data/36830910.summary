Murray has not played since beating Milos Raonic in the Wimbledon final, and was only a spectator as Great Britain won their Davis Cup tie against Serbia in Belgrade at the weekend.
The three-time Rogers Cup winner will train in Mallorca before defending his Olympic title in Rio next month.
"My body needs some recovery time," said the 29-year-old.
