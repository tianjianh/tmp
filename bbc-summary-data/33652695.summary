Skills gap '8,000 shortfall' warning in Wales

Wales could face a gaping hole in its manufacturing workforce - with companies struggling to fill 8,000 posts by 2018, it is being warned.

According to the employers organisation EEF, Wales is punching above its weight with stronger manufacturing growth than anywhere else in the UK.
But there are concerns over longer-term productivity and a skills shortage.
Manufacturing employs 157,000 people in Wales, with the food, drink and transport sectors performing well.
The EEF's regional outlook report says between 2010 and 2014, the number of jobs in the sector increased by 15%.
But it says the momentum has "softened" along with the rest of the UK  since the latter part of last year.
Gareth Jenkins, managing director of FSG Tool and Die in Llantrisant, said: "EEF in Wales has identified that in a sector that employs 160,000 people we will have a predicted shortfall of 8,000 people by 2018.
"There is a growing need to 'future proof' our sector to remain globally competitive."
A 10-year strategy to bridge the skills gap was launched by the Welsh government last year.
The EEF snapshot survey also found Welsh manufacturers were performing well in exports to North America, the Middle East and north Africa and were "putting Wales on the map".
But it found Wales manufacturers scored second lowest in the UK for business confidence.
Paul Byard, director for Wales at EEF, said: "This undoubtedly reflects softening momentum since the latter half of 2014 and headwinds from the fall in demand from the oil and gas sector and challenging demand conditions in some export markets."
