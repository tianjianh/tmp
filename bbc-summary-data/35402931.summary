Glasgow Warriors prop Zander Fagerson says there is confidence within the Scotland camp that they can win this year's Six Nations.

Fagerson, 20 last week, hopes to make his Test debut after receiving a call-up to the squad on his birthday.
He believes the Scots can build on their positive 2015 World Cup efforts.
"There is a belief in the squad and that is every team's aim," he said of their chances of winning the title. "Everybody is very optimistic."
Fagerson was surprised to be called into Vern Cotter's squad so quickly considering he has yet to become a regular starter with Glasgow.
"It was fantastic hearing that on my birthday which made it an extra special day, and that's my new goal," he said of the prospect of earning his first Scotland cap.
"It's amazing. It's like living a dream and I've had to pinch myself a few times.
"It's fantastic, but the hard work starts now. My dream was to become a professional rugby player and I've already accomplished that."
Scotland picked up the Wooden Spoon last season, finishing bottom of the Six Nations table after five straight defeats.
Their only win in their last 12 games in the Championship was a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome, in February 2014, while their last win over England was in 2008.
However, after reaching the World Cup quarter-finals last autumn before narrowly losing to eventual finalists Australia, Fagerson believes the Scots can carry that good form into this season's opening game against England.
"The World Cup proves this team's got something special," said the former national junior mountain bike champion, who won the Scottish championship in the under-15 category.
"In the Six Nations, we were there or thereabouts last year and a few games didn't go our way, but they were all pretty close,
"I think we can do something special this year."
