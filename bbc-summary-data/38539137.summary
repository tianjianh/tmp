[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 1-0 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham earned a much-needed 1-0 win against Gillingham in a battle of two teams under new management.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Sheridan tasted victory at the start of his third spell as Latics boss, while Gillingham were playing their first game since Adrian Pennock replaced the sacked Justin Edinburgh.
The visitors almost grabbed an early opener when Chris Herd's goalbound shot was blocked by Oldham captain Peter Clarke.
But the hosts broke through on 39 minutes when Billy McKay was fouled just outside the box and, from the resulting free-kick, Josh Law cracked an unstoppable drive high into the net.
It was the first league goal at home since mid-October for the EFL's lowest scorers, although they needed Connor Ripley to protect the lead before half-time with a smart save from Max Ehmer.
Lee Erwin could have made it 2-0 after a mazy run, but his low shot drifted wide, while McKay and Law were next to threaten the visitors' goal, both forcing saves from keeper Stuart Nelson.
Law hit the bar in injury time as Oldham pressed for a second goal, but the Latics held on for the narrow victory which ended their 10-match winless run and moved them off the foot of the table.
