Familiar scenes from the bilingual series, broadcast in Welsh on S4C as Y Gwyll, have been recreated at Aberystwyth University's Old College.
The new exhibition includes the police office shared by DCI Tom Mathias, played by Richard Harrington, and Mali Harries' character DI Mared Rhys.
Running alongside the exhibition, which runs until 22 December, are workshops.
The exhibition will also include a bloody murder scene, props used by the cast and a wall dedicated to a busy investigation noticeboard, including a map showing the areas of Ceredigion which have been used during the BAFTA Cymru award-winning series.
Dr Rhodri Llwyd Morgan, Pro Vice-Chancellor at Aberystwyth University, said the exhibition marks the first in a series of exhibitions which form part of an ambitious project to "bring new life to Old College."
"As we prepare to resubmit our funding bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund, we hope it will show the building's potential to be used as a unique exhibition space which will attract both locals and visitors," he said.
The third series of Hinterland has been filmed and will be broadcast on BBC Wales in early 2017. The Welsh language version Y Gwyll is currently being shown on S4C.
