Debutant Lee Angol put Posh ahead early on when he turned home Souleymane Coulibaly's cross, before setting up Erhun Oztumer to fire home.
Rhys Murphy pulled one back for the hosts, but after the break Coulibaly raced clear to finish his side's third.
Coulibaly nodded in Marcus Maddison's cross and Angol slotted in the fifth.
Oldham assistant manager Dean Holden told BBC Radio Manchester:

"It was a poor performance.
"We were in the game for 15 to 20 minutes at the start of the second half, we got a goal back and we were on top at that stage but then we went back to thing we were doing in the first half.
"We've conceded sloppy goals today and you can't win games when you concede goals as bad as we did.
"We didn't play as a team."
Peterborough United caretaker manager Grant McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:
"I thought they were all superb goals -  I said to the players, me being greedy, if we had believed in ourselves we could have got more, but I'll settle for that.
"I didn't single anyone out in the changing room - to a man, we were exceptional.
"They took the messages that I gave to them onto the pitch - they definitely expressed themselves and played with a real freedom. I thought we were very good."
