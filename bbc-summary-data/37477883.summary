[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Denbighshire businesswoman died of crush injuries in a tractor accident, a post-mortem examination has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephanie Booth, 70, was found by her husband, David, at their smallholding in Llangar, Corwen, on 18 September.
They had formerly run hotels in the area and, in 2008, she starred in a BBC series about the industry called Hotel Stephanie.
The coroner adjourned the inquest until March, saying the Health and Safety Executive was investigating her death.
The hearing was told Mr Booth, 72, went looking for his wife when she failed to return home.
She had been driving their tractor mower when the incident occurred at the smallholding where they ran an animal rescue centre.
