House searches in Claudia Lawrence case end

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forensic searches of properties by police investigating the disappearance of York chef Claudia Lawrence have been completed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A house in the Burnholme area of York was searched following the arrest of a 59-year-old man from York on 13 May.
The man, arrested on suspicion of the murder of Miss Lawrence, was released on conditional bail the following day.
A second property in North Shields, Tyneside, was also searched by officers.
North Yorkshire Police said investigations were continuing but searches at both properties had been concluded.
Miss Lawrence, 35, who lived in Heworth, had worked as a chef at the University of York.
She was due to start a 06:00 shift on 19 March 2009 but failed to turn up.
Extensive searches of the area were made but she was not found and police have since treated her disappearance as murder.
The arrest on 13 May followed a review of the case in 2013.
