[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defending champions Juventus moved top of Serie A as they thrashed Cagliari.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts were looking to bounce back from defeat by Inter Milan in the derby d'Italia on Sunday and were soon in front as Daniele Rugani swept in.
Record signing Gonzalo Higuain then doubled the lead before Dani Alves scored his first goal for Juventus with a powerful drive from outside the box.
Luca Ceppitelli diverted the ball into his own net late on as Mario Lemina's shot was parried into his path.
Victory was enough to lift Max Allegri's side back to the top of the table as title rivals Napoli were held 0-0 away at Genoa.
Elsewhere, Edin Dzeko scored twice as Roma beat Crotone 4-0 to move up to third, Inter Milan made it back-to-back wins with a 2-0 victory over Empoli and Udinese drew 2-2 with Fiorentina.
