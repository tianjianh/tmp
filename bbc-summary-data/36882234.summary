Giant miner puppet walks through Cornwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A giant puppet of a Cornish miner has taken its first steps on a 130-mile journey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 10-metre (32.8ft) Man Engine will travel the length of the Cornish Mining World Heritage Site to mark the 10th anniversary Unesco heritage status.
The puppet is the same height as a double decker bus when in "crawling" mode but more than twice that height when standing.
It was launched in Tavistock and will reach west Cornwall on 6 August.

The machine is the brainchild of Will Coleman, founder of Golden Tree Productions, and is named after a mechanism used to move miners up and down to working levels.
