Waste firm ordered to stop dumping rubbish on M62 site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A waste company has been ordered to stop dumping rubbish next to the M62 in East Yorkshire after it failed to reduce the height of the tip.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The site near Gilberdyke had grown to more than double its permitted height of 14m (46ft).
The Environment Agency (EA) served a third enforcement notice to City Plant Ltd following two orders last year to reduce the amount of rubbish.
Residents had called for the agency and local authority to take action.
The third notice bans the firm from taking waste to the towering rubbish tip and will come into force from 13 February.
It was issued by the EA after City Plant Ltd failed to comply with one of the two orders served in November.
Environment Agency regulatory officer Matthew Woollin said: "It's important that we control the amount of waste at the site because we issue the permit based on a set figure to protect the environment.
"We understand the community's concerns and we are working hard to resolve this issue."
Neighbours said the smell from the tip had become unbearable and was affecting house sales.
Local resident Kevin Clifford said the tip was getting "higher and higher" and attracting vermin.
He said he had witnessed up to 100 wagons a day driving through the village "spreading litter, dirt and muck".
City Plant Ltd has yet to comment.
