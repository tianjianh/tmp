Nigeria have reappointed Samson Siasia as coach following the resignation of Sunday Oliseh earlier on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Nigeria Football Federation have ensured a coach is in place for March's Nations Cup qualifiers against Egypt.
Oliseh quit after only eight months, accusing the NFF of "contractual violations" and owing salaries.
The NFF responded in a statement, saying Oliseh was this week "paid three months' salary and a half-year rent" but admitted he is still owed a bonus.
And the governing body quickly moved on from Oliseh's reign by handing Siasia a second spell in charge of the Super Eagles.
He was previously coach between December 2010 and October 2011, before his contract was terminated following the team's failure to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.
This time he will work alongside Salisu Yusuf, former Nigeria Under-17 player Emmanuel Amuneke and Alloy Agu.
The NFF said: "The combination was recommended by the NFF Technical and Development Committee following Sunday Oliseh's resignation on Twitter in the early hours of Friday."
Amuneke coached the Nigeria U-17s to a fifth World Cup title in Chile last year, while Salisu Yusuf and Alloy Agu were part of the coaching team led by Oliseh.
The first task for Siasia, who is in charge of the national U-23 side, is to prepare the team for the Nations Cup qualifiers against Group G leaders Egypt at home on 25 March and the return match two days later.
