Peter Handscomb's unbeaten 57 gave Yorkshire the upper hand over Somerset in a low-scoring match at Taunton.

Steve Davies (35) and Lewis Gregory (43) began the recovery after the hosts slipped to 48-4.
The tail then added valuable runs, led by Craig Overton (44*), as Somerset edged to a 22-run first innings lead.
Dom Bess removed Yorkshire opener Adam Lyth (10) early in the reply, but Handscomb and Alex Lees (38) helped the visitors to a 105-run lead at stumps.
Resuming 161 runs behind, Somerset soon lost James Hildreth (23), trapped leg before by Steven Patterson, but Davies, who moved to 11,000 first-class runs, and Gregory added 65 for the fifth wicket.
The hosts were still 53 in arrears when both were out shortly before lunch, but Overton helped guided the tail past the Yorkshire total.
This included a stand of 24 with twin brother Jamie who became Ryan Sidebottom's 750th first-class victim as the former England bowler took season-best figures of 5-56.
The visitors lost Lyth when just 13 runs ahead in their reply, but Lees and Handscomb patiently built the lead with a battling 58-run second-wicket stand before Overton capped his feats with the bat by removing Lees' middle stump.
Handscomb was dropped in the slips on 27 when Marcus Trescothick put down a difficult chance off Bess, and the Australian international took advantage with a gritty innings.
He brought up his 50 - only the second of the match - off 78 balls as he and Gary Ballance (15*) took Yorkshire to 127-2 before bad light stopped play.
