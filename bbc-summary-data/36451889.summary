The attack happened in Meadow Road and Milford Road, near the Readipop studio, at about 23:20 BST.
A number of men had been seen running along the road with traffic cones and other items before the fight started.
The victim was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital then transferred to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.
Det Con Tim Lloyd said the attack started inside the Readipop venue, where a private function was taking place.
"There were in excess of 200 people at the event, therefore a number of people are likely to have witnessed the altercation," he said.
"I would appeal to these people to come forward and speak to police if you saw what happened."
