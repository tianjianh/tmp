A funeral service is due to be held for teenager Paige Doherty almost a month after her body was found in a wooded area in Clydebank.

The 15-year-old was reported missing on 19 March. Her body was found just off Great Western Road two days later.
John Leathem, 31, has appeared in court charged with murdering her.
Those attending the funeral at St Margaret's Catholic Church, Clydebank, have been asked to wear colourful clothes.
The service will be led by parish priest Canon Gerard Tartaglia.
On Tuesday, a white horse-drawn carriage took the 15-year-old's coffin to the church where a mass was held, attended by more than 100 people.
The carriage, drawn by two horses wearing pink feather headdresses, was followed to the church by mourners, led by Paige's mother Pamela Munro.
Floral tributes included a pink pout-shaped arrangement, a star, and the words "daughter" and "sister".
Ms Munro wrote in a Facebook post earlier on Tuesday: "Absolutely heartbroken knowing last night was the last night I spend with our precious girl Paige.
"Wish there was a way we could turn back time and make sure this never happened. Unfortunately the world's a cruel place but Paige will always be around us for sure."
Following the teenager's death, people including Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon showed her family support by posting pictures of themselves pouting with the hashtag PoutforPaige.
The teenager was last seen alive near a deli in Clydebank before setting off for her part-time hairdressing job on the morning of Saturday 19 March.
Following the discovery of her body, police said they were treating Paige's death as a murder inquiry.
Mr Leathem was later arrested and remains in custody awaiting trial.
Hundreds of people gathered for a memorial event to Paige at a Clydebank park on 26 March.
The Titan Crane in Clydebank was also illuminated pink in memory of her.
A group of about 400 people, made up of the 15-year-old's friends, relatives and neighbours, also took part in a Wear Pink for Paige walk.
