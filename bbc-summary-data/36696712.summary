Labour leadership: Corbyn offers to 'reach out' to opponents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn has said he is "ready to reach out" to Labour MPs who oppose his leadership.

Writing in the Sunday Mirror, the Labour leader said he was willing to "work with the whole party to provide the alternative the country needs".
He said MPs opposed to his leadership needed to "respect" the views of the party members who had elected him.
Mr Corbyn also said he would stand again for the party leadership if his opponents triggered a new contest.
His comments come days after dozens of resignations from his front-bench team and a motion of no confidence in him that was passed by 172 to 40 Labour MPs on Thursday.
MPs and senior figures in the party have called for Mr Corbyn to resign, citing concerns about his performance during the UK's EU referendum campaign - which resulted in the UK voting to leave - and his ability to win a general election.
But Mr Corbyn has refused to resign, saying the motion of no confidence has "no constitutional legitimacy".
Despite speculation, no Labour MP has yet confirmed they will stand against him in a leadership contest.
Writing in the Sunday Mirror, Mr Corbyn said: "I am ready to reach out to Labour MPs who didn't accept my election and oppose my leadership - and work with the whole party to provide the alternative the country needs.
"But they also need to respect the democracy of our party and the views of Labour's membership, which has increased by more than 60,000 in the past week alone.
"Our priority must be to mobilise this incredible force to oppose the Tories, and ensure people in Britain have a real political alternative.
"That is my priority and always will be as leader of our party.
"Those who want to challenge my leadership are free to do so in a democratic contest, in which I will be a candidate."
Mr Corbyn also ruled out the possibility of a second EU referendum in the article, saying "we must respect the democratic Â­decision of the British people - and negotiate a new relationship with the EU".
"That has to be one that's based on fair immigration rules, that protects jobs, living standards and workers' rights and ensures we have the freedom to shape our own economy for the future," he added.
On Saturday Angela Eagle, who along with former shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith is considering a leadership challenge, renewed calls for Mr Corbyn to resign for the good of the "party and the country".
Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock also backed attempts to remove Mr Corbyn, saying MPs were "fundamentally alarmed" by the party's prospects.
Ms Eagle, who quit last week as shadow business secretary, said: "He's lost the confidence of the parliamentary party.
"He's losing confidence in the party. And let's face it the country's in a crisis and we need strong opposition."
BBC Newsnight understands that shadow cabinet members have been drawing up plans to encourage Mr Corbyn to resign.
However, the programme has learned that a delegation of MPs were unsuccessful in their attempts to meet Mr Corbyn on Thursday and put forward their plan.
Under the proposals, potential leadership contenders would agree to pursue some of Mr Corbyn's key policies on issues including tackling inequality and making the party more democratic.
Mr Corbyn has previously said he will not "betray" party members who elected him last year by standing down, while James Schneider, from grassroots movement Momentum, said he still had "enormous support".
Events were held on Saturday in support of the Labour leader, including in Leeds and Liverpool - where more than 1,000 demonstrators attended.
