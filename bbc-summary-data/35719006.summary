Referee Craig Thomson dismissed Boyata for a challenge on Carlton Morris at New Douglas Park on Friday.
Celtic manager Ronny Deila criticised his defender immediately after the Scottish Premiership clash but changed his mind after viewing the footage.
The defender will be suspended for Celtic's next league match away to Partick Thistle.
"I have seen it many times and, when you've seen it from all angles, it's the wrong decision," Deila said after reviewing the incident.
"I'm still saying that in this situation I want my player staying on his feet, because we have quick defenders and running with people is better than taking chances and putting the referee in a bad situation.
"He makes his decision and hits the ball, in my opinion it's not a red card."
