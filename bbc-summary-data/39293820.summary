The chain was the only suitable part to replace the original Corbiere lighthouse lamp chain in Jersey.
Lighthouse keeper Mark Turner was looking for a new chain as a part of his personal restoration work.
The chain used to turn the lighthouse lamp before modern technology replaced this method in the 1970s.
It had not been changed since the lighthouse was built in 1874.
