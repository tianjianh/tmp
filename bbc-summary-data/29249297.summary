WWE Night of Champions: Twitter reacts to the big matches

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If you've been anywhere near Twitter for the last 12 hours or so, it will have been hard to miss #WWENOC, also known as WWE's Night Of Champions.

It started, as any American sporting event (scripted or not) should, with an hour-long Kickoff Show before a night of montages, insane chanting and German suplexes.
But who are we to say what we thought of the night's two big matches?
The full results are online but let's hand over to Twitter for the response.
Naturally, ladies first as Paige defended her title.
A fair few summed this one up with a single image.
And, although some people appeared to pick up on a few stunt calls during the match, it seemed like there was surprise all round during the match.
And then there was THE big one.
The Kickoff Show panel were re-introduced and after another VT, which by all accounts "was awesome", things got underway.
But just as everyone was getting excited by the moves being pulled off...
There was a pretty confusing ending which saw Seth Rollins heading into the ring and the match ending in a disqualification (DQ) for Lesnar as it apparently never officially started. (Full description here)
Maybe read that again if you need to, but the bottom line is that it divided WWE fans with some complaining about paying their $9.99 (Â£6) pay per view (PPV) fee.
