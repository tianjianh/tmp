The Somerset Remembers exhibition at Taunton's Museum of Somerset opened earlier and will run until January.
Curator Sam Astill said: "Just to get up close to people's stories and people's lives - it's a great privilege."
The local war efforts, agriculture and the legacy of the war are also covered in the exhibition.
Thousands of Somerset men served in the armed forces during World War One and more than 8,000 of them were killed.
Mr Astill added: "We tried to choose individuals whose stories relate to a particular period of the war, or a particular aspect.
"For example we have Cpl Joseph Studeley - he's in the section which is called War, which tells the story of the Somerset Light Infantry and the opening battles of the First World War.
"He was killed quite early but he fought at the Battle of Le Cateau, one of the first engagements of the war on the 26th August, 1914."
