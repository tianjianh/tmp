Oxted Health Centre in 'crisis' over staffing issues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The managers of Oxted Health Centre have told patients the practice is in "crisis" and asked them to carefully consider their need to see a GP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a note on their website the centre said two partners were on long-term sick leave and they were unable to replace another who was retiring.
It said due to "clinical safety" patients may find they are unable to be seen on the day they call.
NHS England said the practice should consider stopping patient registration.
The note said: "The practice is currently looking at sourcing additional locum GP cover to assist in the shortfall of appointments during this crisis period and would ask patients to please support us in this difficult time."
Patients with urgent problems who cannot be seen on the day have been advised to use walk-in centres at Caterham Dene, Edenbridge or the A&E Department at East Surrey Hospital.
The practice has not yet responded to the BBC's request for a comment.
