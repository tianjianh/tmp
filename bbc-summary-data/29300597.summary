Police are investigating after shots were fired at two addresses in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A firearm was discharged at a parked vehicle in The Murrays Brae at about 21:30 on Saturday.
A short time later shots were also fired at a house in Gilmerton Dykes Drive.
Police are linking this to another incident in which an address in Walter Scott Avenue was approached at about 22:00.
There are no reports of injuries in connection with any of the incidents.
Det Ch Insp Stuart Houston said: "This is a significant police inquiry and I would appeal for anyone who has any information that could assist with this investigation to come forward.
"I would also appeal to anyone who was in the area or immediate streets surrounding the addresses, at the time, and may have seen anything suspicious, to contact police immediately."
Ch Insp Mark Patterson said: "Incidents like this are extremely rare but in light of this we have stepped up high visibility patrols in the area of Gilmerton and the Inch.
"Members of the public can also be reassured that we have a dedicated inquiry team actively pursuing those responsible."
