Huddersfield Town 1-1 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lukas Jutkiewicz's 73rd-minute header earned Birmingham City a hard-fought point against Huddersfield Town.

Elias Kachunga had put Huddersfield ahead just four minutes earlier with his fifth goal of the season when he combined with Tommy Smith to fire home.
Nahki Wells then struck the bar before Jutkiewicz netted the equaliser after the hosts failed to clear David Cotterill's dangerous free-kick.
The draw kept Huddersfield third, while Birmingham moved up to seventh.
Huddersfield started much the brighter side and Birmingham goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak was forced to save long-range shots from Wells and Chris Lowe.
Kuszczak also held onto Jonathan Hogg's 30-yard effort before Smith skimmed the bar with a rising shot as Town dominated possession.
But the Blues came to life after Kachunga's opener with Jutkiewicz heading in after Jonathan Grounds kept the ball alive, and they could have won it when Ryan Shotton headed wide late on.
Huddersfield's second draw of the season means they have not won in nine home league meetings against Birmingham - a run stretching back to October 1996.
Huddersfield manager David Wagner:  "I always feel we are able to score and we had some good opportunities.
"There was a clear penalty and the free-kick for the goal was not a foul in my opinion, but we have to accept that. Overall the performance was good.
"We know that if we stick together and show our identity on the pitch in every game we are competitive in this league."
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett: "I would certainly have taken a point after the first half. In the first half we didn't do enough and didn't show Championship quality.
"In the second half I thought we grew into the game and we made two brave attacking substitutions. That looked like a very good decision when we scored, but not so good afterwards.
"It was a good point gained and another point to build on after the Aston Villa result last week."
