The Hornets won 2-1 at the Emirates on Sunday thanks to goals from Odion Ighalo and Adlene Guedioura.
It is the first FA Cup defeat Arsenal have suffered in 37 months and continues Watford's impressive season.
"We try to enjoy this moment, this team, this journey. We get to play in a semi-final at Wembley," said Flores.

The Spaniard, who won La Liga as a player with Real Madrid, and the Europa League and Uefa Super Cup as manager of Atletico Madrid, added: "This season is an amazing season for Watford, the players play for the fans.
"I think this is the most important moment of my career."
Watford had only 29% of the possession and had to hang on for victory at the end after Danny Welbeck scored for the home side.
Flores also downplayed an incident in the first half, when Arsenal defender Gabriel escaped punishment for a two-footed tackle on Troy Deeney.
"For me it is football, it is England," said Flores. "This is the kind of contact we see each week, it is nothing special."
