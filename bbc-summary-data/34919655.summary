[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents of a Dorset village are fighting to buy their local shop in a bid to save what they have called their "community hub".

They are trying to raise Â£130,000 to buy, refurbish and run Corner House Village Stores in Broadmayne, near Dorchester.
Campaigner Tim Clayton said the closure of the local garage and GP surgery had added "extra impetus" to their bid.
They hope to buy the business in the New Year.
Mr Clayton, chair of Broadmayne's Community Shop Management Committee, described the shop, which is on the market for Â£95,000, as "a very valuable community asset".
He said the group anticipated it would be staffed by one paid manager, one part-time paid staff member and a team of volunteers.
"It is a profitable business but we are less interested in profit and more interested in keeping the shop open for the community," he said.
The plans will be outlined at a meeting in the village hall later.
