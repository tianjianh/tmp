The 17-year-old was the only woman from the Rio Olympics to complete four apparatus, and scored 55.350.
"I've worked so hard for this," Downie told British Gymnastics.
"It's been a bit up and down in training this week. To get back to full fitness hasn't been easy but it just shows the hard work has paid off."
Claudia Fragapane qualified top for Sunday's floor apparatus final with a score of 13.75.
Olympic floor bronze medallist Amy Tinkler only competed on bars, qualifying in the last spot.
Joe Fraser, 18, said he was left feeling "speechless" after winning the men's all-around title in his first year in the senior competition.
Absent stars Max Whitlock, Nile Wilson and Kristian Thomas will also be missing at the forthcoming European Championships in Romania.
"To come away with this is something I would never have expected before the competition," said Fraser.
"There are more competitions where I need to prove myself but hopefully I can secure myself a space."
