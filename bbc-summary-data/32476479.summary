SBS sports presenter Scott McIntyre has been sacked for "disrespectful" tweets about Anzac Day, the Australian broadcaster says.

It says McIntyre's remarks breached the organisation's code of conduct.
Tweeting on the centenary of the Gallipoli landings in Turkey during World War One, McIntyre wrote that Australia's and New Zealand's soldiers had carried out "summary execution, widespread rape and theft".
Some reporters criticised SBS's move.
They suggested that firing McIntyre was against the principle of free speech.
McIntyre, who was SBS's football reporter and TV presenter, put out a series of tweets on Saturday.
He wrote: "Remembering the summary execution, widespread rape and theft committed by these 'brave' Anzacs in Egypt, Palestine and Japan.
"The cultification of an imperialist invasion of a foreign nation that Australia had no quarrel with is against all ideals of modern society."
Australian Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull described the posts as "despicable".
"Difficult to think of more offensive or inappropriate comments," he wrote.
McIntyre has so far made no public comments on his sacking.
