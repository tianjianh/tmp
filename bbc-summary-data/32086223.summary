From September, it will offer the language to students also reading international business and politics.
While shorter courses are available at other universities, this is the first time Urdu has been included in the title of an official degree.
About 100 million people speak it in the world, including 400,000 in the UK.
Yasmin Hussain from the Routes Into Languages university consortium campaigned for the introduction of the new degree.
She said: "The discourse is that modern foreign languages like French and Spanish are more important. Minority languages aren't seen to be as valued and so it has taken a long time."
Students on the full-time courses will have the chance to learn how the language has been used in film and literature, as well as using Urdu to discuss topics related to their core subject.
The launch of the course saw students from local schools take part in workshops and activities, as well as performances by poets and musicians.
Writer Sabeena Khan was among those at an open day to launch and promote the Urdu courses.
She believes young British Pakistanis in particular would benefit from having Urdu as part of their degree.
Ms Khan said: "The language is rich in meaning, its style and usage. It's beautiful and I don't want to see it die out, I want to see more people learning Urdu."

Sheraz Ali is one of the lecturers who will be teaching the new undergraduate degree course.
"There is a demand for Urdu-related jobs not just in this country but also in many others, especially within professions such as teaching and the health and legal sectors," he said.
Mr Ali believed the course would attract students from different backgrounds and not just native speakers of the language.
He added: "The Urdu degree is open to everyone, not just people from the South Asian diaspora. We live in a multicultural society, where language isn't only a pile of words but something which can bring people together."
