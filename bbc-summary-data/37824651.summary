Hampton stabbings: Man 'attacked women over perceived police treatment'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man attacked four women at random in a "stabbing spree" after what he believed was mistreatment by the police, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ethem Orhon, 67, is accused of attacking the women in a Sainsbury's car park in Hampton, London, on 20 May,
Kingston Crown Court heard he had been arrested for possession of a knife on 19 May and was bailed two hours before the alleged assaults.
Mr Orhon, of Hampton, denies two counts of attempted murder.
He has also pleaded not guilty to two counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
The prosecution says Suzanna Brand, 53, Janet Morsy, 63, Jean Sullivan, 68, and Charandasi Chandiramani, 71, were entirely innocent and selected at random in the car park in south-west London.
The court heard they had suffered appalling injuries after Mr Orhon attacked them with a Leatherman knife, which was shown to the jury.
Ms Brand was stabbed 12 times, including in her back and side that led to two collapsed lungs and laceration to her liver.
Ms Morsy was heard pleading "please don't" shortly before Mr Orhon stabbed her three times. She lost a litre of blood in the attack.
The jury heard that Mr Orhon did not say a word during the attacks, but was eventually stopped by police officers who had to draw their Tasers before he surrendered.
The prosecution said Mr Orhon felt he had been mistreated by the police and that this was his motive for the attacks.
It said the trial would hear of the "true bravery" of members of the public who tried to help, including two school children who may have prevented further attacks by distracting him and calling the police.
The trial continues.
