Tilbrook biker in ditch: IPCC investigates Bedfordshire Police

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bedfordshire Police is being investigated over its involvement in mix-up over county borders which left a crash victim in a ditch for more than two hours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Biker Richard Collins broke his arm in the crash near Tilbrook, Cambridgeshire, which borders Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire.
He was eventually taken to hospital in a Bedfordshire Police car.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating.
Mr Collins, 49, was riding on the B645 with friends when he crashed on 20 September. A 999 call was made shortly before 16:00 BST.
There had been confusion over where the crash happened and therefore which county's emergency services should respond.
Bedfordshire Police said the Northamptonshire force told its staff about the crash at 16:25, but replied saying the accident was not in its patch.
An hour and 15 minutes later, Bedfordshire Police said it was informed that no emergency services had attended so immediately dispatched a police car.
It said due to the distance of travel and difficulties in locating the casualty, the car did not arrive until 18:40.
It was later established the crash occurred in Bedfordshire by a few metres.
Bedfordshire police and crime commissioner Olly Martins said in an open letter last week his force had been receiving "flak", when in fact no ambulance had attended.
East Midlands Ambulance Service, which was alerted to the call, said it could not respond "as quickly as we would have liked".
