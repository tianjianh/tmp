[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 3-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alex Jones' brace helped Port Vale to a home win over 10-man Scunthorpe United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Valiants maintained their 100 per cent home record - and handed the Iron their first defeat of the campaign - with goals from Anton Forrester and Jones, either side of a Josh Morris free-kick.
United's Jordan Clarke was dismissed after picking up his second yellow card in the 55th minute, with boss Graham Alexander sent to the stands in the immediate aftermath.
The home side had the better of the first-half and went ahead in the 33rd minute when Sam Foley received the ball from Kjell Knops and played in Forrester who curled the ball past Luke Daniels.
Morris levelled for Scunthorpe two minutes into first-half injury time when the linesman adjudged his free-kick from the right had crossed the line after evading a host of bodies in the Vale box.
But Jones, on his first start for Vale, secured the points - volleying in Jerome Thomas' deep cross on 49 minutes, before capping a fine display by slotting home Foley's through ball five minutes from time.
