A forensic anthropologist has been helping police since the remains were found at Pentrellyncymer near Cerrigydrudion in November.
His body is believed to have been in the forest for several years.
Police said the man is believed to be aged over 54 and between 5ft 8in (172cm) and 5ft 10in (177cm) tall.
Further forensic tests by experts continue to enable police to establish the circumstances of the death, said Det Supt John Hanson, of North Wales Police, the senior investigating officer.
Mr Hanson said: "The meticulous examination and recovery phase of this operation at the scene at Pentrellyncymer is now complete and the forensic anthropologist continues to examine all the remains.
"The, as yet unidentified, man sustained serious head trauma and whilst the circumstances of his death are unknown at this time the injuries indicate the death is suspicious so detectives will continue to work alongside forensic experts to establish the man's identity and circumstances and cause of his death.
"I am conscious at this stage the description of the man is very limited, and initial indications suggest his remains have been in the forest at Pentrellyncymer for several years.
"However I would still ask if anyone in the community can help me identify this man and offer any information which would progress this investigation to please contact North Wales Police."
