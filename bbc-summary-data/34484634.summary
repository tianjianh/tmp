[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Duck lane' created beside canal to promote manners

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A temporary "duck lane" has been created beside a canal in Powys to remind visitors to share limited space on its towpath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
GlandÅµr Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, took the measure at the Brecon basin on Thursday.
The industrial revolution paths are now "busier than ever" with walkers, cyclists, anglers and animals, it said.
The charity called on visitors to make canals "preserves for old-fashioned good manners".
