[SN]TITLE[SN]
An early farewell to Richard Baker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
And so it is an early farewell to Richard Baker, the able and amiable Labour MSP. Mr Baker had already announced that he intended to step down at the elections in May. But now he has opted to accelerate that to take a job in the Third Sector.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aspiring politicians are motivated by a range of reasons. Ditto when they depart. I well recall one erstwhile Labour cabinet minister telling me of an enduring sense of ennui at the prospect of, once more, "pushing treacle up the hill." Said minister opted to depart.
Mr Baker leaves as he arrived - with a firm note of loyalty to the leadership and comradely support for his party's endeavours.
He praises the ability of Kez Dugdale - while noting in passing that she is "the final leader I have served". That phrase "final leader", of course, summons up - without intent, I feel sure - the difficult and varied history which Labour has experienced in recent years.
Richard Baker formerly worked for Help the Aged and he is now returning to the sector to work for Age Scotland. In his closure is his beginning.
I wish him well, having always found him companionable, thoughtful and decidedly diligent. However, back to that point about the range of motivations which accompany political decisions.
Might Mr Baker's thinking - about the fact and timing of departure - have altered somewhat if Labour seemed better placed to thrive?
He spent a prolonged spell on the party's front bench, advocating and arguing. What if there appeared to be a more probable and serious prospect that he might become a minister, announcing and acting?
In offering her support, Ms Dugdale notes that she is "sad to see him leave Holyrood".  She notes further that he will "be a major asset" in the Third Sector, helping ensure improved provision for elderly people in Scotland.
Mr Baker is replaced at Holyrood by the next candidate on Labour's list, Dundee city councillor Lesley Brennan. She notes that these are "challenging times" for Scottish Labour - truthful and accurate, a good start - but declares her determination to help change that.
PS:  Many, many thanks to the mighty Dundee United for securing a well-deserved cup victory on Saturday, my birthday. I was among the enthusiastic crowd cheering the lads on. It was great to see the team come over to the fans at the end.
Commiserations to Airdrie. But I should note that they missed a trick - and not just on the park. At half time, hundreds of hungry Dundonians headed to the refreshment stalls only to discover that provision was somewhat under-stocked. Up went the anguished, disbelieving cry: "They've run oot o' pehs!"
PPS:  Cannot believe that David Bowie is dead.  He was the sound track of my university years - along with Hendrix, Alex Harvey, Lou Reed and the Floyd.
