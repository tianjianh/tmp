Women's Super League: Casey Stoney does not like plastic pitches

Arsenal defender Casey Stoney says it would be better if Women's Super League matches were only played on grass.

Liverpool Ladies currently play on an artificial surface at the Select Security Stadium in Widnes.
Last month Stoney's England colleague Claire Rafferty refused to play on the pitch, citing injury concerns.
"I don't think it's right, especially if players have to miss out because of it," Stoney said. "Ideally we'd play all our games on grass."
She added: "I don't think you have any 4G pitches in the men's top league. It just puts people at risk, so it's not ideal."
Sunderland's Lucy Staniforth has also criticised the Liverpool pitch, describing it as "absolutely abysmal" and "a serious injury risk".
Last year, the Women's World Cup in Canada was played on artificial turf, despite a legal challenge from leading players.
Clubs in the men's Football League last year voted not to reintroduce artificial pitches.
