Ben Ashworth, from Preston, Lancashire, was diagnosed in 2012 and told he only had months to live.
He was told a week before Sunday's London Marathon that his cancer had spread and he would need surgery.
The father-of-three completed the course in five hours 54 minutes and 56 seconds, raising more than Â£2,000 for cancer charities.
He plans to run another marathon in May.
On Facebook, Mr Ashworth, who ran the race with his wife Louise, said: "Louise has had a rough time in training so I'm very pleased for her.
"We didn't stop smiling the whole way round."
In an earlier post he said it had "been a bit of a shock" to find out the cancer had spread but said he was feeling "very optimistic".
"It's saddening, but it won't beat us... There's a tumour on the scar tissue from my previous liver op.
"I've always been aware that something like this could happen, which is partly why I've worked so hard to get stronger and fitter."
