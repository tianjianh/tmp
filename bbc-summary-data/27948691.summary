Jermaine Grant trial: 'Warning text' in Kenya bomb plot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British man accused of intent to cause explosions sent a text message to an alleged accomplice warning them they were being watched, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland Yard Det Insp John Reilly told the Kenyan court it was among messages sent by defendant Jermaine Grant.
He said the messages were sent to a man referred to as Habib, who was at the time believed to be the partner of British terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite, known as the "White Widow".
Mr Grant denies the charges.
One message, read out in the court in Mombasa, Kenya, by Mr Reilly, said: "There are lions inside. One of them is very watchful. Like a bird watches a stone."
Kenyan police have previously said they believe Mr Grant had links with Ms Lewthwaite, the widow of the 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay.
She is wanted in Kenya in connection with the same case but police have been unable to find her.
Mr Reilly also told the court on Friday that items recovered from Mr Grant - who is also accused of possessing explosive materials - could have been used to make a "highly volatile explosive substance".
The remaining part of the hearing was taken up with a dispute between the defence and prosecution about whether a document by Mr Reilly should be heard by the court, and the case was adjourned until 18 August.
The UK has provided forensic assistance to the Kenyan local authorities in this case, and Mr Grant was arrested in a raid on a flat in Mombasa in December 2011.
One officer with knowledge of the case has previously told the BBC how on the night of Mr Grant's arrest, police raided a number of other addresses associated with him.
At one of these addresses they found a "white lady" who presented a South African passport in the name of Natalie Faye Webb. It later transpired the passport was a fake and Natalie Faye Webb was Ms Lewthwaite.
Police returned some days later to search for her but she had disappeared.
The trial continues.
