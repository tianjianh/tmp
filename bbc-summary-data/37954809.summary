Twelve-year-old Jack Russell Prince disappeared from the home of his owner's friend in Raby Street, Tinsley, late on Saturday.
He was found dumped near some garages, within half a mile of where he went missing.
The RSPCA is appealing for information to trace the driver of a dark-coloured car seen in the area early on Tuesday.
As part of its appeal, it released a photograph of Prince's body inside the suitcase.
Inspector Sandra Dransfield said a witness had described seeing a man get out of a car and leave something in the bottom of a hedge.
She said: "It wasn't until it was getting light that she [the witness] realised it was a blue suitcase and went to investigate. She found Prince inside.
"Whilst there are no obvious signs of trauma to Prince - he literally just looked as though he was asleep - but the way in which he was found is suspicious."
The find comes after Prince's owner, Jasmine Jade Ruby Armstrong, launched a campaign on social media to find him.
