[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stoke City v West Ham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke manager Mark Hughes is hopeful Jon Walters will be available this weekend despite nursing a knee injury.

Jack Butland will keep his place in goal after returning from 13 months out with ankle problems last week.
West Ham striker Andy Carroll has been ruled out again with a groin injury, but Mark Noble and Sam Byram return from suspension.
However, Cheikhou Kouyate, Winston Reid, Arthur Masuaku and Diafra Sakho are all injury doubts for the Hammers.
Simon Brotherton: "There are two clubs who haven't performed as well as they would have hoped this season but have managed to keep a decent buffer between themselves and those anxiously looking over their shoulders at the scramble for Premier League survival.
"A single point separates the teams in the table with Stoke in 11th and West Ham lying 14th - seven points clear of the relegation zone at the moment.
"It's hard to pick a winner here, with Mark Hughes' side having lost five of the last six and West Ham winning only one of the last 10, though they are unbeaten in the last three."

Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "The mood's fine. We're looking forward to the game. It's an important one for us, clearly.
"We were obviously disappointed with the result last weekend but, I've said all season, when we've had a disappointment, more often that not we've bounced back.
"And I fully expect us to have a good performance in front of our home crowd, get past 40 (points) and see if we can finish the season on a high."
West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: "People are talking about who is safe but it is irrelevant. We have four games left, a big game on Saturday and we are looking for points.
"There is a gap between us and mid-table, it is a small gap but with four games to go we are talking about 12 points and we have to concentrate on our next game.
"We are approaching them as four cup finals."
Stoke did not manage their first league win until mid-October and have had quite an up and down season, but I actually think they will finish the campaign strongly.
Five points from their past three matches have taken West Ham clear of the relegation dog-fight, but I still don't see them going to Stoke and winning.
