[SN]TITLE[SN]
Road sign bungle at Chester school 'teaches a lesson'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children were given a lesson in how not to spell when council contractors bungled a painted road sign outside their Chester school.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The yellow sign outside Highfield Community Primary School, Blacon, near the Welsh border, was meant to read "clear" but instead said "claer".
"Claer" has no meaning in English or across the border in Wales.
The sign was wrongly painted on Tuesday and corrected at no cost to Cheshire West and Chester Council earlier.
