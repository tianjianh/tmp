PSNI warn parents about teenage text message 'codes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The PSNI has posted a warning to parents about texting 'codes' that some teenagers use to disguise their phone or online messages.

Referencing a list published by a US technology show, the post encourages parents to understand 'text talk'.
Some of the abbreviations are relatively bland, such as 'HAK', meaning 'hugs and kisses' or 'WYCM' for 'Will you call me?'.
Others refer to sexual acts, drugs and suicide.
The warning has been treated with scepticism by many of the Facebook users who shared or commented on it.
Some pointed out that it was not an exhaustive list and included American phrases that are unlikely to be used by young people in Northern Ireland.
Others welcomed the post, saying it was a useful resource for parents.
Det Supt George Clarke told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster that some of the more obscene messages were a "reality".
"Parents must be involved in their children's lives online and well as offline.
"You wouldn't allow children to go off in a car with people you don't know, so let's be careful about who they're interacting with online," he said.
Margaret Gallagher of the NSPCC said it was impossible to publish a definitive list of texting phrases young people use as they tend to change frequently.
However, she said anything that promoted an "open and honest discussion" about keeping safe online was to be welcomed.
"Teenagers will always want to create coded language that can't be understood by their parents - it's natural and not necessarily something to get overly concerned about," said Ms Gallagher.
"Communication and building trust with your child is the most important thing.
"At the end of the day, you want them to feel comfortable coming to you if they're worried about something that's happened online, like an unsolicited approach or someone putting them in a vulnerable position.
"They (children) just need reassurance that, if things do go badly wrong, they have someone they can turn to."
Ms Gallagher also pointed out that children who have no behavioural issues were equally as vulnerable to online predators as those who do.
But she stressed that older teenagers, in particular, were entitled to privacy.
"It's not always easy for parents to get the balance right - we know that - but if there's trust and openness there, the risk of things going badly wrong is definitely reduced," she said.
