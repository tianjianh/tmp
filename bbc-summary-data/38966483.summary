The woman was attacked in Balham High Road on Friday night.
The man, who is thought to be a potential witness, was seen on Rinaldo Road, Balham, wearing a jacket with an American flag design on the back.
A 41-year-old man from Tooting has been charged with two counts of rape and one count of kidnap/false imprisonment.
The victim had left the 155 bus at 20:30 GMT when she was attacked, forced to a secluded area and raped.
She was taken to hospital for treatment then moved to a Haven Sexual Assault Referral Centre to be given support from specialist officers.
Det Insp Melissa Laremore said police are "keen to trace the male witness" as well as "the victim's distinctive red Marks and Spencer's jacket" which went missing after the attack.
