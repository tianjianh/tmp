Alan Pardew: Former Reading manager 'took club to next level'

Former Reading manager Alan Pardew will have "nothing to prove" when he takes his Crystal Palace side to the Madejski Stadium in the FA Cup quarter-finals, says ex-Royals defender Ady Williams.

Williams played under Pardew when he managed Reading between 1999 and 2003.
"Alan Pardew was the manager who helped take Reading as a club to the next level," Williams told BBC Sport.
Championship team Reading beat West Bromwich Albion 3-1 on Saturday to set up next month's quarter-final tie.
Pardew guided Reading to promotion to the second tier in 2002, but resigned the following year, a month before eventually joining West Ham.

"I think he'll get a good reception," said former Reading club captain Williams, now a presenter for BBC Radio Berkshire.
"A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then and I think the Reading fans appreciate what he did to transform the club.
"Of all the managers I worked with, what he did behind the scenes was incredible. He was up with all the latest gadgets in analysis and sports science.
"He put the backroom staff in place that his successors Steve Coppell and Brian McDermott used so well to get the club promoted to the Premier League."
Reading are in the quarter-finals for the second year in succession, having lost in the semi-finals to Arsenal last season.
