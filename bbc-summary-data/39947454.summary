The 41-year-old has been brought to the club by manager Stephen Baxter after leaving League Two side Mansfield Town.
Regular goalkeeper Sean O'Neill will be out of action for around four months as he continues his rehabilitation from surgery.
Jensen has also played for West Brom, Bury and Crawley Town.

The 6'5'' goalkeeper played 38 times in the Premier League for Burnley and his acquisition is being hailed as a major coup by the Seaview club.
"I am delighted to sign for Crusaders and I look forward to getting involved with pre-season and getting to know the lads," said Jensen.
"I have heard good things about them from Michael Dougherty and I just now want to get the shirt on and show what I can do"
"It is a quality signing and we know what this will do for Crusaders Football Club. It is not everyday a professional of this calibre is offered and we had no hesitation in getting Brian over to sign the one year deal," commented Crusaders chairman Stephen Bell.
Crusaders have also signed former Portadown striker Mark McAllister, while midfielder Richard Clarke has left the club to join Ballinamallard United.
