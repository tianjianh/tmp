A woman who died in a crash has been described as "a loving grandmother".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tydfil Jenkins, 80, was heading home after taking cake to her friend when she was knocked over on Bethania Street, Maesteg, Bridgend county, on Tuesday evening.
A 35-year-old will appear in court on Thursday charged with causing her death by careless or inconsiderate driving.
Mrs Jenkins' family described her as a bingo loving straight-talker who would be missed.
The man, from Maesteg, has also been charged with causing death by driving unlicensed or uninsured, causing death by driving while disqualified and fraud by false representation.
He will appear at Cardiff Magistrates' Court.
In a tribute, Mrs Jenkins' family said: "Tydfil was a much loved mother to Terry, Hayley and the late Wendy and was also a loving grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother.
"Tydfil loved going to the bingo with her friends and she was a straight-forward woman - what you saw was what you got.
"She would say: 'Take me as I am, if you don't like it, tough!' That's just who she was."
