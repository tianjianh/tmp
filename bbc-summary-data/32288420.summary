[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Kennedy, of no fixed abode, admitted attacking his girlfriend in a house in Ballymagroarty on 2 March.
A judge examined the photographs of the injuries suffered by Kennedy's now ex-girlfriend.
He said Kennedy had launched a violent and disgraceful attack on his victim.
The court heard she sustained a serious cut to her face.
It was told that when Kennedy first appeared in court charged with the offence he was remanded in custody, but two days later he was released on High Court bail.
The following week he was arrested by police for being drunk in Newtownstewart and for carrying a knife.
