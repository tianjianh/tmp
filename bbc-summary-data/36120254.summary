Shakespeare Day: BBC Sport readers send in their sonnets on 400th anniversary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare's death, the famous playwright and poet is being celebrated throughout the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Here at BBC Sport, we asked you to pitch in as part of our Saturday football live page.
So, which footballer or manager would you liken to a Shakespearean character? Which of his plays best sums up your season?
There were loads of responses - but the best lines came from those who went a step further and composed their own sonnets...
How about this from English teacher and Crystal Palace fan Dan?
Shall I compare thee to Stoke City away?
The icy potteries are not so temperate
We question if cold December Tuesday
Is the mark of a player we rate.
Sometimes too hot the glare of media shines
And often is a showboater dimm'd
From every foul to foul he does decline
By lack of support from those around him.
But Leicester's eternal summer will not fade
Nor lose possession from a foul unfairest.
Nor shall United brag how much they paid
For Vardy, Drinkwater or Mahrez.
So long as Ranieri breathes and eyes can see
The Premier League goes to Leicester City.
Naturally, Leicester closing in on the Premier League title was a rich source of inspiration.
John Rogers: Raneiri is a reincarnated Romeo: a romantic who refuses to accept that LCFC aren't allowed the title. Will it end in tragedy?
But Mick S had these words of warning: One from Cymbeline for the Tinkerman to think about: 'Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.'
As you might have guessed, former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho also made an appearance...
Andrew Lockett: Mourinho as Macbeth. Delusions of self-importance, always blaming those around him and occasional public breakdown.
Ben, Hampshire: Jose Mourinho is Richard II. Regarded self as being anointed King by God and lived a majestic life as a capricious yet poetic despot. His own arrogance eventually brought him down as his nobles rebelled against him after he banished one in blaming him for his own mistakes.
As did Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal...
Mr Hunt: To attack or not to attack, that is the LvG question./Whether 'tis easier on the eye to endure /A 0-0 at half-time, and then win 1-0 /Or to fling that clipboard to the floor /And play thy beautiful game!
They must be close: True is it that United have seen better days... But a final! A final! My kingdom for an FA Cup final!
Arsene Wenger as King Lear anyone? Sheikh from London makes the case:
Wenger is King Lear; a once-great leader whose success has established him and his people great stability. But he lost touch with reality (our noble defence now a helpless mess) somewhere along the line, has been deserted by those supposedly most loyal to him (Vieira, van Persie, Fabregas) and sent away those who loved him most (Henry). Time will tell if Wenger/Arsenal realises any of this before it's too late.
And to Samson, also from London, we doff our caps for this sterling effort by way of Twelfth Night...
If football be the food of love, play on;
Give me excess of it, that, struggling,
The Arsenal title bid may sicken, and so die.
That March again! it had a dying fall:
O, it came o'er my ear like the silent sound,
That comes from a bank of fans,
Paying and giving nothing!
Enough; no more:
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
O spirit of Bellerin! how quick and fresh art thou,
That, notwithstanding thy capacity
To pass the ball, nought enters the goal.
But what we shall be next year,
A title and a ticket with low price,
Even in a minute: so full of hope is belief
Though it is all high fantastical.
Meanwhile, Jed Fry from Bath had this mash-up featuring Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino as Henry V.
"Henry 'Mauricio' V to his Spurs troops: I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start. The game's afoot : follow your spirit, and upon this charge cry 'God for Harry, England and St George!"
'Frustrated and dispirited' Everton fan Paddy Joe had this Macbeth-inspired take on Roberto Martinez's future at Goodison Park:
If 'twere done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly
If the sacking could trammel up the consequence and catch with his surcease success
That but this blow might be the be-all and end-all here
But here upon this bank and shoal of time, Martinez would jump the life to come
And A Boy Called Mick was also inspired, with the Toffees heading to Wembley.
Is this a Cup I see before me?/Or merely a brave farewell/The game afoot will fortell /And reveal thy final destiny /Roberto
But of course, the tragedy many of you leaned on was Aston Villa's relegation to the Championship, Phil included.
Give the devil his timely due; there was method in his madness.
Neither a borrower or a lender to be, could alter this tragic sadness.
The fans doth protest too much; more sinned against than sinning.
A team lacking in pitched battle, that's also never winning.
It's Greek to me, this relegation, a sad forgone conclusion.
Frailty thy name is Villa, the Championship has now its inclusion.
Tony Sheehan: Surely Aston Villa would be Bottom. Last year's FA Cup final only a Midsummer's Night's Dream...
