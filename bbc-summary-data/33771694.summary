Charlbury O2 mobile signal 'problems continuing'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mobile phone users in an Oxfordshire village insist their mobile phone service is still inadequate, following work on a mast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vodafone and O2 customers in Charlbury were left without text, calls or data services while a mast was "decommissioned" before a 4G upgrade.
The work was expected to be completed last week but campaigners say there is only a low-powered 2G signal available.
O2 has yet to comment but previously said the upgrade would be "worth it".
Residents and businesses first complained at an initial outage in July when O2 work began on the mast, shared with Vodafone, at the town's fire station.
Trevor Taylor, who set up Charlbury Areas Mobile Phone Users (CAMPUS) said there was "no warning whatsoever" at the loss of all mobile signal.
Services were due to be restored on 28 July, but Mr Taylor said there had been little improvement and had been told a temporary 2G mast was in operation until work to upgrade to 4G later in the year.
"If you are close to the mast, you probably have some sort of service. If you're not close to the mast, you either have very poor service or no service.
"It's galvanised people into action. If we band together we have more influence," he said.
O2 has offered Mr Taylor a refund of a month of his subscription after it upheld a complaint made by him.
A spokeswoman for Vodafone previously said its policy was to reimburse customers with the line rental charge for the amount of time they had been unable to use their phone, if it was three days or more.
