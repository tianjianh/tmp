Margaret Atwood, Madeleine Thien and Sarah Perry are among the 16 finalists for this year's international Women's Prize for Fiction.

Atwood's Shakespeare-inspired Hag-Seed is nominated alongside Perry's The Essex Serpent, which was named Waterstones Book of the Year in 2016.
Only three debut novelists - Ayobami Adebayo, Emma Flint and Fiona Melrose - have made the longlist.
The contenders will be whittled down to a shortlist on 3 April.
The winner of the Â£30,000 prize will then be announced on 7 June.
This year's judges are Aminatta Forna, Katie Derham, Tessa Ross, Sam Baker and Sara Pascoe.
The prize is open to female English-language writers from around the world, and this year's longlist includes authors from Nigeria, South Africa, Canada, the US, the UK and Ireland.
This year's prize is the last one that will be sponsored by Baileys.
The company announced earlier this year it had "regretfully decided to make way for a new sponsor" in order to work on new global projects.
Lisa McInerney won the prize last year with her debut novel, The Glorious Heresies.
