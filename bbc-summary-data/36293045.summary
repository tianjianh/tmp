Services between Birmingham New Street and Cheltenham were cancelled following the crash at Abbotswood, Worcestershire.
A man was spotted running from the tractor after it struck the bridge shortly after 21:10 BST on Friday.
Network Rail said services have been now restored.
A train travelling from Cardiff to Birmingham hit the debris at 21:30 BST and although it was damaged it did not derail.
The tractor had been reported stolen from a farm in Drakes Broughton, Pershore.
A Network Rail spokeswoman said Cross Country services south of Birmingham towards Bristol, Exeter and Plymouth, had earlier been cancelled.
"A tractor, believed to be stolen, hit and demolished the parapet above a railway bridge, causing debris to fall onto the track below," she added.
West Mercia Police said the suspect was described as a white man in his early 20s, wearing a purple hooded top and dark trousers.
