[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Benny Collins, 40, died at Three Cliffs Bay on Gower in July 2015 - the third person to die there in two years.
The physiotherapist at Morriston Hospital's A&E department was flown to hospital where colleagues tried to save him.
Acting coroner Colin Phillips said his death was accidental and called it "a terrible tragedy".
Mr Collins' son Harry was taken to hospital, but released later.
The hearing was told Mr Collins and his son were like "two peas in a pod" and had gone to spend some "quality time together" at Three Cliffs Bay.
They ran into the sea together holding hands, but once in the water, a wave knocked them off their feet.
Harry was carried back towards shore but Mr Collins was swept out to sea by a strong riptide.
The inquest in Swansea heard Mr Collins was a passionate sportsman and a good swimmer.
Michael Hanby, an off-duty paramedic, ran into the water to help three people who were calling for help as they struggled against the strong current at the same time.
He said it took 35 minutes to help two girls and a man out of the water and described a young boy being distressed about his dad still being in the sea.
Mr Collins was eventually pulled from the water on the third attempt by a Coastguard helicopter team before being taken to Morriston hospital at 15:14 where he was pronounced dead despite numerous attempts to resuscitate him.
In a tribute, Mr Collins' wife Mel said: "Benny was such a kind and lovely man and was loved by everyone who knew him."
The month before Mr Collins drowned, Jason North from Macclesfield, Cheshire, died trying to get his children out of the water.
In August 2013, Wendy Phillips of Swansea also died at the same spot.
