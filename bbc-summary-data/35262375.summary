Alex McLoughlin, from Liverpool, accidentally left the rings, worth Â£5,500, behind on the train at Birmingham New Street.
CCTV pictures showed a cleaner picking up items where she had been sitting.
The rings were later found at his house and Osman Salhi of Gladstone Street, Birmingham, was arrested.
The 38-year-old was given a 12-month community order and told to complete 240 hours of unpaid work and 20 days of rehabilitation activity, when he was found guilty of theft at Birmingham Magistrates Court in December.
Salhi was also ordered to pay costs of Â£1,620.

Mrs McLoughlin, 36, took off the platinum and diamond rings to moisturise her hands and then dropped them when she showed her tickets to the conductor.
She realised what had happened when she left the train at New Street and contacted lost property, who told her the rings had not been handed in.
They were eventually retrieved by PC Rob Kelly of British Transport Police after he checked CCTV.
Mrs McLoughlin said she could not thank him enough.
"You have stopped at nothing to get this result and I am utterly astounded you managed to retrieve them - no one can believe it," she said.
PC Kelly said theft from passenger was a priority for the force.
"As an officer, it was a truly rewarding experience to successfully locate, seize and return items of such sentimental value to Mrs McLoughlin and this final news of Salhi's conviction is the icing on the cake," he said.
