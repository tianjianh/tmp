The 20-year-old midfielder will join up with Canadian outfit for pre-season training in Arizona next week.
And he will remain based in his homeland for the campaign, which runs from March until October.
Aird made his Rangers debut in 2012 but has only featured as a substitute on four occasions for the Championship leaders this season.
"Delighted to have signed for @WhitecapsFC on loan for the season," wrote Aird on Twitter. "Looking forward to the challenges ahead. Can't wait to get started."
