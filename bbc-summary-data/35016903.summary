Eileen Mullan said that while many organisations displayed creativity and openness, others were lagging behind.
"They're not prepared to look outside, and that's unfortunate," she told the BBC's Inside Business programme.
"I think they lose the opportunity to get that fresh perspective, they lose the opportunity to be a part of a wider voice."
Ms Mullan added: "If companies were to support and release their staff to volunteer on boards, they in return would get strategic thinkers in their workplace and so much value, but they're missing that opportunity."
Inside Business was first broadcast on Sunday on BBC Radio Ulster and Radio Foyle, and is available to listen to again online.
