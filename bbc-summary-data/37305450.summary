The Belgian, 24, who was named as one of Europe's three Ryder Cup wildcard picks last month, was stung during a challenge match on Monday.
Pieters said the sting led to a "major allergic reaction with flu symptoms".
"I owe it to you guys to defend my title next year," the world number 41 added in a post on social media.
There is no indication the allergic reaction will prevent Pieters from competing in the Ryder Cup, which starts at Hazeltine in Minnesota on 30 September.
