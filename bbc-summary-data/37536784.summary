Almost 300 searches have been carried out since Operation Torus began on 5 September and 75 people have been arrested.
It is part of a campaign to tackle street level drug dealing.
Det Ch Supt Andrea McMullan said drugs remained a "policing priority due to the detrimental effects they can cause to individuals and communities".
"Latest overall figures show that from August 2015 to August 2016 there have been 5,308 drugs seizures across Northern Ireland and 2,797 drugs related arrests," she said.
"Seizures are slightly up (0.2%) while arrests are down (-5.2%) for the same period the previous year.
"The seizure of £2,760,832 worth of drugs over the past three weeks is ongoing proof that our commitment to acting upon information provided by communities has paid off."
Operation Torus will continue until 16 October.
