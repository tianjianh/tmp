[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Steven Williams, 29, who was based with the British Transport Police at Finsbury Park in north London, had gone into the sea off Brighton beach.
He entered the sea at Kings Road Arches on Sunday at 23:40 GMT. A woman who went into the water to help him managed to get out and raise the alarm.
He was rescued after a major air and sea search but died later in hospital.
Chief Constable Paul Crowther said: "Steven had his whole career ahead of him and he will be terribly missed by his colleagues and friends here.
"As we can all imagine this is going to be a very difficult time for those who knew him, so I ask that we all pull together to support each other."
