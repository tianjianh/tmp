[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saili won his only two All Blacks Test caps in 2013, featuring in victories against Argentina and Japan.
The 26-year-old spent two seasons with Pro12 side Munster, having previously played for the Blues in Super Rugby.
"I've been mightily impressed with him as a person and I know he's a great rugby player," Quins director of rugby John Kingston told BBC Radio London.
"He's an excellent rugby player; you don't get to play for the All Blacks at 22 years of age unless you can play."
