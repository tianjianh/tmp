The 20-year-old, who is the younger brother of Cornish-born Fiji internationals Josh and Sam, left the Pro12 side in the summer and had been playing for hometown side Camborne.
"Joel just wants to try and challenge himself a bit more," said Redruth head coach Marek Churcher.
"He wants to progress and get another professional contract somewhere."
Matavesi came through the Exeter youth ranks before joining Scarlets as an 18-year-old in 2014.
His first-team opportunities were limited, however, and he played just five games in the British and Irish Cup last season.
"Joel's only 20 years old but he brings a wealth of experience and we're really happy with that," Churcher told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"He sees the game differently to most people which is a good thing, so I can learn off him and he can learn off others as well.
"Hopefully he can reach his potential and do what he wants to."
