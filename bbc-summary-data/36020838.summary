Thousands of Edinburgh pupils in limbo following school closures

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 2,300 pupils have been left in limbo following the closure of 17 schools across Edinburgh over building safety fears.

Contingency plans have been put in place for S4, S5 and S6 pupils at three of the five closed high schools with plans due to be released on the other two soon.
However, S1 to S3 pupils are still without any information.
All primary and special needs pupils will be back in classrooms by 19 April.
The council said that all pupils would be off school on Monday 18 April as it is a public holiday in the city.
About 7,000 pupils were unable to return to their classrooms on Monday after the Easter break.
Council officials said S4, S5 and S6 pupils from Firrhill, Drummond and Royal High would be able to return to their own schools on Wednesday.
They said an update for S4, S5 and S6 pupils at Gracemount and Craigmount High would be released later on Tuesday once arrangements were finalised.
The problems were first uncovered in January when a wall at Oxgangs Primary collapsed during high winds.
Further closures were prompted after workers repairing serious structural issues at the primary found "further serious defects" with the building on Friday.
The city council said urgent work would need to be carried out on at least four of the schools: two high schools Gracemount and Craigmount, and two primaries - Oxgangs and St Peter's.
The initial problem was discovered with wall ties, which hold the outer and inner walls together, at Oxgangs Primary School.
An additional issue on Friday was then found with head ties, which hold the top of the walls to the steel roof frame, at all four schools.
In all, 10 primaries, five secondaries and two additional support needs schools have been shut, as well as a neighbourhood centre.
All of the schools, which are about 10 years old, were constructed under the same public private partnership contract.
A first phase was built by a combination of Miller Construction and Amey - with seven built by other contractors.
A second phase of four schools were all built by Miller. Miller Construction was later acquired by Galliford Try in 2014, who also took contractual responsibility for the second phase schools - now found to require emergency work to remedy defects.
The firm said: "Galliford Try takes its role as a responsible contractor very seriously and the safety of the pupils and staff is paramount."
Award-winning architect Malcolm Fraser warned of the scale of the challenge facing the City of Edinburgh Council to keep on top of safety issues at the schools.
Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said it was extremely difficult to pinpoint all structural issues.
He said: "The issue is, when everything is covered up, it's very hard to tell where these other things and other problems might lie.
"So when you do look at political demands for why haven't all schools been checked etc, you almost have to take a school to bits to find out that these issues are there.
"And you don't really understand that there is a problem until something catastrophic goes wrong as it has at Oxgangs, which has led all these other inspections to happen."
Concerns have been raised about the need to accommodate senior pupils who are due to sit exams soon and have coursework and assessments to complete.
Many parents have also expressed anger and frustration at having to arrange extra childcare at such short notice.
Edinburgh University, the Scottish Parliament, community groups, venues and private sector companies have all offered help.
The local authority confirmed that structural surveys would continue to be carried out this week.
Meanwhile, every other Scottish council has carried out, or is going to carry out, surveys of school buildings that could be affected.
