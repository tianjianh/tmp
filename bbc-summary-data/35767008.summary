The scheme is based on the "Games Makers" used at the London Olympics and the charity which is funding it is giving £2.85m towards the project, the council said.
Martin Green, chief executive officer of Hull 2017, said it was a "vital" role needed throughout the year.
Almost 1,000 people have expressed an interest so far, the authority said.
Mr Green said: "Hull's volunteers will play vital roles before, during and after the city's year of life-changing culture.
"Every individual selected will be a unique ambassador for the city of Hull and for culture."
City undergoing revamp
London Olympics legacy charity Spirit of 2012 said it was "particularly pleased to be supporting this volunteering scheme".
Vice-chair Jane Lady Gibson said: "It will enable so many members of the community to get involved in their own city's big moment and, living in the area myself and as a University of Hull graduate, I understand first-hand the positive effect something like this will have on the city and the people of Hull."
A series of community road show events will be held in the city during April and May to encourage people to take part.
Applications are open to people across the UK, who are aged 16 and over.
Hull is undergoing a £25m revamp ahead of next year's festival.
Streets are being repaved and new lighting installed to highlight the city's landmark buildings.
More than £15m is being spent refurbishing the New Theatre and the Ferens Art Gallery.
