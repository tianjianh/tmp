Hopkins, a multiple world champion at middleweight and light-heavyweight, will contest his 65th bout at the Los Angeles Forum on 17 December.
"A lot of people will focus on my age, the history of my run in the sport, the titles, but I'm focused on one thing - knocking Joe Smith out," said Hopkins.
Hopkins made his pro debut in 1988.
That fight, a loss to Clinton Mitchell, took place 11 months before Hopkins' next opponent was born.
The veteran American has since won 55 of his bouts with 32 knockouts.
He won his first world title in 1995, at the age of 30, before defending his middleweight crown 20 times.
His most recent fight, for the WBA, IBF and WBO light-heavyweight titles in November 2014, ended in a points loss to Russia's Sergey Kovalev.
American Smith, 27, has lost only one fight since his 2009 debut, compiling a 22-1 record with 18 knockouts.
