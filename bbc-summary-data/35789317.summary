Swansea boy, 10, first to get new bionic hand in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Swansea schoolboy has become the first child in Wales to receive a new state-of-the-art bionic hand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan, 10, of Loughor, had both hands amputated at the age of three after complications arising from an infection.
His mother Hannah Jones, 32, managed to raise Â£30,000 in eight months so he could get an i-limb quantum hand.
She said: "It's made a huge difference to his life - he's more confident."
Alan underwent almost 40 operations during his early years due to a heart defect, but an infection which affected his circulation meant he needed a double hand amputation to save his life.
Last year, Ms Jones discovered the i-limb quantum, made by Touch Bionics, was available in Scotland and raised the money from donors.
The "multi-articulating" hand is the first prosthesis to allow wearers to change grips with a simple gesture, according to its manufacturer.
"He's now able to write one-handed, he's able to ride a bike, he's able to eat with a knife and fork, which is something he's always wanted to do," Ms Jones said.
"I can't thank everybody who's helped us enough - to see how much happier it has made him, I'm happy for him. It's been long and hard but we got there."
Alan's mother said he now hopes to realise his dream of becoming a special needs teacher and, perhaps, one day a head teacher.
She would like to raise enough money for him to get a second bionic hand, which he could have fitted when he is aged 12.
