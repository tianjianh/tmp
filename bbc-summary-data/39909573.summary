[SN]TITLE[SN]
Monaco 4-0 Lille

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Monaco all but sealed their first Ligue 1 title since 2000 after Radamel Falcao scored twice in a straight-forward home victory against mid-table Lille.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Falcao nodded in his 20th league goal of the season from close range before Kylian Mbappe's trickery left Bernardo Silva with a simple tap-in before the break.
Teenage forward Mbappe turned provider again when his cushioned square pass allowed Falcao to volley in the third.
And there was more misery for Lille when away defender Junior Alonso diverted Thomas Lemar's dangerous low cross into his own goal.
Leonardo Jardim's side are three points above reigning champions Paris St-Germain, who have one game left, and have a far superior goal difference.
But PSG, who have been hoping to be crowned French champions for a fifth successive season, thrashed seventh-placed Saint-Etienne in a 5-0 away win to stop Monaco mathematically clinching the title on Sunday.
Monaco will, however, wrap up the title on Wednesday with a point at home to Saint-Etienne.
PSG delayed the inevitable as two goals apiece for Edinson Cavani and Lucas Moura, plus an injury-time strike from Julian Draxler, secured an easy win.
