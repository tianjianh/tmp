Betsy, 3, who has Down's syndrome and impaired hearing and vision, was on the Weardale Polar Express when he approached and struck up a conversation in Makaton.
Her mother, Kay Scott, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, posted the footage on Facebook and it gained about 50,000 views.
Kay said: "Immediately she was put at ease, because she understood - it just made her first experience of Santa magical."
Bob Thompson, Father Christmas on the train, from St John's Chapel in County Durham, learned sign language during his time as a social worker.
He said: "It gave Betsy an opportunity to ask Santa what she wanted for Christmas, it empowered her to talk on her own outside a school or home environment.
"She asked me for a teddy bear to put under her Christmas tree, because she had been a very good girl."
