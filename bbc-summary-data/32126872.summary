Two men have been rescued after their tug boat capsized in Southampton Water.

The men were working on the tug Asterix at the Fawley marine terminal when it turned over in strong winds just after 20:00 BST on Monday.
The first crew member managed to jump clear and swim to safety.
The second crew member was trapped in the upturned boat for more than an hour before a colleague spotted his arm through the window and dived in to save him, moments before it sank.
The stricken tug had been under tow to shallower water when rescuers realised the missing crew member was still inside.
Both the crewman and his rescuer were pulled from the water by the RNLI lifeboat crew.
Matt West of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: "It was such a severe incident to happen to a vessel - in the conditions it's fantastic that both of them were able to get away safely."
The trapped man was taken to hospital suffering from hypothermia.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) is investigating the accident.
