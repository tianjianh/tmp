The home side lead 7-5 after eight singles matches in the afternoon session were shared. In the morning foursomes, GB&I opened up a 3-1 lead.
Ireland's Gavin Moynihan, 20, was the star for the hosts on day one, earning maximum points from his two matches.
He and countryman Jack Hume saw off Lee and Mike McCoy in foursomes, before a fine singles win over Jordan Niebrugge.
Rising US star Niebrugge and Ireland's Paul Dunne, both 22, impressed in this year's Open Championship, but the pair struggled in Saturday's windy conditions on the Lancashire coast, finishing the day empty-handed.
The format of morning foursomes and afternoon singles will be repeated in Sunday's concluding sessions.
