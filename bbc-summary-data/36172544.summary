[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bartosz Ojeda-Rodriguez, 35, Stanislaw Czyz, 29, and Andrzej Pawel Czyz, 31, were found guilty of murdering Tomasz Bachta.

Piotr Miezal, 33, was convicted of manslaughter after acting as a lookout for the other defendants.

A trial at Stafford Crown Court heard Mr Bachta was attacked after working a night shift, two days after a previous altercation in a doctor's surgery car park with some of the defendants.
He had been attacked with baseball bats, a sickle and other weapons, and police officers found him lying unconscious in the road.
A sickle found nearby had the DNA of Ojeda-Rodriguez on the handle, the court heard.
A post-mortem examination confirmed he died from a stab wound to the neck that severed a major artery.
Ojeda-Rodriguez, from Hunter Street in Burton; Stanislaw Czyz, of Byrkley Street, Burton; and Andrzej Czyz, of Byrkley Street, Burton, were all jailed for life, and will serve a minimum of 20 years each.
Miezal, of Pershore Drive in Burton, will serve nine years in prison.
Sentencing, Judge Michael Chambers QC described the defendants' behaviour as "particularly reprehensible".
"None of you have shown any remorse for what you did," he said.
"This was, in my judgement, a cold and ruthless joint attack."
In a statement Mr Bachta's family said there was "no explanation for such a horrific action" that left them with "overwhelming grief".
They said: "We will not accept Tomek's death for the rest of our lives and will never forget those responsible for it."
