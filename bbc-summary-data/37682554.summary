[SN]TITLE[SN]
Owen Creaney murder: Stephen Hughes 'unaware' of fatal injuries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man on trial for murdering a man whose body was found in a bin at his house has said he was unaware of the severity of the victim's injuries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Thomas Hughes and his co-accused Shaunean Boyle are jointly charged with murdering Owen Creaney in Craigavon, County Armagh, in 2014
The 40-year-old victim was severely beaten in an attack at Mr Hughes' home.
Mr Hughes said Mr Creaney "wasn't making any noise" when they washed the injured man and changed his clothes.
The victim, from Lurgan, County Armagh, was attacked after he had been drinking with both of the accused at Mr Hughes' home in Moyrafety Court.
His wounded body was then carried up the stairs where he was showered and changed twice.
Mr Creaney died from his injuries two days later and his remains were then dumped into a green recycling bin.
Both Mr Hughes and Ms Boyle, from Edenderry Park in Banbridge, County Down, have said they were not involved in the attack the early hours of Thursday July 3, and have pointed the finger of blame at each other.
Giving evidence at Belfast Crown Court for the second day, Mr Hughes again denied he had assaulted Mr Creaney, saying that Ms Boyle had punched, kicked and stamped on the victim in the hallway of his home.
Mr Creaney's injuries included a total of 15 fractured ribs and a broken breastbone, as well as bleeding of and tearing to the brain.
A prosecuting barrister said being showered and changed twice must have been "agony" for the victim, as he had "several fractured ribs on both sides".
At this point, Mr Hughes said he did notice a bruise on Mr Creaney's chest the second time they changed him.
However, he added that Mr Creaney "wasn't making any noise" at the time.
"I honestly didn't know he had any broken ribs or anything," Mr Hughes told the court.
When he was asked about the state of Mr Creaney's face after the attack, the accused said he noticed the victim had "two black eyes and a wee cut to his lip" after Ms Boyle had washed him.
The prosecution barrister then asked Mr Hughes what he thought was going to happen to Mr Creaney's remains after they were placed in the bin.
"You knew you wanted to put him in the bin. What was going to happen next?"
Mr Hughes replied: "I can't give you a straight answer on that.  I do not know."
The trial continues.
