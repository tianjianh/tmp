Alastair Cook has been unveiled as a patron of the Friends of Newport Cathedral Choir.
Cook spent five years as a member of St Paul's Cathedral School's choir as a boy.
He said: "Music was a huge part of my life growing up and created some very special memories for me."
Director of music at Newport Cathedral, Dr Emma Gibbins, said: "I am delighted that Alastair Cook has agreed to be patron... as a former chorister of St Paul's Cathedral who has gone on to great things, he can be an inspiration and role model for the current choristers and future generations of choristers at Newport Cathedral."
Cook, England's leading Test run scorer, added: "It is great to be asked to be a patron of the Friends of Newport Cathedral Choir. I still use many of the skills I learnt as a chorister today."
