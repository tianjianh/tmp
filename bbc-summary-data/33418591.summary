Stuart Cullen, 52, from Lowestoft, died in the massacre at Sousse on 26 June.
Christine and Emma-Jayne Cullen, his wife and daughter, said: "He lived for his girls and juggled life at home being medically retired from the prison service.
"We would like to thank everyone for all their ongoing help and support at this difficult time."
Their statement, issued through Suffolk Police, described the family as The Three Muskateers and said Mr Cullen had a "wicked sense of humour and only ever wanted to put a smile on people's faces".
"He was Dad, husband, best friend and soulmate. The legacy he leaves is his strength - the strength to move forward whatever that may look like," said the family.
"Not to mourn but to celebrate his life and what he had accomplished. Gone but never forgotten."
