In a statement they said: "Megan had a passion for music and loved going to concerts. She loved socialising and loved having family get-togethers.
"She also loved to have her friends over for sleepovers or just to have catch-ups."
Megan had been given tickets for the concert as a birthday surprise.
"Cruelly taken from us on a night she had waited so long for. No words can describe how we feel right now, other than our hearts are broken and our lives are shattered," the statement continued.
Her parents added: "Goodnight. God bless. Beauty Queen."
Megan's elder brother, Bradley, 20, was seriously injured in the attack.
