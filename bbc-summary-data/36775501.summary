The Championship club have not disclosed the amount but have confirmed it is more than the £20,000 paid for midfielder Russell Penn in 2009.
MK Dons boss Karl Robinson had said that their asking price for McFadzean, 29, was £500,000.
"We watched him extensively and think he was the best centre-half in League One," said Burton boss Nigel Clough.
"He's a good age and has matured as a player. He's probably at his peak and has hardly missed a game for the last two years."
McFadzean scored four goals in 93 appearances during two years with MK Dons, who were relegated from the second tier last season.
"I think he'll be better this time making the step up, thanks to his previous experience in the Championship," added Clough.
"We think he will be a help for us in the Championship. He leads by example on the pitch."
Dons boss Robinson said: "I'm deeply disappointed to lose Kyle. We had meetings with him in the summer.
"He knows what our ambitions are for next season and going forward, but he's decided his future lies elsewhere.
"It's been a testing time but we've been strong and stuck to our principles, showing respect to our players and our fans. This deal is in the best interest of the football club."
