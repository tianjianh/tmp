Police said the "horrific attack" on the toddler took place in Kirkside Court, Leven, at 17:00 on Wednesday.
The girl was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy with serious facial injuries.
The dog was medium sized and similar to a Staffordshire bull terrier. The owner was not seen and has not been traced.
Officers said the girl was in a car park with her mother and a female family friend at the time of the attack.
The dog was black with a white underside and full length tail. It also had a white tail tip and was wearing a red collar with reflective markings.
Sgt Craig Fyall said:  "This was a horrific attack on a toddler, who has had to be hospitalised as a result of this incident.
"Fortunately the injuries are not likely to lead to permanent disfigurement, nevertheless it is important that we trace this dog and its owner as soon as possible.
"I would urge anyone who witnessed this attack, or recognises the description of the dog, to get in touch with us immediately."
