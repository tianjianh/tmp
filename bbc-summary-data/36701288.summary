[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour deputy leader Tom Watson is to hold emergency talks on Tuesday with union leaders in a fresh attempt to put pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to resign.

Sources close to Mr Watson said it was "the last throw of the dice".
Mr Watson told a meeting of Labour MPs he had asked Mr Corbyn to step down but he was given no indication he would.
It comes after Mr Corbyn made a direct appeal to the party to unite, after a week in which he lost the support of the majority of his MPs.
Former shadow business secretary Angela Eagle has said she will run against Mr Corbyn unless he steps down, saying she has enough support to mount a challenge to resolve the "impasse" in the party.
Mr Corbyn, facing a likely leadership challenge after a vote of no confidence by MPs, posted a video message on Monday to "talk directly" to Labour members.
He said he had a "huge responsibility" as leader, and added: "I am carrying out that responsibility and I am carrying on with that responsibility."
He urged colleagues to "come together now" and oppose the Conservative government, claiming Labour had "forced them back" in a number of policy areas.

In what sources close to Tom Watson are describing as "the last throw of the dice", the leaders of the four biggest Labour-supporting unions will be urged to broker a settlement with Jeremy Corbyn which would see him step aside.
It is not clear what the offer to Mr Corbyn will be, and some members of the parliamentary Labour party told the BBC that there were strict limits to any areas on which they would compromise.
If no deal is possible then it's likely that either of two recent shadow cabinet members - Angela Eagle or Owen Smith  - would challenge Jeremy Corbyn head-on and try to unseat him.
Mr Corbyn said party membership was the highest it had been in his lifetime, adding: "That membership wants and expects all of us... to work together in their interests."
But addressing a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Monday evening, Mr Watson said he had told Mr Corbyn he needed the support of his MPs, and not just party members, if he wanted to stay in post.
He said he had received no indication Mr Corbyn would step down as leader and so he would meet with union leaders to try to broker some kind of compromise.
"If nothing comes out of that, then in the coming days we will see a leadership challenge, probably from Angela Eagle," said BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young.
Last week's vote of no confidence in Mr Corbyn, which is not binding, followed mass resignations from his shadow cabinet, triggered by complaints about his efforts in the EU referendum campaign.
In response, there have been demonstrations in support of the leader from Labour members, who overwhelmingly chose him as leader last year.
BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mr Corbyn's critics appeared to be waiting until after Wednesday's publication of Sir John Chilcot's report into the Iraq War inquiry before making their move.
Speaking to the media outside her home, Ms Eagle, who was shadow business secretary in Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, said: "It's a week since Jeremy lost that vote of no confidence and there are many other people up and down the country wanting him to consider his position."
She claimed Mr Corbyn was "not properly engaged", even with deputy leader Tom Watson, saying: "There are many people, MPs, party members up and down the country asking me to resolve this impasse and I will if something isn't done soon."
She added: "I have the support to run and resolve this impasse and I will do so if Jeremy doesn't take action soon."
But shadow chancellor John McDonnell denied access to the leader was being restricted, saying "he has had an open door policy all the way through."
In a message to Mr Corbyn's critics, he said: "It would be better if those MPs who have stood down from their positions thought again and started working again, supporting the party in opposition."
He also rejected a claim in the Daily Mirror that Mr Corbyn was "enjoying" the tussle, saying he was enjoying being Labour leader but that "nobody wants to go through these sort of problems".
On Sunday, Unite leader Len McCluskey said the "coup" against Mr Corbyn "has failed" and trade union leaders should broker a deal between the two sides.
Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA Union called on Monday's Today programme for "cool heads" and accused those wishing to challenge Jeremy Corbyn as "petulant" who "should have known better".
He echoed Mr McCluskey's suggestion that the trade unions were in the best position to "mediate".
