Virgin Trains electric shock report: Safety call for drivers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A safety investigation has called for a review of the rules on when train drivers should leave their cabs after a driver suffered an electric shock.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Rail Accident Investigation Board (RAIB) report said the driver suffered a severe shock on the track at Sutton Weaver, Cheshire, on 23 September 2014.
The man had not seen an overhead wire hanging down as he walked on the track.
The RAIB also recommended that Network Rail extend its overhead line checks for wire damage at attachment points.
The driver was hospitalised for 10 weeks with severe burns to the right-hand side of his body as well as suffering broken ribs, broken collar bone, and a head wound thought to have occurred when he fell and hit his head against a rail.
Virgin Trains report that he is making a good recovery.
The report found that the wire broke at an attachment point because some strands had "fractured due to fatigue".
Its report said the Virgin Trains driver left the train to report his location at Sutton Weaver, to help the team who would reset the circuit breakers which had been tripped after two previous trains touched the live hanging wire.
RAIB said the Rail Safety and Standards and Safety Board should investigate whether "clarification is needed relating to the actions that train crew should take if they are required to leave a train" where an overhead live wire is damaged.
Coaches were called to take passengers away from the scene, and the incident caused disruption between London Euston and Liverpool Lime Street.
