[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After three recounts it was announced Chris Williamson lost the seat to Amanda Solloway by just 41 votes.
The Conservatives held Erewash, Amber Valley, Mid Derbyshire, Derbyshire Dales, High Peak and South Derbyshire
Chesterfield, Bolsover, Derby South and North East Derbyshire were retained by Labour.
Ms Solloway said she was "surprised".
"I certainly feel the country's doing well, the economy's going the way that it should be going," she said.
"When I knocked on people's doors they said they didn't want that to change so we could finish the job."
In the local elections, Labour has retained control of Derby City Council.
The party gained Blagreaves from the Liberal Democrats and took back Mackworth from Independent Lisa Higginbottom.
It also held Chesterfield and North East Derbyshire.
But the Conservatives gained control of High Peak and Amber Valley councils, while retaining South Derbyshire and Derbyshire Dales.
Votes were counted in Erewash on Saturday and saw the Conservatives retain control of the borough council.
