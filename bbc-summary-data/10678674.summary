Marine Jonathan Crookes from 40 Commando Royal Marines was killed in an explosion while on foot patrol in Sangin on Friday.
Sgt David Monkhouse, 35, from Royal Dragoon Guards, died on Saturday after an explosion in Nahr-e Saraj.
Airman Kinikki Griffiths, 20, died in a road accident near Camp Bastion.
The three were among four UK servicemen killed in Afghanistan in 24 hours.
Marine Crookes, 26, from Halesowen, West Midlands, was a reservist on his third deployment to Afghanistan, having volunteered for service in 2007 and 2009.
His fiancÃ©e Danni Davies said: "I can't explain how much I loved him but I am so very proud of him."
Marine Crookes' mother Sue Crookes said: "Jon was a caring, thoughtful son, full of life. If he made up his mind to do something he always achieved it to a high standard."
Outside of the Royal Marines he was studying for a degree in International Relations and worked as a tree surgeon and labourer.
Exceptional soldier
Sgt Monkhouse, a medical technician from Aspatria, Cumbria, was described as a devoted father, an "exceptional" soldier and a "character".
He leaves his mother, Bobby, sister Deborah and daughter, Daisy-Twinkle.
In a statement, his family said: "He was an exceptional soldier and loving and devoted parent. He would not have changed his life for anything."
Based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, Senior Aircraftman Kinikki Griffiths was selected as his flight commander's signaller and driver and he died while carrying out those duties near Camp Bastion in Helmand, according to the Ministry of Defence.
Wing Commander Paul Weaver Smith said: "Kinikki was the consummate professional gunner and, even at this early stage, had much promise; he will be sorely missed by all who knew him in the RAF Regiment.
"Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and girlfriend at this very difficult time."
Squadron Leader David Crook said: "He loved his job, took pride in his work, and gave his all to every task he was given.
"But more importantly, Kinikki was an affable, modest and thoughtful young man, who was a pleasure to know, and whom I had the privilege to command."
