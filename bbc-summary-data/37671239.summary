As part of the inquiries into events following the 21 May match between Hibs and Rangers at Hampden, 85 people have been arrested.
The disturbance followed Hibernian winning the Scottish Cup for the first time in 114 years.
Thousands of Hibs fans invaded the pitch and there were reports of alleged assaults on Rangers players.
A number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch and clashed with rival fans.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.
Rangers players were not able to pick up their Cup Final medals.
Police Scotland said anyone with information about the identities of the people in the pictures should contact the incident room at Govan Police Office on 0141 532 5457 or by emailing this address: Scottishcupfinalpitchinvasion@scotland.pnn.police.uk.
Contact can also be made anonymously through Crimestoppers.
