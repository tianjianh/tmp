[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scotland still lacks key science adviser

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government is still without a chief scientific adviser, a year after the previous post-holder left the job.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It has been empty since Glasgow University academic Prof Muffy Calder stepped down in December 2014.
The position involves giving independent scientific advice to ministers on a range of issues.
Ministers said they had already committed to advertising the job by the end of the year.
The post of chief scientific adviser (CSA) was previously advertised between March and April this year, but the government was unable to appoint a successor.
The issue had also delayed the replacement of several members of the Scottish Science Advisory Council - including the chairman - whose terms of office ended earlier this year.
Their recruitment had been put on hold pending appointment of a new CSA, however, the government subsequently decided to move ahead with the process, and interviews are being held this week.
Science advice
In the last 12 months, the Scottish government has announced a moratorium on fracking and underground coal gasification, a ban on growing GM crops and has played a key role in the recent international climate change talks in Paris.
All are issues in which a chief scientific adviser may have provided advice to ministers.
Earlier this year, Prof Calder said the government's GM crops decision could have "apocalyptic" consequences and threaten the country's food and drinks industry.
Her views have been echoed by another former chief scientific adviser for Scotland, Dame Anne Glover.
The Scottish government said in September that it would advertise for a new chief scientific adviser, after asking for help from university principals and others to fill the post.
A government spokesperson said: "In the meantime, the remaining chief scientists, covering health and rural affairs, food and the environment, continue to carry out key tasks that would usually be done by the CSA Scotland.
"The Scottish government remains committed to drawing on the very best science advice and expertise."
Ministers said they hoped to announce the new members and chairman of the Scottish Science Advisory Council "early in 2016".
