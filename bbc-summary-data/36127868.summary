Newcastle United's Jack Colback says they must give something back to the fans for their continued support.

The relegation-threatened Magpies came from 2-0 down to claim a crucial point against Liverpool at Anfield.
"We've not given [the fans] a lot to shout about, but they're sticking with us," Colback told BBC Newcastle.
"If the fans turn on you it can be difficult but they're there for us and we need to try and repay them with points and good performances."
The draw with Liverpool earned Newcastle's eighth away point of the season out of a possible 54, but the 26-year old - who scored the equaliser - said they did not lose hope despite their poor away form.
He continued: "It would have been easy to lose our heads at 2-0 down.
"With the away form this season, you kind of thought 'is it going to be another one of those days?'
"But we managed to show our character and get a point."
Rafael Benitez's side remain 18th, one point adrift of relegation rivals Norwich and Sunderland who both have a game in hand, but Colback said they will stay positive.
"I've probably been in a worse situation with Sunderland a few years ago and we managed to get out of it," he added.
"All you can really do is keep believing."
