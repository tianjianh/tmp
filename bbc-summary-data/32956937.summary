Passengers had to be evacuated from the vehicle on the eastbound carriageway between junction 29 at Pant-y-dulath and junction 31 at Caerwys, near Holywell.
The coach was destroyed by the blaze and a replacement was sent to pick up passengers. No injuries were reported.
It is believed the fire was caused by an electrical fault.

The lane will stay closed while the coach is recovered and the carriageway is repaired.
This footage was captured by motorist James Nicholls.
