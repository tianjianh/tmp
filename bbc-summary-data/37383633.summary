[SN]TITLE[SN]
Work support for substance misuse and mental health issues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People recovering from substance misuse and mental health problems will be helped to find work in a Â£7.2m scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mentoring, CV advice, interview training and on-job support will be offered to 6,000 people aged over 25.
The programme could be extended to help 1,500 younger adults handle education, training or work.
Public Health Minister Rebecca Evans said work can help people overcome such issues, although "the issues themselves are often a barrier to employment".
Employers will also be encouraged to take on people recovering from substance misuse and mental health problems, with up to three months transitional support for such workers.
