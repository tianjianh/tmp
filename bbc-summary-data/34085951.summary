Like our farms in the UK, Australia has farms especially for crocodiles where the animals are looked after and raised in a similar way to cows or sheep.
Recently lots of big fashion companies have been buying up the crocodile farms, and now around 80% of them are owned by the fashion industry.
This is because they want to use the crocodile's skin to make things like handbags, shoes and belts, which can sell for thousands of pounds.
The crocodiles in these farms are not endangered or protected at the moment.
Ricky has been investigating this one.
