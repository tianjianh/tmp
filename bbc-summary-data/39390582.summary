[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kallum Higginbotham scored a second-half penalty as Scottish Championship leaders Hibernian were held in Fife.

John McGinn's terrific 25-yard drive put Hibs ahead after 12 minutes.
The Scotland midfielder had another long-range effort saved just after the break, before Higginbotham converted from the spot following a hand-ball.
Hibernian's lead at the league summit has been cut to nine points, after Falkirk beat Raith Rovers, with five matches remaining.
The Easter Road side made the trip across the Forth with the backing of around 4,000 supporters, and the visitors began the game in fine style. Jason Cummings made space down the left and his cross into the box was ushered clear by Callum Morris with Brian Graham lurking just behind.
McGinn, very much the Hibs fulcrum, broke the deadlock with a low, thunderous effort that left Pars goalkeeper Sean Murdoch with no chance.
The East End Park surface was not conducive to slick, passing football with multiple bare patches hindering the players' efforts to control the ball.
In the Hibs goal, Ofir Marciano's error almost gifted the hosts an equaliser, when he allowed a back-pass to trickle under his foot. Paul McMullan pounced on the loose ball, but the Israeli international recovered well to block the striker's shot.
The visitors began the second half with the same verve and energy as they had the first. Murdoch parried away another McGinn piledriver, and although Cummings clipped the rebound across the face of goal, his strike partner Graham skewed wide from six yards out.
The roles were reversed a few moments later when Cummings missed a golden opportunity to double Hibs' lead from a Graham cross, before, at the other end, Nicky Clark's header drifted just wide of the target.
Just before the hour mark, Dunfermline drew level in controversial circumstances.
The ball was flicked into the away box, with Pars players claiming it struck the arm of Lewis Stevenson. Referee Greg Aitken took time to make his decision, but eventually pointed to the spot.
Marciano got his hand to Higginbotham's spot-kick, but the ball crept into the bottom corner of the goal.
Neither goalkeeper was troubled in the final half-hour, and despite a 12th draw of the season, Hibernian are another step closer to returning to the Premiership.
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "I thought we were excellent first half, really good value for the lead. They get a penalty which is debatable - if it's the correct decision, it's probably the only one the referee made all afternoon, as far as I'm concerned.
"I'm not too sure Lewis could do much about (the penalty); he's about a yard away. His arm's maybe deemed to be in an unnatural position. He booked Dylan McGeouch for diving - it's ridiculous. And some of the other decisions I wasn't pleased about. I just think the standard of refereeing's not great at the minute.
"We just need to keep ticking off the games at the minute. We should be putting these games away, because we had total control of the game for long periods.
"We keep dragging it out - that's annoying, but we're nearly there."
