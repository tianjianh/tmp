Donald Trump goes to Supreme Court over Menie wind farm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump's challenge to a planned offshore wind farm is being heard at the UK's Supreme Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developers intend to site the large turbine structures close to Mr Trump's golfing development on the Aberdeenshire coast.
The US businessman has taken on the Scottish government, which approved the plan.
Mr Trump began his challenge to the decision to grant planning permission more than two years ago.
He was furious when the Scottish government approved plans for the renewable energy development within sight of his multi-million pound golf development on the Menie Estate in the north-east of Scotland.
He said the 11 turbines would spoil the view.
Mr Trump made a series of legal challenges in the Scottish courts and has now taken the fight to the UK's Supreme Court in London.
He has argued that planning consent for the wind farm was so imprecise as to make it legally invalid.
Following Mr Trump's earlier unsuccessful actions in the Scottish courts, the Scottish government said its decision-making process had been vindicated and that the "painstaking work" of Marine Scotland staff who advised it was both fair and reasonable.
The Supreme Court judges are expected to deliver their verdict later.
