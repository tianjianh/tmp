The 46-year-old succeeds Ronnie Moore, who parted company with the club by mutual consent earlier on Wednesday.
This is a first managerial role for Hignett, who had a spell as Hartlepool assistant manager under Colin Cooper in 2013-14.
Hartlepool are one place above the relegation zone having lost three of their past four league matches.
Hignett, whose 19-year playing career began at Crewe and ended at Hartlepool, will take charge of the team for the first time when Pools host Yeovil on Saturday.
"We immediately identified Craig as our number one target and we believe he has all the right qualities to help instil confidence back in to the players and help us move up the table," said chairman Gary Coxall.
"He has a wealth of experience in football and has been looking for an opportunity to move in to management so we're delighted to give him that chance here at Victoria Park."
Sam Collins, who worked alongside Moore, will remain at the club but in a new role focusing on the club's under-21 players.
