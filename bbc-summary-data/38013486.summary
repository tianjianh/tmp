The sculpture at Tweedbank station also recognises the official opening of the line by the Queen on 9 September last year.
The original plaque she unveiled on the day is incorporated into the two-metre high design.
The stone was supplied by local quarry Hutton Stone and created by Borders artist Michelle De Bruin.
She helped to unveil her artwork alongside retiring Lord Lieutenant of Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale, Capt Gerald Maitland-Carew.
The Borders Railway brought trains back to the region for the first time in 46 years after a campaign led by the community.
More than one million people have used the railway since it opened in September 2015.
Future developments at the Tweedbank terminus include the provision of toilet facilities and the opening of a coffee bar and kiosk selling drinks, snacks and newspapers.
