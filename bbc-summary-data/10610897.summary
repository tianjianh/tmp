Malvern College plans to rebuild fire damaged house

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Worcestershire school is seeking planning permission to rebuild its 19th Century boarding house after it was badly damaged in a fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malvern College has drawn up plans for the building known as Number 6 House following the fire in April.
It will cost millions of pounds because of the work needed to restore the Grade II listed property.
The school was founded in 1865 and counts author CS Lewis among its ex-pupils.
The fire was confined to an area where the housemistress and her family normally live.
