Police said a silver Peugeot 207 was driven into a furniture shop on Cowley Road shortly after 07:00 BST.
There have been no reports of any injuries. Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue said the impact had made the shop's structure unsafe.
A road closure was put in place on Cowley Road close to the junction with Chapel Street.
Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue said crews used metal props to support the roof and prevent it from falling in on the shop while the vehicle was removed.
Station manager Simon Belcher said it showed the "varied nature" of crews' work.
Cowley Road has since reopened and a cordon remains around the shop.
Thames Valley Police are working to establish who was driving the vehicle.
