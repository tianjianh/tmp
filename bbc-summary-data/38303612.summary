She triumphed in the S6 50m butterfly final with a Games record.
The teenager from Northampton was named Young Personality from a shortlist of three which also included rugby union's Keelan Giles and gymnast Amy Tinkler.
Robinson follows in the footsteps of past winners, such as Wayne Rooney, Andy Murray and Ellie Downie.

She was presented with her award by gymnast, and former winner, Claudia Fragapane on BBC One's The One Show.
"It's just been such an amazing year. It's the icing on the cake," said Robinson.
"I only really started swimming properly three years ago and it's kind of snowballed."
The final three contenders were picked from an original list of 10, which included Downie (gymnastics), Sophie Ecclestone (cricket), Tom Hamer (Para-swimming), Lauren Rowles (Para-rowing), Georgia Stanway (football), Jess Stretton (Para-archery) and Rebekah Tiler (weightlifting).
Robinson also won bronze in Rio, breaking a British record in the 100m freestyle final, and has been described as a "great role model to both able-bodied and Para-athletes".
Earlier in the year, at the IPC European Championships, she brought back one silver (50m butterfly) and three bronze medals (50m, 100m and 400m freestyle).
Robinson, who has a form of dwarfism that left her on crutches aged 11, was inspired by watching her now-Great Britain team-mate Ellie Simmonds at London 2012.
