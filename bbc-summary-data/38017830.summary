[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eight-year-old Saros Endris and his sister Leanor Endris, six, died following the "suspicious" fire at a home in Holland Road, Hamstead.
Mohammed Endris, 46, was arrested on Thursday morning.
An inquest heard the cause of the children's deaths was unknown but not related to smoke inhalation or burn injuries.
Firefighters were called to the property in the early hours of October 28 and tackled what they described as a small fire in the hallway.
Mr Endris was found with life-threatening injuries in a fire-damaged car in Staffordshire several hours later.
He is in hospital and currently not fit for interview, the inquest at Jack Judge House in Oldbury heard.
The children's mother Penil Teklehaimamot, 36, was uninjured. She is being treated as a witness.
West Midlands Police previously said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.
