[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
State media said President Vladimir Putin had approved Mr Mutko's promotion to deputy prime minister for sport, tourism and youth politics.
Mr Mutko was accused by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) of ordering the cover-up of a failed drug test
He was denied accreditation to the Rio Olympics in August.
Mr Mutko's anti-doping adviser, Nataliya Zhelanova, and one of his deputies, Yuri Nagornykh, were suspended after a Wada report accused them of helping to orchestrate cover-ups of hundreds of drug tests.
The report, by law professor Richard McLaren, accused Russia's sports ministry of manipulating urine samples provided by its athletes between 2011 and 2015.
Some Russian athletes were banned from competing at the Olympic Games in Rio, while all Russian competitors were banned from the Paralympic Games.
