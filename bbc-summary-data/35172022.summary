Newport Gwent Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones is confident Hallam Amos and Tyler Morgan will recover from injury in time to bid for Wales Six Nations places.

They were injured at the World Cup and have not played for Dragons since.
Jones said back three player Amos and centre Morgan are close to fully fit.
"I'm sure they'll be keen to get a few games under their belt before that [the Six Nations] so we'll see them soon," he said.
"They feel fine and it's a question of getting them up to the physical strength they were before the injuries. They're not far away."
Twenty-one-year-old Amos suffered a shoulder injury in Wales' 28-25 World Cup win over England at Twickenham.
Morgan, 20, underwent shoulder surgery after a second-half injury in Wales' quarter-final defeat by South Africa.
The injuries to Amos and Morgan were among those that have denied Dragons an entire three-quarter line of highly regarded talent his season.
Wing Tom Prydie was the latest to suffer after centre Jack Dixon's kidney damage suffered in the summer.
Prydie, 23, will miss the rest of the season because of a knee problem while Dixon was initially not expected to return until February, 2016.
Adam Hughes rejoined on loan amid Dragons' troubles and has since become a permanent signing and could play wing as well as centre for the rest of the season.
"It's great to have him back here, he's been such a positive influence since he's returned," Jones told BBC Wales.
"We're hoping to get players back with Tyler and Jack Dixon being quality centres, but Adam is as suitable to the wing as he is to centre so it's great to have him."
