The blaze, which broke out at Asda in Wigmore Lane on 6 March, was tackled by almost 100 firefighters, with 16 engines and three aerial platforms.
The GMB union said the company had told it refurbishment should be complete in three months.
Asda said it was "unable to confirm dates at this stage".
A spokesman said: "We want to get the store back open as quickly as possible.
"We are doing everything we can to get the store back up and running for our customers as soon as we can."
The workforce has been redeployed to other stores in the region.
An investigation into the cause of the blaze is ongoing.
