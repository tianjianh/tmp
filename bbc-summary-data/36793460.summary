Gloucester have signed former Australia Under-20 prop Cameron Orr, while front row Paddy McAllister has agreed a new contract with the Premiership club.

Orr, 21, is English qualified and came through Waratahs' academy before playing for Australian National Rugby Championship side Greater Sydney Rams.
He has played two junior world rugby championships for Australia Under-20s.
Belfast-born McAllister, 26, joined Gloucester in 2015 and made 17 appearances for the club last season.
"We're delighted with [McAllister's] progression over the past 12 months and we are excited to see him develop further," director of rugby David Humphreys told the club's website.
Orr added: "I've watched a fair bit of Premiership rugby on the television back home and it looks to be a really competitive league.
"I've also been told that Gloucester will be playing quite a few local derbies, which sounds great."
Long-serving loose-head prop Nick Wood left the Cherry and Whites in June after 15 years with the side.
