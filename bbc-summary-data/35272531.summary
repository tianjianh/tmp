She was a passenger in a Volkswagen car that was involved in a collision with a Seat car and a tractor at around 9:55 GMT on Saturday.
Two women, aged 24 and 42, were also taken to Daisy Hill Hospital for treatment to their injuries that are not believed to be life threatening.
It happened on the Hilltown Road, which has now reopened.
PSNI Insp Stephen Humphries appealed to anyone who was travelling on the Hilltown Road around the time of the crash to contact local police.
SDLP councillor Gillian Fitzpatrick said the local community will support the child's relatives in the weeks ahead.
"It's complete heartbreak, so distressing, but our community will rally round to help this family.
"I have four children myself, two of them young girls. It's just unbearable.
"Everyone will be affected by this."
