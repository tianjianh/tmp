The actress provided the voice of Howard Wolowitz's unseen overbearing mother on the show.
The episode ended with a message honouring Susi, saying: "Every time you spoke, we laughed. You're in our hearts forever."
Producers have yet to make a decision on how to proceed with Susi's character for the rest of the current series.
Other cast members paid tribute to the actress after she died on Tuesday in Los Angeles.
Kaley Cuoco Sweeting, who plays Penny in the hit sitcom, posted a picture of Susi on her Facebook page adding: "Rest in peace hilarious, adorable, sweet Carol Ann Susi. You will forever be part of the Big Bang Theory family."
Kunal Nayyar, Howard's best friend Raj, added: "My heart is broken. I will miss your smile. Your spirit is forever with us."
