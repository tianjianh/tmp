Library opens in Deeside Leisure Centre but others shut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three council-run libraries in Flintshire will shut this month when a new facility opens at Deeside Leisure Centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The closure of Hawarden, Mancot and Queensferry libraries was agreed last year, partly due to funding cuts.
But a group, Friends of Mancot Library, has been set up to to operate the existing building as a community library from March.
The new library opens on 29 February and the others shut on different days.
