[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 1-0 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere missed out on a place in the National League play-offs despite a final-day victory over Grimsby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers, relegated from the Football League last year, needed to win to have any chance of extending their season.
And although Steven Jennings slotted in from six yards to give them victory, Braintree's victory over Altrincham ended their hopes.
Grimsby's defeat means they finish fourth and will play Braintree in the play-offs.
The first leg will be played at Blundell Park on Thursday evening, with the return in Essex on the afternoon of Sunday, 8 May.
