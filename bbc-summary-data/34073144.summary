Assembly poll 'Welsh', regardless of UK leader, says Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2016 assembly election will be a "Welsh" election, regardless of who leads the Labour party at UK level, First Minister Carwyn Jones has said.

Some Welsh Labour figures fear a Jeremy Corbyn victory in the Labour leadership contest will make it harder for the party to gain ground in May's poll.
Labour currently holds 30 of the 60 seats in Cardiff Bay.
Mr Jones said: "It's a Welsh election and it will be Welsh Labour fighting the election with me as its leader."
"It's early days, we don't know who will win the leadership election in September," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"One thing I can say is that next May, whoever is the leader in London, I'm the leader in Wales and Welsh Labour will be the party fighting the election in Wales."
Mr Corbyn's team say there is still no meeting arranged between him and Mr Jones, although Mr Corbyn is keen to meet him.
The first minister has met the other three candidates, Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall.
Welsh Labour said it was "in the process" of setting up a meeting between Mr Jones and Mr Corbyn.
Mr Jones has previously described the left-wing MP as an "unusual choice" as UK Labour leader, but refused to endorse publicly any of the four candidates.
The result of the contest is due to be announced on 12 September.
