More than a dozen Dutch nationals have been reported to prosecutors over a major disturbance in Glasgow before Celtic's game with Ajax in November.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six people were injured - four of them seriously - after a large group of Ajax fans targeted pubs used by Celtic fans in the Gallowgate area on 26 November.
Police said that 14 men and one woman had since been identified and reported to the procurator fiscal.
BBC Scotland understands that all 15 are from the Netherlands.
Police Scotland appealed for information following the disturbance which saw four men, aged 52, 37, 27 and 25, taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary and treated for serious face or head injuries.
Several hundred Ajax fans were given a police escort from the city centre to Celtic Park for the Europa League game which Celtic lost 2-1.
Police made four arrests in or around the stadium - one before, two during and one after the game - for alleged minor public order offences.
