[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Latvian farm worker driving in Scotland for the first time killed a Perthshire father in a "catastrophic" collision, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrejs Trofimovs was driving uninsured on the wrong side of the road when his Audi car crashed into Allan Joiner's Ford Fiesta.
Mr Joiner, 44, suffered fatal head injuries in the collision on the C484 road between St Madoes and Errol in November 2014.
Trofimovs admitted careless driving.
The 37-year-old was originally charged with causing death by dangerous driving.
Prosecutors accepted his guilty plea to an alternative charge of causing Mr Joiner's death by careless driving.
Trofimovs, of Mains of Errol Farm, Errol, also admitted driving without insurance.
The High Court in Edinburgh was told that Trofimovs had been socialising at a caravan at the farm and was asked to drop others off as he had not been drinking.
Collision investigators placed the Audi on the wrong side of the road, which has no markings dividing the carriageways, after carrying out an examination at the crash site.
Advocate depute Alison Di Rollo said: "The collision was catastrophic, causing significant and extensive damage to both vehicles, injury to himself and his passenger, and the tragic and untimely death of Mr Joiner - a much loved father and family member."
"The accused is a Latvian national. In Latvia vehicles are driven on the right hand side of the road.
"This was the first time he had driven in the UK."
When Trofimovs was interviewed by police he admitted he was the driver and stated it was his first time driving in this country, adding: "It looked like he was on our side."
Defence counsel Ronnie Renucci said: "This is a truly tragic case."
He said a background report would be required before Trofimovs, who is a first time offender, can be sentenced.
Judge Lady Wolffe deferred sentence until next month and continued Trofimovs bail, banning from holding a licence in the meantime.
