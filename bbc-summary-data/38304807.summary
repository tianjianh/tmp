Sell-by dates warning to customers over Fife firm products

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pastries, pies and sandwiches produced by a shop supplier in Fife have been recalled after inspectors found the sell- by dates had been extended.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The SoloSnack-branded products, which are produced by Eat & Go Co in Kirkcaldy, issued the voluntary recall on Saturday.
However, on Monday, Food Standards Scotland officials found the shelf life of the food was still being extended.
People have been told to return them to the shop they bought them from.
The products are thought to have reached shops in Edinburgh, Fife and Dundee.
The SoloSnack range includes Scotch pies, curry pies, steak pies, sausage rolls, steak bridies, mince bridies, Cornish pasties and mixed vegetable pies.
It also includes sandwiches with fillings such as chicken mayo, egg mayonnaise, tuna mayonnaise and ham and cheese.
Further SoloSnack products include broccoli and lentil slices, chilli bean slices, tuna pasta salads, pasta bakes, cheese burgers and microwavable ready meals.
Eat & Go Co managing director Naji Yassen said he was told for the first time on Friday the products should have a three-day shelf life, lower than the shelf life he has been operating under over several years.
He said such a shelf life would, in effect, mean the products are in the shops for one day only - a situation he said would mean there is "no way" his business could survive.
Mr Yassen said he had called in microbiologists to carry out testing on Wednesday and is hopeful the longer six-day shelf life will be reinstated following the results of those tests.
He claimed the health authorities were wrong to issue the notice, and added: "I feel absolutely upset and angry because I have been doing this for 20 years.
"We've had no problem whatsoever with anybody. How come all of a sudden the six days is too long?"
