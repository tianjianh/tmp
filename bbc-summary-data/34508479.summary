[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Onyx team will help identify and work with children and young people who are at risk in the force's region.
A key part of the work will be gathering intelligence about where it is happening, identifying victims and those responsible.
Det Sgt Sarah Fellows will lead three officers, working with health, social care and youth justice organisations.
Child sexual exploitation has been recognised as an emerging threat nationally and tackling it is a key aim of North Wales police and crime commissioner Winston Roddick.
Mr Roddick described it as a "heinous crime" and said setting up a specialist team will give the public more confidence to come forward with complaints.
