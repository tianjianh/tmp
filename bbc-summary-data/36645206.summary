[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a man who disappeared in Tenerife 12 years ago have issued a fresh plea for information in a bid to solve the mystery.

Kevin Ainley was living and working on the Spanish island when he went missing in June 2004.
The 24-year-old, of Fleetwood, Lancashire, had moved to the tourist area of Playa de las Americas three months earlier.
His sister Gemma Brooke said the family was "desperate for answers".
"It is no exaggeration to say we have been put through 12 years of hell. Somebody must know something," she said.
Mr Ainley, who had also lived in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, is known to have worked handing out leaflets for a bar named the Sportsman in an area known as "the patch".
On the day of his disappearance he had visited bars and clubs with a friend.
At around noon, he and another friend went for a meal at a Chinese buffet restaurant called Merlins.
He was last seen walking in the direction of the Sportsman, and his passport and belongings were later found in his apartment.
Despite a Spanish investigation and a Lancashire Police review of the case in 2012, no conclusive information has come to light.
"We are convinced there must be someone out there who saw or heard something," Ms Brooke said.
"I just hope that if someone does know something they can find it in their hearts to come forward and help put us out of our misery."
