The pictures show his ship Endurance trapped in ice in 1915, as well as crew members and dogs on the voyage.
For the first time, digitised images of slides owned by crew member Reginald James have been put on show.
He received the images from the expedition's official photographer Frank Hurley.
They form part of a free display at Manchester Central Library until 11 June.
Known as Jimmy by his fellow crew members, James was the expedition's physicist and used the slides in talks about the expedition following their safe return.
After the expedition between 1914 and 1917, he served in Ypres, Belgium, during World War One.
He then lived in Manchester for nearly 18 years where he lectured in physics at the university.
He married teacher Annie Watson in 1936 before they sailed for South Africa, where he worked at the University of Cape Town.

Organised by the Royal Geographical Society, the exhibition, which launched in London last year, will also go on display in the Midlands, Wales and Scotland.
