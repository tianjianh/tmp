[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Logs have been embedded into the grass at a huge city park in Edinburgh in a bid to encourage insects and other wildlife to the area.

The initiative at The Meadows, along the Melville Drive side, comes ahead of a wildlife meadow being planted.
At least 10 large tree logs have been installed by the City of Edinburgh Council after Friends of the Meadows and Bruntsfield requested them.
The logs have been donated by the forestry service.
Lesley Hinds, City of Edinburgh Council's environment convener, said: "We have been working closely with Friends of the Meadows and Bruntsfield Links over recent months to install these logs, which will not only deter drivers from parking along the edge of the Meadows, but will help our efforts to encourage and diversify wildlife in the area, along with a new wildflower meadow."
