Public borrowing worse than forecast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Government borrowing rose in November from a year earlier, worse than forecast, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Borrowing for the month was £14.2bn, up by £1.3bn compared with November 2014.
The ONS said last November's figure was boosted by a one-off gain of £1.1bn in fines from financial institutions for foreign exchange rigging.
Total borrowing for the financial year to date is now £66.9bn, down £6.6bn from the same point last year.
The independent Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that borrowing for the whole of the financial year 2015-16 will be £68.9bn - not including new changes to the treatment of housing associations.
That is well below last year's £90.1bn, which would mean Chancellor George Osborne would have achieved his aim of cutting government borrowing.
However, both October and November's monthly figures were worse than expected, giving some economists doubts that the chancellor will get the borrowing figure down to that level.
Mr Osborne's overall plan is to eliminate the annual gap between government spending and revenue by the end of this decade.
Including housing associations, the OBR predicts a small fall in the amount the government will borrow in the current financial year from £74.1bn to £73.5bn.
The comparable figure increased since July because of statistical changes to the treatment of housing associations.
Looking further ahead, the OBR expects borrowing of £49.5bn next year, £24.8bn in 2017-18 and £4.6bn in 2018-19 before the government moves to a surplus of £10.1bn and £14.7bn in the following two years.
