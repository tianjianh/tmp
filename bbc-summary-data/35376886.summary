[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northern Ireland's Germany World Cup qualifier in Hannover

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifier against holders Germany on 11 October will be played in Hannover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The World Cup qualifier will come less than five months after their Euro 2016 Group C meeting in Paris.
Northern Ireland will face the Germans in the return World Cup qualifier in Belfast on 5 October, 2017.
The Northern Irish start their World Cup campaign in the Czech Republic on 4 September before hosting San Marino three days before the Hannover game.
Germany were scheduled to face the Netherlands in Hannover two months ago but the game was called off shortly before the kick-off because of a security threat in the wake of the Paris attacks four days earlier.
The last meeting between Northern Ireland and Germany saw the Germans earning a 4-1 win in a Belfast friendly in 2005.
In addition to Germany and the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Norway are also in Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifying group.
