Ice cream vans' 15-minute waiting limit in Worcester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ice cream vans must move on after 15 minutes under a local authority's new rules - despite claims pensioners less quick on their feet could miss out.

Mobile street traders will only be allowed to stay in one spot for up to 30 minutes if a queue forms, Worcester City Council said.
Some responses to a consultation are reported to have been from pensioners "hostile" to the new time limit.
The council said it did not believe the elderly would be disadvantaged.
The change was brought in after complaints from street traders holding static licences.
Traders were concerned mobile traders were loitering for too long, the council said.
A total of 77 people responded to the consultation, including 60 delivered to the council by the holder of a mobile street trading licence.
Allah Ditta, chairman of the council's licensing and environmental health committee, said the new rules "make no difference to most traders".
He said: "The majority of them have established routes and times and would never normally stay in one spot for 30 minutes.
"We certainly do not expect anyone to struggle to get to a street trader in time - most customers are used to ice cream vans turning up at particular locations and particular times."
