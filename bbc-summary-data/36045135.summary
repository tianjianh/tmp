Putin says Syria army in 'strong position' despite Russian drawdown

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russian president Vladimir Putin has said the Syrian army is able to carry out "serious offensive operations" despite a drawdown of Russian forces.

He said Syrian government forces had achieved some recent important victories, including in Palmyra.
Russia began its campaign of air strikes in Syria last September in support of the government.
Mr Putin, speaking in an hours-long annual televised phone-in, also said Turkey was still a friendly nation.
He said the country just has "problems with some politicians who have behaved improperly".
Relations between the two countries have been at a low point since Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on its border with Syria in November.
The Q&A event involves Mr Putin answering pre-selected questions from members of the public on issues of concern.
More than one million questions were submitted, the Associated Press reports.
Speaking on Syria, Mr Putin said the only way to end the war is for all parties to sit down for political talks, adopt a new constitution and hold early elections.
He made no specific mention of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who sees Moscow as a key ally.
Russia announced last month that it was withdrawing most of its forces from Syria but would continue to carry out air strikes.
A woman from Omsk, in Siberia, asked the first question - about potholed roads.
A 12-year-old girl later asked Mr Putin who he would save first if Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko were both drowning.
He replied that "if someone has decided to drown, then it's already impossible to save them".
But he added diplomatically that he would extend a hand of friendship to any partner, if they would accept it.
Asked if he planned to remarry, the divorced president joked that speculation about his private life risked affecting the rouble or oil prices. "Maybe some day I'll be able to satisfy your curiosity?" he added.
