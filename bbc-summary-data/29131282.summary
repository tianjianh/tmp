The US have lost five of the last six contests, including the most recent match at Medinah in 2012 after Europe's thrilling final-day comeback.
"The American team has to get back on track," Watson said. "The loss at Medinah should stick in their craw."
Ex-Europe captain Bernard Gallacher has called the appointment of eight-time major winner Watson a "masterstroke".
Watson has captained the US once before, winning at the Belfry in 1993, and the 65-year-old told BBC Sport he was desperate to be given a second chance.
"I wanted to be captain, in the worst way," Watson said.
"When I got the call a couple of years ago, I said to myself, 'I've been waiting for this call for almost 20 years.'"
And Gallacher, who lost as captain to Watson's American team in 1993, believes it was an inspired decision by the PGA of America to approach Watson again.
"I thought it was absolutely a masterstroke," said Gallacher, whose nephew Stephen will compete for Europe at Gleneagles.
"If anybody can keep the interest going on the American side, [it's Watson].
"It's not just about the players, because the players obviously want to play in the Ryder Cup, but you're really thinking about the American public - keeping them."
