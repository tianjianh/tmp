Duff, 39, was put in charge of the club's under-18 side last season following his retirement as a player.
He has been promoted to his new role after the departure of Michael Jolley, who became head coach at AFC Eskilstuna in Sweden.
"There was an opportunity to step up which the club have asked me to do and I'm happy to do it," said Duff.
"It's a nice progression into a new career and it probably happened a little bit quicker than I expected, but I'm in a good place."
Burnley's under-23 team will compete in the Professional Development League for the first time this season after the club were granted appropriate academy status.
