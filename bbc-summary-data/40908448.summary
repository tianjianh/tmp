[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 0-2 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Macauley Bonne's brace gave Leyton Orient a victory at Woking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors, searching for a swift reprieve after their 6-1 drubbing at Bromley, were almost gifted an early lead when Woking's Josh Staunton headed just past his own net from Joe Ward's tricky ball back to him.
That was as close as either side came before the interval, but Orient got the breakthrough they deserved as Bonne converted Jake Caprice's fine cross after 50 minutes.
The 21-year-old striker, who spent a spell at Woking last season, then got his second of the afternoon with a cool finish late on to wrap up the points for the visitors.
