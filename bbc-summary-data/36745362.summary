Emma Watson has praised the new Harry Potter play, which has just opened in London's West End.

The actress, who played Hermione in the film series, went to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child earlier this week.
Writing on Facebook on Thursday, Watson said: "I came in with no idea what to expect and it was amazing.
"Having seen it, I felt more connected to Hermione and the stories than I have since Deathly Hallows came out, which was such a gift."
She added: "Some things about the play were, I think, possibly even more beautiful than the films."
Watson met with the cast and crew after the performances of the two-part play - including Noma Dumezweni, the actress who plays Hermione in the show.
The 26-year-old said she felt like she was "meeting her older self" as she embraced Dumezweni.
"The cast and crew welcomed me like I was family and Noma was everything I could ever hope she would be. She's wonderful," Watson wrote.
Watson signed off her post with the hashtag #KeepTheSecrets - a reference to author JK Rowling's plea to fans not to post spoilers from the play's plot on social media.
The play is currently in the previews stage and officially opens on 30 July.
Watson is taking a year off from acting, but will soon be seen in Disney's live action version of Beauty And The Beast, which is due for release next year.
