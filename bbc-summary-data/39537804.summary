The all-rounder top scored with 50 from 32 balls - his second innings in the competition - in Pune's total of 163-6.
Durham's Stokes, the most expensive overseas player in the IPL, hit three sixes but went wicketless with the ball as Australia's Glenn Maxwell hammered 44 from 20 balls to see the hosts to victory with six wickets and an over to spare.
Pune have a win and a defeat from their first two matches after beating Royal Challengers Bangalore on Thursday.
Bangalore, featuring England fast bowler Tymal Mills, claimed a 15-run victory over Delhi Daredevils at home on Saturday.
Mills took 1-33 off four overs as Delhi, chasing 158 for victory, could only reach 142-9 - England batsman Sam Billings hitting 25 off 19 balls, while 19-year-old India keeper-batsman Rishabh Pant top scored for the visitors with 57 off 36.
Kedar Jadhav's knock of 69 off 37 deliveries - including five sixes - helped Bangalore post 157-8 in their innings, with Mills making a three-ball duck.
Bangalore face Kings XI Punjab on Monday, while Pune take on Delhi on Tuesday.
