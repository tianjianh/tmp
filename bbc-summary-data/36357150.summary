England v Sri Lanka: Ben Stokes replaced by Chris Woakes for second Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England all-rounder Ben Stokes has been ruled out of the second Test against Sri Lanka and replaced in the squad by Chris Woakes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stokes injured his left knee while bowling during the innings-and-88-run win in the first Test at Headingley.
There is currently no timeframe on the absence for the 24-year-old, who will see a consultant on Tuesday.
Woakes will vie with pace bowler Jake Ball for a place in the final XI for Friday's match at Chester-le-Street.
The 27-year-old won the last of six Test caps against South Africa in January.
He has taken eight wickets at average of 63.75 and scored 129 runs at 21.50, though he has started well for Warwickshire this season, taking 12 County Championship wickets and scoring a century against Nottinghamshire.
Notts' Ball has yet to play a Test but was in the squad for the Headingley win.
No matter who plays, England could shuffle their batting line-up, moving each of Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali up a place to six and seven respectively.
Both Woakes and Ball are currently involved in Championship fixtures, but will leave at the close of play on Monday in order to join up with the England squad on Tuesday, with Warwickshire and Notts permitted to name replacements.
England will win the three-Test series with victory in Chester-le-Street, where Durham's Stokes misses out on playing a first Test on his home ground.
England squad for second Test v Sri Lanka: Cook (c), Hales, Compton, Root, Vince, Bairstow (wk), Moeen, Broad, Finn, Anderson, Woakes, Ball.
