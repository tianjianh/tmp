[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maidstone extended their National League unbeaten run to eight games after coming from behind to beat Barrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Turnbull put Barrow into a ninth-minute lead with an exquisite free-kick into the top corner.
Danny Livesey nearly doubled the lead, but his header hit a post, and just before the break, Joe Pigott equalised for the hosts.
Stuart Lewis completed the turnaround after 62 minutes, taking full advantage of Barrow's inability to clear their lines.
The win moves the hosts up to 18th place and gives them a four-point cushion above the relegation places.
