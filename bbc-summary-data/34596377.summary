Cumbria County Council unveils plans to cut adult care by £5m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cumbria County Council has unveiled plans to cut adult social care services by £5m in a bid to help save £37m from its budget.

The authority needs to save £37m in 2016/17, £17.5m of which it still has to find, and a total of £80m by 2018.
The public's views are being sought on a 2% rise in council tax, the closure of five fire stations and an overhaul of care for the elderly.
Council leader Stewart Young said the "ambitious" plan must work.
The council said the proposals will "fundamentally change" the way it works and delivers services in the future.
Plans to change the way elderly and disabled people are cared for, including providing more care to people in specially adapted housing rather than in care homes, will save £5m from next year's budget, the authority said.
Like all local authorities, Cumbria County Council is going through difficult times, with major funding cuts in the last five years.
The council leader Stewart Young says it means tough choices - and if the cuts get worse the council could move towards a situation where it only provides services it has to by law.
And, at a time when the number of elderly people in the county is growing, the council is looking to make significant savings in adult social care.
It involves providing more care for people in their own homes and in specially designed housing, rather than in care homes and day centres.
If the plan works, it could save £5m in the next financial year, the council says.
Mr Young admits it's a risky strategy and says "plan B is making plan A work".
Patricia Bell, Carlisle Council's deputy leader, said: "These are extremely tough and challenging times.
"The cuts we have already made have been achieved by internal reshaping and the reduction of the workforce from 10,000 in 2012 to 7,000 now through voluntary redundancy and reduction in the number of managers.
"It is anticipated that this will further reduce to 5,200 by 2018.
"The journey ahead will be difficult but rather than sitting back bemoaning our fate we are actively embracing the change and taking control of our future."
The authority has already saved £150m from its budget since 2011, and in the next three years 1,800 jobs will be cut.
The public consultation runs until 22 January.
