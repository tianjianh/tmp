The winger opened the scoring, with tries from Matty Ashurst, Sam Williams and Bill Tupou putting them 24-0 ahead.
Aaron Brown got the Rams on the board after the break, but Caton-Brown added a 50-metre second to restore the lead.
Tupou and Ashley Gibson crossed before Caton-Brown scored twice in three minutes to complete the victory, with Liam Finn converting all nine tries.
Dewsbury have won just one of their 12 league fixtures this season and sixth-placed Super League side Trinity were simply too good, with stand-off Finn unflappable from the kicking tee and Caton-Brown's finishing electric.
Caton-Brown, who joined Trinity from Salford in September, set the pattern of the match by the scoring in the corner after just four minutes.
Trinity took complete control of the tie through some neat play and clinical finishing, with Tupou crossing twice before Finn's perfect kicking and Caton-Brown's carrying added gloss to the scoreline.
Dewsbury coach Neil Kelly:
"I can't remember a time when I've lost a game by over 50 points and said that we defended superbly. Fitness took its toll in the end, but we scrambled well and showed a great desire to keep them out.
"I've got so much respect for the players and so many positives came out of that for us as a team.
"If we can keep sides out like that in the Championship we'll climb the table, but we have to do better with the ball as well."
Wakefield coach John Kear:
"I'd like to give Dewsbury a pat on the back because they are doing it tough at the moment yet I thought they showed plenty of spirit and some of their on-line defence was very, very desperate - they played well.
"I like to think we play a good brand of rugby league and you only have to look at the number of tries our wingers score.
"Everyone goes on about Castleford and the tries their wingers score but ours aren't bad either. It's exciting for the fans to watch."
