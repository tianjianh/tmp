[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side, who only needed a point to book their top-flight spot for next season, fell behind early on to Ben Reynolds' try.
But Widnes hit back to lead 20-6 at the break through Patrick Ah Van, Kevin Brown, Charly Runciman and Paddy Flynn.
Alex Gerrard, Rhys Hanbury, Joe Mellor and Jack Owens all crossed after the break, while Ah Van grabbed his second.
Salford's defeat at Hull KR meant that Widnes climbed above the Red Devils to finish second in The Qualifiers, with all three remaining in Super League for next season.
Leigh, meanwhile, are destined for another year in the Championship despite convincingly winning the regular season title.
