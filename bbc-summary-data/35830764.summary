They were travelling from the West Bank to Saudi Arabia when the bus overturned in a remote area. Two children are reported to be among the dead.
The driver lost control about 320 km (200 miles) south of the Jordanian capital, Amman.
Dozens of passengers were injured and several are said to be in a critical condition.
Most of the victims were from the West Bank city of Jenin.
One of the casualties, Azzah Ibrahim, said passengers were hurled around by the impact.
"Some of us were beneath the bus, and some of us were inside the bus, between the chairs," he told the Associated Press news agency.
The Palestinian Authority declared a day of national mourning in the wake of the crash.
