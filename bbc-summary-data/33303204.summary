Three members of the same family were among those killed in the Tunisian gun attack, the BBC has learned.

Adrian Evans, 44, from Tipton, West Midlands, died along with his father, 78-year-old Patrick Evans and nephew Joel Richards, 19, from Wednesbury.
Mr Richards's 16-year-old brother Owen is reported to have survived the attack.
Sandwell Council Leader Darren Cooper said colleagues of Mr Evans, a gas manager, were in a "state of shock".
At least 30 Britons were among 38 killed when a Tunisian student opened fire on a beach on Friday.
Mr Evans had worked for the local authority for the last 30 years and was "very, very popular", Mr Cooper said.
"I've had staff on the phone in tears," he said.
The three men were big fans of Walsall FC and a spokesperson for the club said their thoughts were with their family.
Fellow fans have been asked to show their support by laying scarves outside the main entrance on Monday morning.
Mr Richards was a local football referee and student at the University of Worcester.
A spokesperson for the local FA described him as "talented", with "the world at his feet".
University of Worcester Vice Chancellor Prof David Green said: "It's a real tragedy, we're all deeply affected. Joel was a particularly popular and outgoing student."
Flowers and other tributes had already started appearing at the Malvern Gate, on the St John's campus, according to the university.
Teachers and fellow students have posted dozens of comments on the university's Facebook page.
Sports psychology lecturer Dr Andrea Faull wrote: "Joel was one of my most wonderful students. Words cannot express how I feel but I have so much love and sympathy at this time."
Sue Davey, 44, from Tamworth, and her partner Scott Chalkley, 42, from Derby, were also among those killed in the attack.
Ms Davey's son Conor Fulford told BBC WM on Saturday he was searching for news of her, but later took to Twitter to confirm she was among the dead.
He said his mother was a "strong" woman, adding: "Love you always Mom, I've got my teddy bear you got me tonight, Rest easy."
Both Ms Davey and Mr Chalkley worked for Severn Trent. The water firm tweeted: "We are immensely saddened by the news of Sue and Scott. They were much loved by colleagues."
Mr Chalkley's son Ross Naylor said he had discovered on Saturday afternoon the pair were among those killed.
He said his fears had increased after hotel staff told him his father and partner were on the beach and had found some of their bags on the sand.
Some families of holidaymakers said they had struggled to get information from Tunisia.
Simon Boon, from Felixstowe in Suffolk, said his sister, Alison Heathcote, 48, was badly injured, while there was no update about her husband Philip, 53.
"Alison was on most news channels, being stretchered off on a sunbed," Mr Boon said.
Mrs Heathcote underwent surgery to remove a kidney on Saturday and her brother said she was now "critical, heavily sedated". Her son is planning to travel to Tunisia later.
"We've received very little information from the Foreign Office. All the information is what we've sourced ourselves from phoning the four hospitals around Sousse," he said.
Home Secretary Theresa May suggested British officials were also facing difficulties.
As the attack took place on the beach, few of the victims had been carrying passports or other means of identification, she said.
Ms May added that some of those injured were being moved between hospitals in Tunisia.
Relatives of many of the Britons have turned to social media in a desperate bid to track them down.
Adam Fisher, from Redhill, Surrey, said he had not spoken to his parents since they left for their holiday.
He told the BBC he felt "powerless".
Danny Clifford said initial information that his parents-in-law Denis and Elaine Thwaites, from Blackpool, were in hospital turned out to be wrong.
"We are now back to square one and fearing the worst," he said.
Another person awaiting news is Cheryl Mellor, from Bodmin in Cornwall.
Father Graham Minors, the vicar of St Petroc's Church, told BBC Radio Cornwall he had been informed on Friday night that she and her husband Stephen were caught up in the shooting.
He said he understood Mrs Mellor had been shot in her arm, but had heard no news of her husband.
"She's had no official confirmation, but is fearing the worst," he said.
Father Minors said the last thing Mrs Mellor remembered was seeing her husband shot while trying to protect her.
Graphic designer, photographer and blogger Carly Lovett was among the first named dead after the attack, while her fiancee is understood to be travelling back home.
The 24-year-old, from Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, was a graduate of Lincoln University. Ex-students joined friends to pay tribute on social media.
Some described it as a "waste of a young life", while another described Carly as "a lovely colleague", who was "always making us laugh".
Lincolnshire Police said they had appointed a family liaison officer to support Miss Lovett's family.
Claire Windass, from Hull, also died in the attack, her family have confirmed.
A neighbour of the 54-year-old described her as a "lovely lady who would do anything for anyone".
Mrs Windass was on the beach with her husband, who survived and is reported to have returned to Hull.
In nearby Goole, the family of Bruce Wilkinson paid tribute to the 72-year-old grandfather.
They described him as a "loving family man".
"He was fun-loving and will be deeply missed by friends and family alike," his family said in a statement.
Grandmother Lisa Burbidge, from Whickham, Gateshead, has also been named locally as one of those killed.
Her granddaughter, Chloe Thompson, posted a tribute online, describing her as "my best friend".
One of Mrs Burbidge's daughters is believed to have been on holiday with her in Tunisia, according to neighbours.
"It's been a massive shock to the whole street. It'll be a massive shock to anyone from Whickham," one neighbour said.
She told BBC Look North Mrs Burbidge had been killed almost exactly 10 years after the death of her husband.
The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to warn further terrorist attacks in Tunisia are possible and urged people to be "especially vigilant".
Thousands of tourists are believed to have flown back to the UK from Tunisia on Sunday as part of efforts by holiday companies.
