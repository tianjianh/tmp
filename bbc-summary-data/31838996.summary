[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bosses at Gatwick Airport have unveiled five "guarantees" they hope will convince the Airports Commission to approve a second runway.

The airport is in competition with Heathrow to win approval for an additional runway.
One of the guarantees is compensation for people living close to the airport.
Gatwick's chairman Sir Roy McNulty said: "These guarantees would mean Gatwick takes on the main risks of building the new runway."
The Airports Commission is currently considering three options for expanding airport provision in south-east England and is due to publish its findings in the summer.
These options are a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow or a second runway at Gatwick.
Gatwick has "guaranteed" the project would be privately funded with no need for public subsidy, that airport charges would be capped and it would bear the main risks of the expansion plan.
It has also promised to compensate residents by Â£1,000 towards council tax bills if they are affected by significant level of aircraft noise, and said it would ensure that air quality targets always were always met.
