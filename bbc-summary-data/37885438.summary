Football matches across Uruguay have been suspended this weekend, after the death of a fan who was shot by rival supporters in September, the country's football association says.

Penarol fan Hernan Fioritto, 21, and two others were hit by rival Nacional supporters, who wanted to steal their club scarves.
The men attacked were celebrating the club's 125th anniversary in the southern town of Santa Lucia.
Fifteen men are being held in prison.
They are now being accused of homicide, El Clarin newspaper reports (in Spanish).
The other two injured men have already recovered, though one of them spent a month in hospital.
Uruguay's football association said in a statement (in Spanish): "As important to all Uruguayans as football is, there is nothing more important than the life of a human being and young football fan.
"We have to think and reflect on what is the limit of passion, admiration and feeling for a football club."
Penarol said on Twitter its flags would fly at half mast and that the club's players would wear a black band until the end of the year to remember the victim.
