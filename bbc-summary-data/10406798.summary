Consultation into £250m Carlyon Bay resort plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public consultation has opened into a £250m resort planned for Cornwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plans by the Commercial Estates Group for the development in Carlyon Bay were halted when a public inquiry rejected them last year.
The group said it had new proposals for the plans and that people had the chance to look at the development brief until 26 June and give their views.
The company said it would then submit a fresh planning application to Cornwall Council in the autumn.
Planning permission was first granted in 1991 for the project near St Austell - which includes more than 500 holiday apartments - and sea defences were originally built to protect the apartments and construction workers.
But when developers applied to upgrade the defences, opponents claimed they were too big, unsafe, and could damage the environment.
The company said it was now working with the council and using feedback from other consultations in the hope the plans would meet with local people's approval.
The Commercial Estates Group said the new plans included defences which would be set back about 27m (90ft) from the front line of the previously refused scheme.
Exhibitions of the plans are being held at the project's Information Centre at Crinnis Beach, Carlyon Bay, until Saturday, and at The Engine House, Fore Street, St Austell on Friday.
