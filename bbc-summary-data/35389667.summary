In a game of few clear-cut chances, Charlie Walker scored the winner shortly after half-time when his left-footed strike beat keeper Dean Snedker.
Walker twice had further goals ruled out, first for a foul by team-mate Alfie Pavey and then after the 25-year-old striker was caught offside.
But Harriers were unable to avoid slipping to a seventh successive loss.
The visitors, making only their second appearance of 2016 after a succession of postponements, had new signing Evan Garnett making his debut as a 73rd-minute substitute following his arrival from Evo-stik Southern Division side Belper Town
Harriers, still under the control of chief executive Colin Gordon, are now six points adrift at the foot of the table, 16 points from safety, while Aldershot move up a place to 13th.
Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey:

"We are pleased with the result. When you are not playing well and the other team are dominating for certain spells, you have to grind out results like that.
"We've played in games when we've been the better team and not get results. Today we didn't play as well and got three points.
"We dropped our standards in the first half and we didn't organise the way we should have. We sorted it out at half-time and the players reacted in the right way but getting that early goal.
"Charlie Walker has scored 11 goals this season. His work-rate is great for the team and he deserved that goal on his performance."
