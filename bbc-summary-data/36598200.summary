City will meet an 18m euros (£13.8m) release clause in Nolito's Celta Vigo contract, which expires in 2018.
The 29-year-old, who is on duty with his country at Euro 2016, has yet to decide his future, with his former club Barcelona also interested in him.
Nolito has started all three of Spain's matches at the Euros so far, scoring in the 3-0 win against Turkey on 17 June.
He started his career at Barcelona, where was given his debut in 2010 by Pep Guardiola, who is City's new manager.
Nolito moved to Benfica in 2011, before joining Celta two years later.
Should the winger join City, he would become Guardiola's second signing following the £20m arrival of midfielder Ilkay Gundogan from Borussia Dortmund.
