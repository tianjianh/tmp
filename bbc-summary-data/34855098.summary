A BMW parked outside the property in Wilkinson Street, Leigh, was crushed by a hail of bricks and chunks of masonry in winds of up to 50 to 60 mph.
Half of the flats in the two-storey 14 apartment block had to be evacuated at about 19:45 GMT during Storm Barney.
Part of the street is currently cordoned off.
Some of the bricks are still hanging off the building which used to be a technical college.
Dean Bates, a resident who was able to stay in the building, said: "I had just walked through the doors and I heard this almighty crash and I virtually jumped out of my skin."
Stuart Schofield, who lives opposite the block, said he was watching the England v France football match on the television, "when I just heard the loudest bang of my life."
He added: "Luckily no one was in that car at the time... I usually park my car in that spot, I had parked two spaces behind it."
Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said crews were called out to several incidents thought to be a result of the bad weather.
