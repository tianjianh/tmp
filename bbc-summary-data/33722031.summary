[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bramley apple pie filling is given protected status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traditional Bramley apple pie filling has been given protected status by the European Commission.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mixture is defined as a blend of fresh Bramley apple pieces, sugar and water, with the option of Bramley apple puree, cornflour and lemon juice.
The apple pie filling joins several other delicacies on the traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG) list.
Bramley apples are grown commercially across Kent, East Anglia and the West Midlands.
Other products given the same special status as the pie filling include Italy's mozzarella cheese and Belgian lambic beer.
The TSG list seeks to protect the reputation of regional products, promote traditional and agricultural activity and ensure inferior products cannot be promoted unfairly.
Adrian Barlow, chief executive of English Apples and Pears, said: "We are delighted that Bramley apples have been recognised by the EU and that they, like us, realise that the heritage of such an iconic British ingredient is worth celebrating and the traditional Bramley apple pie filling worth protecting."
A farm product may be registered as TSG only if it is produced using traditional raw materials and prepared with traditional methods.
The designation is considered a boon for ingredient producers as it is thought to place a premium on their product.
The TSG is one of three European designations used to protect local foods, including Cornish pasties, Jersey royal potatoes and French Champagne.
