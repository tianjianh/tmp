Rotherham yet to train taxi drivers on child sex abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New training for taxi drivers on how to spot signs of child sexual exploitation has yet to be implemented in Rotherham a year after a report called for it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Jay Report said taxi drivers played a prominent role in moving around children who were abused in the town between 1997-2013.
One recommendation was to provide training so taxi drivers could help agencies spot and report abuse.
The council said compulsory courses were being planned.
Authorities in a number of others areas including Leeds, Calderdale and Harrogate have already brought in the training as a direct result of what happened in Rotherham.
The delay in Rotherham has been because of problems in bringing in a new licensing policy.
Rotherham Council did start a review of its licensing policy after the Jay report was released.
It was decided last November that CSE training should be given to taxi and private hire vehicle drivers.
But the council was in chaos and the plans were scrapped after another report, by Louise Casey, deemed the council unfit for purpose. Government commissioners were put in charge of council functions and the licensing department.
A new policy has now been approved and compulsory training is included for taxi licence holders.
It's due to get under way in the next three months, but a year on from the Jay Report, the public will be left wondering if valuable time has been wasted.
The council said taxi drivers that had specific contracts dealing with vulnerable children already received safeguarding training.
It said the new licensing policy, which was brought in last month, now made it a compulsory requirement.
A spokesman said: "The council is in the process of organising 60 sessions that will ensure all drivers receive the training within a three-month period.
"The cost of these sessions will be met by the council."
There are 1,200 drivers registered in Rotherham, 80 operators and 800 vehicles.
