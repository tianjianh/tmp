County Championship: Brendan Taylor hits ton against Middlesex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor marked his Championship debut for Notts with a century as they reached 298-9 on the first day against Middlesex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old was given the chance to open at Lord's and made the most of it with 106 off 188 balls, with 14 fours.
However, Welsh pace bowler James Harris took four wickets in two overs to reduce them from 180-2 to 183-6.
It gave him figures of 4-75, but Chris Read halted the Notts slump with 62 not out before bad light ended play.
However, skipper Read was unable to see his side to a third batting bonus point, while Middlesex collected a full set of bowling points.
Taylor was one of three new faces in the Notts XI, having arrived on a three-year contract, joined by South Africa seam bowler Vernon Philander and former Gloucestershire all-rounder Will Gidman.
And he shared a third-wicket partnership of 108 with namesake James Taylor (36) after Steven Mullaney was bowled off the inside edge by Tom Helm for 22, having previously been dropped twice off the same bowler, and Alex Hales run out without scoring.
Harris then had James Taylor caught at mid-wicket and won an lbw decision against Samit Patel in the space of four balls, and then had Riki Wessels and Brendan Taylor leg before in his next in a welcome return to form after only making seven Championship appearances last summer.
