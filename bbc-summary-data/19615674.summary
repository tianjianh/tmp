Kevin Ssali, of Whitworth Road in South Norwood, was attacked after he got off a route 202 bus in Lee.
Police and paramedics were called to Burnt Ash Road at about 21:45 BST on Saturday where they found him with multiple stab wounds.
Three teenage males have been arrested on suspicion of murder, police said.
Detectives believe Kevin had travelled on the bus through Lee Green and was attacked after getting off outside a supermarket.
He was taken to hospital, but later died. A post-mortem examination will take place on Monday.
Det Ch Insp Mark Dunne said: "I am appealing for anyone who travelled on the route 202 bus on its way through the Lee area just before 9.45pm on Saturday night to speak to my officers.
"Did you witness an altercation or argument involving a group of male youths?
"I would also like to speak to anyone who was in Burnt Ash Road, where the victim got off the bus. I need to know what the series of events were which culminated in a 14-year-old boy losing his life."
One of Kevin's friend, Denshan Williams, who was at the scene to pay tributes, said: "It still hasn't sunk in now. It makes me think that it could happen to anybody."
The stabbing occurred near the bakery where 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen was murdered in 2008, close to his family home.
Jimmy's father, Barry Mizen, said: "It came as a great shock because it's a few hundred yards away [from where Jimmy was stabbed].
"Our hearts go out to the family."
Jimmy's mother Margaret said: "Today what was horrible was that I saw all the ribbon that was around the area and that brought back such memories of when Jimmy was killed.
"It is painful and it does bring back the pain."
The couple asked people to help the police and urged people to "stand together and let's bring peace in the community".
In an unrelated incident, police said a 19-year-old man was stabbed in New Cross Road  - just three miles from Lee - just after 03:30 BST on Sunday.
The man is in a critical condition in hospital. No-one has been arrested over the attack.
The Met said six teenagers have died as a result of violence in London this year, four of whom were stabbed.
Eleven teenagers were stabbed last year, which was one more than the figure in 2010.
In 2009, 10 teenagers lost their lives in stabbings and in 2008, the year Jimmy Mizen was killed, 22 other youths were stabbed to death in the capital.
