Atzaz Khan, 40, pleaded guilty to six counts of disseminating terrorist publications under the Terrorism Act at Leeds Crown Court on Thursday.

When they were shut down, he activated others and posted links to publications praising the Paris terrorist attacks.

Officers said Khan was arrested in March 2016 after making posts on social media in support of the so-called Islamic State group.
Det Ch Supt Clive Wain, from the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, said: "Due to the vast reach and influence of social media, the implications of posting such material should not be underestimated.
"Tackling extremist material is an essential part of protecting the public and preventing offences that incite or encourage acts of terrorism."
