Timeline: Irish Olympic ticket-sale scandal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The performance of the Republic of Ireland's athletes at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics has been overshadowed by allegations of illegal ticket sales involving senior Irish Olympic officials.

The alleged scheme - in which tickets were reportedly being sold for many times their face value - could have netted of 10m reals (Â£2.4m; $3.1m), police say.
The arrest of Olympic Council of Ireland president Pat Hickey made headlines around the world.
The former judo international has denied any wrongdoing in relation to ticket sales, and is due to appear before a judge in Rio on Tuesday.
Here is how events have unfolded:
Friday 5 August:
On the day of the Olympics opening ceremony, Rio police arrest Kevin Mallon, director of THG Sports, a corporate and sports hospitality company based in London.
More than 700 tickets organised in envelopes clearly marked for sale are found in a safe with Mr Mallon, police said.
Wednesday 10 August:
In an email seen by RTE News, Pro 10 Sports Management, the OCI's authorised ticket re-seller in Ireland informs the organisers of the Rio games that:
"At no time did we authorise Mr Mallon to sell any tickets on our behalf nor to the best of our knowledge did he sell any tickets. He merely acted as a collection point for individuals transacting directly with ourselves."
The OCI says it is launching an immediate investigation, adding that it "strictly adheres to the International Olympic Committee regulations around ticket allocation, sale and re-sale".
"We are treating this matter with the utmost seriousness," it says.
Sunday 14 August:
Irish Sports Minister Shane Ross arrives in Rio for a meeting with Pat Hickey.
Mr Ross describes the meeting as "fairly tense, fairly direct and fairly frank", and calls for an independent investigation.
Mr Hickey says the meeting was "excellent".
Monday 15 August:
A Brazilian judge orders the arrest of four THG Sports executives.
Marcus Evans and Martin Studd from the UK, Irishman David Patrick Gilmore and Dutchman Maarten Van Os are not believed to be in Brazil.
Police say they will be pursuing the matter via Interpol.
Wednesday 17 August:
Pat Hickey is dramatically arrested by police at his luxury hotel. His Olympic credentials and passport are seized.
Mr Hickey complains of a heart problem and spends a night in hospital.
Thursday 18 August:
Pat Hickey temporarily stands down from his positions as president of the OCI, president of the European Olympic Committees and member of the executive board of the International Olympic Committee.
The OCI says in a statement that Mr Hickey is stepping aside "until this matter is fully resolved" and would continue to co-operate and assist with all inquiries.
Acting OCI President William O'Brien says the council will "defend ourselves to the hilt".
Mr Hickey is questioned by police, denied bail by a judge and sent to Rio's notorious Bangu 10 prison.
Friday 19 August:
The OCI announces it will commission an independent inquiry into Olympics ticketing.
Saturday 20 August:
Pat Hickey and Kevin Mallon are reported to be sharing a cell in Bangu prison.
Sunday 21 August:
Brazilian police seize the passports, phones and laptops of three senior OCI officials.
RTE and the Irish Times say the officials are OCI Chief Executive Stephen Martin, a former Olympic hockey gold medal winner, OCI Secretary General Dermot Henihan and Kevin Kilty, Ireland's Olympic chef de mission.
No arrests are made and there is nothing to suggest impropriety on the part of the three men, reports say.
In Dublin, the OCI Executive Council appoints a three-person crisis management subcommittee to lead its response to the crisis.
