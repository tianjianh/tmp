Burton Albion's precarious position in the Championship means they must make new signings in the January transfer window, according to boss Nigel Clough.

The Brewers are just one point and one place above the relegation zone following Monday's 1-0 home defeat against Preston North End.
Clough told BBC Radio Derby: "Everybody has had a chance now and we are fourth from bottom of the league.
"We will do everything we can to get some Championship players in."
The Brewers retained the nucleus of the side that finished second in League One last season, but have only won six of their 25 league matches in 2016-17.
Clough continued: "It's a great thing saying we have to keep the team and keep the spirit together and everyone deserves a chance.
"The lads will keep giving absolutely everything but you have to do more than that in the Championship."
Clough said the Brewers are close to bringing one new player on an 18-month contract, adding: "We have agreed a deal and that should be tied up by the weekend."
The Brewers are also making progress with two loan signings and are keen to extend attacking midfielder Will Miller's loan deal from Tottenham.
But midfielder Hamza Choudhury has returned to Leicester City after cutting short his loan spell.
