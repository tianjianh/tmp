Captain Heather Stanning managed to fit a tour of Afghanistan in between winning Olympic gold and setting a new rowing record at the World Championships.

Easy right? Well the army hopes some of its young female soldiers will follow her example.
Officials have started an elite programme to deal with the lack of female athletes in certain sports, like weight-lifting, rowing and boxing.
Newsbeat tracks two 17-year-olds hoping to make it:
Chloe and Laura are among 70 young women who applied to take part in the first assessment day at Aldershot Military Garrison.
They are tested by performance scientists and after the easy bit (photos, height measurements) the hard work begins.
The pair are put through a vertical jump test, a timed 30-metre sprint, before a set of gruelling sprints on spin bikes.
Laura told Newsbeat: "I've never done the long jump before, so it's quite a good experience."
Chloe added: "It was alright, I don't think I'll be a jumper but it was good to try it out."
This is the first of many assessment days which will be taking place across army bases across the UK, as well as in Cyprus and Germany.
This programme is a joint venture by the British army, UK Sport and the English Institute of Sport, which wants to recruit in disciplines with too few female competitors.
Chloe told us: "I was hoping to do the winter Olympics, because I like watching it on TV.
"I really want to try out the skeleton."
She said: "I was curious of what it would involve and when I was younger I'd always wanted to be in the Olympics, so I thought I'd give it a try."
The Â£1.4m pound project is being funded by money raised by troops providing security during the London 2012 Olympics.
The hope is that the successful athletes will be seriously challenging for medals in Tokyo in 2020.
Performance scientist Neasa Russell believes six years is about the time it takes to develop from raw talent to Olympic contender.
So what of Laura and Chloe's chances?
"It's a little bit hard to tell," Neasa told Newsbeat, "but I think one, they're here today and two, they've gone around and given their best. That shows a lot of good character."
She added: "The good thing is that even if they might not be quite suited to an Olympic sport, we can give them an opportunity with army sports to try that out as well."
