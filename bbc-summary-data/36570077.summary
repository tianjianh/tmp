Stephen Gallacher hopes to return to Europe's Ryder Cup team in 2018 after a wrist injury put him out of contention for this year's event.

The 41-year-old was part of the successful European team that overcame the United States in 2014.
However, the recurrence of a wrist problem has put him out of contention for this year's Ryder Cup at Hazeltine in Minnesota, starting on 30 September.
"There's been plenty guys played Ryder Cup in their 40s," the Scot said.
"Who knows? I might have the best years ahead of me once I change my swing and I'm injury free."
Le Golf National in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France, will host the 2018 Ryder Cup and Gallacher, who has had surgery on his left wrist, hopes to be back playing later this year.
He aims to change his swing during his absence from competitive action.
"I'm going to use this time off to the maximum," Gallacher told BBC Scotland. "I'm going to come back stronger and a bit fitter.
"I'm raring to go just now. I can't wait to get back into the clubs. I'm really looking forward to it.
"The full year for the Ryder Cup, you hope you're in the top 50 so you can play in all the majors."
For this year's event, Europe captain Darren Clarke has selected Padraig Harrington, Thomas Bjorn and Paul Lawrie as well as Ian Poulter as vice-captains.
"I think there's going to be a few more rookies in it, yeah definitely," said Gallacher.

"I don't think that really matters. They're all on form and he [Clarke] has always got three picks as well that he can add a bit of experience in if guys don't make it.
"The guys have got there on merit. We'll be up for the case, no bother.
"You've got Matt Fitzpatrick and Andy Sullivan. There's a lot of guys knocking on the door for these spots.
"Then you've got the likes of Martin Kaymer and Lee Westwood, who you would want in your team, I would think.
"Poulter's not going to be there now, but he's going to be a vice-captain, which will be a fantastic addition to the team room.
"There is scope for him to put guys that are experienced in there as well. I think you need a bit of both."
