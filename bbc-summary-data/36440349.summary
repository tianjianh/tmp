[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
United were already on top when City midfielder Conor McCormack was sent-off for two yellow cards on 28 minutes.
Derry keeper Ger Doherty twice kept out John Sullivan efforts as the hosts were denied by poor finishing and determined Derry defending.
Aaron McEneff almost snatched a later Derry winner when his strike was superbly saved by Conor Winn.
Derry were on the backfoot from the start at Eamonn Deacy Park and Ruairi Keating saw his shot headed off the line by Dean Jarvis.
Stephen Folan headed over and Gary Shanahan hit the side-netting while Ryan Connolly directed affairs from midfield.
McCormack was booked for simulation before a heavy challenge resulted in his dismissal.
Candystripes striker Rory Patterson was forced off with injury minutes later on his return after a hamstring problem.
The visitors kept Galway at bay for the remainder of the half and the tempo slowed early in the second half.
Enda Curran's header, which flew just wide, signalled the resumption of a concerted threat on the Derry goal and Doherty had to be at his best while skipper Ryan McBride was an outstanding leader of the rearguard.
Vinny Faherty netted but he was ruled offside before McEneff forced Winn into action after 85 minutes.
Folan headed wide with the last opening of the game as Derry came away with a point to remain third going into the mid-season break.
