The hosts opened the scoring through a Mark Docherty own-goal and found a second from defender William Edjenguele from close-range.
Robert Thomson grabbed one back for Dumbarton 18 minutes from time, but the visitors couldn't find a leveller.
The Sons remain without an away league win since December 2015.
United's Scott Fraser hit a post after six minutes when he latched on to Nick van der Velden's pass, before Arabs stopper Cammy Bell somehow got down to bundle away Gary Fleming's shot from three yards out.
Bell contrasted the point-blank save with a full-length diving stop to turn away Thomson's clever header, which looked certain to sneak in.
In the visiting goal, Alan Martin was beaten on the half-hour but Docherty was in place to head Coll Donaldson's header off the line.
United started the second half with a greater sense of purpose, working their way into a two-goal lead - although Dumbarton will be disappointed that both came from corners.
Docherty headed past his own goalkeeper after 52 minutes and Martin was beaten again 14 minutes later when his initial stop fell to Edjenguele, who forcefully drove home from only three yards out.
Dumbarton refused to be disheartened and set about finding their way back into the game.
Substitute Andy Stirling was the catalyst for their 72nd-minute goal, his low cross met by Thomson, who just beat Bell to the ball and squeezed it beyond the keeper.
United looked to the assistant referee for an offside ruling but Simon MacLean, who had dropped his flag, picked it up and raced to the halfway line.
Dumbarton tried to find an equaliser but couldn't find a way past United, who came closest to adding to their tally when Van der Velden pulled his shot wide.
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "It was a fine three points for us today. Dumbarton were very direct and the guys had to deal with a lot of headers and second balls. We've passed the ball really well and had some great performances. A lot of teams are coming here and making life difficult for us; my team had to be patient and we had to work at getting the result.
Dumbarton manager Stevie Aitken: "I thought the application of the players was terrific today; they are dejected in the dressing room and it says a lot that we come here as a part-time club and are disappointed at losing to Dundee United. I thought Cammy Bell was outstanding and I was ready to celebrate twice - how he saved them I just don't know."
