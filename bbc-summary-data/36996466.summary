Members of the Justice for Mark Duggan campaign walked from Broadwater Farm estate to Tottenham police station, where a vigil was held.
Mr Duggan, 29, was shot and killed by police who were trying to arrest him in north London on 4 August 2011.
The Met said at the time they suspected he was in possession of a firearm.
Around 100 demonstrators marched along the same route as the protest march to Tottenham police station on 6 August  2011 carrying Black Lives Matter placards and banners shouting "no justice, no peace".
An inquest jury decided in January 2014 that Mr Duggan had been lawfully killed.
The demonstrators arrived at Tottenham police station, where they started a vigil with a minute's silence.
The 2011 protest turned into a stand off with police before descending into violence.
Five nights of riots followed, spilling over into other parts of the capital with copy cat riots flaring up in cities across the country, such as Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol.
The demonstrators said the march would also be remembering other black people who have died in controversial circumstances including Cynthia Jarrett, Joy Gardner, Roger Sylvester and Jermaine Baker.
On Friday, Black Lives Matter protesters blocked roads in Nottingham, Birmingham and the M4 at Heathrow, in a day of anti-racist activism.
