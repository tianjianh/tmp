RB Leipzig 'have no history' says Borussia Dortmund chief executive

RB Leipzig's rise from Germany's fifth tier to the top of the Bundesliga is no fairytale, says Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke.

Leipzig, founded in 2009 with backing from drinks firm Red Bull, are three points clear at the top of the table.
Watske dismissed suggestions Leipzig's rise is on the same scale as Leicester City, the 5,000-1 outsiders who won last season's Premier League.
"There is no tradition like Leicester City," said Watzke.
With the backing of the Austrian energy drink manufacturer, Leipzig have won four promotions in seven seasons.
They have won their last eight top-flight games and face defending champions Bayern Munich away on 21 December.
Their rise has seen them labelled "Germany's most hated club" and opposition fans have staged protests against their commercial structure.

In September, some Dortmund fans did not travel to support their team at Leipzig and instead followed radio coverage of the match at the club's old ground.
Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel suggested in November that Leipzig could emulate Leicester's Premier League achievement and win the Bundesliga.
Speaking to BBC World Service's World Football, Watzke described RB as a promotion tool for Red Bull.
"It's a club built to push up the revenues for Red Bull and for nothing else," he added.
"Ok, it's good for the league because the race to be champions is more close.
"In German football, the clubs belong to the fans and our pricing level is very cheap. A lot of fans from England come to Borussia Dortmund to watch a live game for 11 euros."
