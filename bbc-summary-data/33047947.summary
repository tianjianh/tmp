[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted "shocking" fraud, assault and slavery offences involving a 27-year-old victim has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Joyce, 33, was imprisoned for 34 months having pleaded guilty at an Oxford Crown Court hearing earlier this year.
Three co-defendants, Helen Cash, Michael Joyce and Ifran Iqbal, were also sentenced after admitting offences in connection with the case.
Prosecutors said it involved "serious mistreatment of a vulnerable man".
The offences took place in Oxford and Hemel Hempstead between 6 January 2012 and 29 November 2013.
Adrian Foster, chief crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said the victim was "trapped by his personal circumstances".
He said: "They used intimidation, threats of violence and actual violence to prevent the victim leaving them or from alerting the authorities to their mistreatment.
"It is shocking to hear that offences such as these can occur in modern times."
The victim was forced to work long hours without being paid, had his bank card stolen and benefits were claimed on his behalf, Mr Foster added.
Paul Joyce, of Old Abingdon Road, Oxford, admitted three counts of fraud, one count of common assault and two counts of substantive forced labour.
Cash, aged 31, of the same address, pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud and two of substantive labour.
She was given a two-year suspended sentence and an 18-month supervision order.
Michael Joyce, 25, also of the same address, pleaded guilty to one count of substantive forced labour.
He was given a two-year suspended sentence and ordered to undertake 150 hours of unpaid work.
Ifran Iqbal, aged 29, of Millfield Walk, Hemel Hempstead, pleaded guilty to one count of fraud and one count of substantive labour and was given a one-year community service order.
