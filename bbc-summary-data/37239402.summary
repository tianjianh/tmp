Swansea's Franck Tabanou joins Granada on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City defender Franck Tabanou has joined Spanish La Liga club Granada on loan for the rest of the 2016-17 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old joined Swansea in 2015, but made only three appearances before going on loan to former club St Etienne.
The ex-France Under-21 cap can play on the wing, but is primarily a left-back.
Neil Taylor's presence in Swansea's defence helped ensure Tabanou's chances to impress were rare.
