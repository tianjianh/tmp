He will be joined by musical star Elaine Paige, DJ Sara Cox and The Saturdays' singer Rochelle Humes.
Contestants in one-off specials, such as Fern Britton and Susanna Reid, have gone on to compete in the main show.
The 2013 line-up was officially unveiled on Strictly: It Takes Two on Monday evening.
The six contestants also include comedian Rufus Hound, and EastEnders actor Ricky Norwood, who plays 'Fatboy' in the soap.
Hound previously won Let's Dance For Comic Relief, performing a spoof version of Cheryl Cole's routine to Fight For This Love.
Humes, meanwhile, lost out to McFly's Harry Judd in the 2010 Children In Need edition of Strictly.
The singer, who had dance training as a child star in S Club Juniors, will be hoping to emulate her husband - JLS singer Marvin Humes - who won last year's Strictly Christmas Special.
Goss, who found fame as the frontman of 80s pop stars Bros, recently appeared on Strictly as a musical guest.
The star, who currently has a residency in Las Vegas, performed a big band version of his debut single When Will I Be Famous?
Training for the festive edition is due to start this week.
The celebrities are paired with professional dancers who have been voted off the main show and given three weeks to get up to speed.
Goss will dance with Aliona Vilani, Paige has been teamed up with Pasha Kovalev, while Humes will be partnered with Ian Waite.
Norwood will dance with Janette Manrara - a newcomer this year - Cox will compete with Robin Windsor, and Rufus Hound will dance with Flavia Cacace, who did not take part in this year's main competition in order to concentrate on other dance shows.
Christmas TV schedules have not yet been finalised, but Strictly traditionally forms part of BBC One's Christmas Day line-up.
Previous winners include EastEnders' actress Charlie Brooks and Torchwood star John Barrowman.
