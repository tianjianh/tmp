[SN]TITLE[SN]
James Richardson jailed for 'frenzied' killing of Natalia Czekaj

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An alcoholic who almost decapitated his girlfriend has been jailed for six years after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prosecutors accepted James Richardson's alcohol dependency was a medical condition that substantially impaired his responsibility.
Natalia Czekaj died from multiple stab wounds in January.
A Met Police officer described it as a "tragic case" and a "frenzied attack".
The judge also imposed an extended licence period of five years during which Richardson will be supervised and receive help with his alcohol addiction.
Richardson, 35, from Berridge Green, Edgware, and Miss Czekaj, 34, were both believed to be functioning alcoholics.
They were celebrating the New Year at home when the defendant attacked the barmaid with a kitchen knife, the Old Bailey heard.
At the time, his blood alcohol level was four times the drink-drive limit.
Judge John Bevan QC told him Ms Czekaj had been "the gratuitous victim of your rage".
Det Insp Simon Pickford, of the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: "Natalia died during a frenzied attack, which may have been fuelled by Richardson's dependency on alcohol.
"Richardson will have time to think about the consequences of his actions behind bars."
In accepting the plea of manslaughter by diminished responsibility, the prosecution had to be satisfied he had a recognised medical condition that substantially impaired his responsibility.
During the trial, Richardson's defence lawyer told the court although his client could not remember the killing, "his remorse and shock have been wholly genuine".
