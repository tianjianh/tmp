Angry protests took place at the Condor Liberation ferry terminal in Poole after 70 passengers were left behind.

The new vessel had returned to service between the UK and the Channel Islands after being cancelled on Saturday because of engineering problems.
Eyewitnesses reported protests and police at the scene at the departure point after it was overbooked due to a "systems error".
The company said it would carry out a "thorough investigation".
In a statement it said: "Unfortunately Liberation's departure was delayed because a small number of passengers prevented other passengers from boarding the ship.
"Because of tidal restrictions in Jersey, the master had to make the difficult decision to sail before she was fully loaded.
"He is now trying to make up as much time as possible in order to maintain today's schedule."
The protests prevented a further 69 vehicles and their passengers from boarding the ferry.
Laurence Hall, who missed the ferry, said he had been told of passengers lying on the ground at check-in to Poole Harbour and cars lined up so nobody else could get through to the ferry.
"It's a form of protest, and as soon as three police cars turned up everybody fled.
"It's quite a surreal situation to be honest. You kind of expect to be delayed after the technical issues that Condor has experienced in the past week, but when you turn up and police cars drive through the check-in point with their lights flashing and then you hear rumours of a public protest it's not what's expected," he said.
"There are queues of passengers trying to get rebooked at check-in, one police car is still here, and Condor staff are trying to calm passengers."
The company has rebooked passengers on Monday's sailings and arranged accommodation in Poole.
Fran Collins, executive director of operations, said: "Whilst we understand and share customers' enormous frustration at the situation, it was disappointing that some of them took action in this way, thereby causing further inconvenience and delay."
She added: "I'd like to sincerely apologise for the disappointment and inconvenience this will cause to those passengers who are affected.
"Our port teams have been working flat out and moved swiftly to help affected passengers revise their travel plans and to book them accommodation.
"We will also conduct a thorough investigation to find out how this systems error occurred and ensure that we improve our processes to prevent it happening again."
The ferry is currently operating at a reduced speed following the repairs.
The initial problem with the exhaust system was discovered on Thursday and repairs were carried out.
The Â£50m Condor Liberation has been the only fast ferry between Guernsey, Jersey and the UK since March.
