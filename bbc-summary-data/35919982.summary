[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fisherman has died after being found entangled in his own nets in a river.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called to the River Helford at about 12:45 BST on Monday after someone reported seeing a fishing boat going around in circles.
The RNLI said both lifeboats from Falmouth attended and crews performed CPR on the man.
It is thought the 56-year-old had been lying in the water for some time and he was airlifted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro.
He died a short time later.
Devon and Cornwall Police said his death was not being treated as suspicious and next of kin had been informed.
