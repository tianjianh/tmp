Speaking publicly for the first time since Trudy Jones died along with 37 other tourists in Sousse in June, they said they are "stuck in a nightmare".
The care home worker, 51, from Blackwood, was on holiday with friends.
Her family said David Cameron had written to them to say a memorial will be placed locally.
"She was an amazing person, she'd put everybody before herself," said her son Gavin Davis.
"We still haven't come to terms with it all, we still haven't accepted it. I don't think any of us will ever accept it to be honest with you.
"Even with everything that's gone on - from waiting for her to come home after the event, when she landed in Brize Norton - even then it didn't seem real. It was horrible looking at a box.
"I think with all the planning and everything we've had to go through, we're constantly busy and I think that's helped us deal with it.
"I don't think it's going to sink in until everything is sorted and quietens down. It's going to be tough, really tough."
He added: "We've had a letter off David Cameron saying there's going to be a memorial put up in the area at some point which will be nice as there'll always be something local to remember her by."
His brother Wayne Davis described the last few months as a "blur".
"We're still waiting for her to come home from holiday," he said.
"It's been horrible. You just wake up in the morning and forget it, then it comes back to you in the day and it it takes your breath away."
The family were speaking at a memorial bike ride from Pontllanfraith to Newbridge and said the support from the public has been "amazing".
There will be a charity fun day in her name on Monday.
