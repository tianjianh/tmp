The teenager, who is thought to have been trafficked to Russia before ending up in Scotland, was found by a member of the public on 16 January.
He is now in the care of West Dunbartonshire Council's social work department.
Police have appealed to anyone who has information to contact them.
The case emerged at a meeting of the council's community planning management board, according to a report in the Dumbarton Reporter. Police Scotland has since confirmed the details.
Ch Supt Grant Manders told the meeting the teenager had been found on a footpath near Overtoun House.
He said: "A young Vietnamese boy - 16 years old - came into our care having been trafficked from Vietnam to Russia.
"Smashing wee boy escaped his traffickers up in West Dunbartonshire and was found cowering in the bushes having escaped from wherever he might have been going."
It is thought the boy ran for about an hour from the site of his escape before being found.
Det Con Andy Docherty said: "He was found in quite a distressed state.
"We quickly established that he was of Vietnamese origin and he stated that he was subject to a human trafficking. His welfare is paramount.
"Inquiries are ongoing."
