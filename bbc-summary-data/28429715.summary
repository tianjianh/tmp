'Trojan Horse' report by council 'ought to be reviewed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The council-commissioned review of the "Trojan Horse" allegations "ought to be reviewed itself", teachers have said.

Members of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said Peter Clarke's Government-commissioned report into allegations of a hardline Muslim take-over of schools was more thorough.
The two reports differed in their conclusions, although neither found evidence of extremism in the schools.
Birmingham City Council would not comment on the inquiry process.
It said: "This was an independent review. The terms of reference are published in Ian Kershaw's report."
Peter Clarke's report said there had been a coordinated attempt to introduce an "aggressive Islamist agenda" into some Birmingham schools and criticised the city council for not acting sooner.
Ian Kershaw's investigation for the city council found "no evidence of a conspiracy" and said individuals had encouraged certain Islamic principles in an attempt to "raise standards".
Rob Kelsall, from the NAHT, sat on the Kershaw review panel and said witnesses were put off giving evidence to that inquiry because they were asked for their names.
"It was a massive barrier. I know of one witness, a head teacher, who made a phone call to the inquiry hotline," he said.
"She was told she was not able to give a statement unless she gave her name, address and the school's details.
"I know she gave evidence to the Clarke inquiry but not the Kershaw inquiry."
He claimed the witness who volunteered details of a social media group called the Park View Brotherhood had not given evidence to the Kershaw report "because of issues of trust". Mr Clarke's report said that group included "grossly intolerant" messages.
Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, head teacher of Anderton Park Primary School in Sparkhill, said the inquiries were carried out differently.
She said she had an interview with a law firm which worked on the Kershaw review, and the firm said "tell us what you know with a blank piece of paper".
"With Clarke, the interviewer already had an incredible amount of information about me and my school going back years and asked specific, probing questions. It was more thorough," she said.
Mr Kelsall said: "In light of the Peter Clarke inquiry's outcome and recommendations, the council ought to review the Kershaw review to ensure any evidence identified by Clarke has been recognised."
