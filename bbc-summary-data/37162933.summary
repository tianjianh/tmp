Selsey Academy fire: Roofing work 'most likely' cause

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A blaze that engulfed a secondary school was "most likely" an accident caused by a workman maintaining its roof, the fire service believes.

Selsey Academy in West Sussex suffered "extensive structural damage" and much of its contents were destroyed.
The school said it hoped to announce alternative arrangements for its 453 pupils on Thursday afternoon.
Head teacher Tom Garfield said he was dedicated to keeping schooling in Selsey "in the short and long term".
The Academy is the only secondary school on the Manhood peninsular and the nearest similar school is understood to be eight miles away in Chichester.
Mr Garfield told BBC Sussex he did not know how much of the building would be useable.
He said electronic pupil records were being restored from a cloud-based storage system but it was "difficult to tell what remains of written records".
He was consulting its sponsor, the Kemnal Academies Trust, the school's insurers, the Department for Education and West Sussex County Council.
West Sussex Fire and Rescue said the first 999 call came from a roofer to say a partition on the roof was alight.
Strong winds blew embers on to adjacent buildings as the fire took hold.
Deputy chief fire officer Gavin Watts said: "There was little that could be done to stop it spreading so quickly and it is a sad sight to see such a local asset so badly damaged.
"We were able to prevent it spreading to all parts of the school, however, and I'm particularly pleased there were no injuries reported.
"I'm also glad we were able to protect the neighbouring properties including the thatched houses that are part of Selsey's appeal."
