Cornwall Council fights to end £260m BT contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cornwall Council is in a court battle to end a £260m contract with BT which it says has failed to meet targets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BT has issued an injunction preventing the council from ending the contract after just two years.
The 10-year deal was signed in March 2013 for BT to run IT, human resources, document management and other services for the council.
But a report to the council said BT had failed on performance and jobs and was in "material breach" of its contract.
A Strategic Partnership Review by the council in April said BT had promised it would create at least 197 extra jobs in Cornwall over the life of the contract.
It also said 111 of those would be delivered in the first two years, but only 35 had been created.
The review added that BT had received nearly £25m over the first two years of the contract.
But the state of service delivery had been "generally downward" since BT took over, according to the council, with just 38 per cent of targets delivered.
The council said: "The council wants to ensure that staff and councillors receive adequate support to enable them to deliver public services and that the taxpayers of Cornwall receive value for money.
"The council, therefore, provided BT Cornwall with notice of its intention to terminate the contract and bring the services in-house.
"Whilst the dispute is being determined, the council hopes and expects BT Cornwall to maintain service delivery and support affected employees."
BT said: "BT has commenced legal action to ensure fair and proper handling of the issues which have arisen about BT Cornwall and, whilst this is taking place, it would be inappropriate for us to comment."
