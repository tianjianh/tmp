Aston Villa striker Rudy Gestede has shown he is "more than just a battering ram", says his boss Tim Sherwood.

The 26-year-old 6ft 4in summer arrival from Blackburn scored his 20th header in two years to help Villa beat Bournemouth 1-0 on Saturday.
"I don't think our centre-backs are too happy defending against him every day in training," said Sherwood.
"He is very accurate with his heading and his hold-up play is very good. He gives us another dimension."

Gestede, a second-half substitute, scored 33 goals in 66 league games for Blackburn and is renowned for his physical style.
Sherwood has already described the Â£6m fee for the Frenchman as a bargain.
"He attacks the ball for his life and throws everything at it. He flies in, he hurts people if they get in his way, but he seems to get up himself," said the Villa manager.
"He terrorises defenders - he doesn't give them a minute - but he is more than just a battering ram.
"Everyone worked hard to get Rudy in - we tracked him for a long time - well I certainly have, and I mentioned him to the scouting department."
