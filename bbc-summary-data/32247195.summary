Coastguard rescue teams were called to just north of Chimney Hole, near Filey, just after 19:00 BST on Thursday.
It is thought the girl, understood to be Leah Price, lost her footing on cliffs near the Blue Dolphin holiday park.
She was airlifted to Hull Royal Infirmary where she is in a "critical but stable condition", police said.
A spokesman for the holiday park said they believed the family were from Nottingham.
"We are continuing to offer assistance to Leah's family and friends through this difficult and painful time," he added.
Coastguard rescue teams from Filey, Scarborough, Burniston, and Bridlington attended along with the inshore lifeboat from Filey.
The coastguard said the rescue was the first carried out using the new Rescue 912 helicopter.
In 2005, a six-year-old girl escaped with just "bumps and bruises" when she plunged 150ft (46m) from the same area.
Terri Ellwood, a 16-year-old-girl, fell to her death near the same caravan site in 2003.
