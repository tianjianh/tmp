She will join singer Will Young and former shadow chancellor Ed Balls on the dance floor in the next series.
Her involvement was announced on the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast show, where she told DJ Nick Grimshaw she had wanted to be on Strictly since it began.
The Irish former MTV presenter fronted I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here Now! until last year.
The 31-year-old had presented the ITV2 spin-off show since 2011.
Whitmore said she had been asked to be a contestant in the past, but had not been able to participate.
"I was afraid they might not ask me again," she added, saying she was a "big fan" of the show.
She said she used to Irish dance as a child, but joked: "It was just the legs that moved. Apparently now I have to use my hands as well."
The contestants are all known by Shakespearean code names this year, Whitmore said, revealing hers was Lady Macbeth.
The presenter added the show was "so secretive" and did not know who any of the other contenders for the Strictly glitterball trophy were.
Her dance partner has not been revealed either, but she told Grimshaw: "I just want someone who can lift me."
She said when she puts on the Strictly outfits, "I'm not Laura any more, I'm this whole other person".
"They're unbelievable - they're actually amazing," she said of the costumes, adding she was "embracing the sequins".
Whitmore said she was throwing herself into training and told Grimshaw: "I'm going to come in here in December and I'll be like the Hulk."
She said her mother was very excited about her being on the show, adding: "That's what she's always wanted me to do."
The presenter said she had been "obsessed" with the programme since series one: "It's an incredible show and I feel so honoured to be asked to part of it. I'm not going to lie, I'm slightly petrified too!"
The new series of Strictly Come Dancing will start on BBC One next month.
