[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Wells hit a career-best 258 and Stiaan van Zyl struck an unbeaten century as Sussex took command against Durham on day two at Hove.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Starting on 43-1, the hosts lost Chris Nash to Graham Onions with the third ball of the day before Wells and Van Zyl made a third-wicket stand of 376.
Wells' innings included 34 fours and seven sixes, and he smashed 32 in one over before falling to Paul Coughlin.
Coughlin removed Luke Wright for a duck soon after, but Sussex lead by 165.
It was a 14th first-class century for left-hander Wells, who is making his comeback after a long-term knee injury.
The partnership between Wells and South African Van Zyl broke the previous best for any wicket by any county in a first-class match against Durham, which was the unbroken stand of 366 between Yorkshire's England pair Jonny Bairstow and Tim Bresnan in 2015.
However, they fell short of Sussex's third-wicket record of 385, set by Michael Yardy and Murray Goodwin against Warwickshire in 2006.
Durham were not helped by losing experienced seamer Onions to injury before lunch, leaving them a bowler down.
Their opponents lost their opening two County Championship games of the season, but look favourites for victory unless the visitors can produce a strong batting performance of their own in reply.
