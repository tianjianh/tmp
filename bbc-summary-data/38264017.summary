East Bergholt wins judicial review on houses in 'Constable Country'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents in Suffolk's "Constable Country" have won a judicial review to block the building of 10 homes.

They claimed the homes would be a blot on the landscape in the village where John Constable lived and worked.
Mr Justice Mitting, at the High Court, ruled in favour of East Bergholt Parish Council's claim that Babergh Council was wrong to approve the development.
Babergh said it would "consider the judgment of the High Court carefully before making any further comment".
Parish council chairman Paul Ireland said: "The victory is not one we would celebrate because public money has been wasted.
"Babergh did not listen to concerns of local people."
East Bergholt council not against more housing, especially affordable homes, and has been talking to a developer on a project for a not-for-profit project, he said.
"Residents have spent Â£35,000 on a 140,000-word plan document which embraces localism, a government policy we support," Mr Ireland said.
Babergh planners are now to consider the consequences of the High Court's decision, "or the future consideration of this planning application," a spokesman said.
David Bowman, of Royds Withy King, who acted for the parish council, said: "The judge decided that Babergh District Council had made a number of material legal errors, including misrepresenting to local councillors what local housing needs means in the context of the local plan".
A separate decision to permit a 144-home development and another application for 75 homes could also be affected by the High Court decision, campaigners now believe.
The Suffolk village is within walking distance of Flatford Mill and the Dedham Vale, which provided the inspiration for several of Constable's most famous paintings, including The Haywain.
