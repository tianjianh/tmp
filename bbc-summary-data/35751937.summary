Feather-ending story: Bird safe after Belfast roof rescue

Shoppers on a Belfast City Centre street witnessed a dramatic rescue on Monday after a swan became stuck on a roof.

The lost swan-derer was spotted on the five-storey building on Arthur Street.
Animal rescuer Debbie Nelson, who helped co-ordinate the operation, said the female bird may have mistaken the slate-grey roof for a swan lake.
The fire service brought the bird back down to earth several hours later.
The unusual bird rescue comes after a rabbit was brought down from a roof in County Tyrone after a storm in January.
Ms Nelson, also known as Debbie Doolittle for her years rescuing animals, posted about the feather-ending story on Facebook after being called by onlookers who feared the bird could be about to have its swansong.
She said that it is very common for swans to land on roads, thinking it is water, but more unusual for a swan to end up on a roof.
"After landing on the roof, the swan would have nowhere to go as it needs quite a long runway in order to take off again. It's essentially an aeroplane."
She said she "didn't believe it" when she first heard, but that it was soon clear the bird could pose a "major safety problem".
"It was the middle of the afternoon on a busy street, so if the swan fell off the roof it could have hurt someone.
"It would be the weight of a Labrador coming off a five-storey building."
The fire service do not usually get involved in animal rescues, said Ms Nelson, but agreed to help because of the possible risk to public safety.
A rescue operation was planned for later that evening after shops had closed and the street was quieter.
"It took about an hour to get on the roof," said Ms Nelson. "When we got up there, it was up against a wall resting.
"It was a pretty quick catch, we were able to get her into the net quite fast."
In tribute to the fire service's efforts, Ms Nelson has called the swan Andi, after the individual who helped rescue the bird.
After taking the swan in for the night, Ms Nelson said she planned to release the bird later on Tuesday.
"We're trying to figure out where she came from," she said. "We think she might have came from Victoria Park, so we're going to try and release her there.

"If it's not Victoria Park, we'll release her somewhere quiet and she'll find her way back to where she's from.
"I've been rescuing animals for over 30 years, and I've never seen this before," she said. "I did once rescue a badger from a garage loft, but this is definitely a new one."
