They also have multiple entries in the singles chart, where Drake remains top.
Beyonce's "visual album" sold 73,000 copies, making it the second-fastest selling artist record of 2016, behind David Bowie's Blackstar.
Fifteen of Prince's albums made it into the chart as fans rushed to buy his music following his sudden death.
Six are in the top 40 with The Very Best Of, Ultimate and Purple Rain at two, three and four.
In the midweek chart Prince had held every spot in the top five, but many retailers ran out of physical stock at the start of the week and could not keep up with fan demand.  The singer's catalogue is also only available on streaming service Tidal, limiting its reach.
Record label Warner Music, which published most of his classic albums, said more CDs were being pressed this week.
Ultimate, which was released in 2006, reached a new peak at three after first only making it to number six when it was first released in 2006.
The Purple Rain soundtrack at four, is up on its previous peak of seven when it was first released in 1984. Dirty Mind, which entered the chart at 61, did not previously chart in the UK.
Beyonce's Lemonade sold 10,000 copies via streaming - which is the biggest streaming sales since they were introduced into the chart last year.
In the singles chart, Beyonce has six tracks in the top 40 - the highest being Hold Up at 17.  Formation, Sorry, 6 Inch, Don't Hurt Yourself and Freedom also made the top 40.
Six Prince tracks entered the top 100, with Purple Rain the highest entry at number six. The track peaked at eight when it was first released in 1984.
When Doves Cry, Kiss, Raspberry Beret, 1999 and Little Red Corvette also all charted.
Drake remained at number one for a third consecutive week with One Dance with sales of 129,000, which include 50,000 downloads and a record-breaking 7.86 million streams.
It is the highest number of track streams in a week ever recorded, beating Adele's Hello which reached 7.32 million plays on its release week in October.
Elsewhere in the album chart Adele's 25 fell out of the top five for the first time since its release in November.
Katherine Jenkins was at seven with Celebration, her album commemorating the Queen's 90th birthday. It is also number one on the classical album chart - giving the singer a record 12th UK classical number one, ahead of violinist Andre Rieu's 11.
Three other new entries in the album chart top 40 were Katy B's Honey at 22, Sandy Denny's I've Always Kept A Unicorn at 31, and Julian Ovenden's Be My Love at 37.
