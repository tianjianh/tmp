Warwickshire: Boyd Rankin set for Bears return following back injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire fast bowler Boyd Rankin is in line to make his first start of the 2017 season following a back injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old Ireland, and ex-England, international has not featured for the Bears since last July, having suffered a fractured tibia in training.
Rankin was fit enough to make four appearances in seven days for Ireland in January, in the Desert T20 in Dubai.
But he then suffered his most recent problem, another back injury, while on Ireland duty again in April.
Having opted to transfer his international allegiance back to his native Ireland, that ruled him out of his country's two ODIs against England at Bristol and Lord's in early May.
He came through a Second XI match last week against Derbyshire bowling almost 20 overs to take 3-60 in the match.
Bears captain Ian Bell will lead the side on the ground when he scored his last first-class century, an unbeaten 174 in the opening game of last season.
