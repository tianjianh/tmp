The New Forest Centre display, in Lyndhurst, aims to show how new technology has helped map sites previously hidden from view.
The Brockenhurst hill fort and Matley Ridge dog facility have not previously been noted in local history records.
The exhibition runs until 24 January.
The dog training facility housed about 200 animals which were trained to carry messages under battle conditions.
The New Forest National Park Authority said the remains of the training trenches "are very hard to spot with the naked eye".
The hill fort could not be seen with standard aerial photography, the park authority said.
A technique known as Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar), which uses lasers shone from a light aircraft, was used to map the sites.
World War Two accommodation huts, hidden in woodland at Beaulieu Airfield, also feature in the Shedding New Light on the New Forest's Past exhibition.
