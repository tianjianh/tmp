[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northbay Pelagic's main processing and packing lines were lost, along with an office and administration block, earlier this month.
Alternative employment is to be found for about 120 full-time and 100 temporary staff until the factory is rebuilt.
Some will be redeployed to other processors in the town.
Northbay Pelagic director Chris Anderson said: "We knew our staff were concerned about their jobs and we have worked extremely hard in the last week to find a solution that means everyone retains their employment."
