Out of 73 constituencies, 38 are currently Labour, 28 are Conservative and seven are Liberal Democrat, reports BBC London's political editor Tim Donovan.
Seats such as Westminster North, Hampstead and Kilburn and Sutton and Cheam will be key for the Conservatives.
Meanwhile, Brentford and Isleworth, Ealing Central and Acton and Croydon Central will be key for the Labour party, he said, in this election which is one of the "most unpredictable" yet.
