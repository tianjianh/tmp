McDonald's defends 'Signs' advert from 'negative comments'

McDonald's has defended its latest US advertising campaign after it "sparked commentary" from social media users saying they were exploiting tragedies.

The advert shows restaurant signs with messages that have been written for community members over the years.
Although some praised the company for reflecting the lives of local people, others said they shouldn't capitalise on events such as 11 September attacks.
"Did we expect all this? No," said Deborah Wahl, chief marketing officer.
"Good advertising creates emotion," she said.
"We Remember 9 11," reads one sign. Another, saying "Boston Strong" refers to the marathon bombing which killed three people.
Other signs marked wedding anniversaries, birthdays and military staff returning from active duty.
In an official statement, which seemed to contradict Ms Wahl's surprise, McDonald's told Newsbeat: "The powerful Signs commercial has sparked commentary from consumers, and we're happy to see that.
"It is part of our campaign to listen more and have a deeper conversation with our customers, and this ad is achieving that.
"We've seen some strong praise and some negative comments. We expect that, and we welcome it.
The advert, which has a children's choir singing a cover of Fun's Carry On in the background, was aired in the US during the Golden Globes and the NFL playoffs.
An associated Tumblr account explains the back story behind each of the signs in the advert.
For example, one of the signs reads: "Keep jobs in Toledo."
According to Luke Humbard, the owner-operator of this branch in Ohio, loyal customers and local workers are rewarded with discounts.
"[We] make sure to tell them we appreciate them coming to us on their thirty minute lunch breaks.
"What prompted the message was a press conference that signalled a factory line might be moving out of the city of Toledo. This could mean a loss of jobs for the city of Toledo."
McDonald's is currently facing criticism in the US for paying staff poorly, with some employees going on strike over the issue.
They are looking for a minimum wage and for unions to be introduced.
