Andrew Salter, 22, now a first-team regular, will return to Australia for a second successive 'winter season' to play grade cricket in Sydney.
He will be joined by Glamorgan second-team player Owen Morgan, 21.
Morgan will be at the Darren Lehmann Cricket Academy and playing club cricket in Adelaide.
Former England spinner Peter Such is in charge of developing young bowlers for the ECB.
"The most important factor in a player's development, particularly for spin bowlers, is match-play overs to hone the skills and work out how to apply them effectively in game situations," he said.
"There is no substitute for this.
"We are looking to expose our spinners to cricket overseas during the off season, for the experience of competing overseas, taking more personal responsibility and also to continue their development by bowling those much-needed match play and practice overs."
