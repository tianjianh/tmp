[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Heavy rains caused the mudslide in the municipality of San Pedro Soloma.
A minibus carrying 10 people to work was buried by the mudslide which came down the WachunÃ¡ hillside. All passengers on board were killed.
During last year's rainy season, which lasts from April to November, 15 people were killed in landslides.
One of Guatemala's most deadly landslides hit the mountain village of El Cambray in October 2015.
More than 200 homes were buried and an estimated 280 people died.
Guatemalan Vice-President Jafeth Cabrera said the situation this year was particularly worrying as much of the soil was already saturated with water.
