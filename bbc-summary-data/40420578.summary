Robert Lui: Salford Red Devils half-back signs contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salford Red Devils stand-off Robert Lui has signed a new long-term contract at the Super League club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Australian, 27, joined the Red Devils in 2016 and has scored four tries in 21 league games this season.
Coach Ian Watson said he was "ecstatic" to re-sign "one of the best half-backs" in Super League, a day after Niall Evalds also signed a new deal.
"This again signals our intentions to bring in and keep top quality at this club," Watson added.
