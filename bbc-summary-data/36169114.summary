Legal high teenager 'threw parrot around'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager who threw a caged parrot across a room after taking so-called legal highs has been banned from keeping animals for six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Clark, 19, admitted causing the parrot unnecessary harm in Aberdeen.
He also admitted assaulting his mother and ripping a door off its hinges before throwing it through a window.
Aberdeen Sheriff Court previously heard that Clark had taken legal highs and alcohol and did not remember the events.
Sheriff Alison Stirling said: "Given your behaviour, in that you threw a parrot in a cage about, you are not an animal lover.
"You're a danger to animals."
Clark will be under supervision for 12 months and will have to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work in the community.
The incident happened at his mother's home in the early hours of 1 January.
