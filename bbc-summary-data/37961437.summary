[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of airman Corrie Mckeague, who disappeared seven weeks ago, has said it is "hard to stay positive".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, went missing after a night out in Bury St Edmunds on 23 September.
He was last spotted on CCTV walking alone in Brentgovel Street at 03:25 the next day.
His mother, Nicola Urquhart, said: "What's happened to Corrie doesn't make sense as people can't just disappear. Somebody must know something."
She said: "It is my opinion that he must have left the area in a vehicle but police have not been able, so far, to find that vehicle.
"Somebody has given Corrie a lift somewhere, either willingly or unwillingly, and managed to get him out of Bury."
Over the past few weeks officers have been carrying out extensive work to locate Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline in Fife.
Detectives believe he stopped for a brief nap in a doorway before setting off to walk the nine miles (15km) back to the RAF Honington base alone.
Dozens of people have been spoken to and hundreds of lines of inquiry followed up, and police continue to urge anyone with information to come forward.
A trace on his mobile phone, which has not been found, showed it was in Bury St Edmunds early on 24 September but then moved to the Barton Mills area.
Facebook and Twitter pages have been set up appealing for information to help the police inquiry.
Norwich City Football Club fans have distributed posters during recent matches and club director and TV chef Delia Smith was pictured holding one.
Mrs Urquhart said the family appreciated the support they had been shown.
"It's very hard to stay positive but the help and support of the public and people around us is keeping us going.
"I've never seen a community come together quite like this."
