Dundee City Council plans 2.5% council tax rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee City Council has announced its proposal to increase council tax by 2.5% this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority said the move would mean a rise of less than 60p per week for more than eight out of 10 households in the city.
The proposal will be put before councillors at a budget meeting on 23 February.
The SNP administration said the budget proposals would have "no impact on frontline services."
The administration's finance spokesman Willie Sawers said it retained its policy of no compulsory redundancies, but said "minor voluntary redundancies" would be sought "here and there".
Mr Sawers said these were likely to be in the area of City Development.
The budget proposals also include investment to bring oil and gas industry decommissioning jobs to the city, and a planned increase in the school clothing grant from Â£81 to Â£100
Angus Council and Fife Council will vote on a proposed 3% increase in council tax on Thursday.
Perth and Kinross, which has not yet indicated if it plans to increase council tax, will set its budget on 22 February.
