The retired British gymnast, 30, had surgery to fuse fractured vertebrae after she was injured while training for the celebrity winter sports show.
She tweeted: "I just wanted to let you know the good news that I am being discharged from hospital today."
The tweet was accompanied by a photo of Tweddle wearing a neck brace.
Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington, 26, Holby City actress Tina Hobley, 44, and Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli, 26, all withdrew from the show because of injury.
Tweddle, who won five medals, including three golds, at World Championships during her career has been in hospital since hitting a barrier on 6 February.
Channel 4 said it had asked producers to review safety procedures on the programme.
