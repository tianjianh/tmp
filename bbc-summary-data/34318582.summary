[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Simon Reynolds assaulted a 27-year-old man after the victim was arrested in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, in the early hours of 22 November, 2014.
He was found guilty of common assault after an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
Reynolds, 38, was sentenced at Swansea Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The inquiry into Reynolds' conduct came after a referral to the police watchdog by Dyfed-Powys Police in December 2014.
It related to the assault of a man arrested outside Bar Luna in the town centre.
He was taken to hospital for treatment to a cut on his forehead after the incident, the IPCC said.
As well as the sentence, suspended for one year, Reynolds was ordered to pay Â£500 in prosecution costs, Â£250 in compensation and an Â£80 victim surcharge.
The watchdog said its report into the conduct of Reynolds and another officer had been passed to Dyfed-Powys Police.
