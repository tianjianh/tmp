Timeline: Reports into clerical sex abuse claims in Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The latest claims about Cardinal Sean Brady in a BBC investigation come after numerous reports into clerical sex abuse in Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
October 2005 The Ferns Report, an Irish government inquiry, found that successive bishops had failed to adequately protect children from abuse in the Wexford diocese.
It uncovered more than 100 allegations of sexual abuse by priests and said the allegations were made against 21 priests who had been working in the diocese between 1966-2002.
May 2009 The Ryan Report found that sexual and psychological abuse was "endemic" in Catholic-run industrial schools and orphanages in Ireland for most of the 20th century.
It covered a 60-year period from 1936.
November 2009 The Murphy report was published. It had looked into how the church and state authorities examined allegations of clerical abuse in the Dublin archdiocese.
It found that a cover-up had taken place, with the church placing its own reputation above the protection of the children in its care.
March 2010 There were revelations that Cardinal Sean Brady took part in an inquiry about the activities of notorious paedophile Brendan Smyth. These led to calls for his resignation.
The Irish primate said if he would only step down if asked to do so by the Pope.
July 2011 A report into clerical abuse in the diocese of Cloyne was damning of Newry-born Bishop John Magee.
The report said Bishop Magee falsely told the Irish government and the health service that his diocese was reporting all new cases of child abuse to the authorities.
Bishop Magee stood down in March 2009 after serving as bishop of Cloyne since 1987.
May 2012 The BBC revealed that despite being told about other children being abused and other children at risk of abuse, Cardinal Brady did not alert their parents or inform the police.
