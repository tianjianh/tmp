[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New head coach Ian Cathro insists Hearts will be "a different team" after watching them lose 2-0 against Rangers.

Cathro's first match in charge ended in defeat at Ibrox, having been appointed on Monday.
The 30-year-old previously worked as an assistant at Rio Ave, Valencia and Newcastle United.
"It's important that the fans know that performance is not going to be what is on the grass for them," he explained. "We will be better."
Hearts' Don Cowie had a goal ruled out for offside before Rob Kiernan and Barrie McKay netted for the hosts.
The result increases the gap between second-placed Rangers and Hearts to five points.
Aberdeen, with a game in hand, are a point ahead of Hearts in the Scottish Premiership.
"It's not a dramatic day by any means," said Cathro. "It's a game which could have gone better and we could have been better.
"But there is no disaster associated to it. Just a game we need to learn from and improve from. We will be a different team than what you saw today.
"Of course the situation is different, but I'd like to think one of the reasons I did well as an assistant was being able to help the manager as I really, really cared about it.
"For me, it was a normal day at work. We need to take as much value as we can out of this game and make improvements.
"Was there too much focus on me this week? No. Everyone will go through a process of getting to know me. I think you'll realise that very little bothers me.
"Noise is noise. The reasons why I've been able to make progress in my career is because I focus on the work."
McKay's goal was his first in the league this season, having netted in the League Cup in July.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton said: "Barrie is a young player. Almost all of last season he was first choice and got a national call-up.
"For a young player, a lot came very early. Young players have dips.
"The old saying is that form is temporary and class is permanent and I have no doubt Barrie McKay can go to the very top level.
"He can be as good as he wants to be and it was great to see him back to his best today.
"I thought we were good today as a team. Physically, we were good, tempo wise we were good, quality on the ball was good."
