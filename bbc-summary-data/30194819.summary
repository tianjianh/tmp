Bill Cosby: From America's Dad to comic under fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bill Cosby has been known to millions as America's Dad, but a string of sexual allegations threatens to leave his reputation in tatters.

His role as the benevolent, jumper-wearing Dr Cliff Huxtable in 1980s hit sitcom The Cosby Show made him a national treasure in the US.
But now that more than a dozen women have accused the comedian of misconduct, his legacy is being questioned.
The 77-year-old comedian, who was born in a housing project in Philadelphia, started his career as a stand-up in 1962 at clubs across the US.
His debut on NBC's The Tonight Show in 1963 led to a recording contract with Warner Brothers, who released a series of award-winning comedy albums.
On one of those, 1968's To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With, he established the themes that would define his work - the father as a loving disciplinarian; siblings who could plot together one minute, then scream blue murder the next; and a confidence in the bonds of family.
The album sleeve noted: "During his time on stage, Cosby never once told a joke.  He didn't sing or dance or do tricks. All he did was talk," but the performer had the 10,000-strong audience in the palm of his hand throughout.
By the time the album was released, Cosby was already a TV star.
In 1965, he had become the first black actor to star in a drama series, when he was cast in the espionage show I Spy.
He played Alexander Scott, an undercover agent posing as a tennis instructor, alongside Robert Culp, who played fellow agent Kelly Robinson.
Cosby wasn't originally in line for the role, which was intended for an older actor, but producer Sheldon Leonard had been wowed by the comedian's stand-up routine and decided to rewrite the show as a buddy comedy.
Premiering during a time of great upheaval for race relations in the US, it was banned by some stations in the southern states. But Cosby went on to earn three consecutive best actor Emmys for his role - a record that still stands.
Despite his prominence on TV, Cosby made a conscious decision not to directly address race relations in his act - preferring a more subtle challenge to the status quo.
"A white person listens to my act, and he laughs, and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it, too,'" he once said.
"OK. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right?
"So I figure this way, I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy."
The Cosby Show, which was launched by NBC in 1984 and aired for eight seasons, was his biggest success.
Described by critics as a "transformational piece of American culture", the sitcom established Cosby as a household name.
Based on his stand-up routines, Cosby's portrayal of an educated, affluent doctor and the trials of raising five young children, drew parallels with his own life.
His TV wife, a lawyer named Claire Huxtable, was loosely based on his own wife Camille Cosby, whom he married in 1964.
One of the most popular shows of the 80s, the sitcom was watched by about 30 million viewers each week. By 1989, its star was earning $4m (Â£2.5m) a month in syndication rights alone.
When the show was cancelled in 1992, Cosby embarked on a number of projects including film roles but was never able to emulate the success of his star vehicle.
In 2013, he received rave reviews for his first TV stand-up show in 30 years, which led to a national tour.
But his "triumphant return" fell apart as several women came forward with allegations of sexual assault going back almost 30 years.
The accusations first surfaced in 2005, when Andrea Constand, a staff member at Cosby's former university, said she had been drugged and molested by the star at his home a year earlier.
Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing lack of evidence, but Ms Constand filed a civil case against the comedian.
Thirteen women, 12 of whom remained anonymous, agreed to be witnesses, each with a similar account of sexual assault.
Cosby denied the accusations, which his lawyer called "preposterous", and the case was settled out of court in 2006 for an undisclosed sum.
In subsequent years, some of Ms Constand's fellow witnesses came forward and told their stories to the media, but the accusations were not comprehensively reported until Cosby's planned TV comeback thrust him back into the limelight.
More than a dozen women have now accused the star of sexual assault or rape. His lawyer has issued a blanket denial of the charges, calling them "old and discredited," while Cosby has largely refused to comment.
"I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos," he told Florida Today in November.
"People should fact check. People shouldn't have to go through that and shouldn't answer to innuendos."
Nonetheless, the accusations have left his comeback in limbo. A planned appearance on the David Letterman show was cancelled in November when it became apparent the chat show host would have to address the allegations.
NBC then announced it had shelved plans to revive Cosby's sitcom career, while repeats of The Cosby Show were pulled by cable station TV Land.
Several of his stand-up shows were called off, including those in Oklahoma, Nevada, Illinois, Arizona, South Carolina and Washington.
After a three-month break, Cosby returned to the stage in Ontario, Canada on 7 January, 2015.
He received a standing ovation, but only two-thirds of the ticket-holders turned up, and dozens of protestors stood outside the venue holding placards that read "Rape is no joke".
The star's lawyers continue to deny the charges, issuing a strongly worded statement condemning the "media frenzy".
"These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous," said Marty Singer.
"It is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.
"Lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day. There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted.
"This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards
"Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end? It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr Cosby to stop."
At first, it appeared unlikely that legal action could be taken against Cosby for any of the alleged incidents, partly because the statute of limitations applies to cases of rape and sexual assault in most US states.
However, in early December, a lawyer representing three women who claim they were abused by the star urged him to waive the statute and let her clients "obtain justice".
Separately, a woman in California sued the comedian, saying he molested her at the Playboy mansion when she was 15.
Judy Huth alleged that she was forced to carry out a sexual act against her will, adding that the incident caused "psychological damage and mental anguish".
California law allows victims of sex abuse when they were minors to bring a claim later in life if they discover they have suffered psychological injuries as a result.
Cosby's lawyers have counter-sued Ms Huth, calling for the "absolutely false" claims to be thrown out of court, but the comedian's reputation has undoubtedly been tarnished again.
