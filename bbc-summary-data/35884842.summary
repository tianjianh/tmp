Deepcut inquest: Pte Cheryl James 'told to choose lover'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A boyfriend of a young soldier who died at Deepcut barracks asked her to end a love triangle at the Surrey base on the day she died, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Paul Wilkinson said he asked Pte Cheryl James to choose one of her lovers and pick him or her boyfriend.
The inquest in Woking was told Pte Wilkinson and Pte James had been caught in bed by her boyfriend Sapper Simeon Carr-Minns, known then as Jim.
Pte James was found dead with a bullet wound to the head in November 1995.
The 18-year-old from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was one of four recruits to die at the base in seven years.
Mr Wilkinson, then aged 16, said he spoke to Pte James about 20 minutes before he heard she had died.
He said: "I just remember saying 'pick one of us, if you want to be friends that would be fine if you want to stay with him'. She said that she did not."
Mr Wilkinson said he did not try to avoid being seen while the pair talked and he was just sitting in a chair in the cabin while she was on guard duty.
He was eventually seen by a major and told to leave because he should not have been with Pte James while she was on duty, the inquest heard.
He said the officer "pretty much escorted me back to the barracks".
The major has previously told the inquest that he did not march Mr Wilkinson off.
The inquest heard that was the last time Mr Wilkinson saw Pte James.
He also told the hearing about his anger and upset after Mr Carr-Minns caught him in bed with Pte James, days before she died.
He said Pte James told him then she was splitting up with Mr Carr-Minns.
Alison Foster QC, representing the James family, suggested to Mr Wilkinson he was "not just angry" but "humiliated" when Mr Carr-Minns turned up because other people who were also in the room began to tease and laugh at him.
Mr Wilkinson said being caught in bed by her boyfriend "is not what you want".
Ms Foster then told Mr Wilkinson the major was certain he had not marched him away and asked: "Were you aware that you needed to sort out some sort of alibi?"
Mr Wilkinson said he had always given the same account but the other officer remembered it differently.
Ms Foster then recalled a statement from December 2002 in which Mr Wilkinson commented that if he had not been forced off the grounds he could have been facing a murder charge and been in prison.
But Mr Wilkinson denied he had tipped Pte James over the edge.
Ms Foster took Mr Wilkinson through differences in statements he has made and said: "Your story gets more and more elaborate as time goes by.
"Your upset and humiliation gave you a motive to be seriously angry with Cheryl.
"Is it the case you have been less than truthful for your reason for going to see her on Monday morning?"
But Mr Wilkinson replied: "No that is not true. I have said all that I remembered."
Mr Wilkinson was asked if he saw Pte James sitting by a tree, if either of them had messed with her rifle, if he saw an accident happen to her, if he was present when the trigger was pulled, and if he heard the shot - he replied "no" to each question.
He had earlier denied he got violent when angry but Ms Foster pointed out he put someone's head through an arcade machine when he thought they were laughing about Pte James's death.
Mr Wilkinson said he had been pushed to breaking point and added: "I think any other person would have done the same thing."
A first inquest into Pte James's death in December 1995 recorded an open verdict. This second inquest was ordered after High Court judges quashed the original findings.
The hearing continues.
