Sam Clancy, 24, from Rochdale, had been with more than 20 others in the Hungarian capital for a stag party but became separated from the group, the Manchester Evening News said.
Hungarian media is reporting he was knocked down by a car and killed on Friday.
Family and friends had earlier appealed for information on social media.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office statement said: "We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Budapest. We are in contact with the Hungarian police and hospital services."
Mr Clancy was last seen at a nightclub in the city. He is believed to have been hit by a car while crossing VÃ¡ci Road, in the Ãšjpest district on the left bank of the Danube River.
Tributes have been made to the young father-of-one. A friend wrote on Facebook: "RIP Sam Clancy a true gent".
"I just can't believe what's happened. Rest in peace Sam. Such a lovely lad, my thought are with all the lads, Becky & all his family, not to mention his beautiful little girl," another added.
On Twitter a friend wrote: "Gutted to hear about Sam, such a horrible thing to happen to anyone. Thoughts are with his family."
