Thousands of cards, flags, pictures and messages of condolence to the victims of the Shoreham air disaster are to be preserved in a public archive.

Tributes lined the Shoreham Toll Bridge, since dubbed the "Bridge of Flowers", after last month's crash.
Most have now been removed by volunteers and handed over to West Sussex Record Office.
They will be preserved and kept in memory of those who died when a vintage jet crashed on 22 August.
The community archive will be set up by the record office, working with local people in the Shoreham Recovery Group.
Lesley Sim, West Sussex County Council information services manager, said it would include all the cards and messages left on the bridge.
"We are currently working to dry and conserve all of these for the future," she said.
"The community archive will be held at the record office in safe, environmentally-controlled conditions where it will be catalogued and made available in the public search room for people to see and use both now and in the years to come."
The disaster happened when a vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed on to traffic on the A27 during a display at Shoreham Air Show.
The plane, flown by experienced pilot Andy Hill, failed to pull out of a loop-the-loop stunt before crashing and exploding in to a fireball.
An interim report released by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found "no abnormal indications" during the flight.
Mr Hill has now left hospital and his condition is improving.
