The victim, aged in his 30s, was assaulted after a group of four or five men entered his home in Montrose Road, Tuebrook, through a rear patio door at about 20:30 GMT on Wednesday.
He was forced into a Range Rover before he was later dumped at Bootle Docks, Merseyside Police said.
The victim was treated for injuries to his leg and face.
The vehicle was later found in Church Walk, Bootle, and recovered for analysis.
Det Insp Richie Jones said the incident "would have been shocking to witness" and urged anyone who may have seen a man being bundled into a vehicle to contact them.
