Two Ryanair jets were damaged when they collided on the ground at London Stansted Airport.

One plane was approaching the stand and the other was "pushing back" when the incident happened at about 06:45 BST.
The wing-tip of one plane and the tail-cone of another "made contact", said Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely.
No passengers or crew were injured, an airport spokesman confirmed. The Air Accident Investigation Board is investigating.
Essex Police said it had conducted "routine breath tests" on both pilots after the incident, but there was no evidence of alcohol consumption.
Mr Kiely said passengers were put on other planes after a three-hour delay.
He said Ryanair's engineering team were "investigating, and will repair both aircraft and return them to service as soon as possible".
The crash involved a plane heading to Warsaw and an aircraft from Frankfurt Hahn that had just landed. Both were Boeing 737-800 models, which can carry up to 189 passengers.
One passenger on the Warsaw-bound flight said on Twitter: "Huge loud crashing noise and totally felt the crush sitting at the back. Thank God it only hit the wing as if it was the body of the plane it'd been apocalypse."
