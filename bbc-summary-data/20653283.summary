Elizabeth Bennett and Brian Woodward tied the knot at St Peter's Church, Ickburgh, Norfolk, on Saturday, nine years after their chance conversation.
Mrs Woodward said he was "really rude" when they first spoke but he called back the following day to apologise.
"A couple of weeks later he turned up at Thetford train station and hasn't been away since," she said.
Mrs Woodward, 25, said her husband, 26, and originally from Leamington Spa, was the worse for wear when he made the first phone call and "didn't know what he was doing".
"He popped the question the day after my 21st birthday - four years ago," she said.
Mrs Woodward said the wedding on Saturday "went perfectly well" and the weather was "better than we hoped for".
One of the four bridesmaids, Hannah Hamilton, said the day had been "filled with happiness and love".
The couple, who live in Mundford, Norfolk, plan to go on honeymoon in the new year.
