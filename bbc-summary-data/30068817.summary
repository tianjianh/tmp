Scotland v England: Terry Butcher predicts test for Hodgson's side

Former England captain Terry Butcher says Tuesday's friendly against Scotland at Celtic Park will be the most hostile test manager Roy Hodgson's side will face before Euro 2016.

England have a 100% record in qualifying going into their first visit to Scotland since a Euro 2000 play-off in 1999.
"It will be a massive test, huge. If the England team and supporters think this is going to be comfortable, a nice quiet friendly, they have got another thing coming," Butcher told BBC Sport.
"I think that this will be, without a shadow of a doubt, the most hostile environment England will face before they get to Euro 2016."
England have been handed a comfortable draw in their European qualifying campaign and have already won away in Switzerland and Estonia, as well as beating San Marino and Slovenia at Wembley. They still have to face Lithuania in Group E.
Scotland face a more difficult passage to France but enhanced their prospects of qualifying from Group D with a 1-0 win over the Republic of Ireland in Glasgow on Friday.
And the mettle of Hodgson's players will face a fierce examination against the Scots, according to Butcher, who was a pillar of England's defence for the best part of a decade as well and won three Scottish titles and two League Cups with Rangers, before managing Motherwell, Inverness Caledonian Thistle and latterly Hibernian.
He also had a spell as assistant to erstwhile Scotland manager George Burley.
Butcher said: "There are not going to be any games like this in England's Euro 2016 qualifiers for atmosphere. This is a friendly but England and Scotland don't do friendlies in any sport at any level.
"It is going to be an unbelievably hostile night. Celtic Park will be bouncing with the Tartan Army buoyant on the back of a Scotland team they are very optimistic about.
"Roy Hodgson may throw a line out that he may rest some players but he will need all his most experienced players in this one. It won't be for the faint-hearted."
Butcher believes the experience of facing a fired-up Tartan Army and a rejuvenated Scotland side determined to beat the 'Auld Enemy' on their return to Glasgow will provide perfect preparation for tests ahead.
"It will be excellent for the younger players in the England squad who play week in, week out in the Premier League. They won't really have a hostile environment like they will have in Scotland on Tuesday," he added.
