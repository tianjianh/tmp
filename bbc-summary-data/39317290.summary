Donegal seized control after a tight opening and the hosts scored the final five points of the first half to lead 0-9 to 0-4 at the break.
Tyrone failed to find a response in an ill-tempered second half as Donegal easily secured the two points.
Dublin top the table after drawing with Kerry and head Donegal and Tyrone on scoring difference.
Tyrone went into the Ulster derby as league leaders but they were dominated by a determined Donegal team as the rain fell.
Peter Harte hit two points to bring Tyrone level at 0-4 to 0-4 but from here the game belonged to the hosts.
Ryan McHugh, Michael Murphy, Paddy McGrath and Hugh McFadden split the post before Ciaran Thompson added his third point of the game to ensure a five-point advantage at half-time.
Tyrone captain Sean Cavanagh scored the first and last point of the second half but there was nothing else to cheer for the Red Hands.
Cain Mulligan, Martin O'Reilly and McFadden tagged on Donegal points in a second 35 minutes littered with melees and off-the ball clashes.
Donegal's Paddy McGrath was black-carded while Tyrone pair Justin McMahon and Mark picked up yellow cards.
It was an excellent display by Donegal, who sit second and above their Ulster rivals courtesy of a better head-to-head record.
"Both sides know it was the league and we use it to try to make improvements for the championship," said Donegal captain Michael Murphy.
"We're happy with some facets of our game but we didn't push on in the second half and we are not happy with that."
