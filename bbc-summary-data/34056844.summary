A 33-year-old man walked into London's Bethnal Green police station and said he was the man in the footage, but was not arrested, police said.
The video showed a cyclist being pushed into the path of traffic after she asked a man not to cross the road in front of her at Whitechapel.
She was left shaken by the incident in Sidney Street on 1 May.
A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: "The man will be interviewed by officers from Tower Hamlets in due course."
