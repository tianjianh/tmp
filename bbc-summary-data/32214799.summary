The controversial broadcaster will appear as the guest host of Have I Got News for You on 24 April.
"Jeremy's contract has not been renewed on Top Gear but he isn't banned from appearing on the BBC," a BBC spokesman said.
Clarkson has hosted the satirical news quiz on numerous occasions.
During one appearance in 2008, he threw a pen at regular panellist Ian Hislop that left the latter with a cut on his face.
Clarkson was suspended by the BBC on 10 March following a "fracas" with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon in a hotel in North Yorkshire.
Mr Tymon suffered swelling and a split lip in the assault on 4 March and visited a hospital A&E department for his injuries.
Following an internal investigation, the BBC announced on 25 March Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed.
More than a million fans signed a petition to reinstate the presenter, but BBC director general Tony Hall said "a line has been crossed" and "there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another".
On Tuesday, North Yorkshire Police said there was "no need for further action" against Clarkson following an inquiry into the "fracas".
Top Gear is watched by some 350 million viewers worldwide and is one of the BBC's biggest properties - with overseas sales worth an estimated Â£50m a year.
The BBC has said the show will continue without Clarkson, however it is unclear whether co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond will remain.
