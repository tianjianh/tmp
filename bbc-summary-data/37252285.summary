[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northamptonshire swept to a convincing double over Glamorgan, winning by 318 runs as the visitors were spun out for just 132 on the third day.

It was the turn of left-arm spinner Graeme White to play the leading role with a career-best 6-44, as fielders clustered round the bat all day.
Off-spinner Rob Keogh took 4-73 to finish with 13 wickets in the match.
Nick Selman top-scored for Glamorgan with 30 not out but the game was over before tea on day three.
A target of 451 was always highly improbable on a pitch that had turned from day one, and Northants claimed wickets at regular intervals.
Four fell by lunch as Glamorgan were unable to break free of the Northants' spinners stranglehold, with Keogh and White taking all 20 in the match compared to 11 from Glamorgan's slow bowlers.
Victory gave Northants the double over Glamorgan after winning by 251 runs in Swansea in August.
Batsman Ben Duckett, who scored 265 runs in the match, and all-rounder Rory Kleinveldt were both awarded their county caps.
Northants spinner Graeme White told BBC Radio Northampton:
"There's been quite a bit of help for the spinners but to wrap the game up like we have done and to have the complete performance with bat and ball is very pleasing, it couldn't have gone any better for us.
"As a spinner you can't always get a run in the team, but it's nice to come across a pitch that does offer a bit of spin for the first time this year, and Rob (Keogh) was bowling really well at the other end.
"It's been a good season (for me), my white-ball cricket is my strength and I've gone well in that so I think at the end of the season I'll be quite pleased with what I've done.
"We want to finish strongly in the Championship, people just think we can play white-ball cricket but that's not the case, this shows we can compete in the format so why not push for promotion next year."
Glamorgan assistant coach David Harrison told BBC Wales Sport:
"We came into the day with hopes of at least batting the day out, build a couple of partnerships and put them under pressure but unfortunately it didn't work out that way.
"Nick Selman played nicely there on a pitch that was difficult when you went in, when you spent a bit of time there it seemed easier but we kept losing wickets and couldn't get that partnership to give us a bit of space.
"Ben Duckett played really well on that pitch and when you've got a big total on the board (against you), scoreboard pressure is always a hard thing.
"It's not a pitch we come across that often on the county circuit, turning that much, so we'll regroup and prepare for the next game against Gloucestershire."
