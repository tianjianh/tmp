Conservation pioneer Sir Peter Scott's Slimbridge home to open to the public

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former home of the "patron saint of conservation", naturalist Sir Peter Scott, is to be opened to the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The nature reserve at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, which he helped found, will also be developed.
Sir Peter, who died in 1989, built his home near the Severn Estuary in the 1950s so he could observe wildlife.
The WWT has been given a £4.4m Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) grant towards the £6m scheme.
The BBC's first ever natural history programme was presented by Sir Peter live from the lounge in the house in 1953.
Other new attractions will include an aviary and theatre, more observation hides, access to WWT's conservation duckery and the original cottage on the site will be turned into a multimedia centre.
Sir David Attenborough, who was inspired by Sir Peter's pioneering TV career, said he was the "patron saint of conservation".
"Long before words like biodiversity were coined, Peter looked out from that huge window in his house at Slimbridge and realised our lives are so linked with our natural world that we have to learn to love it and look after it.
"I think it's wonderful that absolutely anyone will be able to sit in that same window in future years and feel just as inspired."
Sir Peter, whose father was the Antarctic explorer Capt Robert Falcon Scott, helped to found the WWT as well as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
Much of the house remains as it was when Sir Peter died, and the public will be able to see items such as his original binoculars and his sketches of the panda logo he designed for WWF and the swan logo for WWT.
WWT needs to raise a further £1.6m towards the full cost of the project and work on it is due to start in late 2017.
