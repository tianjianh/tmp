[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Henry Esin, also known as Henry Ayabowei, was a well-known footballer who turned out for several teams in the area.
The 27-year-old, from Llangefni on Anglesey, was found unresponsive near Dean Street in Bangor on 2 April.
Gareth Williams, who is helping organise the event, said: "Playing this game is our way of remembering Es."
He said it was also about "doing their bit" to help his family.
The match will pitch former Bangor University squad members against the current team, at the Bangor University Stadium 3G pitch at 14:00 BST.
A 26-year-old man is due to go on trial in the autumn charged with Mr Esin's murder.
