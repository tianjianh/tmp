Norton will co-host the show alongside Tess Daly, Rochelle and Marvin Humes, Greg James and Ade Adepitan.
Sir Terry fronted the broadcast every year from its first appearance in 1980. But he pulled out last year due to ill health and died two months later.
Chat show host Norton said it was a "huge privilege" to step in.
"This year we'd love to raise as much money as we possibly can in honour of the late Sir Terry Wogan," he said.
It is the first time Norton has appeared as a presenter on the appeal. Sir Terry was replaced by Dermot O'Leary for the 2015 show.
Strictly Come Dancing's Daly, who has previously presented the show alongside Sir Terry, said it was an "honour and pleasure" to work on Children in Need again and "make a real difference to the lives of disadvantaged children and young people right here in the UK".
Former Paralympian Ade Adepitan said: "When I was a kid, Children in Need had a fundraiser at Stoke Mandeville - I was playing wheelchair basketball there.
"They made me and all the other kids feel really special, the money raised helped to buy wheelchairs and gave my friends opportunities to play sport. It was also cool to think we might get on TV.
"So, to now be part of the presenting team is such an honour and so exciting. I can't wait - it's going to be an incredible night!"
Rochelle Humes said she would "never forget the amazing experience of presenting Children in Need with Sir Terry Wogan".
Her husband Marvin - who has previously appeared on the show with boy band JLS - said: "I've always been a huge fan of Children in Need and have great memories of watching the night of TV growing up and of course, performing with the JLS boys."
BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James, also hosting for the first time, said: "It's an honour to be hosting Children in Need this year. It does such great work and makes a huge difference to the lives of disadvantaged children and young people across the UK."
The programme will be broadcast live on BBC One on 18 November from the BBC's Elstree Studios.
Director of BBC content Charlotte Moore said: "I know the nation will dig deep and do the late Sir Terry Wogan proud with their generous fundraising."
