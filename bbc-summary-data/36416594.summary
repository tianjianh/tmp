The Healthcare Environment Inspectorate (HEI) made unannounced visits to Monklands Hospital on 16 and 17 March.
Inspectors praised staff for infection control procedures but found evidence of some dirty patient equipment and outstanding maintenance work.
NHS Lanarkshire said it had taken steps to comply with the four recommendations made by the HEI team.
Claire Sweeney, interim director of Quality Assurance for Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said the inspection had covered wards and theatre departments at Monklands.
"We found that staff demonstrated good knowledge of standard infection control precautions and were generally complying with hand hygiene practice," she said.
"In addition, we found that theatre department renovation works were being well managed.
"We also identified a number of areas for improvement however. For example, NHS Lanarkshire must ensure that the environment and all patient equipment is safe and clean."
The HEI inspection report found evidence in ward four of dust on patient scales and boxes storing needles, contaminated blood glucose monitors and commodes and intravenous lines with "splash marks and sticky residue".
Inspectors also noted: "We found that the general environment in many of the areas inspected had outstanding works such as damaged walls and doors, exposed and damaged woodwork, and exposed and protruding pipe work.
"This means that these surfaces cannot be cleaned effectively.
"Staff told us that this pipe work had been reported to the estates department over one year ago and that staff had scraped their leg on the pipe work. Staff also told us that the advice they had been given by the estates department was to cover the pipe with a dressing to stop staff injuring themselves."
Calum Campbell, chief executive of NHS Lanarkshire, said he was pleased that the report had acknowledged the efforts of staff and the health board had a "detailed action plan" in place to address the issues raised.
"I can give an assurance that they have either already been resolved or are in the process of being completed," he said.
"We will continually monitor progress to ensure we strive for the highest standards of cleanliness and infection control at Monklands."
Emer Shepherd, head of infection prevention and control at NHS Lanarkshire, added: "Inspectors commented that the majority of wards at Monklands were clean and the majority of staff demonstrated good working knowledge of infection control policies.
"Inspectors also reported from their observations and from talking to our patients and visitors that staff routinely wash their hands.
"This is positive feedback to note and tells us that our staff are committed to the highest standards of patient care."
