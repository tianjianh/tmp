But they are looking at possible overseas sponsorship avenues.
That response came after reports the Swans are talking to possible investors from USA, Russia and Asia.
A club spokesman told BBC Wales the board: "always speaks to anyone who knocks on the door" as they continue to try to compete with richer Premier League rivals.
According to reports the Swans are holding discussions with potential foreign investors who might be interested in injecting funds into the club.
The club, who are in their fourth Premier League season, survive mainly on television money and transfers.
And chairman Huw Jenkins said in September that Swansea were "miles behind" most of their rivals in terms of commercial income.
Swansea City currently sit fifth in the Premier League table six points behind leaders Chelsea after drawing 0-0 at Sunderland last weekend.
