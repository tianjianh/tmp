It is part of a devolution deal that will give the regions more control over issues such as housing and transport.
The mayors will lead combined authorities of representatives from each of the existing local councils.
Ahead of the election, the BBC wants to know what you want from the new mayors and where you think their immediate priorities should lie.
What do you want to know about the candidates' plans in areas including housing and the economy?
You can also board the BBC News Listen Up bus, which will be travelling around the two regions.
It will arrive in Liverpool on 18 April to ask "What's the point of a mayor?"
On 24 April it will head up the M62 to Greater Manchester, to explore the topic "Can the mayor sort out healthcare?"
