[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Wales Green Party has launched its campaign for the local elections, pledging to "rebuild" communities.

Leader Grenville Ham said community-run renewable energy schemes and "truly efficient" housing could provide jobs for thousands of people.
"Across Wales, Greens have the expertise and the appetite to develop sustainable local economies that provide jobs for all," he said.
The party currently has one Welsh councillor and 50 confirmed candidates.
"As a party, we are focusing on reducing fuel bills through local selling of locally-generated renewable energy," Mr Ham said.
"My vision is to cut out the exploitative middle man in energy production and delivery, through Green-led local action."
Mr Ham added that Green councillors would not be told by party bosses how to vote on issues.
"We believe that our candidates know their local community best," he said.
