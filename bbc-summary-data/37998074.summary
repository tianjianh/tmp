The calendar is aimed at raising money to ensure the club continues to develop women's rugby in Hitchin.
Club members said they were "shocked" by the hip-hop star's interest.

Claire Crompton, 27, from Stevenage, said: "We were a bit shocked. My dad told me about it, I didn't know my dad was a 50 Cent fan.
"A few people have tried to tweet him."
She said she did not mind his "macho" reputation as "any publicity is good publicity - we can't complain".
Miss Crompton said they had sold 400 calendars so far, with 20 now going to the US.
