A solar farm could be built on farm land near Kelso.

Developers have submitted initial plans for the 5MW project to Scottish Borders Council.
Green Energy UK is exploring the possibility of constructing the panels about a mile south-east of the centre of Kelso.
The firm, which is based in Cheshire, has told planners it would cover an area of 30.6 acres (12 hectares) of land at Wooden Farm.
In a pre-application "screening request" to the council, they claim most of the site will remain vegetated as only 30% of the site will be covered by solar panels.
The developers said the farm could be built in 12 weeks and it is likely to be in place for 25 years.
The panels will be no more than 2.3m (7.5ft) in height.
