The tour will visit five continents in the space of 12 days, calling in on South Korea, Australia, the US and Mexico before winding up in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil in August.
Capaldi said it was "fantastic" so many people love Doctor Who.
Fans will first be able to see Capaldi and assistant Jenna Coleman at events in Cardiff and London on 7 August.
Capaldi became the latest regeneration of the Doctor at Christmas, and has spent the past few months working on his first full series starring alongside Coleman who returns as assistant Clara.
Capaldi said: "After eight months solid filming deep in the world of monsters, Jenna and I are thrilled to be heading for the Planet of Fans."
Steven Moffat, executive producer and lead writer Doctor Who which is made by BBC Cymru Wales, added: "I've always thought we'd all be a lot safer if the Doctor conquered the world, instead of the Daleks.
"Now with Jenna and Peter leading the charge, it looks like it's going to happen. I'll be bringing up the rear to handle the exposition scenes, and maybe carry some bags."
Filming is well under way on the new series of Doctor Who with guest stars including Frank Skinner, Ben Miller, Tom Riley, Keeley Hawes and Hermione Norris confirmed to be joining the action.
