Rio 2016 Olympics: Mark English exits after fifth spot in 800m semi-final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Letterkenny man Mark English bowed out of the 800m in Rio after he was unable to produce any heroics in a semi-final won by Olympic champion David Rudisha.

English, injured for much of this year, was unable to keep in contact with the leaders early on and despite a late burst finished fifth in 1:45.93.
Rudisha won the heat in 1:43.88 ahead of American Clayton Murphy.
The toughness of the qualifier was indicated by Poland's Adam Kszczot also exiting despite finishing third.
Kszczot's time of 1:44.70 was not sufficient to clinch a fastest loser's place with only the top two securing qualification for the final.
English, whose personal best is his Irish record of 1:44.82, said that he had performed "the best race that I could".
"It was always going to be tough running two races in two days." added the UCD medical student.
North Belfast athlete Breege Connolly is among three Irish women competing in the marathon at 14:00 BST on Sunday while Ciara Mageean will aim to secure a final spot in the women's 1500m when she runs in the semi-finals at 01:30 BST on Monday.
Mageean is the second slowest on the 12 athletes in her semi-final on personal bests with only Germany's Konstanze Klosterhalfen having a slower lifetime mark.
However, the statistic is unlikely to bother Mageean who looks in the kind of form to take a whopping chunk off her best of 4:06.49 some day soon.
With sub four-minute runners such as American Shannon Rowbury (3:56.29), Kenya's Faith Chepngetich Kipyegon (3:56. 41) and Ethiopia's Dawit Seyaum (3:58.10) in her semi-final, it may well come in the early hours of Monday.
Mageean's opponents also include Britain's Laura Weightman, American Brenda Martinez and Australian duo Linden Hall and Zoe Buckman.
