[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sunderland 0-0 Leicester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City secured survival while Sunderland edged closer to it after their goalless Premier League draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hull's 2-0 defeat against Tottenham means Sunderland need a point from either of their last two games, at Arsenal and Chelsea, to secure safety.
The Black Cats could have taken the lead in the first half but Danny Graham shot straight at Kasper Schmeichel.
Leonardo Ulloa came close with a flicked effort in the second period but neither side could break the deadlock.

Nigel Pearson's Leicester side were bottom of the table and seven points adrift at the beginning of April, but have turned it around and can now look forward to another season in the Premier League.
Their remarkable recent run has seen them pick up 19 points from their last eight games to stave off a return to the Championship after only one campaign.
Their last game of the season - against QPR - was being billed as a battle for survival, but with Rangers already down and Leicester safe, it is now an encounter with little at stake.
Meanwhile, Dick Advocaat's Sunderland side have taken 11 points from their past six games as they look to repeat last year's miraculous escape, when they won their final four games under Gus Poyet to stay in the top flight.
And although they still need a point to be sure of staying up, with daunting trips to Emirates Stadium and Stamford Bridge still to come, the Sunderland supporters celebrated as news filtered through of QPR beating Newcastle and Spurs winning against Hull.

Sunderland striker Graham had the best chance of the first half, but could not connect properly with a volley, while fellow front man Connor Wickham blazed an effort wide as he failed to add to his five goals this season.
Home winger Sebastian Larsson also went close with a free-kick which was pushed away by Leicester keeper Schmeichel.
Riyad Mahrez and Ulloa worked away up front for Leicester but neither were able to find the target when given opportunities, although the Foxes were well worth a point.
Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat:
"It was a very exciting match for both teams, with a lot of nerves, but both teams work so hard. We had more opportunities, but I think 0-0 is a good result.
"Leicester are a very difficult team to beat. They've lost one game in eight, we'd lost one in six. We were organised, but we needed more, and we got it when Adam Johnson came on. We hope to use him in our last two games and get more chances.
"We play Arsenal next, and they are an excellent team. We have to make it as difficult as possible for Arsenal and score a goal. Swansea did it. If you are organised, you will always get chances."
Leicester manager Nigel Pearson:
"When you consider our plight a couple of months ago, to go into the final game with our safety assured is quite an unbelievable achievement.
"I think the key thing for us even in our darkest moments, there have been a few, the players have continued to support each other and believe in their own ability. That's difficult when people are questioning your integrity.
"We've developed as the season has gone on. This run has been extraordinary, but we've needed to do it, because a number of sides have picked up form. We've stuck at our job."
