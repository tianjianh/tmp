Leicester City, who rose from likely relegation to league champions in just one season, are owned by Thai billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who arranged their visit.
Players and staff were welcomed to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport by cheering supporters.
On Monday, more than 240,00 people watched them parade in their home town.
Team coach Claudio Ranieri and captain Wes Morgan were among the players who made the trip to Thailand.
However midfielder Riyad Mahrez was not among the line up, nor were Danny Drinkwater and Jamie Vardy who had been called up for international duties.
Support for the Foxes, as they are known, has gained momentum across Thailand, as football supporters have slowly started to shift away from popular clubs such as Manchester United and Liverpool.
The club remained largely unknown in Thailand until it was bought over by Mr Srivaddhanaprabha six years ago.
The brand of his duty-free company King Power features prominently on the players' blue jerseys, with the club's home stadium also named after the company.
"Now I'm half Liverpool, half Leicester", said 20-year-old Max Akkhapracha, speaking to AFP. "It was a very exciting season, winning the Premier League was just amazing."
Leicester won the league 10 points above nearest rivals Arsenal, and will contest next season's Champions League competition against the best clubs in Europe.
