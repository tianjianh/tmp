Fish farming company Marine Harvest's plan for a fish feed factory on Skye has been approved by Highland councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The development on the site of an old quarry at Kyleakin could create 55 full-time permanent jobs.
The plant will produce food for the firm's Scottish fish farms as well as those in Norway, Ireland and the Faroe Islands.
Marine Harvest hopes the new plant will be constructed by 2018.
The cost of the project is expected to run to £93m. It had previously been estimated at £80m.
Members of Highland Council's north planning committee voted through the plans by 13 votes to three.
