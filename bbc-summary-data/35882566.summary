The six-week old pets were stolen from Rob and Victoria Hollingsworth's home in Royton, Greater Manchester, earlier this month.
Police found one of the puppies, called Frankie, after inquiries led them to a house in Manchester.
A 23-year-old woman and two men - aged 20 and 32 - have been arrested on suspicion of burglary.
They have been bailed pending further inquiries.
Mr and Mrs Hollingsworth are now appealing for anyone with further information to contact police in the hope of finding the remaining puppies, which are worth several thousand pounds each.
