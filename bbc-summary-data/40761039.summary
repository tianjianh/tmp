[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 2-1 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One title favourites Blackburn Rovers suffered defeat on the opening day of the season as Tony Mowbray's side lost 2-1 at Southend United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First-half goals from Ryan Leonard and Michael Kightly put the Shrimpers in control at Roots Hall.
Phil Brown's side were able to hang on to secure all three points despite a fine free-kick from Rovers captain Charlie Mulgrew in the second half.
Southend - who missed out on the play-offs by just a point last season - went in front in the 28th minute when an unmarked Leonard volleyed home a right-wing corner from Michael Timlin.
The goal justified Southend's decision to turn down offers from both Millwall and Sheffield United in the summer and the Shrimpers were celebrating again in the 38th minute with Kightly on target.
The winger - who returned to the club in the summer after leaving Burnley - netted from eight yards.
And his effort proved to be the winner as Rovers were unable to build on Mulgrew's fine 30-yard free-kick eight minutes into the second half.
