Both medallists, who already hold MBEs, are appointed OBEs - Adams for services to boxing while Clancy is honoured for cycling.
Cyclist Brian Robinson, the first Briton to win a Tour de France stage, is awarded a British Empire Medal.
Paralympic medallist Kadeena Cox is to receive an MBE.
Cox, 25, from Leeds, said being made an MBE for services to athletics was "the cherry on top".
"It's amazing. I can barely put it into words.
"I couldn't have asked for anything else.
"People have said to me 'can't wait to see you on the honours list' or 'I'm waiting for you to get nominated for Spoty [BBC Sport's Personality of The Year]' and these things I just didn't imagine would ever happen so it's amazing.
"To be recognised by the Queen, it's just wow, thank you."
The Paralympic champion won four medals in Rio including a gold in the T38 400m sprint, a silver in the 4x100m relay and bronze in the 100m. She also set a new world record in the 500m cycling time trial in addition to winning a gold medal in the category.
She is the first British Paralympian to top the podium in two different sports since 1988.
Ms Cox said she hoped her honour would inspire other youngsters in her community to "break the mould" and "not be one of the stereotypes that ends up being young and pregnant or involved in drugs".
Fellow Paralympians Stephen Bate and Adam Duggleby are honoured with an MBE for services to cycling, while Paul Bennett is to receive the same for rowing.
Olympic diver Christopher Mears is to get an MBE for diving.
Cycling legend Robinson receives his BEM for cycling and charity work.
Other notable figures who have been included in the New Year Honours list include:
