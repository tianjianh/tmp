The Poppies: Weeping Window installation has adorned the steps of St George's Hall since November and ends on Sunday.
A larger display of the poppies was on show at The Tower of London in 2014.
Created by artists Paul Cummins and Tom Piper, the original artwork marked 100 years since the start of World War One.
The Weeping Window display was installed in Liverpool just before Remembrance Sunday and had attracted 301,500 visitors by the end of 2015.
The Liverpool Welsh Choral Union will sing at the site at 14:00 GMT on Sunday, before the exhibition is closed with a performance from a bugler from the Band of the Duke of Lancaster at about 16:45.
Councillor Wendy Simon, assistant mayor and cabinet member for culture, tourism and events, said: "These poppies will have been part of the city's fabric for 72 days and the reaction to the stunning work has been overwhelming to say the least.
"We bid to host the poppies six months ago as St George's Hall would be the perfect venue for the installation with its World War One connections, and as with all our events, we knew that as usual, the people of Liverpool would come out in their thousands to show support for the thought-provoking piece of work.
"But we didn't expect the response we've had, and it makes me massively proud to know so many people have taken the time to visit."
