The blaze started in the roof of Wythenshawe Hall at about 03:30 GMT, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said.
More than 50 firefighters tackled the "serious blaze" at the Tudor hall.
Five fire engines are still at the scene as an investigation is under way into the cause.
The timber-framed hall was built in 1540 and was home to the Tatton family for about 400 years.
Warren Pickstone, from GMFRS, said: "We are doing everything we can to save as much of this building as we can.
"The fire is in the roof and is difficult to access but we have specialist resources at the scene and we are doing our best."
He said the historic clock tower was also on fire, adding: "So far we believe we have lost the roof and the first floor."
The hall was donated to local people in 1926 and was previously run as a museum and art gallery.
