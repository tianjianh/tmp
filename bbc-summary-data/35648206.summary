[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A TV advert for Nurofen Express has been withdrawn by makers Reckitt Benckiser.

The advert implied that the capsules directly targeted muscles in the head.
The company says it will not re-broadcast it following complaints that the ad was misleading.
BBC News understands the company has promised the Advertising Standards Authority it will not imply the product has a mechanism that makes it especially effective for headache pain.
The ASA has halted an investigation which could have led to the ad being banned.
Viewers were shown a huge head, that highlighted the muscles which tended to come under strain and caused headaches.
They were told that Nurofen Express "targets these muscles and gives you faster headache relief".
The advert was launched in February last year and has not been aired since June.
Details of the ASA investigation emerged before Christmas, after an Australian court ordered certain Nurofen products to be taken off the shelves.
The court said although they were marketed to treat specific pains, such as migraine and period pain, they were actually identical to one another.
