Police are treating the attack, which happened at the city side entrance of the Peace Bridge, as a sectarian hate crime.
Two of the boys who were attacked are 15, the other is 13.
The mother of one of the victims said that they were beaten by a gang of up to 25 youths in Friday night's attack.
"There will be long-term repercussions because of this attack," she said.
"My son was kicked in the head and had a handprint on his throat.
"A taxi man stopped to help my son and if he hadn't stopped it would be a very different scenario today."
The father of another victim said his son's face was covered in blood.
"It looks like my son has a broken nose. He was in a really bad way," he said.
"A crowd of boys came over and they were calling them names about their religion."
The third parent who son was attacked said that he was disgusted by what had happened.
"You should be allowed to go anywhere in this city without being threatened," he said.
"It shouldn't be happening in this day and age."
Three boys arrested in connection with the incident have been released on bail pending further enquiries.
