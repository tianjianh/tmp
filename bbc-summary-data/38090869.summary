[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Sea platform corrosion led to accident and injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Corrosion on a North Sea oil platform caused an incident in which a man was injured, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two pieces of equipment hit the worker on EnQuest's Thistle Alpha platform in July. He escaped with shoulder and cheek injuries.
The HSE found corrosion was to blame for the failure, and issued Enquest with an improvement notice.
EnQuest said it would implement changes to prevent a repeat.
Thistle Alpha is operated 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland.
