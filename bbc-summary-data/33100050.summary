[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A three-year-old boy who was killed after being struck accidentally by a car driven by his mother died of severe head injuries, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood Lindsey Turner was reversing the vehicle when she hit her son Liam in Adland Road, Watton.
He was injured on Sunday afternoon and died later at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.
Norfolk's assistant coroner David Osborne adjourned the inquest for a final hearing on 21 October.
The boy's father is understood to have moved him from underneath the vehicle and driven towards the hospital before flagging down an ambulance.
Liam was then airlifted to hospital.
Police are treating it as a tragic accident.
Earlier this week, his family issued a tribute through the police and described him as a "happy, content little boy who was always smiling and laughing".
