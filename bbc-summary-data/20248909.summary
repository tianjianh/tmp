Oscar, a Turkish Van cat, attracted police attention when he scratched and bit a neighbour in Wingrave in May.
The five-year-old recently went missing and was later found 34 miles away in Northampton.
Owner Caroline Hughes said she "didn't like to think how he got there" but would keep Oscar indoors temporarily.
Oscar gained his reputation after a series of clashes with cats and dogs in the village, Ms Hughes said.
But his fame spread when a local newspaper reported the pet had disappeared after being "under curfew" for the neighbour attack.
After being missing for about three weeks, a cat sitter in Northampton found the cat trying to eat her charges' food. She took him to a vet and found his microchip.
"I was incredibly relieved," said Ms Hughes, who has two other cats.
"I was just beside myself when Oscar went missing, without him the house was black.
"He's just got so much personality. I feel he's got a bit of a bad press."
She said people in the village had helped in the search for Oscar but added it was a mystery as to how the pet got to Northampton.
"I don't like to think how he got there, I hope it was a delivery van," she said.
She said Oscar had lashed out when a neighbour tried to pick him up.
"I think it's not what he's [Oscar's] used to, so he was scared and scratched and bit him," she said.
"I never saw the full extent of what happened but I got a visit from police."
She said that for now, she would keep Oscar indoors to restore village harmony and give him a herbal remedy she hopes will calm him.
