[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Boden nodded the hosts in front on 35 minutes but Stewart Murdoch curled in a lovely equaliser early in the second half.
Simon Murray missed a glorious one-on-one chance for the Championship side.
However, the United striker slammed in the winning shoot-out penalty, with Greg Tansey and Ross Draper missing from the spot for the hosts.
United top Group C on seven points, one ahead of Dunfermline, who were 3-0 winners at Cowdenbeath.
Caley Thistle are now on four points and like the Pars have played a game less than the Tannadice team.
Richie Foran's side opened the scoring with a goal of real simplicity. Carl Tremarco took a throw-in near the corner flag, Gary Warren nodded on and Boden found space in the six yard box to head the ball home.
Before that Lewis Toshney was very unlucky for United, a late run to the back post was rewarded as he connected with Nick van der Velden's delivery but the ball clipped the crossbar and away.
United's response came immediately after half time, with Murray surging away on the right to find Blair Spittal, who laid the ball off to Murdoch and the midfielder curled a magnificent first time shot home.
Spittal tried for a quick-fire second but dragged a shot narrowly wide as United started the second period brilliantly.
Murray was then presented with a gift from Draper's loose pass on the edge of his penalty box. The striker dashed forward and clipped a shot beyond advancing keeper Cameron McKay but his effort slipped inches wide.
Boden went close to adding a second for the hosts before a Tansey free-kick was pushed away by Cammy Bell, who then saved Liam Polworth's low drive.
Neither side could find the winner with United slotting home all four of their spot-kicks to earn an extra point.
