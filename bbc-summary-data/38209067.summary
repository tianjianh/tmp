Cook, 31, holds England records for Test runs, caps and matches as captain.
Last month the opening batsman hinted he may stand down after the current tour of India, saying: "It could be two months, it could be a year."
Bayliss told BBC Test Match Special: "He's talking about the next Ashes series and being out in Australia."
The Australian added: "Sometimes there are little comments made along the way and they get blown out of all proportion.
"He's certainly up for the fight. I haven't had any discussion with him any other way and that's what we've been working towards.
"I was as surprised as anyone when I saw that in the papers."
England trail India 2-0 in the five-Test series, with the fourth match in Mumbai starting on Thursday.
Cook, who made his Test debut in India in 2006, has scored 10,934 runs at an average of 46.72 in 138 Tests, winning 24 of his 57 matches in charge.
Under Cook, England won the 2013 and 2015 Ashes on home soil, but lost 5-0 in Australia in 2013-14, only the third whitewash in Ashes history.
Michael Vaughan holds the England record of 26 Test wins as captain.
England host four Tests against South Africa and three against West Indies next summer, before the Ashes start in November.
