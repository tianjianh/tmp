Work on a new gym, cafe and pool-side changing rooms is due to start at a Denbighshire leisure centre in January.

The former Nova Centre in Prestatyn shut in February after the trust running it had its funding pulled by Denbighshire council.
It has confirmed the revamp will take place from 5 January after agreeing Â£4.2m in funding in October.
Three promenade-side retail units will also be built as part of the plans.
"The redevelopment of the Nova Centre is an important piece of the jigsaw in our vision to develop the leisure offer on the coast," said councillor Huw Jones, cabinet lead member for leisure.
The work is expected to be complete by July.
