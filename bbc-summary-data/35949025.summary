Northampton Town secured promotion to League One despite being held to a draw by Bristol Rovers at Sixfields.

Nicky Adams headed the hosts into an early lead before Sam Hoskins side-footed in a second after the break.
Matt Taylor's header and Ellis Harrison's low effort saw Rovers fight back to earn a point to boost their own hopes of automatic promotion.
But the Cobblers, who faced a petition for administration earlier this season, are guaranteed a top-three spot.
They have lost only once in the league since Kelvin Thomas's takeover of the club in November.
Fifth-placed Plymouth's loss to AFC Wimbledon meant this season will be the end of Northampton's seven-year spell in the fourth tier of English football, following relegation in 2009.
The Cobblers, who only escaped relegation to non-league on the final day of the 2014 season, are now 12 points clear at the top with five games remaining.
Rovers now lie fourth, two points behind third-placed Accrington.
The attendance of 7,579 was the largest ever recorded at Sixfields and Northampton's biggest for a league game since 1987.
Northampton skipper Marc Richards will miss the end of season run-in as he is to undergo an Achilles operation next week.
