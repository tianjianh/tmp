The 91,000-sq ft Moneypenny development at Western Gateway includes a treehouse meeting room, its own village pub and a sun terrace.
Outside there are nature trails, a duck pond and orchards.
The telephone answering service plans to create 500 new jobs over the next few years and hopes to double its client base by 2018.
Co-founder and director Ed Reeves said: "What we believe is simple: the happier our staff, the happier our clients.
"We provided our architects with the same budget we'd been quoted to build a standard office and said 'right, show us how we can create something amazing'.
"It was a challenge, but we ripped up the rulebook and that's exactly what they did."
