All roads around the 37.75-mile (60km) TT course will close to traffic at 18:00 BST, with the Mountain section closing an hour earlier.
Race newcomers will be the first to depart down Glencrutchery Road at 18:20 BST on a speed-controlled lap.
Practices will continue on Monday and be held every evening next week ahead of the opening racing on 4 June.
TT stars including John McGuinness and Michael Dunlop will have their first taste of TT 2016 during Monday evening's first timed session.
McGuinness is three wins away from equalling Joey Dunlop's all-time record of 26 wins.
The TT sees riders reach speeds in excess of 200mph.
Last year more than 43,000 fans travelled to the island for the festival, which has been running for more than 100 years.
The opening Superbike and sidecar races will be held on 4 June with the main Senior race on 10 June.
Manx rally driver Mark Higgins will also attempt to break his own TT lap record in a car at this year's event on 10 June.
Races are also being held on the Billown circuit in the south of the island this weekend with the holding of the Pre-TT races.
