[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 4-1 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport lost at Blackpool after Sean Rigg's penalty miss proved vital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts led after four minutes when Brad Potts fired home from close range after Jack Payne's cross.
However, Newport hit back before the break through Rhys Healey. Blackpool then survived when Sean Rigg saw his penalty on the hour mark saved by Sam Slocombe.
Jack Payne then fired the hosts back in front before Vassell made it safe and Kelvin Mellor added a late fourth.
Newport County manager Graham Westley told BBC Wales Sport: "Football is a 90-minute game. For the last half-hour, after we missed the penalty, we saw a team that was a bit unbalanced.
"We were stretched and strained and lacking ingredients against a very experienced Blackpool side which has a lot of quality. They exposed us in that last 30 minutes."
