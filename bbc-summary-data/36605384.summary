[SN]TITLE[SN]
New crofts could be created in Assynt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community landowner hopes to establish new crofts on the thousands of acres of land it owns in the north west Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Assynt Foundation said its project would involve affordable homes on crofts of varying size and type.
The organisation manages 44,400 acres acquired in a community land buyout of the Glencanisp and Drumrunie estates from a private landowner in June 2005.
A working group has been set up to explore possible locations for crofts.
Potential sites include Tileathdoire and Drumrunie, Ledbeg, Cnocnaneach and Glencanisp.
Crofts involve smaller areas of land than farms and crofters usually share areas of common grazing for raising livestock.
The foundation said: "These crofts will be established and regulated according to crofting law.
"They will be life-long, heritable tenancies, with an annual rent payable to Assynt Foundation, with no automatic right to buy or assign."
