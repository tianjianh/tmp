Adam Fanelli murder trial: Co-accused blamed for attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of two men accused of murdering a scrap metal dealer has told a court he was not responsible for the death and blamed his co-defendant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Fanelli, 31, was found dead at Nash Park travellers' site in Buckinghamshire on 17 March.
Addy McAllister, 34, of Charlesworth Street, Bolsover, and Jemma Price, 30, of Ridgeway, Kensworth, deny murder.
But Mr McAllister told Luton Crown Court it was Mr Price who fought with Mr Fanelli.
The body of father-of-two Mr Fanelli, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, was discovered in a field next to the travellers' site in Winslow Road in Nash near Milton Keynes.
He had 159 separate injuries and post-mortem tests showed he died from blunt force trauma to the head.
Mr McAllister told jurors Mr Fanelli had bought drugs for him and Mr Price in Dunstable before the three set off for Nash in Mr Fanelli's van.
An argument broke out at the site, between Mr Fanelli and Mr Price, who had armed himself with two knives and punctured three tyres on the van. Mr Fanelli then came towards Mr Price with a drain-pipe.
Mr McAllister said at this point he managed to get the knives and run off, discarding them in a nearby field.
When he returned, he said he found the pair fighting and neither was backing down.
"They were like two dogs fighting," he said.
He tried to intervene, but said he got into the van and drove off fearing for his safety.
When he returned soon after he found Mr Price washing his hands and no sign of Mr Fanelli.
"I asked him what had happened to the lad (Mr Fanelli) and he said he had sent him home," he said.
He learned the next day that Mr Fanelli's body had been found.
The prosecution allege both defendants inflicted a severe beating on the victim.
