Iraq war report delay 'an insult' says Elfyn Llwyd

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision to delay publishing a long-awaited report following the official inquiry into the 2003 Iraq war has been described as an "insult".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot was expected to confirm in a letter to David Cameron that it would be delayed until after the election on 7 May.
The inquiry began its work in 2009 and held its last public hearing in 2011.
Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd has been critical of the way the UK went to war in Iraq.
He was involved in the high-profile attempts from 2004 onwards to impeach the then Prime Minister Tony Blair for misleading the UK Parliament over the war in Iraq.
He told BBC's Good Morning Wales: "This prolonged delay - remembering it's over five years since they started - the millions of pounds of public funds going into it, I think it's an insult to those who lost loved ones out there and I also think it undermines the credibility of the whole report and its recommendations at the end of the day."
