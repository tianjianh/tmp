Former Reading player/manager Mick Gooding believes more is going on behind the scenes at the club than supporters are being made aware of.

The Royals are searching for a new manager after parting company with Brian McDermott on Friday.
Former Serbia and Atletico Madrid winger Milinko Pantic is among those linked with the vacancy.
"The big issue fans have got with Reading at the moment is nobody tells them what's going on," Gooding said.
McDermott, 55, left the Championship club following a second spell in charge which lasted just five months.
Former Manchester United and Netherlands defender Jaap Stam is also thought to be a candidate for the job.
Gooding, who made more than 300 appearances for Reading, is concerned about the club's future direction.
"The football club is like a swan, there's a lot going on below the surface that we don't know about," he told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"The new owners have come in and they backed (former manager) Steve Clarke to a certain extent last summer, bringing lots of players in.
"They (the supporters) just need someone who can speak and tell supporters what their vision is for the next few years."
