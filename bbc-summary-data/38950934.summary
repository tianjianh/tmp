[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Valentin Eysseric scored in the final 10 minutes as faltering Ligue 1 title contenders Nice came from two goals down to save a point at Rennes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With Mario Balotelli absent because of illness, Lucien Favre's side went behind to a chipped finish from former West Ham midfielder Morgan Amalfitano.
Giovanni Sio turned in from close range for Rennes' second amid offside claims.
Anastasios Donis pulled one back before Eysseric ran clear to slot in the equaliser for Nice, who remain third.
Benjamin Andre almost won it for Rennes with a header from a corner in the final minutes, but Mounir Obaddi cleared it off the line.
Favre's team, who led the table for much of the first half of the season, have won just two of their last seven Ligue 1 matches, and are five points off the top.
Despite their comeback, they finish the weekend having lost ground on second-placed Paris St-Germain, who won 3-0 at Bordeaux on Friday, and leaders Monaco, who thumped Metz 5-0 on Saturday.
Match ends, Rennes 2, Nice 2.
Second Half ends, Rennes 2, Nice 2.
