Gary Bowyer says Blackpool have been given a "kick up the backside" by an "embarrassing" loss to Grimsby Town.

Sam Jones scored twice to secure a 3-1 win for Grimsby - their first in five matches - and condemn play-off chasing Blackpool to back-to-back defeats.
The result followed a 1-0 loss to Luton, leaving Blackpool eighth, two points off the play-off places.
"We're in there fighting and we've got a right good chance of it and it's how we respond now," Bowyer, 45, said.
Before the two setbacks, Blackpool had put together a nine-game unbeaten run, which saw them climb the League Two table and offer hope of promotion.
Fortunately for Blackpool, the three sides immediately above them - Stevenage, Exeter City and Carlisle United - all also suffered defeats on Saturday and Bowyer is now hoping the loss to Grimsby can spur his side on for the final five matches.
"The goals [Blackpool conceded] were embarrassing," he told BBC Radio Lancashire. "They [the players] have had a kick up the backside and we've now got to regroup and go again because the results have been kind to us.
"We've got some work to do now, but we've got five good games left now to try to finish strongly and get something out of this season."
Blackpool face League Two's form side Accrington, who are on a 13-game unbeaten run, at home before a trip to promoted Doncaster Rovers.
