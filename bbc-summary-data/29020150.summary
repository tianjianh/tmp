Donnelly, 26, has agreed a two-year contract after scored 13 goals in 86 appearances for Dale.
Brezovan, 34, spent the beginning of this season with Portsmouth on a short-term deal but has now signed for a season with Rovers.
Meanwhile, defender Matt Hill has also earned a one-year deal, having played five games on non-contract terms.
"George is a fast, powerful striker who will run behind defences and cause them a lot of problems," manager Rob Edwards told the Rovers club website.
"He gives us an option we haven't currently got in the squad.
Edwards added: "I'm delighted to bring Peter to the club. He's an experienced keeper who has played at Championship and League One level and it gives us good competition for places."
