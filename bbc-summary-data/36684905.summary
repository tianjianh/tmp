[SN]TITLE[SN]
Palace to return to Brighton Pier name

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton Pier is to regain the word "Palace" in its name following a 16-year absence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was built as the Brighton Marine Palace and Pier during the 1890s, and known as the Palace Pier until 2000 when it was rebranded Brighton Pier.
Luke Johnson, executive chairman of the Brighton Pier Group, has now announced that it will be known as Brighton Palace Pier.
A competition has also been launched to design a new logo.
Anne Martin, general manager of the Grade II* listed structure, said: "We've always been very aware of the affection that the local people had for the Palace Pier, but also very aware of the Brighton connection for us, so it's an ideal marriage."
Anthony Wills, of the National Piers Society, said: "Brighton is associated with George IV, therefore it deserves a royal appellation."
"Visitors love royalty - I think they will feel a special sense of walking down that pier now that it's got that kind of regal name attached to it."
