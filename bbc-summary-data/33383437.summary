John "Goldfinger" Palmer, who allegedly amassed a huge fortune in a time-share scam, was treated for a cardiac arrest on 24 June at his home in South Weald.
But a post-mortem examination on 30 June revealed the 65-year-old convicted conman had been shot in the chest.
His family said they had suffered a great loss and appealed for anybody with information to help the police.
They described his murder as a great shock and a family spokesman said: "To lose someone you care about and who is a key part of your family so suddenly is traumatic and completely overwhelming.
"If anyone knows anything about John's death which could help police please get in touch with them so we can find some answers."
DCI Simon Werrett said: "I am making a further appeal for anyone who was in the Sandpit Lane area of South Weald between 16:00 and 18:00 BST on the day that Mr Palmer died to come forward.
"The area is rural but is used by dog walkers and people out running.
"Any information people may have about any possible suspicious people or vehicles in the area at that time may help us."
Essex Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
The force said police and paramedics who were called to Palmer's house in Sandpit Lane "initially assessed the death as non-suspicious due to pre-existing injuries due to recent surgery".
"Closer inspection raised doubt and a post-mortem examination was conducted to establish the cause of death," he added.
