Google News launches fact check label

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Google has launched a new feature, fact check, which will add a label next to news stories in search results.

Fact check will appear with other news organisations in Google News and will, Google says, "shine a light on its efforts to divide fact from fiction".
Richard Gingras, Google's head of news, added it will "help readers find fact checking in large news stories".
He said sites which already have a fact checking service can apply to be included to appear in search results.
"You'll see the tagged articles in the expanded story box on news.google.com and in the Google News & Weather iOS and Android apps, starting with the US and the UK," he added in a blogpost.
Google will determine whether a fact check is needed for a news story using the claim review technique. It already labels stories with tabs such as opinion, related and local source.
Fact checking is something that has become increasingly popular in the past few years.
According to the the Duke University Reporter's Lab, there are more than 100 fact checking sites online including the BBC's own Reality Check.
However, not all fact check sites run by algorithm have been as fortunate when it comes to fulfilling their intended purpose.
Facebook overhauled the Trending feature on its site in August to make posts more automated after claims of left-wing bias.
Google's fact check comes in time for the final run-up to next month's US presidential election. The New York Times also has a fact check site which is keeping tabs on the campaign for the Oval Office.
