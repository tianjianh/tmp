Michael Forney and Steve Saviano netted first-period goals to put the hosts in control against the Scots.
James Desmarais, Chris Higgins and Jonathan Boxill added to the tally in the second period.
Desmarais completed the rout while the Devils stayed top with a 7-5 victory over Coventry Blaze.
Belfast completed a double after Friday's 5-4 win over Notthingham Panthers.
Desmarais is a man in form with his two goals against Dundee coming 24 hours after he hit a treble in the narrow victory over the Panthers.
The Giants are back in action next weekend with an away double-header against Sheffield Steelers.
