[SN]TITLE[SN]
Superman IV film recreated in Milton Keynes 30 years on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An artist has recreated about 10 minutes of the 1986 film Superman IV where it was originally shot in Milton Keynes.

A total of about 18 minutes of the film The Quest For Peace was filmed in the town.
Richard DeDomenici has reshot footage in the same locations including the Avebury Building and Milton Keynes station.
He said it was "weird how little it had changed in 30 years".
"You held the camera up and everything looked the same," he said.
"You got a kind of shiver, it's not dÃ©jÃ  vu as you've not been there before but it was a very strange experience."
Mr DeDomenici, has made about 50 recreations of sections of popular films - known as Redux.
The fourth Superman film in which Christopher Reeve starred as the Man of Steel sees the superhero battle the radiation-charged Nuclear Man.
The movie is much maligned by critics and was once name in Time magazine's Top 10 Worst Superhero Sequels.
"I heard the story that the budget got cut in half for the fourth [film] so they chose the most modern place they could in the south of England as it was being filmed at Elstree," Mr DeDomenici said.
"They thought Milton Keynes was new and modern but of course none of the buildings were more than four storeys high so it looked a bit incongruous. It was clearly not New York."
Mr DeDominici decided to recreate the scenes when he started making films in 2013 but it took time to put together due to scheduling filming in people's properties.
Milton Keynes International Festival (MKIF) then got involved and it was shot over two days, with a budget of Â£5,000, using local people in the same locations.
"It's the most ambitious one I've done and I'm very pleased with how it's turned out," Mr DeDomenici said.
"People seem to prefer these cheap knock offs to the originals, it's strange, I'm still trying to figure it out.
"But I think the message in the film about stopping war is extraordinarily pertinent now so I'm glad people are giving it another look."
