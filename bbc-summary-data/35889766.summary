Greg Allman biopic director Randall Miller freed after year in jail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A director who admitted involuntary manslaughter over a fatal train crash on the set of a biopic about Gregg Allman has been released from jail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Camera assistant Sarah Jones, 27, died after being hit by a freight train on the first day of filming Midnight Rider in Georgia in February 2014.
Randall Miller, 53, who also pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing, had spent a year in county jail.
He was released halfway through his sentence, for good behaviour.
Six other crew members were injured in the accident that killed Jones.
She was struck by the train after the crew had placed a hospital bed on a railway bridge across the Altamah River in Doctortown, south east Georgia, to shoot a dream sequence.
The train, which was travelling at 55 mph, shattered the bed, sending a shower of debris that injured other crew members.
Filming was suspended and actor William Hurt, who was due to play Allman, pulled out of the production. Allman himself had also called for the project to be axed following the death.
An investigation found that CSX Transportation, which owned the train trestle on which filming was taking place, had refused permission to film on the tracks.
Miller was jailed on 9 March 2015 after pleading guilty as part of a plea deal, which saw criminal charges dropped against his wife Jody Savin. He could have been jailed for 11 years if convicted by a jury.
He was freed shortly after making a court appearance on Wednesday.
Don Samuel, one of Miller's defence lawyers, said: "He was still in shackles when I last saw him, but he was very glad the sentence was behind him. He's moving on and he's going to be on an overnight flight to California."
His defence team had been arguing that Miller should be freed early because of his good behaviour and also because of concerns for his health.
Sarah Jones's parents had told Superior Court Judge Anthony Harrison they opposed Miller's early release.
Speaking after the hearing, her father, Richard Jones, said: "The message we did not want to send is that because you may be a movie director, you may be getting off lightly.
"Sarah's dead for heaven sakes. These were just blatant decisions that put these people in danger unnecessarily."
Miller will spend the next nine years on probation and is banned from directing any films during that period.
