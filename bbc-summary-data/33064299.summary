Girls should challenge their teachers more, says the head of the Girls' Day School Trust (GDST).

"Being the compliant girl is never going to get you anywhere," says Helen Fraser, head of the trust, which runs 24 independent girls' schools.
She says girls are expected to be "docile at school" and then "dynamic, exciting leaders in the workplace".
Speaking ahead of the trust's annual conference, she said assertiveness was an important skill in business.
Ms Fraser said pupils challenging teachers was "very important" and a "great preparation for life".
"In single-sex girls' schools, crowd control is not a problem," she said.
"The danger is not having a riot, the danger is they're sitting quietly and taking notes.
"We've really got to push back against that and encourage a dynamic place of debate."
She said she saw some girls who had courage "built in from the beginning not to accept authority" and this "good disruptiveness" should be encouraged.
In a corporate environment, suggesting something innovative rather doing "whatever the boss hands down must be right".
"We need to build much more of a good disruptiveness into schools" to encourage girls to be excellent leaders in the workplace, she said.
She said this did not only apply to girls in independent schools.
"I think all children in education should be encouraged to challenge and take risks," she said.
She said she found "spoon feeding" of pupils in class disheartening.
"The most depressing question in a class is, 'Is this going to be in the exams?'
"Exam results should just be a side-effect of a great education and should come naturally, we should really fight against letting exams rule."
