Coastguard say County Down kayaker alarm was elaborate hoax

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The coastguard has called off a search for a kayaker after it declared the alarm an "elaborate hoax".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The search was launched after the coastguard received reports from an individual claiming to be in difficulty off the coast of County Down.
Two RNLI boats and a coastguard helicopter from Scotland were launched to assist in the search.
The kayaker was reported to be near Mew Island, one of the Copeland Islands near Donaghadee.
A coastguard spokesman said it received several calls from a person claiming to be in difficulty.
However, the alarm was declared to be a hoax following a thorough search.
