[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dead whale has washed up on the Devon coastline.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mammal's body was discovered on Red Rock beach near Dawlish Warren on Thursday morning.
Coastguards had been tracking the 30ft (9.1m) whale as it drifted down the coast, after it was mistaken for an upturned boat.
Initially thought to be a sperm whale, it has since been confirmed as a fin whale by Rob Deaville of the Zoological Society of London.
Teignbridge Council, which has begun work to remove the whale, has advised members of the public not to approach the badly-decomposed carcass.

The whale has been attracting a crowd throughout the day, with people describing it as a "magnificent beast" and saying it "deserved respect".
"It's so beautiful", described one onlooker. "It's the closest I'm ever going to get to a whale, so I feel very, very sad."
