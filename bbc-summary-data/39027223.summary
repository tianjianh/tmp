[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company which is developing new kite power technology has opened a head office in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kite Power Systems (KPS) said the move would consolidate its activities in Scotland.
It is planning to establish a research and test facility at West Freugh near Stranraer, having secured Â£5m of investment from E.On, Schlumberger and Shell Technology Ventures.
KPS will initially be based in the new Tontine Innovation Centre in Glasgow.
The company's technology uses two kites which turn spool drums to produce electricity.
KPS has already secured planning consent to deploy a 500kW power system at West Freugh from April this year.
The company said this would lead to a planned onshore demonstration array of multiple 500kW systems within the next three or four years elsewhere in Scotland.
KPS will then develop a 3MW onshore system at West Freugh, before deploying a "similar-sized power system" in offshore waters.
The company plans to recruit 10 new staff in the first quarter of this year.
It said it could eventually employ up to 500 people by 2025.
Business development director David Ainsworth said: "As an important hub for innovation in renewable energy, Glasgow ticked all the boxes as a new KPS head office location.
"As well as its proximity to our testing facility, the city offers a wealth of resources, expertise and talent in engineering design and manufacture, especially in low-carbon industries.
"Its academic institutions are world class and the facilities and support available to KPS through the Tontine Innovation Centre will prove invaluable as we enter this next exciting phase of technology development."
