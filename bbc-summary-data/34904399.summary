Dylan Jackson, 20, of Crosby Close, Wolverhampton, attacked 46-year-old Herman 'Louis' Simpson at his home in Wolverhampton on 13 April.
Following a police manhunt he was arrested in Bath on 29 April.
Jackson was found guilty by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court and is set to be sentenced at a later date.
Det Insp Warren Hines, from West Midlands Police, said it was believed Jackson arrived at Mr Simpson's home for a pre-arranged heroin deal before robbing and stabbing his victim.
He described Jackson as "a determined criminal" motivated by greed, adding Mr Simpson's history of drug dependency left him "vulnerable".
"Louis leaves behind a family who are absolutely distraught at his death and my abiding hope is that the guilty verdict will allow them to begin the slow process of recovering from their sad loss," he said.
Sylvia Simpson, mother of Mr Simpson, said the family had "nothing but positive memories" of her son.
"Louis was a much-loved son, brother and father whose death has already left a huge void in many lives," she said.
"The outpouring of grief and kind words said by the community after his death showed what a kind, generous and loving person he was."
