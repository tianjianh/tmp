The court heard Mr Ali was part of a group of men - including two others whose plans to get to Syria had been thwarted - who met for a seemingly "harmless" paintballing session at Delta Force paintballing in Hockley Heath, West Midlands.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte QC said: "During it, the participants posed for photographs in quasi-combat gear, holding their paint-filled weapons.
"It was a bonding act of preparation between men of like mind and like intent. They were doing what passed, in their limited circumstances, for training."
Ms Whyte said the trainee bricklayer intended to join the IS group in Syria when he travelled to Turkey seven months later.
He is also alleged to have sent "abusive" anti-democracy messages to a Labour councillor after making his way back to the UK from Istanbul via Ireland.
The court was also told he sent numerous video messages to other men showing beheadings and atrocities carried out by the so-called Islamic State.
Mr Ali denies two charges of sending a malicious communication.
The trial continues.
