Bradley Saunders: Sedgefield boxer relishes ring return after taste of 'normal' life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sedgefield boxer Bradley Saunders is looking forward to returning to the ring after an extended break from the sport to recover from two broken hands.

Saunders, 31, was disqualified for headbutting Renald Garrido in his last fight, amid frustration at the hand injuries sustained during the bout.
That was back in September 2015, after which he took sabbatical from boxing.
"I let my hands recover and not just that, I actually lived a normal life," Saunders told BBC Tees.
"I'd lived a secluded boxing life since I was eight years old and it came a time where I needed a break. Having beans on toast for Christmas dinner is not much of a life.
"I enjoyed every single minute of the 'normal' life, eating normal food, having a glass of wine and going out with the lads. But now I'm a bit sick of it."
His return to the ring comes on the Matchroom JDNEXTGEN card headlined by Sunderland's unbeaten Josh Kelly, who faces fellow local fighter Tom Whitfield on 23 June.
The absence from the sport has left super-lightweight Saunders feeling refreshed, and with a new perspective on the preparation required for professional sport.
"I've never done a diet properly, the only thing I've ever done properly is train hard," Saunders added.
"I've done my own thing but it's time for me to do it properly and start listening.
"I'll start listening to my nutritionist, and strength coach, I've always listened to my coach but I need to listen to my whole team."
