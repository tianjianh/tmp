Storm Desmond: Clady flood defence work may not go ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A county Tyrone village devastated by Storm Desmond may not get new flood defences because of a lack of funds.

A number of homes and businesses in Clady were flooded after the storm last December.
An initial study has been carried out to replace a damaged floodwall and flood-banks.
But David Porter of the Rivers Agency said progressing that work was now subject to "the availability of funds".
"We are carrying out a study to see whether any works are viable, i.e. affordable, to increase the standard of protection," he told BBC Radio Foyle.
"That will be a longer terms project because of its scale, and also because of the availability of funds."
Mr Porter said there were "many competing priorities" for funding.
Mr Porter said people who live in at-risk areas must take measures to protect themselves from flooding.
Last month a couple in their 60s who have been living in a caravan since their Clady home flooded last year said they are fearful of repeat flooding this winter.
Eugene and Mary McShane' home on Urney Road was damaged by about 5ft of water on 5 December 2015.
The record rainfall caused the rivers Mourne, Finn and Derg to burst their banks.
