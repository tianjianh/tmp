Scotland to launch standard sports concussion guidelines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland is to become the first country in the world to introduce standard guidelines for dealing with concussion in sport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will be launched at Hampden Park in Glasgow by Peter Robinson, whose son died after a double concussion in a school rugby match.
The new guidelines are meant for people involved in sport at all levels.
Until now, each sport has had its own means of dealing with head injuries sustained during play.
The new advice has been drawn up by the Scottish government's chief medical officer, leading medics and representatives from sportscotland and several of the country's sporting bodies.
Mr Robinson, who now lives in Midlothian, has campaigned for schools and sports clubs to correctly identify concussion and to remove a player from the field at the first sign of symptoms.
His 14-year-old son Benjamin died in 2011 after getting concussion twice during a rugby match at Carrickfergus Grammar School in Northern Ireland.
