[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 2-0 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover kept up the pressure on those on in the National League playoff places with a comfortable 2-0 win over strugglers Guiseley at the Crabble Athletic Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guiseley managed to frustrate Dover during a first half that was dominated by the hosts, but Dover kept plugging away and took complete control just after the break.
Ricky Miller underlined his position as the National League's top marksman by slotting his 19th of the season after 46 minutes, beating two defenders before firing hard and low past Jonathan Maxted.
Moses Emmanuel profited from slack defending three minutes later to make it comfortable for the hosts, who remain sixth and one point off the play-off places.
