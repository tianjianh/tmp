[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reigning champions Yorkshire climbed to second in the Division One table as they inflicted Middlesex's first Championship defeat of the summer.

England opener Adam Lyth made 67 as they won by four wickets at Headingley with a day to spare.
Middlesex began on 127-4, but were bowled out for 229, with all-rounder Will Rhodes taking 3-42.
Set 213 to win, Lyth and Gary Ballance (29) added 71 and Yorkshire got home on 215-6 with a six by Glenn Maxwell.
Having begun the match as Championship leaders, Middlesex slipped two places to third and were left to rue the loss earlier in the day of their last four wickets for just 23 runs.
After a poor start when Lyth's occasional off-spin accounted for Dawid Malan (35), they reached 206-6 as James Franklin and Ollie Rayner added 47.
But Rayner's dismissal, caught at short cover off Steve Patterson, heralded a slump which saw Franklin run out of partners on 55 not out.
The New Zealand all-rounder had Alex Lees lbw for 10 with his first delivery as Yorkshire started their run-chase, but England team-mates Lyth and Ballance put the home side back on course.
Both eventually fell to Rayner's off-spin and first-innings centurion Jonny Bairstow went for a duck as he edged Toby Roland-Jones to first slip where Franklin failed to hold the chance, but Rayner, at second, snatched the loose ball.
It seemed as if skipper Andrew Gale would see Yorkshire home, but he was bowled by Tim Murtagh for 37 before Maxwell (23 not out) and Rhodes (10 not out) finished things off in the second over of the extra half hour.
Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie:
"The game was a tough one but I was confident we could win it once we knew what we would be chasing and I would have been happy to chase 300. I would have backed our players to do that.
"I was always quietly confident but Middlesex have a really good group of bowlers and the pitch was starting to turn for Ollie Rayner.
"The most pleasing thing is we maintained our positive intent throughout the game.
"Our bowling was a lot better than in the last game at Taunton. Steve Patterson was fantastic with his accuracy and Jack Brooks' five in the first innings showed he has the knack of taking wickets."
Middlesex all-rounder James Franklin told BBC London 94.9:
"We knew we were going to have to play good-hard cricket against these guys because it's their home turf and we just came up short.
"There were probably a few moments in the game that were 50-50 that we didn't quite take and Jonny Bairstow's (first-innings) hundred was an outstanding hundred in the context of the game.
"Small moments are sometimes the difference between two strong teams.
"It's disappointing we came second, but we gave it a good shake."
