Claudio Ranieri: Leicester manager sacking made Gary Lineker 'shed a tear'

Leicester's decision to sack Claudio Ranieri nine months after winning the Premier League made former Foxes striker Gary Lineker "shed a tear".

Ranieri guided Leicester to the title despite them being rated 5,000-1 shots at the start of the 2015-16 campaign.
The Foxes are 17th this season and lost to League One Millwall in the FA Cup.
"It is very sad," said Match of the Day presenter Lineker. "It is inexplicable to me. It's inexplicable to a lot football fans who love the game."
Speaking to BBC Radio 4, the 56-year-old added: "I suppose you can explain it in terms of a panic decision and for me a wrong decision.
"I shed a tear last night for Claudio, for football and for my club."
After news of the 65-year-old Italian's dismissal broke on Thursday, former England captain Lineker, who played for his hometown club for seven seasons, said the "game's gone" in a post on social media.
"It's a sign of modern football, what happened last season was truly extraordinary, " he added on Friday. "The lack of gratitude from the owners of the club and who knows who else involved in such a decision beggars belief.
"That season will remain with us forever, it was truly special and a lot of that was down to the management.
"The same guy cannot be considered incapable of doing the job a few months months later after achieving what, for me, was the biggest miracle in sport."
Chelsea dismissed Jose Mourinho as manager the season after their 2015 title and Lineker says while that is "expected at big clubs", the decision to sack Ranieri "takes away from the glory" for the Foxes.
"For a club like Leicester to win the league last season, the magnificence of the story, the likeability of the club under Ranieri - the ultimate gentleman - it kind of demeans the club.
"Leicester were hugely popular right around the world. To do something like this now loses a lot of that popularity."
France midfielder N'Golo Kante moved to Chelsea for Â£30m in the summer and Lineker said losing the 25-year-old was "huge".
He added: "There were a whole host of things that made the season fairly inevitable in the sense it would never be anything like last season.
"They had a journeyman back four that was protected brilliantly by Kante. They were an ageing back four, who are a year older.
"All of a sudden they were on pre-season tours, playing Barcelona, travelling all over the world. They were not prepared for the new season and then the confidence aspect sneaks in."
Former Leicester and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton, said the club's struggles this season made Ranieri's sacking understandable.
Speaking to Radio 4, he said: "Going down would be a disaster for Leicester and I suppose the board have made a very brave decision.
"If they stay in the Premier League then they've made the right decision. A lot of people will say there's no sentiment in football, look at what he's done for the club, but he's had a lot of the season to get things going.
"There's obviously some reason why not. We're not privy to that - maybe the board are. Maybe there's unrest in the dressing room, who knows? Maybe the players just aren't performing."
Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha used social media platform Instagram to explain why he sacked Ranieri.
"We have done our best as management, we do not have only one problem to solve, but there are a million things to do to make our club survive, " the billionaire wrote.
"Please respect my decision, I will never let the club down".

"There's almost a sense of grief in the city today, with many having lost their 'favourite uncle'.
"Claudio Ranieri was the man that brought the dream to life by winning the Premier League title. It has gone sour this term with players underperforming, new signings not working out and baffling tactics at time from the Tinkerman.
"I thought they would get relegated with Ranieri in charge. I hated to say it. I hoped it wouldn't come true and I'd be proved wrong.
"This gives them a chance. A different kind of chance to stay up."
Phil McNulty, BBC chief football writer:
It is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title.
But is there actually method in what many see as the madness of the club's Thai owners?
Leicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday.
After 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season.
The difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous.

I understand some influential players in the dressing room, who were part of the Nigel Pearson squad a couple of years ago, were making graphic contrasts with team spirit and the organisational qualities of Pearson compared with Ranieri this season.
The club never really lost faith in Pearson this time two years ago. Despite the fact they were in the parlous position, the general feeling was that he had the dressing room and knew where he was going. He left in the summer of 2015 for different reasons - personal reasons associated with his son, who was on the staff.
Quite clearly, Ranieri had lost a lot of key allies in that Leicester dressing room with long memories.
On 7 February, Leicester issued a statement saying Ranieri had their "unwavering support". Sixteen days later they sacked the 65-year-old Italian, who had signed a new four-year deal in the summer.
His departure came a day after the Foxes won praise for their performance despite losing 2-1 in their Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Sevilla.
"Ranieri was told he was sacked on Thursday afternoon in Leicester once the team returned from Spain, but the suggestion is the owners decided before that defeat by Sevilla," said BBC sports editor Dan Roan.
"The decision was taken very reluctantly but the club's owners are desperate to avoid relegation and its consequences."
Foxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said: "This has been the most difficult decision we have had to make in nearly seven years since King Power took ownership of Leicester City.
"But we are duty-bound to put the club's long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be.
"Claudio has brought outstanding qualities to his office. His skilful management, powers of motivation and measured approach have been reflective of the rich experience we always knew he would bring to Leicester City."
Srivaddhanaprabha added: "His warmth, charm and charisma have helped transform perceptions of the club and develop its profile on a global scale. We will forever be grateful to him for what he has helped us to achieve.
"It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Indeed, survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign.
"But we are now faced with a fight to reach that objective and feel a change is necessary to maximise the opportunity presented by the final 13 games."
A news conference with Leicester assistant manager Craig Shakespeare will take place at 13:00 GMT on Friday.
