Aberdeen terror trial hears Islamic State 'like Mafia'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aberdeen student accused of terrorism offences has told a court that the Islamic State group is "like a Mafia organisation or criminal gang".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yousif Badri, 29, is accused of being involved in conduct "with the intention of committing acts of terrorism".
He denies charges under the Terrorism Act at the High Court in Glasgow.
Mr Badri accused IS of "hijacking" Muslim history and "trying to get almost legitimacy".
He told the court: "It tries to appear as a religious organisation, but it's more like a Mafia organisation or criminal gang."
Defence QC Murdo Macleod said: "There is an ongoing debate between militants and non-militants?"
Mr Badri replied: "Yes."
The QC asked: "You will have been strongly-opposed to Al-Qaeda and IS?"
Mr Badri agreed.
Mr Macleod asked: "Do you want to shoot anybody?" and he replied: "No."
Mr Macleod then said: "Are you interested in making shells?" and Mr Badri replied: No."
The trial, before judge Lord Turnbull, continues.
