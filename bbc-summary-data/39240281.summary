[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crystal Palace v Watford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crystal Palace defender Patrick van Aanholt has not recovered from an ankle injury so Jeffrey Schlupp is expected to start at left-back on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Loic Remy has been ruled out until after the international break.
Watford midfielder Etienne Capoue has been suffering from a fever this week and will be assessed.
Nordin Amrabat is available after an ankle injury for the first time since New Year's Day, while Daryl Janmaat makes his return from a groin problem.
Jonathan Pearce: "This is the first of four huge home six pointers for Palace against relegation rivals. They'll need 10 points from them. They also have all of the top six to play as well!
"Back-to-back wins have given them hope of staying up but they must win this.
"Watford can make themselves safe in three successive winnable games before a big summer clear out that could include the head coach. Walter Mazzari probably needs to better last season's points tally to survive.
"Big Sam Allardyce got in a tizz about the Hornet's mascot at Xmas. He'll be hoping to avoid a nasty sting in the tail this time."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "For me it's about trying to go undefeated for as long as possible now. We're disappointed if we draw matches, but it's still a point.
"We have to be at our very best, 100% every game between now and the end of the season. We can't let that drop off."
Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri: "Palace are one of those teams that, when you look at their squad, nobody thought when we started that it would have fought relegation.
"We will play them in their best moment as they come from two positive results.
"They've got an important fan base so it won't be easy. We go to the pitch knowing we cannot commit any mistakes."
Watford conceded four goals at home to Southampton last time out, when they paid the price for giving Saints far too much time and space to play. I am going to go with another Palace win.
