[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derek Sheils clinched a double at the Skerries road races which were overshadowed by the death of travelling medic Doctor John Hinds following an accident during practice on Friday.

The popular doctor was taken to a Dublin hospital but died on Saturday.
Kawasaki rider Sheils took victory in the Open and Grand Final events, with William Dunlop second in both races.
Dunlop won the Supersport outing, with Derek McGee, Sam Wilson and Paul Jordan also taking victories at the meeting.
Mullingar man McGee won the Supertwins, Wilson was the 250/400cc victor and Jordan was the 125cc winner.
Jordan, from Magherafelt, took the flag from Ballymoney riders Paul Robinson and Sam Dunlop at the north County Dublin course.
Alan Bonner and John Walsh were podium finishers in the two 'big bike' races, with Michael Dunlop fourth in the feature event on his BMW Superstock, after retiring in the Open class.
BikeBits NI Kawasaki runner Sheils enjoyed an advantage of less than half a second over William Dunlop in the Open race, with third place going to the impressive Bonner.
In the feature Grand Final, Sheils made a flying start from pole and gradually edged away at the front from William Dunlop, who was riding a 1000cc machine for the first time since his accident at the TT, which left the Ballymoney rider with a broken rib.
At the finish, Sheils had more than four seconds to spare over Dunlop, who was clear of Walsh in third.
The Dunlop brothers now turn their attention to next week's Southern 100 races on the Isle of Man.
In the Supersports, Yamaha-mounted William Dunlop held off a determined challenge from McGee, who was riding his own Yamaha machine after splitting from Wilson Craig Racing last week.
