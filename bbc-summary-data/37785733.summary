A tiny hairless hamster who got a custom-made sweater to keep warm is adapting to her new home, her adopter has said.

Mathew Sears in the US state of Oregon adopted one-year-old Silky just days after the BBC had published her story.
"Silky likes people and is super friendly and outgoing," said Mr Sears.
He added that he was also "hair-challenged" and he joked that he imagined Silky would say, "There's Daddy!" when they first met.

The Oregon Humane Society (OHS) in Portland  had been caring for Silky after her original owners, who were moving away, said they would no longer be able to cater for her.
A staff member had knitted the sweater to help Silky stay warm because she was often cold. The hamster had been born hairless due to a genetic mutation, except for short curly whiskers on her snout.
"She does need to be kept in a heated environment," especially in winter, said Diana Gabaldon from the OHS.
"While she isn't fluffy like a normal hamster, she is just as cuddly and playful as any other hamster," Ms Gabaldon added.
The OHS said Sears had contacted them "right away" after reading the hamster's story over the weekend.
"He went straight to OHS and met Silky, and it was a match," the charity said on its website.
Sears said of his visit to the shelter: "Even if I had not adopted, it was a good experience, there was so much love."
The OHS sent Silky to her new home with a care package including her habitat and her tiny sweater.
