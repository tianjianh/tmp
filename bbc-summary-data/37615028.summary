[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 1-1 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late penalty from Port Vale's leading goalscorer Alex Jones rescued a draw at home to Charlton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His eighth of the season cancelled out Frederik Ulvestad's goal for the Addicks in the first half.
Jones turned and shot from 20 yards straight at Charlton goalkeeper Declan Rudd in the 13th minute as the hosts looked for the opener.
Charlton went close after 20 minutes when a Ricky Holmes cross was met by the head of Northern Ireland international Josh Magennis, but the ball came down off the crossbar and was smothered by Jak Alnwick.
Charlton made the breakthrough after half an hour when Holmes cut a ball back across goal from the right and on-loan Burnley midfielder Ulvestad was on hand to poke a shot past Alnwick.
The Valiants tried to find a leveller in the second half when substitute Rigino Cicilia headed a Sam Hart cross over the bar.
They finally rescued a point with five minutes left when Jones levelled from the spot after he was bundled over in the area.
