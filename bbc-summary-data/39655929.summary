A woman and a five-year-old girl have escaped injury in a gun attack on a house in west Belfast.

The shooting happened in Aitnamona Crescent shortly after 22:00 BST on Wednesday.
No-one was injured in the attack. The shots were fired through two of the living room windows.
Sinn FÃ©in MP for west Belfast, Paul Maskey, said the shooting was "disgraceful" and that someone could have been killed.
The woman and the girl, who was her cousin, were upstairs watching a film when the shots were fired.
"It just sounded like someone was putting their fists to the windows, not like a gun," the woman told BBC's Evening Extra programme.
"Two minutes later, I heard another one and then another one. My wee cousin was squealing and shaking.
"All the neighbours were standing out in the garden asking if we were ok. I was just looking for my keys and shouting: "Get me out of the house".
"The child now won't leave her mummy's side. She won't come down to mine anymore. She is asking me if I'm ok.
"Five-year-olds shouldn't have to think of stuff like that and shouldn't have to see things like that".
The attack left four bullet holes in a living room window, next to a sofa, said Paul Maskey.
"If anyone had been in that living room they would have been seriously injured or killed," he added.
"It is quite clear the attackers did not care who their target was.
"No-one has explained to the family why this attack occurred on their property.
Police are carrying out a number of follow-up enquiries and have appealed for information.
