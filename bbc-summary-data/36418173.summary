The body of Darren McMinn, 48, of Bolton, was found in Yarrow reservoir in Hodge Brow, near Rivington, Lancashire, early on 3 May.
Greater Manchester Police have asked for the public's help to trace his necklace, which has "sentimental value" to his family.
A 37-year-old Bolton man appeared in court charged with murder in May.
Two further men, aged 34 and 29, were arrested on suspicion of murder and are currently on bail.
The missing gold chain with a cross has a rectangular piece with red in the centre.
Det Ch Insp Sarah Jones said: "It may assist the investigation if we can find out what happened to Darren's necklace.
"More importantly, it is of great sentimental value to Darren's family, and particularly his son, so we would like to return it them."
