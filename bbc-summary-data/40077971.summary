The Northern Irishman, 30, finished ahead of Kawasaki team-mate Tom Sykes, who won the first race on Saturday.
English rider Sykes, 31, remains second in the 2017 standings on 205 points.
Leon Haslam, who was second on Saturday, crashed out early, while Italy's Marco Melandri also failed to finish due to a mechanical issue.
Wales' Chaz Davies claimed a podium finish after securing third spot and is third in the standings on 185 points.
"I was  happy this weekend, although in the races the ball didn't bounce our way, because this was the first time I actually felt that we might actually be able to do something about the green bikes around here," Davies told BBC Wales Sport.
Rea's win, 24 hours after crashing out with three laps left in the first race, was Kawasaki's 100th World Superbikes triumph.
It was an emotional weekend as Superbike fans paid tribute to former MotoGP world champion Nicky Hayden.
American Hayden died at the age of 35 in an Italian hospital last Monday following a cycling accident on the Rimini coastline.
There was a minute's silence before the opening race on Saturday, with Hayden's bike and helmet standing on the start/finish straight.
