The accusation, made at FMQs, followed confirmation of a budget deal between the SNP-led Holyrood administration and the Scottish Greens.
It is likely to include a Â£6 a week rise for the top 10% income rate payers in Scotland.
Ms Davidson believed Ms Sturgeon needed to start listening to the country's business leaders whom she said were warning that higher taxes were not the way to economic prosperity.
