Richard Rojas, 26, a US navy veteran who was arrested twice previously for drunk driving, is now in custody.
He also said he expected to die, the sources told AP news agency.
According to Reuters, he said after being arrested: "You were supposed to shoot me! I wanted to kill them."
The streets in Times Square, a bustling tourist district, were thronged with tourists when the car ploughed through the crowds.
The burgundy Honda sedan jumped the kerb at 45th Street and Broadway at 11:55 local time (15:55 GMT) and drove at high speed for three blocks before crashing into a pole.
It came to a crumpled standstill with smoke and flames escaping the bonnet.
Afterwards, victims lay on the ground, many of them separated from their scattered shoes and belongings, as medical staff, police officers and passersby tried to assist them.
One pregnant woman at the scene said: "A man pulled me out of the way of the car. I think he saved my life."
Media reports say a ticket agent and a worker at Planet Hollywood restaurant were among the people who helped police subdue and detain Mr Rojas.
The incident evoked recent terrorist attacks by vehicle in London, Nice and Berlin but New York mayor Bill de Blasio said there was "no indication" it was an act of terrorism.
Police believe he was high on synthetic marijuana, known as K2, ABC News reports, citing law enforcement sources. Initial tests reportedly came back negative for alcohol but positive for drugs.
According to media reports, he has a history of offending:
One neighbour told Reuters Mr Rojas had come back from serving in the navy with a drinking problem.
Harrison Ramos, who lives in Mr Rojas's building in the Bronx, said: " He went through a real tough time. Don't make him out to be a terrorist or something. He served his country and when he came back, nobody helped him.
"That's my friend. I care about him, and it hurts."
The woman who died was 18 years old. Her name was Alyssa Elsman and she had been visiting from Michigan with her family.
Her 13-year-old sister was also hit and injured.
The 22 injured people included:
An iconic space full of shops and entertainment places in downtown Manhattan.
It is full of advertising screens and, as a major tourist destination will be familiar to those who have visited New York. It features in many films. It is right next to Broadway, where many musicals and plays are performed.
