[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A husband was captured on CCTV shooting his wife in the head in their family home, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Allison Muncaster was shot in July by husband Stephen as she tried to escape the home in Magdalen, near King's Lynn. Builder Muncaster was later found dead in the couple's front garden.
Norfolk senior coroner Jacqueline Lake ruled Mrs Muncaster had been unlawfully killed.
Muncaster was the uncle of the so-called "lotto lout" Michael Carroll.
Norfolk Coroner's Court heard how the shooting was captured by CCTV cameras positioned throughout the house in Stow Road.
Det Con Jeremy Pitt from Norfolk Police told the hearing how the cameras showed the couple both appearing to be upset in the lounge at 23:49 GMT on 11 July.
Muncaster is then seen retrieving a shotgun from the bedroom.
"Stephen goes to collect the shotgun that had been concealed under the bed earlier in the evening," the officer said.
"Allison was sitting on the sofa in the second lounge. Stephen then produces the gun from behind his back."
The fatal shot was fired at 00:05 GMT.
Mr Pitt told the court: "He takes aim. Allison, realising what's about to happen, gets off the sofa and tries to run.
"She's fatally injured in the head and collapses on the lounge floor."
He said cameras covered the lounge where cleaner Mrs Muncaster sat on the sofa as well as the neighbouring room from which her husband fired the shot.
Mr Pitt added there was no record of previous domestic incidents, and Muncaster held a valid shotgun and firearms licence.
The builder had appeared on national TV alongside his nephew, Michael Carroll, when the 19-year-old won Â£9.7m on the National Lottery in 2002.
The former binman became known as the "Lotto lout" when he collected his winnings wearing an electronic tag.
At the time, Mr Carroll had been living with Muncaster and he then wife Kelly at the property in Magdalen.
In a written statement, paramedic Michael Heppel described how Muncaster's body was found with a shotgun by his side.
He found Mrs Muncaster's body inside. Two dogs were also "standing quietly behind a child gate in the kitchen."
A post-mortem examination concluded Mrs Muncaster died of a shotgun wound to the head. There were no signs of offensive, defensive or restraint wounds.
The inquest into the death of Stephen Muncaster will take place in April.
