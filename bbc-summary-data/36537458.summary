Kirsten Johnson's Cameraperson looks at her own career, which has included working on Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and Citizenfour, the film about whistleblower Edward Snowden.
Festival juror Nino Kirtadze said it was "expansive and intimate, formally ambitious and morally humble".
Johnson showed "real bravery... to turn the camera on herself", she added.
The grand jury at the annual international documentary festival also gave a special mention to Shimon Dotan's documentary about Israeli settlements in the West Bank, The Settlers.
Kirtadze said it "stood out [as] a psychological spiral in storytelling that drags you deeper and deeper into the history of this very delicate issue".
Other winners included Sonita, a film about an Afghan refugee living in Iran, which took the Youth Jury Award; a Chilean short about Alzheimer's, I'm Not From Here, which was awarded the Short Doc Award; Seed, a story about humans' 12,000 year relationship with seeds, which won the Environmental Award.
Festival director Liz McIntyre said it had been "an extraordinary year of brilliant creativity and originality [with] an awe-inspiring display of talent, both home grown and from around the world".
