Tigers are in Pool One with Glasgow, Munster and Racing 92 - the side that knocked them out of the competition at the semi-final stage last season.
"It's a tough one," Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
"Racing are the French champions, Munster we know well and Glasgow were champions two years ago."
Elsewhere, defending champions Saracens will face three-time winners Toulon in Pool Three.
Sale and Scarlets complete that group, while Exeter meet Ulster, Bordeaux and Clermont Auvergne in Pool Five.
Pro 12 winners Connacht are in Pool Two alongside Wasps, Toulouse and Zebre, while Leinster are in Pool Four with Castres, Northampton and last season's Challenge Cup winners, Montpellier.
"You look down all the draws and this is a pretty tough draw all-round really. The quality is as strong as ever," Cockerill said.
"With Racing, we know their quality. Glasgow have been good for the last three years and Munster will recruit well and be strong.
"They're all very tough. Both home and away games will be very tough."
