[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrejs Trofimovs was driving on the wrong side of the road when his car crashed into Allan Joiner's vehicle.
Mr Joiner, 44, suffered fatal head injuries in the collision on the C484 road between St Madoes and Errol in November 2014.
Trofimovs admitted careless driving.
Judge Lady Wolffe sentenced him to carry out 225 hours of unpaid work and banned him from driving for three years.
Lady Wolffe said it had been stressed that the collision occurred on a narrow, country road with no markings and there was no evidence of speeding or drink driving.
The 37-year-old was originally charged with causing death by dangerous driving.
Prosecutors accepted his guilty plea to an alternative charge of causing Mr Joiner's death by careless driving.
Trofimovs, of Mains of Errol Farm, Errol, also admitted driving without insurance.
The High Court in Edinburgh was told that Trofimovs had been socialising at a caravan at the farm and was asked to drop others off as he had not been drinking.
Collision investigators who examined the crash site concluded the Audi was on the wrong side of the road, which has no markings dividing the carriageways.
Advocate depute Alison Di Rollo said: "The accused is a Latvian national. In Latvia vehicles are driven on the right hand side of the road.
"This was the first time he had driven in the UK."
When Trofimovs was interviewed by police he admitted he was the driver and stated it was his first time driving in this country, adding: "It looked like he was on our side."
Lady Wolffe told him: "The sentence I impose in no way diminishes the death of Mr Joiner or the very great loss suffered by his family.
She said: "This is a sad and tragic case for all concerned. You acted as a favour, but the carelessness exhibited led to tragic consequences."
"You will have to carry the burden of what you have done.
"A family man has lost his life. His family will bear that loss for their lives too."
