The visitors had the best chance of a lively first half, but Elliot Lee's effort, which deflected off Tom Aldred, flew just wide of the upright.
Midway through the second half, Porter found space to volley Colchester into the lead from close range.
Blackpool pushed for a leveller, but Jim McAlister's header was saved by Elliot Parish as Colchester hung on.
The result meant both sides remain in the relegation zone with Colchester eight points adrift of safety in 23rd place and Blackpool one point behind Shrewsbury in 21st position.
