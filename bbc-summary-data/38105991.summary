Lancashire captain Steven Croft is hopeful cricket director and head coach Ashley Giles will stay despite interest from his former club Warwickshire.

Former England spinner Giles, 43, has a year left on his Old Trafford contract.
He guided the team to promotion from Division Two in 2015, his first season in charge, as well as the Red Rose's first domestic T20 Blast title.
"It (the speculation) is something none of us could ignore. We'd like him to stay," Croft told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"I don't think our goal or our plans are going to change too much as we still want to win things and develop players, and we'd like to do that with him.
"He's been great in the two years he's been here and hopefully we can get a few more out of him."
Giles, who still lives in the Midlands, was appointed Warwickshire's director of cricket in 2007 and led the Bears to the County Championship in 2012.
He also had a spell as England's one-day coach.
