[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager found hanged in his cell during his second night in custody at a young offenders' institution was "distressed", an inquest has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greg Revell from Long Eaton died on 11 June at HMP Glen Parva in Leicestershire.
An inquest jury at Leicester Town Hall heard he was depressed and had tried to take his own life three months earlier.
However, a custody sergeant said the 18-year-old had given him "no cause for concern".
On the first day of the inquest, the coroner heard Mr Revell had been admitted to HMP Glen Parva on 9 June while awaiting a crown court trial for threatening a person with an offensive weapon.
Mr Revell's mother, Karin, said her son had called her on his first night in prison and described how he was distressed and angry about being in custody.
She said she thought he was with a member of staff when he made the call, and that someone would have noted his behaviour.
Greg Revell first tried to commit suicide at a friend's flat in March 2014, before he was due in court on a previous charge.
Mrs Revell told the inquest he had been terrified he would go to jail.
He was sent to HMP Glen Parva, where she said he was bullied by other inmates, which had a "massive impact" on him.
Before Mr Revell was sent to the young offenders' institution for the second time, a police station custody sergeant, Nigel Rogers, told the inquest he was searched and put in a safety suit to reduce the risk of self harm.
He said he did not have any "cause for concern" about the teenager's mental health.
Staff at the prison said they had checked on Mr Revell at 03:00 BST but during their next check at 05:30 BST he was found dead.
The inquest is expected to last four days.
