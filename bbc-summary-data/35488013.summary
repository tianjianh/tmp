[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crowdfunded Rebus in administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Claims management company Rebus has gone into administration, marking one of the biggest failures of a crowdfunded company in the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rebus raised more than £800,000 last year on Crowdcube.
Investors in the company, which reports suggest number more than 100, could now lose their money.
Rebus specialised in pursuing claims against companies that mis-sold complex investments, which were later deemed to be tax-avoidance schemes.
According to the company's website, it was managing 1,700 claims with a value of more than £930m.
It employs 29 full-time members of staff.
This is the second high-profile failure of a crowdfunded company in the past few months, after Zano, the mini-drone project that raised £2.3m on Kickstarter, was shut down in November last year.
