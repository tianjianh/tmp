The Senegalese was taken to hospital after breaking his thighbone and jaw in the crash on the M4 near London.
In September, Palace manager Alan Pardew said he expected the 26-year-old to be sidelined for up to six months.
"I don't know about my injury. I don't know if I can get back or not," Souare told BBC World Service.
"I just put everything in the hands of God and we will see."
The left-back, who joined Palace from French club Lille in January 2015, had to be cut free from his car by a team of firefighters.
Souare said he remembered "everything" about the crash and admitted he felt "very lucky" to be alive.
"I got my leg broke, and my jaw, and I couldn't eat for the first month, but now I can eat, I can try to eat a little bit," he said.
"The thing about my leg, it's getting there. I'm trying to do the work to make it stronger with the physio at the club.
"I remember the helicopter coming to get me. I remember the door on my leg. I remember the guy who was coming to talk to me and I said to him I'll keep in touch with him as he helped me a lot before the helpers come. I remember they cut the roof to take me out.
"I was very lucky because that was a very crazy shock."
During Palace's Premier League game against West Ham in October, Palace fans sang 'there is only one Pape Souare' in the 23rd minute as a tribute to the player, who wears the number 23 shirt.
"I receive all the support from the fans - everything. They help me a lot and they make me believe myself," he added.
"I was watching the game, so when they stop singing to support the team to support me, I was very happy for that."
