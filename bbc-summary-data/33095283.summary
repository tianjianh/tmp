Two men are to stand trial accused of robbing relatives of Stagecoach tycoon Ann Gloag in their Perthshire home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher McMultan, 40, and Brian Martin, 57, are accused of entering the Kinfauns House home of Sarah Gloag in January, assaulting her and her husband and stealing Â£4,000 in cash and jewellery.
Lawyers for the pair entered not guilty pleas on their behalf.
They will stand trial on 11 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Prosecutors alleged McMultan and Martin tied up Mrs Gloag - step-daughter of Scotland's richest woman Ann Gloag - along with her husband Sundeep Salins and two children, and brandished knives at them during the raid on 19 January.
They are also accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice, by failing to stop their car when ordered to by police and throwing a bag of jewellery from the alleged raid out of the window.
Prosecutors also claim they refused to leave their cells at Perth police station to have their fingerprints and photographs taken.
The men are further charged with carrying out a similar assault and robbery a day earlier in Crieff, allegedly tying up a man and a woman before taking a bank card and using it to obtain Â£200 from an ATM.
During a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Burns continued the case for trial in November. The trial is expected to last up to nine days.
