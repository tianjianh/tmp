The FTSE 100 closed down 50.07 points, or 0.9%, at 5,848.69.
The fall came despite some big gains in miners, which are benefitting from a weaker US dollar, making commodities more affordable in other currencies.
Anglo American rose another 10.7% after a near-20% gain on Thursday, while Antofagasta was up 3.7%.
On the downside, house builders suffered, with Berkeley Group down 5% and Persimmon 3.6% lower.
On the commodities markets, Brent crude was down 0.4% at $34.32 a barrel, while US light crude was 0.4% lower at $31.60.
Oil prices have fallen more than 70% since mid-2014, hit by the slowing global economy and oversupply.
On the currency markets, the pound was down 0.9% against the dollar at $1.4466 and was 0.2% lower against the euro at â‚¬1.2989.
