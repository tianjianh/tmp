Man raped property manager during Gorebridge house inspection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 39-year-old man has been convicted of raping a property manager when she went to inspect his house in Midlothian.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 51-year-old woman was attacked by Keith Stevenson as she was about to leave his Gorebridge home.
She told the High Court in Edinburgh that Stevenson had grabbed her by the neck and forced her into a bedroom.
His trial heard how she tried to make him stop by pretending she was pregnant but he told her to shut up and continued the attack.
The woman fought back and, after kicking and biting him, she managed to leave Stevenson's house, drove to a hospital and called the police.
The attack happened on 18 March last year.
Stevenson denied the rape but jurors took just over an hour to return a guilty verdict.
Judge Lord Kinclaven deferred sentence for the court to obtain a report on whether Stevenson's offending meets the criteria needed for a life sentence.
As he left the dock, Stevenson laughed and shouted: "Wahey!"
During proceedings, the victim said she spent 18 March last year inspecting rental properties in Midlothian and did not know Stevenson.
She told the court: "He grabbed me from behind by my neck. He told me that I wasn't going anywhere.
"He said 'shut up' and 'just be a good girl.' "He said it would be all over in 10 minutes. He told me not to go for my phone.
"I was just shocked. I then said 'please let me go. I'm pregnant. I need to go to the hospital. I have an appointment. I need to go. I need to go.
"He told me to shut up."
The woman told the court that she was "dragged" into a bedroom and threatened to kill her.
She said: "I knew it was do or die. I started kicking him. I started screaming. He put his hand in my mouth. He said 'shut up, shut up. I'm going to kill you.
"I bit down on his finger. He said 'It shouldn't have happened like that.'"
Jurors also returned not proven verdicts to charges which alleged he sexually assaulted and attempted to rape another woman in Gorebridge in May 2014.
Prosecution lawyer Peter Ferguson QC told the court that Stevenson had a number of previous convictions for violence.
He will be sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow on 7 April.
Following the hearing, Det Insp Scott Anderson, of Police Scotland, said: "Keith Stevenson preyed on this woman who simply turned up at his house to do her job.
"He acted deviously in order to lure her to his house, and subjected her to a horrendous and frightening attack."
He added: "The victim bravely came forward to police shortly after the incident, which enabled us to react quickly to gather enough evidence to trace and detain Stevenson.
"I hope that with today's conviction, it will help her to begin moving on with her life.
"Police Scotland treats all reports of sexual crime with the utmost seriousness and we will investigate the matter thoroughly to ensure those responsible are brought to justice."
