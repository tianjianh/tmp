Welsh food and farming industry's post-Brexit warning

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh food and farming industry is in danger of "being put back decades" when the UK leaves the European Union, the environment secretary has warned.

Lesley Griffiths met Westminster counterpart Michael Gove for the first time since his appointment on the first day of the Royal Welsh Show on Monday.
She fears Wales will have less power and flexibility after Brexit if the UK government's repeal bill becomes law.
Mr Gove said Welsh farming would have a new chance to "grow and flourish".
First Minister Carwyn Jones and Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns are joining tens of thousands of visitors on the opening day of the Royal Welsh in Llanelwedd, Powys.
Mr Gove is spending the day at the show, meeting figures from the farming industry.
Brexit is set to dominate the political agenda at the four-day event, Europe's largest agricultural festival.
"I'm worried the Withdrawal Bill, coupled with the UK government's lack of engagement with us to understand the needs of Welsh farmers, will mean this understanding is lost and the industry in Wales will move back decades," said Ms Griffiths.
"Devolution has allowed us to tailor our policies for Welsh farmers with an understanding of their distinct needs."
Concerns about the way the UK government plans to convert EU law into British law were raised with Mr Gove by Ms Griffiths, whom she accused of showing "a complete disregard for devolution" after he postponed two planned meetings of UK agriculture and environment ministers.
Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, First Minister Mr Jones said: "London shouldn't become the new Brussels. We cannot have a Defra minister negotiating on behalf of Welsh farming without their consent."
A Defra spokesman said it was working closely with all the devolved administrations to "make sure we get the best deal for farmers across the UK when we leave the EU".
This included the right powers being returned to Westminster and the right powers being passed to Wales.
The spokesman said as well as meeting Ms Griffiths, Mr Gove was "listening to local farmers and their representatives so they can help shape the future of farming in their area".
The UK government's proposed Withdrawal Bill suggests control over regulation being handed back from Brussels in these areas will temporarily be held by Westminster.
Ministers say they need time to develop a legal framework for matters such as trade, animal health and farm subsidies that would apply UK-wide.
They said it would include the flexibility for devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to make changes based on their own specific needs.
Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas will set out his party's vision for agriculture post Brexit during a question and answer session at the Royal Welsh.
He said: "Plaid Cymru agrees with the need for UK frameworks as we leave the EU and wanted to work in building up those frameworks for agriculture, fisheries and for the environment.
"But the attitude of Tory ministers in Whitehall makes that impossible. What we are seeing now is not frameworks but impositions."
Mr Gove, who on Friday announced farming subsidies would have to be earned rather than just handed out after Brexit, plans to "celebrate the success of the Welsh lamb industry" during his visit.
Global appetite is at an all-time high, he will say, with 40% of what is produced now exported around the world.
Lamb accounts for a third of Wales' total food and drink exports - worth Â£110m last year.
However, 90% of what is sent overseas goes to EU countries.
Welsh farming unions and Meat Promotion Wales have insisted that ongoing tariff-free access to European markets is vital.
NFU Cymru president Stephen James said they had made it "crystal clear" to Mr Gove and Mr Cairns that a transitional period from current arrangements to a new agricultural policy over a number of years was "an absolute must".
Ahead of his visit, Mr Gove said:  "Leaving the EU will provide this hugely successful industry with new opportunities to grow and flourish and I am looking forward to meeting farmers and producers to hear their views on how we can drive the sector forward."
Glyn Roberts, president of the Farmers' Union of Wales said he had been "very disappointed" with the way Brexit discussions had been conducted so far and called on both the Welsh and UK governments to work together in a spirit of partnership.
