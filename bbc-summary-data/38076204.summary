Simon Ball trial: Teacher guilty of sexual offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A private school music teacher has been found guilty of a series of sex offences against girls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Ball, 42, of Greenwich, was convicted of four counts of engaging in sexual activity while in a position of trust at Giggleswick School, North Yorkshire in the early 2000s.
He had already admitted five counts of the same charge relating to his time at Kimbolton School, Cambridgeshire.
A jury has yet to reach verdicts on five further charges.
They are considering four counts of indecent assault and a further count of engaging in sexual activity while in a position of trust between 2001 and 2004, all relating to Giggleswick School.
During his trial at Peterborough Crown Court, the jury heard Ball had escaped prosecution at the school, near Settle, before offending again at Kimbolton School, near Huntingdon.
The Giggleswick investigation was reopened after a former Kimbolton School pupil reported Mr Ball to police last year.
He left his job at that school during the investigation.
Although he admitted charges relating to his time at Kimbolton, Ball had denied four counts of indecent assault and five counts of engaging in sexual activity while in a position of trust at Giggleswick School.
Gregory Perrins, prosecuting, told the jury Ball had sex with one pupil in different locations and on multiple occasions, including in the school music room and on top of his wife's wedding dress at his home.
Ball has since separated from his wife.
