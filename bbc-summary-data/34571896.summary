Becky Watts murder: Witness tells of 'threesomes' with accused

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A young woman has told the Becky Watts murder trial she had a number of "threesomes" with the man and woman accused of murdering the teenager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman said the arrangement with Nathan Matthews and Shauna Hoare was consensual.
She also told Bristol Crown Court Mr Matthews was "a bit controlling" of Ms Hoare and "jealous of her speaking to other men".
Nathan Matthews, 28, and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, deny murder.
The dismembered body of 16-year-old Becky was found in a shed in March.
The woman, who was visibly upset as she gave evidence, told the court she had known Ms Hoare since 2010 and had met Mr Matthews through her.
She said she thought Mr Matthews could be "paranoid" and added: "I think he was jealous of her speaking to other men."
The woman told jurors she became involved with the liaisons with the defendants after splitting with her boyfriend.
"At the beginning of 2014. A threesome, two occasions I think, over a month or two," she said.
"It started as a joke when I was with my partner because I was spending a lot of time with them. He would joke I was having a threesome, but I would laugh it off because it was ridiculous.
"By 2014, it came up in general conversation."
She told the court she had been on holiday to Butlins in Minehead in August 2014 with Ms Hoare, Mr Matthews, Becky, Becky's father Darren Galsworthy and stepmother Anjie - Mr Matthews' mother.
She said they appeared to be "just a normal family".
'False start cuts'
The court has also heard from Professor Sarah Hainsworth, an expert in materials and forensic engineering.
She demonstrated a duplicate version of the circular power saw recovered from the shed where Becky's body parts were found, to show how loud it was.
Jurors were also handed the saw to see how heavy it was.
Mr Matthews has admitted using the saw to dismember Becky's body.
Prof Hainsworth said it "would be easier to conduct a dismemberment such as the one I have seen if more than one person were involved".
However, she said the lack of "false start cuts" could mean "the person sawing was very careful and methodical".
'Nooks and crannies'
The court then heard from forensics expert Claire Morse who said it was "extremely surprising" none of Becky Watts' DNA was found in the bathroom where her body was allegedly dismembered.
The bathroom at 14 Cotton Mill Lane, home to Mr Matthews and Ms Hoare, was searched several times for blood.
Ms Morse said that did not mean the body could not have been cut up there, if sheeting was used.
But she said it is "a difficult thing to clean up and get out of all the nooks and crannies".
Mr Matthews, 28, of Hazelbury Drive, south Gloucestershire, admits killing his stepsister but denies murder and conspiring to kidnap her.
He also admits perverting the course of justice, preventing Becky's burial and possessing a prohibited weapon.
Miss Hoare, 21, of Cotton Mill Lane, Bristol, denies murder and conspiracy to kidnap, the weapons charge, perverting the course of justice and preventing a burial.
Two other men, Donovan Demetrius, 29, and James Ireland, 23, deny assisting an offender.
The trial continues.
