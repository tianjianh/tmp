[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 1-0 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cameron McGeehan's ninth goal of the season gave Luton a vital win over Accrington Stanley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder arrived on cue from James Justin's cross with 15 minutes to go and beat the excellent Elliot Parish to stretch his side's unbeaten run to eight league games.
Jordan Cook was sent off on 83 minutes but Luton held on for the win.
Luton probed in the first half as Parish tipped Alex Gilliead's 20-yard shot behind, while McGeehan hit the stanchion behind the goal, and Jack Marriott's attempt flew over.
Moments before the break, Parish made a superb double save from Glen Rea.
Jordan Clark hot wide from range for Stanley after half-time whiel at the other end Cook sent an effort over the top.
Alan Sheehan was denied what would have been a wonderful opener on 67 minutes, his free-kick cannoning off the underside of the bar, with Terry Gornell's 25-yarder straight at Christian Walton.
Parish made an outstanding stop from Scott Cuthbert's downward header, before he was finally beaten by McGeehan.
Luton were reduced to 10 men with seven minutes to go, Cook seeing red for two yellows, but Walton made fine stops late on from Romuald Boco and team-mate Rea's mis-placed header to ensure victory.
