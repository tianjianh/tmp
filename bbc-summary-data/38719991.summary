Humphrys, 19, made his Fulham debut in the 2-2 Championship draw with Derby in December and has gone on to make a further two first-team appearances.
He had impressed for Fulham's under-23 side, scoring 12 goals in 13 Premier League 2 games so far this term.
"It just seems like a really nice club to be at," Humphrys said.
"The standard here is really good, there's some good players and hopefully the team will pull together."
Humphrys is the third striker to join Shrewsbury on loan in January, following Crystal Palace's Freddie Ladapo and West Bromwich Albion's Tyler Roberts.
Shrewsbury have also signed Hartlepool United defender Aristote Nsiala, Notts County winger Alex Rodman and Middlesbrough midfielder Bryn Morris.
