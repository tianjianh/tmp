Derry is the penultimate stopover on the world's longest ocean race, which left London in September.
Some of the yachts were expected to arrive in Derry from Saturday, but will now start to arrive on Monday due to poor weather conditions.
About 120,000 people visited Derry in 2012 for the Derry-Londonderry homecoming.

Magilligan strand and Greencastle in County Donegal will be a vantage point to see the yachts leaving Northern Ireland.
The Mayor of Derry, Brenda Stevenson, said Londonderry will rise to the occasion.
"When the city hosted its first clipper stopover event in 2012, we received tremendous feedback," she said.
"I know that Derry will certainly rise to the occasion once again and, with an even bigger and better line up for 2014, the Legenderry Maritime Festival promises to be an exceptional event.
"Thousands of people will be thronging the streets over the coming days, so this is a real opportunity to showcase the very best of the city, our stunning riverfront, our renowned hospitality and our ability to stage world class events.
"I would urge everyone to come along and join in the fun, and give the Clipper crews, including our own Derry-Londonderry-Doire, a very warm Derry welcome."
Clipper project manager with Derry City Council, Aeidin McCarter, said she was delighted to see the event finally coming together.
"The team from Derry City Council has been working around the clock to put the final preparations for the festival in place after many months of planning.
"We are delighted that the clipper race organisers have selected Derry once again as a stopover city, and after the fantastic welcome they received in 2012 they are extremely enthusiastic about their return.
"Music will also be in the Derry air on Saturday as Music City 2014 stages a massive all-day outdoor music spectacular, featuring the very best local musical talent spanning all age groups and genres."
