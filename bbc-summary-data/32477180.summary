As Nepal struggles to cope with the aftermath of Saturday's devastating earthquake, the international community is rallying to help. India mobilised more quickly and has given more than any other country, correspondents say.

Impoverished Nepal has relied on its giant neighbour India for decades. Indian PM Narendra Modi was tweeting his support within minutes of the quake. Indian media reported that within four hours it had sent its first military aircraft along with 285 members of its National Disaster Response Force, and has airlifted out more than 1,400 of its nationals. Thirteen military aircraft, three civilian aircraft and six helicopters have been deployed, the Indian foreign ministry said.
India has also sent 10 tonnes of blankets, 50 tonnes of water, and 22 tonnes of food. Such supplies are desperately needed by the displaced living in tent cities. In addition, India has dispatched three army field hospitals, an engineering task force, doctors and two tonnes of medical supplies, the ministry said. There are 62 Indian dead and 259 injured.
The government urged those waiting to be airlifted out to be patient, stressing that relief and rescue is "our primary purpose". It is hoping to also evacuate people by road, adding that highways are believed to be open, but slow-going due to the weight of traffic.
The National Tourism Administration of China said that as of Sunday morning, 683 Chinese tourists were stranded in Nepal. The Chinese consulate in Nepal is operating as a temporary shelter for them and China's government said four of its nationals were confirmed dead and 10 seriously injured. Xinhua said at least 20 people were also killed in Tibet. One Chinese mountaineer died on Everest and another eight of its climbers were seriously hurt.  China is sending 20m yuan ($3.3m) in humanitarian aid and has sent a 60-strong medical team from Sichuan province, including experts from medical, pharmacy, osteology, nursing and psychology departments, and will stay for 10 days, Xinhua said. They brought with them 13 tons of medical aid.
China has also sent a 55-strong military rescue team, with another 45 soldiers arriving on Tuesday. Because of China's own seismological vulnerability, they have participated in several deadly earthquake operations in recent years, Xinhua said, and will provide not only medical aid but also psychological counselling.
Pakistan has sent four C-130 aircraft carrying a 30-bed hospital, special search and rescue teams and relief items. The hospital will include a range of specialists and the search and rescue team is carrying radars for detecting those buried and concrete cutting equipment. The planes also took 2,000 meals, 200 tents and 600 blankets. Pakistan has airlifted 39 of its nationals who were stranded in Nepal out on military planes. A Pakistani diplomat told The Express Tribune that there were about 100 Pakistani nationals in Nepal and that efforts were being made to contact them.
There are 549 Australians registered as travelling in Nepal and the government has so far confirmed the safety of more than 200 but efforts are continuing to reach the rest. There have been no reports of deaths so far in Kathmandu but one Australian was reportedly killed on Mount Everest, with several others still unaccounted for. The Australian government is sending $5 million Australian dollars (US$3.9m) in aid.
Israel has sent a 260-member team to Nepal along with 95 tons of humanitarian and medical supplies, including a laboratory, X-ray machines, operating rooms, children's treatment rooms and birthing facilities. Israel's government said on Sunday it would airlift four pregnant Nepalese women to Israel who are acting as surrogate mothers for Israeli nationals, and 25 babies born to surrogate mothers from India on behalf of Israeli families. There are reported to be 600-700 Israelis in Nepal, and about 400 have been contacted.
Japan is sending emergency relief worth 25 million yen ($210,000) including tents and blankets. Japan's foreign ministry said one Japanese man was killed and a woman injured. There are 1,100 Japanese residents living in Nepal, though it is not clear how many tourists are in the country.
Several hundred British citizens are believed to be in Nepal but no deaths or injuries have been reported so far. Consular staff are reported to be looking for UK nationals in tourist centres and hospitals, in order to give any assistance needed. "There are several hundred British nationals in Nepal at this time of year and we expect that almost certainly some will have been caught up in the earthquakes," said UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. The UK is sending an eight-strong humanitarian team and Â£5m in aid. A flight on Sunday took seven UK International Search and Rescue crews, and more than 11 tonnes of kit, including torches, axes, ropes, search cameras, stretchers and tents.
The US is sending a disaster response team and an initial $1m (Â£0.7m) of aid. Three Americans were killed in the avalanche on Everest, the US State Department said, including a Google engineer, a medical worker and a filmmaker.
