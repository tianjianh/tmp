Pro12: Glasgow Warriors 15-16 Munster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late drop-goal from Ian Keatley was enough to secure victory for Pro12 leaders Munster and consign Glasgow Warriors to a third consecutive loss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Conway's early try put the visitors in control, with the hosts struggling to find any cohesion.
Warriors were hindered by injuries to Peter Horne and Rory Hughes but stole a line-out for Ali Price to score.
Mark Bennett raced clear to nudge Glasgow ahead but the conversion was missed and Keatley had the last say.
The visitors got off to a flier against a dreadfully poor Glasgow; Keatley banging over an early penalty before Conway scored the game's first try. That score had its origins in a sliced clearing kick from Peter Murchie that gave Munster a line-out, then a collapsed maul gave them a free play.
Keatley hit a crossfield kick to the right-hand corner where Darren Sweetnam and Murchie missed it in the air. Conway followed up to touch it down. Keatley's conversion made it 10-0.
Until their dramatic recovery, Glasgow were uninspired and utterly unable to break down a terrific Munster defence.
They had 60% possession and 60% territory in that first half, they played a quarter of the half with a one-man advantage when Dave Kilcoyne was binned, they were awarded seven penalties - and gave away only three - and still all they could do on the scoreboard was three points from Horne's boot.
Glasgow turned down kickable penalties and went for touch instead. Dubious decision-making that led to frustration after they ran into one red wall after another.
Munster didn't have to be anything other than aggressive and well-organised in defence to have a 13-3 lead at the break. They even won the 10 minute sin-binning period 3-0.
Glasgow scrum-half Price made his international debut last weekend in the final minutes against Georgia. He helped create a try that day and he scored the one that woke Glasgow up in this game.
Price had been one of the few home players who stood out in the first half and, on the hour, he came alive with a try. Glasgow stole line-out ball and Price saw his chance, taking it brilliantly.
He darted through the visitors' defence, eluding Sweetnam and Keatley and going in by the posts. Clegg converted.
Glasgow hit Munster with another try nine minutes later, attacking from their own 22; Tommy Seymour slipping a lovely offload to Bennett who ran 60 metres to put Glasgow ahead 15-13. There was no conversion - and it was costly.
With three minutes left, Munster worked good field position and Keatley kept his nerve wonderfully to strike the winning drop goal straight and true.
Munster, deservedly, had continued their winning run and Glasgow had continued a losing sequence that is now looking deeply concerning for them. That's three in a row in the Pro 12 - for the first time since 2011 - and four losses in five in all competitions.
A terrific night for Munster, but a grim one for the hosts.
