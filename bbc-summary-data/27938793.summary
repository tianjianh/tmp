Coronation Street fans can get married in the Rovers Return after the soap's old set was granted a wedding licence.

The show vacated its old set in central Manchester earlier this year and moved to a new site on Salford Quays.
The old set has since been opened up for guided tours and its indoor Studio One has now been given permission to host wedding ceremonies.
The studio houses the interior sets for the Rovers Return, the knicker factory and the Platt and Duckworth houses.
Andy Begg, general manager of Coronation Street The Tour, said it was "a real must for any die hard Corrie fan wanting to tie the knot in style".
He added: "We are currently in the process of working out what packages can be made available, but rest assured, you can guarantee the Rovers will play a big part."
Weddings will be available on weekday evenings during school term time, when guided tours do not happen, he added.
ITV sold Granada's Quay Street site for Â£26m to Allied London and Manchester City Council last year.
The set is currently scheduled to be open to the public until October but the long-term plans for the site have yet to been confirmed.
