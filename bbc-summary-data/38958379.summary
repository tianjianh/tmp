The 23-year-old centre-back, who has previously had spells with Gillingham and Brighton, scored one goal in 11 appearances in WSL 2 in 2016.
"It is a dream of mine to join a pro club so to be here is an amazing feeling," she told the club website.
"I have worked my way through the ranks and am delighted to have done enough to earn a contract with Chelsea."
Chelsea have not disclosed the length of Cooper's contract.
The Blues begin the WSL Spring Series against Manchester City on 23 April.
