[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield moved up to third in the Championship with victory at Norwich.

The Terriers took a fifth-minute lead through Elias Kachunga's header but Jonny Howson equalised for the hosts just 66 seconds later.
Kachunga put the visitors back in front before the break when he poked an effort past John Ruddy via a deflection off Sebastien Bassong.
The Canaries had chances in the second half but defeat means they have now lost seven of their last nine games.
Relive Norwich v Huddersfield
For David Wagner's side victory was their third in successive games after five without a win, but their first goal came about in controversial circumstances.
Kachunga looked to be in an offside position when Tommy Smith crossed in from the right, however the header was allowed to stand.
The Canaries got back into the match almost immediately when Robbie Brady hooked a cross to captain Howson to head home his fourth goal of the season.
But, soon after Terriers forward Nahki Wells nearly capitalised on a wayward Graham Dorrans backpass, Kachunga was given too much space in the middle of the park to run forward, play a one-two with Smith and prod in his ninth of the campaign.
Kachunga missed a similar chance for a hat-trick in a second half which Norwich shaded, but could not find a way past Town goalkeeper Danny Ward, as Nelson Oliveira's attempted lob went wide of the mark when he was free in the box.
Sebastien Bassong almost equalised late on with a powerful header from a corner but it was not to be and the home fans let out a chorus of boos at the final whistle.
Norwich manager Alex Neil: "The disappointing thing is we had a lot of clear-cut chances that we didn't take.
"Ultimately goals change games. There was certainly enough there to score goals.
"In the first half we lacked intensity, we looked leggy. In the second half we were more energetic."
Huddersfield boss David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We wanted to be confident and play with our identity. We were very strong in the first half and I think we deserved the three points.
"When you play Norwich away there will be hard moments but we were lucky and I'm very proud.
"Kasey Palmer was outstanding tonight. His work with and without the ball was class.
"This was a great week and I'm giving the players tomorrow off! It's important they spend time with their families around Christmas."
