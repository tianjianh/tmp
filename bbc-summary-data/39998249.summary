General election 2017: Welsh Labour manifesto at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Labour launched its Welsh general election manifesto in the battleground seat of Delyn

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The document, which is 113 pages long, presents a flavour of the Labour manifesto with a cache of local policies included.
With Labour leading the Welsh Government it also reinstates existing policy in Cardiff, with some pledges from the assembly election last year included.
You can read more about Labour's pledges to the whole UK here. This guide looks at what is put on offer specifically to Wales.
"Welsh Labour is in power in Wales and we want to establish a real partnership with a UK Labour government," the document says in its forward.
The manifesto says: "This is not the Brexit election."
It claims that Wales needs "a strong Labour Government and a big Welsh Labour team in Westminster fighting for the causes that matter - we're the only ones that can take them on".
The manifesto:
Many aspects of transport such as road building, with the notable exception of railway infrastructure, are devolved in Wales.
The manifesto says that a UK Labour government would complete the electrification of the Great Western main line to Swansea and work with Labour in Cardiff to set a clear timetable for the electrification of the North Wales main line.
It also says that Labour UK ministers would complete the High Speed 2 line from London to Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester, ensuring there are "effective links into North Wales" to benefit the economy.
UK Labour would work with Welsh Government to scrap tolls on the Severn bridges, the party says.
The manifesto also:
The NHS is a sector almost wholly devolved to Wales' assembly and government.
The section in the manifesto largely restates existing policy in Cardiff Bay - claiming that Welsh Labour has "defended the Welsh NHS from Conservative attacks and from a disruptive top-down reorganisation".
It says the party has increased the number of nurses, doctors, consultants and GPs caring for patients.
Labour says Wales is spending Â£160 more per person on health and social services combined than in England.
Labour says it will take action to end zero-hours contracts in social care, and says that in Cardiff it has protected social care funding "helping Welsh councils to avoid a social care crisis".
Like health, the manifesto's pages on Welsh education largely outlines existing Welsh Government policy.
Labour leads the government but the current education minister is a Liberal Democrat - Kirsty Williams.
The manifesto says that, under the Carwyn Jones' leadership which began in 2009, there is "new momentum in Welsh education", claiming "GCSE results are the best ever, the attainment gap is closing and our apprenticeship system is delivering the skills businesses and our economy need".
The manifesto reiterates the Welsh Government's intention to begin trailing 30 hours of free childcare a week from September, and says it will fund lunch and fun clubs across Wales over the next three years to "end the spectre of children going hungry".
It reiterates an outstanding pledge to create 100,000 all age-apprenticeships across Wales by the end of the assembly term.
The manifesto also spells out the current policy to end grants that cover the bulk of tuition fees and replace it with help for living costs.
UK Labour's pledge is to end tuition fees, however. The document says: "When a Labour Government is elected at Westminster we will undertake a further review of the impact of any changes made in England on universities and students in Wales."
It says Welsh Labour has "always been clear" that there should be no tuition fees "if funding allowed".
The manifesto says Labour would:
Housing policy is devolved in Wales.
The manifesto says Labour in Cardiff will build a further 20,000 affordable homes in Wales, including 6,000 through Help to Buy Wales, and 1,000 through a rent-to-home scheme.
The party had pledged itself to the 20,000 figure at the last assembly election.
Welsh Labour also promised to act to ban lettings agents' fees for tenants. Welsh Labour ministers have been under pressure from their own backbenchers for the measure after plans were announced to do the same in England and action was taken in Scotland.
The manifesto also:
