Grealish, 21, will have his condition monitored over the next 24 hours, Villa manager Steve Bruce told BBC WM.
The England Under-21 international fell awkwardly during the first half of Saturday's goalless draw against the Hornets at Villa Park.
"We hope it's not too serious, but it's knocked him sick," Bruce said.
"Whatever he's got, we hope internally that he's OK, but we won't find out for the next 24 hours."
Grealish's injury comes just a week before Villa start their Championship season against Hull on Saturday, 5 August.
He scored five goals for Villa last season in 33 appearances.
