Beach huts damaged in a major storm in Hampshire are to be replaced as part of a £1.1m repair project.

Many of the 119 privately-owned beach huts at Milford on Sea were destroyed by waves and high winds on St Valentine's Day 2014, with about 40 remaining intact.
New Forest District Council said owners would make a "substantial contribution" towards replacement huts.
The remains of the site will be demolished in June.
Planning consent was agreed at a council meeting earlier, and includes repairs and improvements to the lower promenade where the huts sit.
Edward Heron, portfolio holder for the environment, said: "I am very pleased that by securing outline planning permission to replace the huts and restore the promenade we can now move this project forward.
"We will be clearing the lower promenade in time for the public to use the beach this summer, and in the long term I believe this project will help enhance the beach at Milford for everyone who uses it."
Milford was one of the areas worst-hit by the storm in February. About 30 people had to be rescued from the seafront Marine Restaurant after the windows smashed and water poured in.
Of the beach huts that remained, many were deemed dangerous and were demolished. The area, including the surviving huts, remains cordoned off.
The council said it would recoup the expenditure of the project over time through licence fees.
It is currently inviting tenders for design and project management.
