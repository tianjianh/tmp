Ricardo Moniz: 'Street-wise' Notts County boss can handle problems

Notts County boss Ricardo Moniz says his "street-wise" personality helps him cope with any hard-to-handle players.

Part of his job since arriving in April has been improving the disciplinary record of midfielder Liam Noble.
"I come from the streets and I know from my past that all the best players are difficult characters," Moniz said.
"We have a few characters which a lot of clubs and coaches would run away from. I think you should guide them in a good direction and be a leader."
The Magpies, who are 14th in League Two, travel to Wycombe Wanderers on Tuesday after last weekend's dramatic 4-3 victory over Newport.
Noble scored twice on Saturday, including the injury-time winner, to secure Notts an eighth victory of the season.
And Moniz is impressed with the performances from the 24-year-old, who was sent-off three times last season and red-carded early in this campaign against Accrington.
Moniz told BBC Radio Nottingham: "Noble has made a big step this season. He has eight goals now and there are no red cards anymore.
"Off the pitch he is a massive influence in the dressing rooms. It is fantastic to see his development.
"If people are not different, we only create robots. It starts with the youth, sometimes difficult characters are sent away but they are the best.
"You think of George Best, Cantona, Gascoigne - you can't say they are bad players.
"Noble is a little different and sometimes he can surprise you."
