The 25-year-old, who played for his country at the recent World Cup, was with Sale Sharks last season.
He could be used immediately by Glasgow coach Gregor Townsend, who has three hookers out injured.
"He came down to Cardiff at the weekend and has been training with us for over a week, so he's ready to play if selected," said Townsend.
"Shalva is a very experienced hooker who has been playing international rugby for the last four years and played well for Georgia against the All Blacks at the World Cup.
"He was also at Sale Sharks last season, playing at a high level in the English Premiership and Champions Cup."
Mamukashvili will replace Kevin Bryce in Warriors' 41-man European squad before Saturday's opening Champions Cup trip to face French side Racing 92.
Bryce and Fergus Scott have both had shoulder operations and are expected to remain on the sidelines for several months, while Fraser Brown is recovering from foot surgery.
Back-rower Jason Hill has also had ankle surgery and is expected to be out for another two months.
"Fergus has done well for us when called upon and Kevin had just come back from the World Cup ready to kick on this season," said Townsend.
"Jason had a really good pre-season, impressing against Clermont and Canada."
Mamukashvili has 35 caps for his country and played 11 times for Sale last season, including three Champions Cup games.
The hooker, who began his career with Kochebi and Armia Tbilisi in his homeland, rates Glasgow as "one of the best in Europe".
"Playing against Argentina and New Zealand at the World Cup was a great experience and something which will help me at the Warriors," he said.
