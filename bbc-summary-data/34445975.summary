[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More tourists could die from carbon monoxide poisoning unless the government and holiday industry do more to protect them, a coroner has said.

The warning comes in a report by David Hinchliff who investigated the deaths in Corfu in 2006 of Bobby and Christi Shepherd, from Horbury near Wakefield.
An inquest jury ruled in May they were unlawfully killed by a faulty boiler.
In his new report, Mr Hinchliff says: "There is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken."
The document, which has been sent to senior government ministers, travel agents group Abta and the Federation of Tour Operators, says the government must push for a new EU-wide safety standard.
He also called for:
The inquest jury also ruled that travel firm Thomas Cook had breached its duty of care after seven-year-old Christi and six-year-old Bobby were overcome by fumes while on holiday with their father and his partner at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel in October 2006.
Mr Hinchliff said Thomas Cook should lead the way with improving safety and raising awareness across the industry.
Thomas Cook said in a statement: "As a company we are now reviewing his report and the suggestions he has made for both the wider travel industry and for Thomas Cook.
"We will continue to work with the travel industry and ABTA to identify possible improvements that may be appropriate for implementation across the industry.
"We are already working with Sharon Wood [the children's mother] on a new initiative to raise awareness about carbon monoxide in order to tackle some of the issues head on."
An ABTA spokesman added: "We have received a copy of the coroner's report regarding the inquest into the deaths of Bobby and Christi Shepherd and are reviewing it in detail.
"We will consider the points raised in the report very carefully and we will provide feedback to the coroner by the date requested."
Mary Creagh, the family's MP in Wakefield, said: "I welcome the fact the coroner is pushing the UK government to institute new carbon monoxide standards in the UK and across Europe and is also pushing the holiday industry to better protect travellers."
The Labour MP said 43 holidaymakers had died of carbon monoxide poisoning since Christi and Bobby's deaths.
"The family's dearest wish is that this sort of tragedy does not happen to anybody else," said Ms Creagh.
