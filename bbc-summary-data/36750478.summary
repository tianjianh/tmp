[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Woodhouse, 65, of Rothwell Avenue, Grimsby, was found guilty of three counts of rape and 12 indecent assault charges following a trial at the town's Crown Court.
Humberside Police said the girls were abused over a six year period.
Woodhouse, who denied all the charges, was also placed on the sex offenders register for life.
Det Insp Peter Thorp said the conviction followed a "painstaking investigation" led by Det Helen Garrod.
"His two victims suffered the most unimaginable experiences that no child should ever have to and showed incredible courage and bravery throughout the investigation.
"I sincerely hope the victims will now be able to rebuild their lives again."
He added he hoped it sent a "strong message to those victims who have never come forward but suffered abuse at any point in their lives."
