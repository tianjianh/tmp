Brighton manager Chris Hughton says it is "right and fitting" that Saturday's game at home to Hull will be dedicated to victims of the Shoreham air crash.

One of the victims, Matt Grimstone, was a member of the Championship club's ground staff team while another, Jacob Schilt, was a Seagulls supporter.
"I have have been incredibly impressed with the way the club and the community have come together, right through this period," Hughton told BBC Sussex.
"It is about us showing our respects."
Grimstone and Schilt were among 11 victims of the crash which occurred on 22 August when a Hunter Hawker jet crashed on to the A27.
There will be a minute's applause before kick-off against Hull, while Brighton are also planning other tributes before the match begins.
"Matt was highly thought of while Jacob was a very big supporter," Hughton added.
"We were at the funeral of Matt on Monday, and the turnout from the club and the local community was exceptional.
"It is a Brighton and Hove Albion day and a day we pay our respects, using it as a celebration of their lives. That is the way the family and the community would like to remember it."
Both Grimstone and Schilt played for Sussex non-league side Worthing United, who dedicated last Sunday's FA Vase match against East Preston to the duo.
