Ed Slater: Leicester Tigers lock suffers knee injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester Tigers lock Ed Slater has been ruled out for up to two months with a knee injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Slater, who has four England Saxons caps, damaged ligaments in his right knee in Saturday's loss to Saracens.
The 27-year-old missed the start of the season with knee problems and and was out for nine months last season, after having surgery on his left knee.
"It's probably six to eight weeks," director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
"He has a medial injury on the inside of his right knee. It is not a horrifically bad injury; it's a pretty straightforward one.
"It's not ideal but that's the game."
