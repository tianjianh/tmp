Plans to put an arts centre in one of Wrexham's indoor markets have been given the go-ahead.

The proposals for the People's Market have proved controversial with opponents raising doubts over the cost and the location.
But a report to Wrexham council's executive board said the Â£4.5m plan was to regenerate a key building and increase footfall in the town centre.
The Oriel gallery has been looking for a base since it left the town library.
It has since moved to a temporary shop in Chester Street near the market and former gallery space has been earmarked for a new police station.
Councillor Huw Jones, lead member communities collaboration and partnerships, said it was "one of the most significant developments in Wrexham in recent years".
The project would be funded by the Welsh government, Arts Council of Wales and Wrexham council.
