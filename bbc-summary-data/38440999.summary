However, on-loan Jack Wilshere is ineligible against his parent club and Marc Pugh remains an injury doubt.
Arsenal could be without midfielder Mesut Ozil, who missed the win over Crystal Palace through illness.
Mohamed Elneny is at the Africa Cup of Nations, while Theo Walcott and Kieran Gibbs could miss out through injury.
Alistair Bruce-Ball: "Scorpion pun alert! The football world continues to marvel at Olivier Giroud's remarkable goal, but will there be a sting in the tail for Arsenal on the south coast?
"Bournemouth are having an excellent season. At the half-way stage they were 10 points clear of the relegation zone after their 3-0 win at Swansea, they'd won as many home games as Manchester City and Manchester United and were actually a little unlucky to lose 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium at the end of November.
"But if Arsenal harbour serious hopes of hauling in Chelsea, then they need to win this game and probably their next three league games before facing Antonio Conte's side on 4 February."

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "We're still in that moment as a team where we haven't consolidated any consistent run. That's what we're looking to do.
"The players have the ability to respond to disappointments and the ability to produce, individually, some very good performances.
"So it's a case of trying to do it on a more consistent basis will be the key for us."
Bournemouth had a good win at Swansea but they will be without Jack Wilshere for the visit of his parent club.
Arsenal lost 2-1 at Manchester City and Everton over Christmas and that was perhaps a little blip. It seems to have gone unnoticed, though, and I think they will win on the south coast.
