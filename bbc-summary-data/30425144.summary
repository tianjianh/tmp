National Trust staff took on the challenge to care for St Michael's Mount on an island off Cornwall.
Gardeners have to weed the 50m (160ft) walls of the 12th Century castle three times a year.
The four-strong team of gardeners at the medieval church and castle keep the walls clear of unwanted vegetation and allow the desired plants to flourish.
Lottie Allen, head gardener, said: "Abseiling has become an important skill to complete essential strimming and planting of the many nooks and crannies within the cliff face where plants grow in spite of the salty winter storms and baking summer temperatures."
Ms Allen said the weeding allowed plants such as aloes and aeoniums to thrive and flourish.
"It is a thrilling and unique experience to tend these gardens which are designed to be viewed from above," she said.
"On a personal note, abseiling allows me to appreciate the spectacular views of our gardens across the seasons and in all weathers."
