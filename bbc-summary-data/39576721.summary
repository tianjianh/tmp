Sercombe, 26, was left out of Saturday's League One draw at Walsall for unspecified "disciplinary reasons".
Manager Michael Appleton refused to confirm if the former Exeter midfielder had played his last game for Oxford.
"Who knows?" he said. "He won't be in the squad this weekend and whether he is beyond that, is something that will we decide at the time."
Sercombe's last appearance for Oxford came against Fleetwood on 5 April just days after he scored at Wembley in the U's EFL Trophy final defeat by Coventry City.
He has scored 22 goals in all competition for Oxford since joining from Exeter City in summer 2015.
"Everything is undo-able, there's never a full stop on anything," Appleton added. "But, there's going to have to be a hell of a lot of work behind the scenes to put things right.
"We do things a certain type of way. There's a culture at this club, certain things we accept and certain things we don't.
"I'm speaking on behalf of the whole group, not just myself and I'll be amazed if anybody thinks differently."
Sercombe will sit out Friday's trip to Bradford and the visit of Port Vale on Monday as 10th-placed Oxford look to cling on to their slim chances of reaching the League One play-offs.
