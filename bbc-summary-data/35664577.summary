Six Nations 2016: Do not sanitise rugby - Wales lock Jones

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales lock Alun Wyn Jones says international rugby cannot be "sanitised" too much.

The comments come after France were criticised for their approach in their win over Ireland, which saw Irish fly-half Johnny Sexton forced off.
"There was a bit of 'afters' but you have to be careful we don't sanitise it too much or the game might turn to touch rugby," said Jones.
France lock Yoann Maestri received a warning for a tackle on Sexton.
Jones believes the sports' match officials are capable of policing the line between hard, but legal and dangerous play.
"I'm sure the officials will keep an eye on that, but that's their job," said the Ospreys player.
"What's in vogue at the moment (for offences) is no arms in the tackle, hands on the floor so there's always things that dip in and out of the game."
Charteris challenge
Jones will be partnered by Wasps lock Bradley Davies in the Welsh second row after a knee injury to Racing 92's Luke Charteris, the tallest player in the squad at 6ft 9in.
"Obviously Charts is taller than the rest of us, but we try to stick with the policies we've had," said Jones.
"It's like when someone goes off during a game, you don't want to change too much.
"He's been pretty disruptive in the driving mauls, but we'll just have to go under, rather than over the top!"
Jones is warning Wales will compete on the opposition line-out throw despite the loss of Charteris, whose place has gone to 6ft 6in Bradley Davies.
"We had two decent steals (against Scotland) so there's probably a perception now that we will compete, teams have to make sure they can win the ball before they can drive so it's good we're putting that pressure on."
