Both will be in contention to feature for the Ports in Saturday's Irish Cup game at Loughgall.
Dolan, 28, has had spells at several Irish League clubs including Ballymena United, Carrick Rangers, Ards and Warrenpoint Town.
Duffin, 24, was on Cliftonville's books for four years before moving to their neighbours Crusaders in 2014.
Ports manager Niall Currie signed the duo just before the transfer window closed on Tuesday night.
Dolan played under Currie during his stint at Ards and the Ports boss believes he will be a good acquisition for the Shamrock Park outfit.
"He had a bad injury last season that put him out for a long time but we've got him up a few times over the last six weeks to monitor where he was at," Currie told the Portadown website.
"He did that off his own bat with no guarantee of a contract and has shown me his desire to help us in the situation we are in.
"He's played many times in the Premiership and his experience and quality will be a great boost for our squad."
Matt Hazley, who signed for the Ports earlier in the transfer window, will also be available for Saturday's Irish Cup tie.
