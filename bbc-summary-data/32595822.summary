Police in Indonesia have arrested a man they suspect was smuggling rare birds inside plastic bottles.

The man was allegedly caught carrying the live birds on a passenger ship near the city of Surabaya.
They included 21 yellow-crested cockatoos, which are listed as endangered. They were kept inside bottles to stop them from flapping.
The birds are known to sell through legal channels for as much as Â£1,000 ($1,500) each.
Customs officials said the haul also included an unspecified number of green parrots.
The exact number of yellow-crested cockatoos in the wild is not known, but the International Union for Conservation of Nature place it on their critically-endangered list.
Birdlife, a nature conservation group, say the birds' numbers are dropping due to " unsustainable trapping for the cagebird trade".
In 2013, two Indonesian military employees were given a warning after they were found to be running a bird-smuggling ring on board a military aircraft.
Bags containing rare birds were found when the plane refuelled in Australia.
