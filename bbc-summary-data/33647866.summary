Tins of fuel were set alight outside the Doherty family's front door causing extensive damage to the front of the house on Thursday.
The police have appealed for information.
Jeanette Doherty said she was told by police that the fire was set alight deliberately.
"I turned off the lights in the living room and I saw the flames going up the outside window and I shouted to Eugene [her husband]," said Jeanette.
"You couldn't see anything, it was just flames. I was terrified, never was as terrified in my life and all I could think about was the wean [young child] upstairs."
"A few empty tins of fuel and a lot of fire lighters about. The police think it was maybe diesel which is harder to light so that's why there's six or seven or maybe more fire lighters.
"They meant to hurt or kill they definitely did.
"I can't understand who would do it and why they would do it, put our lives at risk. I just don't know how they can live with themselves.
Ch Insp Catherine Magee said: "The victims extinguished the fire with water before the police or firefighters arrived and damage has been caused to the house. We are lucky no one was injured.."
