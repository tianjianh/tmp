Nearly 6,000 patients will be left to "fend for themselves" without a GP when a Brighton surgery closes next February, councillors have warned.

Councillor Gill Mitchell said the closure of Eaton Place Surgery will affect care and called on NHS England to open new premises in the area.
NHS England said Ms Mitchell was wrong and 15 other local surgeries were "ready to welcome patients".
The surgery is due to shut when the practice's two partners retire.
Patients registered at the surgery are worried about having to travel further to find a new GP, according to Ms Mitchell.
"They would like a GP practice in their neighbourhood in Kemptown and that really is not too much to ask", she said.
Local MP Simon Kirby has also written to NHS England to voice concerns about the closure of the surgery, which is based in a district of Brighton.
A spokeswoman for NHS England said it had addressed the points made by Mr Kirby and was working to help those patients affected.
"The only way we can guarantee patients continued access to care after this date is to ask them to re-register with one of the 15 other surgeries located nearest to Eaton Place Surgery," she said.
She added that the 15 surgeries had the capacity to take on all patients affected by the closure and six of them were based within a mile of Eaton Place.
However, Dr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association (BMA) warned that the closure will increase pressure on surgeries in the area.
"Those practices will end up picking up more patients and they will not necessarily have the resources to be able to take on more GPs", he said.
Patients registered with Eaton Place Surgery are due to receive a letter from NHS England with further information about registering with a new doctor.
