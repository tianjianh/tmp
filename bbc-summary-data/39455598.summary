[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vinisha Ajanraj, 30, was seriously hurt when she was hit by a car outside the shop on London Road, Leigh-on-Sea, on Monday.
The couple's unborn baby was not harmed, but Mrs Ajanraj may not fully recover from her injuries for a year.
Her husband Thangarasa said it was an "extremely difficult" situation.
The 36-year old, who also has a son, aged two, with his wife, said he can not believe what has happened.
"I can't control my feelings. She's crying. I'm crying. My son can't find out. I can't tell my son about her injuries. It's a very bad time," he said.
"I plan to sell it [the shop]. I have to look after my kids, and my wife, and I can't do everything."
He said the sale of the shop would allow him to look after his wife when she leaves hospital, as well as looking after the new baby and his two-year-old son.
Mrs Ajanraj, who is seven months pregnant with a girl, was working by herself on Monday in The Turnpike shop at about 17:00 BST when three men came inside.
She challenged one man about a bank card but he left the shop, pursued by Mrs Ajanraj, who was then hit by a car.
She is having surgery on a fractured cheekbone at the Royal London Hospital. She also suffered a fractured shoulder.
It is not known how long she will be in hospital.
A 25-year-old man has appeared at Basildon Crown Court accused of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, fraud, dangerous driving and failing to stop.
