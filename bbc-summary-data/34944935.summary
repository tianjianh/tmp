Kevin Gartland, 24, twice discharged a sawn-off pump action shotgun at the room where Robyn Murtagh was sleeping.
Gartland earlier admitted endangering the life of Ms Murtagh, 24, by culpably and recklessly discharging a shotgun at a bedroom window on 13 July 2015.
He also pled guilty to having a prohibited weapon.
Ms Murtagh was woken in the early hours by a loud bang and saw glass on the floor before a second shot rang out seconds later.
Gartland had previously sent a text message to his ex-girlfriend stating: "I have nothing to lose now. No one gets away with playing with my emotions like this. I promise."
The judge Lord Jones said Ms Murtagh had been "very unnerved" by her ordeal and ordered Gartland be kept under supervision for a further two-year period.
Defence solicitor advocate Cameron Tait said Gartland now accepted his behaviour was "reckless and dangerous in the extreme".
He said: "He had been taking cocaine consistently for three days."
Broken glass was all over the floor of the bedroom at Miss Murtagh's flat in Gilmerton Dykes Avenue and on her bed following the shooting.
Ms Murtagh rolled out of the bed and crawled through to the hall before hearing Gartland make his getaway on a motorbike.
Gartland was later detained by armed police and the gun was found after he handed over a diagram to a visitor in Edinburgh's Saughton prison of where he had disposed of the weapon.
Gartland has twice been jailed for offences of serious violence.
Det Ch Insp Martin MacLean, of Police Scotland, said: "Kevin Gartland is an extremely dangerous individual and it was only by chance that his utterly reckless actions did not kill or cause serious injury to a member of the public.
"I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the tremendous police effort that led us to Gartland within a matter of hours and the invaluable assistance afforded to us by the local community.
"Today's sentence, and the investigation pursuant to it, sends a clear message that anyone involved in the criminal possession and discharge of firearms can be sure that the full spectrum of resources available to Police Scotland will be directed tirelessly against them to ensure they are arrested and brought before the courts."
