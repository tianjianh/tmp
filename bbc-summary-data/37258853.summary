Two men have already appeared in court in Pakistan in connection with Ms Shahid's death.
Her former husband, Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel, is accused of murder and is reported to have confessed to strangling her with her scarf, according to local police.
Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid, her father, is being held as an accessory to her murder.
Both have been remanded until 5 September.
Ms Shahid had been visiting family in the village of Pandori when she died and her relatives initially claimed she had suffered a heart attack.
Her second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazim, believes she was the victim of a so-called honour killing as her family did not approve of their marriage.
A post-mortem examination confirmed she died as a result of being strangled.
