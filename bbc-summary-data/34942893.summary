It comes after the force released CCTV images last week of two men officers believe might be able to help with their inquiries.
Det Con Mark Seymour, of Police Scotland, said: "We continue to pursue various lines of inquiry in relation to this theft and remain keen to speak to the two men pictured in the CCTV footage we recently provided.
"We have now issued images of the coins in the hope someone will recognise them and come forward to tell us where they can be found.
"If you have any information relevant to this investigation then please contact police immediately."
