[SN]TITLE[SN]
Anglesey's South Stack lighthouse lease to end

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The lease on one of Wales most well-known landmarks - South Stack Lighthouse on Anglesey - is being put up for grabs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council has given notice that it will surrender its lease on the lighthouse at the end of March 2017.
The authority hopes community groups or businesses will take over running tours of the lighthouse.
It is part of moves to make almost Â£3m of budget savings next year.
The  91ft (28m) lighthouse was built just off Holy Island in 1809 and is visible for 28 miles out to sea.
Access to the whitewashed buildings and its tower also requires some effort - with 400 steps down onto the South Stack island outcrop itself.
While the lighthouse building itself is owned by Trinity House, visits to see the lighthouse are operated through the council.
Anglesey council's executive committee met on Monday to discuss the future of some of its heritage sites.
It is estimated releasing the lighthouse lease would save the authority about Â£13,000 in running costs.
Members heard groups are also being sought to take over the operation of:
The council's head of learning, Delyth Molyneux told the committee that they had received expressions of interest.
"We are in a much better position than we were some months ago," she said.
"There has been definite progress."
The committee will receive an update on 20 March.
