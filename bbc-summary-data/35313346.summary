Andrew Savage, 47, of no fixed address, killed Glen Hack, 41, at the property in Victoria Road, Farnham, last July. Mr Hack suffered multiple injuries.
He was found guilty at Guildford Crown Court earlier this week.
Co-defendant Gareth Wheeler, 46, of Victoria Road, Farnham, was jailed for 15 months after pleading guilty to assisting an offender.
Savage was told he would serve a minimum of 22 years in jail.
Surrey Police said jurors were told that Savage had recently struck-up a casual friendship with Mr Hack and was staying at his home.
The court heard Savage was also an alcoholic and a person of bad character who had convictions dating back 30 years including assault, theft and harassment.
Savage had carried out the murder in a drunken rage after Mr Hack refused to give him access to money to buy more alcohol, the court heard.
Det Insp Paddy Mayer said it was "a brutal attack on an innocent man who opened up his home to Savage because he knew he was homeless".
"His kindness was repaid with an act of complete savagery," he added.
When Mr Hack's family paid tribute to him last year, they described him as a warm and kind man who was a "free spirit".
