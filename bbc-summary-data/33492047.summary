Treasury's 'formal concern' over Stormont finances

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Treasury has told the Stormont administration that it is engaged in preparatory work to take control of the Northern Ireland Executive's finances.

First Minister Peter Robinson said the Treasury had indicated its willingness to intervene if Stormont does not stay within its budget.
He said "formal concern" was expressed in a letter to Stormont's finance minister from the Treasury.
Mr Robinson made the comments during an interview for the BBC.
The DUP leader said the chief secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands had written to Northern Ireland's Finance Minister Arlene Foster voicing concern about Stormont departments potentially breaching their spending controls.
Mr Robinson told the BBC that the letter gave "a very clear indication that they intended to take steps that preparatory work had already begun and that they would not allow us to breach those totals but would intervene".
He added:  "That indicates that the lifetime of the assembly is limited, unless those who are stalling in the process, the SDLP and Sinn FÃ©in, take their responsibilities seriously and deal with these issues.
"I can imagine as soon as there will be an intervention from the Treasury to tell us what we can spend and how much we can spend, we will have ministers who aren't prepared to play ball with that and the assembly collapses."
Mr Robinson held a private meeting with the prime minister on Thursday. He said the prime minister continued to be concerned that agreements reached last December had not been implemented.
The Northern Ireland parties had agreed a deal on Westminster's welfare reform measures in the Stormont House Agreement last December.
However, Sinn FÃ©in withdrew its support in March.
Since the striking of the agreement, Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Green Party have opposed plans to implement the changes.
They have argued that the measures will hit the most vulnerable members of society.
But supporters of the plan have warned that failure to change the benefits system will mean the executive cannot manage its budget, putting the future of the devolved government at risk.
Last month, Stormont's new budget bill passed its second stage, but the final stage is dependent on a deal on welfare reform.
