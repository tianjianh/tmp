Thieves have stolen a large amount of lead from a church roof in a Hampshire village.

The metal was stripped from the south transept roof of All Saints' Church, East Meon overnight on Thursday.
The damage to the roof left has left rainwater pouring into the main aisle of the church.
The Rev Jane Ball said: "I feel devastated. Inside it's raining as much as it is outside. Pews and wood flooring are just getting wet."
Ms Ball said a baptism on Sunday would go ahead as planned.
