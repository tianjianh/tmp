Supporters have been complaining to the club about the birds swooping down on people in the stands during games.
In a statement on its website, Aberdeen FC said it was an ongoing issue that it has been trying to tackle.
While gulls are discouraged from setting up home at Pittodrie, AFC said it could not control nearby nest sites.
For a number of years, nests and eggs found at the football ground have been destroyed under licence.
A hawk is flown at the football ground during the week and an hour before the stadium's doors open on match days.
But Aberdeen said the bird of prey could not be flown during games.
The club said: "Currently Aberdeen FC has no nesting in and around the actual stadium buildings, however, we cannot control this out with our boundary and birds are nesting in and around the flats around the stadium.
"Seagulls are very intelligent birds and will always gather where a large crowd of people are and where food is consumed so we would urge all fans to take care and use the bins provided for unwanted food which will assist in controlling the seagulls."
It added: "Aberdeen FC will continue to do all we can to combat this issue and ensure the match-day experience is a positive one for Dons supporters."
