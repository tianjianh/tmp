The 20-year-old was shot in Malvern Road in Kilburn, north-west London, on Friday night and later pronounced dead at the scene.
It is believed she was standing with a group when they were "approached by a number of suspects possibly on pedal cycles", a Met Police spokesman said.
A shot was fired at the group and the woman was killed.
The victim's family has been notified and a post-mortem examination is due to take place later.
