[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England captain Eoin Morgan says his side's "huge amount of character and talent" will stand them in good stead in the World Twenty20 semi-finals.

They reached the last four with a tense 10-run win over Sri Lanka in Delhi.
Following Jos Buttler's 66 from 37 balls, Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes restricted the defending champions to 11 runs from the last two overs.
"As a unit we can be quite strong and that's important confidence-wise to take into a semi-final," said Morgan.
"We've shown different strengths game on game. We're a reasonably good chasing side and on top of that we show a lot of character."
England are likely to face Group 2 winners New Zealand in the semi-finals on Wednesday in Delhi, unless West Indies lose heavily to Afghanistan on Sunday.
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews hit five sixes in an unbeaten 54-ball 73 to drag his side within sight of victory but Joe Root's spectacular diving catch to dismiss Dasun Shanaka when they needed 17 from 10 balls proved crucial.
"We certainly like to make it interesting, not through choice," added a relieved Morgan.
"Given the position we were in after the first fix or six overs [of the Sri Lanka innings], we would have liked to have finished it off a little bit earlier.
"Going from Wednesday's performance against Afghanistan to today's performance against Sri Lanka, I think we've made a significant improvement."
Probable last-four opponents New Zealand completed a 100% winning record by defeating Bangladesh in Kolkata on Saturday but Morgan says England will embrace the challenge.
"We won't get too far ahead of ourselves. We know anything can happen but having put ourselves in this position, it gives us a little bit of freedom to go out and express ourselves as much as we can," he said.
England fast bowler Stuart Broad: "Great entertainment. So tense, loved it - Jos Buttler is the man."
Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff: "Maybe you'll start to believe me now, England to win the WT20."
Former England captain Michael Vaughan: "Great, great game. No question England have been the entertainers in this tournament. Never know what's going to happen."
Former England captain Alec Stewart: "For those that continually doubt Chris Jordan he again showed his value bowling the tough overs."
England wicketkeeper-batsman Sam Billings: "Geez.... win's a win. On we go, Jos Buttler showing the freak he is yet again! Class... come on."
England women's wicketkeeper-batter Sarah Taylor: "How can you not love this game. T20 at its very best. Hats off to Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes at the end. Great win."
