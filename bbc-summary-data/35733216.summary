Sean Clohessy almost gave Orient a second-half lead but his effort on towards what seemed to be an open goal was blocked by Joe Skarz, before Johnny Mullins blocked the follow-up shot.
Moments later, Jobi McAnuff put Orient ahead with a low right-footed shot.
Orient ended with 10 men when Mathieu Baudry was sent off in stoppage time for a late challenge on Kemar Roofe.
The result sees second-placed Oxford fall further behind League Two leaders Northampton Town, who now lead by 14 points, while Orient are inside the play-off places by a point.

Leyton Orient player-manager Kevin Nolan told BBC Radio London: "I asked the lads for a reaction all week and to be fair, they've been absolutely fantastic.
"The training and everything has been spot on and they've matched it with the performance today.
"It could have been three or four. That's where we've now got to get that ruthlessness going when we're away from home and carving those chances out."
