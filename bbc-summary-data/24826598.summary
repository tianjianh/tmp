The 18-time champion jockey from Moneyglass, County Antrim, has been honoured with 20 Lester Awards, more than any other jockey past or present.  He has ridden over 13,000 races, equivalent of 31,000 miles or 1.25 times around the earth.
Begins riding at the age of eight when his dad takes him to a local horse riding school in County Antrim. A year later, he gets his first pony, which he names Seven Up "because that was the number of times she would drop (me) in one session".
Records his first career win with Legal Steps at the age of 17 at Thurles while serving as an apprentice at Jim Bolger's flat yard in Coolcullen, Ireland.
Moves to England in order to compete nationally.

Equals the record of five winners (record shared with Fred Winter, Jamie Osborne and Barry Geraghty).
Records his 1,000th win in a meet at Cheltenham. By the end of the decade, McCoy has set a new National Hunt record of 253 for the number of winners in a season.

Awarded OBE in Birthday Honours for his services to horseracing.
Voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year ahead of darts player Phil Taylor and heptathlete Jessica Ennis - the first jockey ever to be given the award.

This year's Grand National is not so successful for McCoy, as his horse Synchronised falls at the notorious Becher's Brook on the circuit.  Synchronised suffers a leg fracture and dies of his injuries.
McCoy makes a delayed start to the 2013/14 season after falling from Quantitativeeasing during Cheltenham's end of season meeting.  He suffers broken ribs in the fall but returns to action a month later at Ludlow.
McCoy seals his 4,000th career win.
