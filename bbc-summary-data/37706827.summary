Regulator clears Kelvin MacKenzie after hijab article complaints

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A complaint from a Channel 4 presenter about a column written in The Sun by Kelvin MacKenzie has not been upheld.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fatima Manji complained after the newspaper's former editor criticised Channel 4 for allowing a reporter wearing a hijab to report on the aftermath of the Nice terror attacks.
More than 1,700 other people also complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso).
But in its ruling, Ipso said Mr MacKenzie was "entitled to express" his views.
"The article did not include a prejudicial or pejorative reference to the complainant on the grounds of religion," the ruling said.
"While the columnist's opinion was undoubtedly offensive to the complainant, and to others, these were views he had been entitled to express.
"The article did refer to the complainant but it did so to explain what triggered the discussion about a legitimate subject of debate: whether newsreaders should be allowed to wear religious symbols."
Mr MacKenzie has previously defended his "reasonable" criticism of Channel 4 News, arguing the hijab was a "religious statement" and questioning whether a Christian would be able to wear a cross prominently on television.
Ms Manji complained to Ipso that the article had breached clause one (accuracy), clause three (harassment) and clause 12 (discrimination).
But in its ruling, published on Wednesday, Ipso said Mr MacKenzie "was permitted to identify what prompted his discussion, rather than merely raising it in the abstract".
"Furthermore he was entitled to express his view that, in the context of a terrorist act which had been carried out ostensibly in the name of Islam, it was inappropriate for a person wearing Islamic dress to present coverage of the story."
In response, Ben de Pear, editor of Channel 4 News, said he was "dismayed" by the ruling.
"Whilst we agree that freedom of expression is a fundamental right, we do not believe that it should be used as a licence to incite or discriminate," he said.
"His inflammatory comments on Fatima Manji's professional status, which were widely condemned, and his attempts to equate the wearing of a hijab with support for terrorism, have no place in a properly informed and tolerant society.
"At Channel 4 News we employ reporters based on their journalistic skills, not their ethnicity. We see no reason why a Muslim journalist should be prevented from covering any story and Fatima will continue to report and present the news on the issues of the day with impartiality and depth."
He added that the programme was grateful for the support shown to Ms Manji during "this difficult time".
