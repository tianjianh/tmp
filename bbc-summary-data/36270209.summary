Reality Check: Does the EU subsidise Spanish bullfighting?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uxbridge MP Boris Johnson popped up on BBC Breakfast this morning to say that more money could be spent on science and the NHS, instead of Greek tobacco or bullfighting, if the UK left the EU.

The claim: £110m a year of EU agricultural subsidies go to fund Spanish bullfighting.
Reality check verdict: Not any more. Spending EU agricultural funds for the purpose of Spanish bullfighting is specifically prohibited.
"£110m a year of CAP money goes on Spanish bullfighting for heaven's sake," the former Mayor of London said.
Spanish farmers receive direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to subsidise food production and support sustainable practices.
A 2013 report by Green MEPs on bullfighting in Spain found that around €130m (£103m) a year from EU funds was being used to subsidise the industry.
But in October 2015, MEPs voted for an amendment to the EU budget that stated that agricultural payments should not be made to land being used for the rearing of bulls for bullfighting.
Such funding "is a clear violation of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes", it noted.
But, there's nothing to stop Spanish farmers raising bulls and then selling them on to others who may or not use them for bullfighting.
