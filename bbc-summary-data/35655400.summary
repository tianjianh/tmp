US election 2016: What makes Super Tuesday so super?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After Donald Trump's resounding win in Nevada, the candidates are already shifting their focus to 1 March or Super Tuesday - a flood of primaries squeezed into a single day. Super Tuesday can be a day of reckoning for campaigns - exposing candidates who can't complete on the national stage and instantly catapulting others to the nomination.

Super Tuesday was developed in 1988 to combat the so-called "Iowa syndrome." Iowa, which votes first in the presidential race, has been criticised for not being representative of the American electorate. It's a small state and candidates often spend months campaigning there. Dedicated candidates with few resources - such as Rick Santorum in 2012 - have been known to excel there. So Super Tuesday is meant to introduce the candidates to the rigours (and the costs) of running a national campaign - creating a sink-or-swim moment for campaigns.
In the past, Super Tuesday has been known to be decisive. Mitt Romney essentially secured the Republican nomination after his Super Tuesday wins in 2012. This year, the result will not be as clear cut. Because many of the states on 1 March allot delegates proportionally, look for some candidates like Marco Rubio and John Kasich to wait until 15 March when large winner-take-all states such as Florida and Ohio vote. That said, the campaign of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has privately said it is likely to end his run on Super Tuesday. He has underperformed in the first four Republican contests and many insiders have wondered why he has not called it quits already.
On the Democratic side, Mr Sanders - once thought of as a protest candidate to advance the issue of income inequity - is likely to revert to that status and stay in the race even if Mrs Clinton wins big.
