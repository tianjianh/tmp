Police have made an arrest following a stand-off in Norwich that lasted eight hours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were called to Argyle Street at 08:26 GMT after reports of a man making threats with a knife.
"The man moved into a nearby property where negotiators had resolved the situation by 16:30," police said.
Norwich City's ground is about 400m from the scene but the Premier League match against Arsenal, which kicked off at 16:15, was unaffected.
Norfolk Police negotiators succeeded in persuading the man to surrender and the police units were stood down, a spokesman said.
He had been in a distressed state before locking himself into the property, where officers later recovered a knife and other bladed weapons, he added.
Ch Supt Nick Davison said: "The area around the property was cordoned off for the safety of all involved, including local residents."
The force said a man, aged in his 40s, was arrested on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon and affray.
