Laceby Crash: Cockburn family blame North East Lincolnshire Council for road rut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relatives of a family killed in a car crash claim a rut in the road was to blame.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Angela and David Cockburn, 48 and 49, their daughters Carley Ann, 21, Bethany, 18, and Bethany's one-year-old daughter Lacie, died on the A18 near Grimsby in April 2013.
Their family are now criticising North East Lincolnshire Council for not fixing the rut after an accident months earlier.
The council said it could not comment.
An inquest is due to be held next year and the council said it will review the coroner's findings.
Angela's sister Ann Walker said the family, from Ouston in County Durham, were travelling to Skegness for a dance competition when their car crashed into a lorry in Laceby.
Mrs Walker said the road was the "main concern" when another woman crashed after hitting the same ditch in January 2013.
She said: "The road was never repaired and subsequently my family paid the ultimate price."
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has already said it will not be bringing any criminal charges but the Cockburn's are appealing that decision.
Son Dean Cockburn, who called his father David his best friend, said they were told it was not in the public's interest for the CPS to take the case further.
