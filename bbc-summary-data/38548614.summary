Two men with scarves across their faces knocked on the victim's door in Baldwin Road, Minster, on the Isle of Sheppey, just after 22:00 GMT on Saturday.
They ushered him into an upstairs bedroom, threatening him and demanding money. One had a knife and the man suffered a cut to his head and hand.
The suspects also stole two sets of car keys before running out of the house.
