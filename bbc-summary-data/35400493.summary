£6m for A1079 roundabouts as dual carriageway scheme shelved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme to upgrade part of the A1079 into dual carriageway has been postponed but £6.3m is to be spent on improving two roundabouts on the route.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The money would have been used on a mile of the Hull to York road between Wilberfoss and Barmby Moor.
But surveys showed it would cost "significantly more than originally anticipated", East Riding of Yorkshire Council said.
The £6.3m will be used to relieve congestion at two roundabouts.
They are well known bottlenecks with regular queues and congestion, the council said.
The work will take place at Killingwoldgraves roundabout, the junction of the A1079, A1174, A1035, and at Dunswell roundabout linking the A1079, A1174 and the A1033.
The money was given to the council by the York, North Yorkshire and East Riding Local Enterprise Partnership.
