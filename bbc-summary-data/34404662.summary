But Belgian-born Dutchman Max Verstappen was unable to drive a car legally on his own in either country.
That all changed on Wednesday when the youngster turned 18 and passed his driving test at the first attempt.
Despite having competed in 14 grands prix since his debut in Australia in March, Verstappen admitted to feeling the pressure during his test.
"It's a relief," said the Toro Rosso driver, who finished ninth in Japan on Sunday and had only started driving lessons a week ago. "I was a bit nervous to make mistakes, but the exam went well."
A bonus of turning 18 is that Verstappen will now be able to drink the champagne if he ever makes it onto the podium.
