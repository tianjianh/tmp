Noel Kinsey: Former Wales forward dies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Wales forward Noel Kinsey has died at the age of 91.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The inside right from Treorchy in south Wales won seven caps for his country and played professionally for Norwich City, Birmingham City and Port Vale.
Kinsey scored in the 1956 FA Cup final for Birmingham as the Blues lost 3-1 to Manchester City.
The match is best remembered for the bravery of Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who played on with a broken neck suffered in a collision.
Kinsey played youth football for Cardiff City, and was appointed player-coach at Vale in 1960 before moving on to King's Lynn and Lowestoft Town.
