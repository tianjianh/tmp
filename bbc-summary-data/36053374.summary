Shaheen Jafargholi, 19, from Swansea, will play Shakil Kazemi, the son of Bonnie Langford's character Carmel Kazemi.
He shot to fame at the age of 12 when he sang a rendition of The Jackson 5's Who's Lovin' You on ITV's variety series in 2009.
He also sang at Michael Jackson's memorial service in Los Angeles.
Jackson had seen Jafargholi's performance on Britains' Got Talent and lined him up as a support act for his ill-fated This Is It tour. He died weeks later.
In EastEnders, Jafargholi will play the 15-year-old brother of Kush (Davood Ghadami).
Known as Shaki by his friends and family, and described as a "cheeky teenager", he arrives in Albert Square determined to reunite his divorced parents.
He said: "I'm so excited to be joining the show.
"I've been a fan since I was a little kid so to now be a part of something so iconic is an honour. I'm also really excited to be working with a legend such as Bonnie Langford."
