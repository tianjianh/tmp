A County Tyrone missionary who was shot by bandits in Africa plans to return to fight for justice for a man she said is "falsely accused".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maud Kells, who is 75 and from Cookstown, was shot outside her home in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
She narrowly missed death or paralysis after the bullet hit her in the shoulder.
Ms Kells said she wants to help free a man who has been imprisoned for involvement in the crime.
"There are two of our Christians who are falsely accused of being involved in my shooting incident and they were completely innocent," said Ms Kells.
Ms Kells said she hopes to go back to the town of Mulita at the end of the year and help one of the men who remains in prison.
"I'd really like to go out and get him released."
Ms Kells also said she would like to meet with those who carried out the shooting.
"I did feel that they should be arrested, they should get the punishment that's due to them but I would love to see them really regret it, repent and ask for forgiveness.
"I can honestly say I feel sorry for him, he must have a dreadful conscience.
"I would meet him and I would challenge him and find out his motives."
