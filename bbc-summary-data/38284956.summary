Saracens: Mark McCall says English clubs disadvantaged by Test timing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall has described the timing of England's Test against Australia as "ludicrous".

England's final autumn international was on 3 December, a week later than those of the other European nations.
And Eddie Jones' men immediately returned to their clubs to prepare for this weekend's Champions Cup action.
"You're asking players to play in the Champions Cup the weekend after they've played Australia. It's not fair on the Premiership clubs," said McCall.
"For me it's ludicrous that the fourth international shouldn't be at the start of the window rather than the end. I don't think it's right that you continuously have to ask them to back up.
"Ireland, Scotland and Wales were able to rest players and you've maybe seen that in some of the other results this weekend - the wins by Munster and Leinster."
Munster thumped Leicester 38-0, while Leinster came away from Northampton with a 37-10 victory.
Saracens beat Sale 50-3, with England internationals George Kruis, Mako Vunipola, Jamie George and Owen Farrell all involved.
