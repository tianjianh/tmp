New Zealand v Wales: Luke Charteris and Rhys Patchell start for Warren Gatland's side

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales have made two changes to the side that lost the first Test against New Zealand for Saturday's game against the world champions in Wellington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lock Luke Charteris replaces Bradley Davies and Rhys Patchell starts at full-back after George North's injury, with Liam Williams moving to the wing.
Wales, beaten 39-21 by New Zealand at Eden Park, are looking for a first win over the All Blacks since 1953.
Warren Gatland's side were thrashed 40-7 by the Chiefs on Tuesday.
Wales have lost 27 consecutive games against New Zealand and are looking to beat Steve Hansen's side for the first time on their own soil.
Captain Sam Warburton and second-row Charteris are the only players to retain their places from Tuesday's rout by the Chiefs.
Gatland said his fringe players missed a chance to impress in that game and wings Tom James and Eli Walker have both been overlooked for the Test match, with Patchell preferred in the back three.
It is the first time the Wales coach has picked the Scarlets' back with Patchell's previous two caps coming on the 2013 tour to Japan when Robin McBryde and Shaun Edwards were in caretaker charge.
Charteris is the only change in the forward pack as he comes in alongside Alun Wyn Jones in the second-row.
Davies takes Jake Ball's place on the bench after the Scarlets lock limped off the pitch in Hamilton.
Ellis Jenkins pulled out of the game against the Super Rugby side with a tight thigh but he has recovered to feature among the replacements.
Ross Moriarty was another late withdrawal at the FMG Stadium Waikato due to soreness, but he too is on the bench in Wellington.
Gareth Anscombe, who has been nursing a hip injury sustained in the first Test, is replaced by Rhys Priestland on the sidelines.
Gatland commented: "It is important we go out on Saturday with the confidence to play for 80 minutes in what will be another huge Test match.
"We kept the ball and played well for periods of the first Test and we need to convert that to the full 80.
"It will be another huge occasion, in a packed out stadium in Wellington and we are determined to build on our first Test performance."
New Zealand have recalled World Cup-winning lock Sam Whitelock for the second Test after a hamstring injury.
The All Blacks have also shuffled their back three, with Israel Dagg in at full-back and Ben Smith moving to left wing with Julian Savea omitted.
