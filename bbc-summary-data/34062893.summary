India halts Italy marines trial after UN tribunal order

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
India's Supreme Court has halted all legal proceedings in the case of two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen in 2012.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A UN-linked tribunal asked India to suspend its court case, pending international arbitration.
The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea also rejected Italy's request for the marines to be freed while they await the final ruling.
The case has led to a bitter diplomatic row between Delhi and Rome.
The Supreme Court has adjourned the case until the third week of January.
The tribunal said that in addition to halting all current court proceedings, both countries should "refrain from initiating new ones which might aggravate or extend the dispute".
Both sides should submit a report to the tribunal by 24 September ahead of hearings, it added.
Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone face murder charges and are on bail awaiting trial.
Mr Girone is currently staying in the Italian embassy in Delhi, while India's Supreme Court has allowed Mr Latorre to temporarily return to Italy on health grounds.
The marines were guarding an Italian oil tanker when they opened fire, killing two men off the Kerala coast in South India. The marines said they mistook the fishermen for pirates.
Italy says that as the shooting took place in international waters, the men should be tried in Italy.
However, India wants the men tried in an Indian court. It has ruled out the possibility of the death penalty.
