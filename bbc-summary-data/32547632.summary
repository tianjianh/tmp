[SN]TITLE[SN]
The battle for Warwick and Leamington

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There's a real battle going on between the Conservatives and Labour for the seat of Warwick and Leamington, which switched from red to blue back in 2010.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Now Labour's fighting to take it back.
Defending his title in the political ring is Conservative Chris White, who had a majority of 3,513, out of an electorate of 67,800.
"This is a very important seat to me as a local resident," he said.
"It is a battleground, I've been fighting not just for the last four weeks, not just since Christmas, but for a long time to make sure that I'm promoting Warwick & Leamington, making sure it's on the map."
Battling to take the seat back into Labour's hands meanwhile is Lynette Kelly who will need to reverse an 8.8% swing experienced by the party last time around.
"I am the kind of person who if they see something that needs doing I get up and try and find out how we can make it happen," she said.
"I'm more the kind of person who if something needs fixing says pass me the screw driver, let's fix it. It will bring a different approach to the constituency."
The seat has changed hands twice since 1997, before which it had been held by the Conservatives since 1910, with MPs such as Sir Anthony Eden and Sir Dudley Smith.
Like many others across the country it went to Labour in 1997 as Tony Blair was swept into office. And Labour fancy their chances here once again.
Two young contenders stand in their way, 21-year-old Liberal Democrat Haseeb Arif and 22-year-old Azzees Minott for the Greens.
"A lot of young people, particularly a lot of my friends too are quite disengaged with politics and it's one of my main reasons for being involved in politics is trying to get more people inspired to get involved," Mr Arif said.
Ms Minott said 2015 was a chance for change.
"I would really encourage those who aren't happy with the current politics that we've had, to vote for change to vote for something they really believe in that can bring about hope, and the Green party is that person and that political party that will bring about that hope," she said.
Meanwhile UKIP's man is Alastair MacBrayne, who will be hoping to claim seats off both the Conservatives and Labour and better the 926 votes his party polled last time around.
"Things have gone wrong with the political establishment. I'm for leaving the EU through a referendum so we can control our immigration, because immigration at the moment is a bad thing cause it's got out of control," he said.
So, five candidates to choose from in Warwick and Leamington, the clock is ticking down as the fight continues for every vote on 7 May.
However, we'll have to wait a little longer to find out who's won as the count for Warwick and Leamington doesn't get underway until 10:00 BST on the 8 May, so the seat could be one of the last in the country to declare.
