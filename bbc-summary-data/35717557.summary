Davis Cup: Dan Evans replaces Kyle Edmund for Great Britain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dan Evans has replaced the injured Kyle Edmund in the Great Britain team that will begin their defence of the Davis Cup against Japan on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edmund, who was expected to play two singles rubbers, injured his back during practice in Birmingham.
His absence means Evans, 25, features in the GB team alongside Andy Murray, Jamie Murray and Dominic Inglot.
On Friday, Evans will play world number six Kei Nishikori, whom he beat in the first round of the 2013 US Open.
British number one Murray will kick off the tie against world number 87 Taro Daniel.
If Britain beat Japan they will face either Kazakhstan or world number one Novak Djokovic's Serbia.
Russell Fuller - BBC Radio 5 live tennis correspondent
Davis Cup captain Leon Smith waited until the very last moment to confirm Dan Evans' place in the line-up.  He said it was a 'difficult call, but the right call' as Kyle Edmund's slight back injury was just too much of a risk.
It's another cruel slice of luck for Edmund - who also missed last year's semi-final after rolling an ankle in practice - but Evans will relish the opportunity to perform on a hard, indoor court in his home city.
Friday
Andy Murray v Taro Daniel
Dan Evans v Kei Nishikori
Saturday doubles
Dominic Inglot & Jamie Murray v Yoshihito Nishioka & Yasutaka Uchiyama
Sunday
Andy Murray v Kei Nishikori
Dan Evans v Taro Daniel
