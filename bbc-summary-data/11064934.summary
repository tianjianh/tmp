A pony club which was planning to celebrate its 80th birthday next year fears it will be homeless instead.

The field occupied by Mid Surrey Pony Club in Ebbisham Lane, Walton on the Hill, is being sold when its lease expires in April 2011.
The club has built a barn, catering facilities and cross country course on the site, which it says could not be replicated quickly or easily elsewhere.
It is now hoping to raise Â£480,000 to buy the field from the farmer.
The club, which has 200 members, has been on its present site for 23 years, but has historic links with Walton on the Hill and the surrounding area.
Many past members now have children and grandchildren at the club.
"We have developed the site over the years to be used by the larger community," Pony Club district commissioner Gina Kitchener said.
"The equestrian community in Surrey and the bordering counties come to our shows and we use it for our training.
"Local livery yards who have flourished because of our position and the supporting equestrian community would lose out if we weren't there."
