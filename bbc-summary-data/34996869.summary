Dawson was one of four players drafted into the Lions' squad this week for the T20 tour in the United Arab Emirates.
The 25-year-old was already part of the England Performance Programme in Dubai, before he was added to the 16-man squad to face both UAE and Pakistan A.
"It's a brilliant environment to work in," he told BBC Radio Solent.
Dawson's Hampshire team-mate James Vince leads the squad, which plays a warm-up match against the UAE on Friday before five T20 matches against Pakistan A.
Vettori, who retired from international cricket after this year's World Cup, has been working with the squad since Sunday.
"It's great to have coaches like him with so much experience to offer," slow left-armer Dawson said.
"It's exciting to speak to him, as well as Andy Flower and Graham Thorpe, who have played so much cricket in these conditions, and pick their brains.
"Speaking to Daniel about how you set up your four overs in a T20 match has been great to listen to."
Dawson, who returned to Hampshire's team last season after a loan spell at Essex, is hoping to play in the majority of the series.
"I've been hitting the ball well having scored 44 in a practice match last week," he said.
"This environment has been great in helping to bridge the gap between county cricket and international cricket and it's exciting learning new things."
