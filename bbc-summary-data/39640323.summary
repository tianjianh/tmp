Apparat will play a DJ set at Skye Live in September.
Other headline acts are Mercury Prize nominee Django Django and Irish DJ Mano Le Tough, whose genre is described as apocalyptic calypso house.
This year's Skye Live will be held at a new venue, moving half a mile from playing fields in Portree to The Lump.
The site is used for Skye's Highland games.
Taking place on 22 and 23 September, the festival is to feature more than 20 acts.
Breaking Bad, a crime drama starring Bryan Cranston, ran in the US between 2008 and 2013 and was also shown in the UK.
