Consumers are more "vulnerable to scams" said University of Surrey security expert Prof Alan Woodward.
Scams involving card fraud or financial details being stolen are more likely to occur he said.
Prof Woodward explained the most common hoaxes during the holiday period.
Part of the reason why online Christmas shoppers are at risk is because consumers' are less cautious during the holiday season.
"Their guard is down slightly," Prof Woodward said.
"I might be looking for an unusual present for my wife so I might go to a website I'm not familiar with and I'll put my credit card details into it," he said.
"I know the ones that I can trust. But I might take that extra risk because it's an unusual present or whatever.
"There's more likelihood of that financial information being stolen at this time of year."
Consumers can be susceptible to fraud linked with "bargains" he said.
"You can get something that pops in from some retailer with some sort of voucher in it, 'just click on here for some special offer,'" Prof Woodward said.
"You have to remember that most malware, most viruses and Trojans appear on your machine because you inadvertently invite them.
"You've got to click on a link somewhere, that can be a link in an email or a link on a website, but it's a link on a website and you get rather more than you bargain for.
"So along with that voucher that comes down to your machine there comes a whole load of other things."
There are peak periods for scams during certain parts of the year Prof Woodward said.
"It gets worse straight after Christmas of course, in the sales," he said.
"The scams adapt with the seasons. They understand social engineering and understand human psychology very well.
"Typically there's something in this year's 'must have' toy. But somebody appears to be selling them cheap."
Consumers may be lured by the promise of free products or services.
"It might not be true cybercrime, but on the internet if you're not a paying customer you're typically the product," he said.
"They're doing it as a way of profiling you effectively as a marketing target.
"You're being sold somehow, and that is a concept we've all gotten used to."
Cybercriminals prey on consumers looking to save money.
"There's nothing really free," Prof Woodward said. "But criminals use that psychology to think up all sorts of things that might be free as well or at least very very cheap.
"You usually find out before it's too late that you've given away your credit card details or your personal information.
"Just exercise a great deal of caution. Think twice before you click."
Scams during the Christmas season can also extend to wifi connections, Prof Woodward said.
"The classic ones are you need a break, you go to a coffee shop, you log onto the wifi.
"You think you're logging onto the coffee shop's wifi and actually it's someone else in the coffee shop setting up their own wifi network," he said.
"They can consequently look at your details as it passes through their machine."
"I call it the ABC," Prof. Woodward said. "Assume nothing, Believe no one and Check everything."
He said the only way of consumers staying safe online is "by being cynical".
"A little bit of paranoia goes a long way online," he said.
"You've got to remember it's not the physical world, people can pretend to be all sorts of things that they're not in reality."
