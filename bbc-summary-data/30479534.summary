When Ruuxa was born, his mum couldn't take care of him properly and he was hand-reared by zoo keepers at San Diego Zoo Safari Park.
The zoo keepers there paired Ruuxa with Raina, a Rhodesian ridgeback, when she was around four weeks old, to be his life-long friend.
The video shows Ruuxa and Raina running around together, after Ruuxa recently had to have an operations on his legs.
Raina went with him to the hospital and sat with him after the operation, whilst he recovered.
Ruuxa has made a complete recovery and is happy to be running around again with his puppy pal.
