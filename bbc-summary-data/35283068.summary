[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jobs at risk at Brecon Beacons National Park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jobs are at risk at a national park as the authority running it looks to make savings of more than Â£200,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Brecon Beacons National Park Authority said it was reducing its budget by 5% because of Welsh government funding cuts.
Chief executive John Cook met staff to announce a consultation and outline proposals to lose eight jobs.
The authority will meet on 5 February to discuss the proposals and make its decision.
The measures include "significant rationalisation" of visitor centres, reducing office space and sharing IT service management with Pembrokeshire council.
