MacTavish Cup: Glenurquhart ease past rivals Lovat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glenurquhart atoned for defeat by Lovat in the 2013 and 2014 MacTavish Cup finals by ousting their local rivals 5-0 at Drumnadrochit in the tournament's quarter-finals.

James MacPherson bagged three of his side's five goals, completing his hat-trick in the final minute.
The other three ties were encounters between Marine Harvest Premiership and National Division sides and Newtonmore made heavy weather of that difference.
The holders had to come from behind to edge Caberfeidh 3-2 at the Eilan and Kilmallie similarly squeezed past visitors Inverness 1-0.
But, on a day of huge winning margins, the gulf showed at Beauly, where visitors Kinlochshiel handed out a 7-1 thrashing.
In the corresponding South Championship, the GCC Celtic Society Cup, there was a much bigger mismatch when Kyles demolished South League side Kilmory 18-0 after reaching double figures by half-time.
Glasgow Mid Argyll made their Premiership status show when they eclipsed Glenorchy 8-0 and Inveraray won 2-0 at Bute.
Conor Golabek and Neale Reid put Glenurquhart 2-0 up after only 10 minutes and MacPherson put the game beyond Lovat before half-time, going on to complete his treble.
It was much harder going for Newtonmore, who, by their own high standards, have had an uninspiring start to the season.
Glen MacKintosh put More ahead, but the game swung the other way after Colin MacLennan and Kevin Bartlett gave Cabers the lead.
However, that lead would only last nine minutes as MacKintosh completed a hat-trick for Newtonmore to prevail.
Ryan Stewart's early goal for Kilmallie, who had Duncan Rodger sent off, was enough to eliminate lower league Inverness.
Two each from John MacRae and Jordan Fraser and strikes from Keith MacRae, Oliver MacRae and Gordie MacDonald meant Kinlochshiel overwhelmed Beauly, whose consolation came from Jack MacDonald at 6-0.
Mismatches are relatively common in shinty, but, even by those standards, Kyles' 18-0 obliteration of Kilmory, who sit second-bottom of the league two tiers below them, was extreme.
Grant Irvine opened the scoring in the second minute and reached five before half-time, at which point Kyles led 10-0.
Roddy MacDonald and Gordon Whyte both knocked in four, Sandy MacKenzie two and Brandon Wilson, Martin MacFadyen and Thomas Whyte one each.
This made Glasgow Mid Argyll's 8-0 rout of Glenorchy seem rather tame despite a Craig Anderson hat-trick and a score apiece from Calum McLay, Duncan MacRae, Mark Bain, Gary Luke and Stuart Reid.
A Lewis Montgomery first-half double helped Inveraray through at the expense of Bute.
Skye, 4-1 winners away to Strathglass, and Fort William, 3-1 winners at home to Oban Celtic, now occupy the top two places in the Marine Harvest National Division.
