Paul Gascoigne on loneliness, sun beds, and pigeons

It's not often Russell Brand plays second fiddle as a guest on a TV show.

But when Paul Gascoigne appeared on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show, everyone listened, including Russell.
For all of Gazza's amazing moments on the pitch, he's also known for his long term battle with alcohol.
Despite visible signs of vulnerability over the years the former footballer seemed back to his old "daft as a brush" self.
Paul Gascoigne was massive news when you were growing up.
He picked up 57 England caps and was described as the most naturally gifted footballer of his generation.
Type "Paul Gascoigne Euro 96 wonder goal" in your search engine and you'll see for yourself.
He was also famed for cracking jokes and playing pranks on teammates.
He began the interview talking about how the tabloids have reported on his problems with addiction.
"(What) the press what they've been writing about it, it's scandalous.
"The press were actually outside my house and were taking pictures and they even wrote the next day that I was in rehab in Spain somewhere," he said.
"I wasn't, I was somewhere else. It was just the lies that keeps coming on."
He then remembered a conversation which led to him signing for Tottenham.
"I played against Spurs at Newcastle, scored two, and walking off the pitch Terry Venables (Spurs manager) said 'If you come and sign for me I guarantee you within 10 days you'll be playing for England'."
"That's all I wanted to do.
"Then I did in about eight games of coming to Tottenham, I got my chance to join with the England squad, which was unbelievable."
Then, almost inevitably, things took a funny turn when Gazza remembered trying to help out the Spurs groundsman.
"He [the groundsman] said 'I've got to get rid of these pigeons', I went 'OK then I'll help you... I'm not doing anything.'
"I walked across the pitch, and he says: 'There's one at the top of that roof'.
"I went: 'OK how'd I get up there?'"
Once he got up onto the roof things soon went, hilariously, wrong.
"I went over and I just heard [a cracking sound], and I fell through the roof, I landed 30 foot down on the steps!
"I said, gaffer, I don't think I can train today,"
"He said 'what for?'
"I said 'A pigeon did it.'"
The 47-year-old talked about turning down a deal to sign with Manchester United, in favour of a Tottenham package which included a house for his parents, as well a sun bed for his sister.
What he didn't bank on was getting a letter from Sir Alex Ferguson himself.
"It wasn't a good letter, I got cained.
"It was like 'I can't believe you turned down the biggest club [for a sun bed]'.
Gazza enjoyed a spell in Italy in the 1990s after Lazio paid more than Â£5m for the striker.
"The one team I wanted to play for was AC Milan, I eventually got to play them - away.
"I thought this is my chance to prove against them, how good I am."
"We got beaten 5-1, I think it's the only game I wanted to end quickly, I think I had one touch with about five minutes to go."
Gazza famously cried when he was booked during an England World Cup match - because it would have stopped him playing in the 1990 final.
And he admits he still gets tearful today, especially when it hits him afresh that his playing days are behind him.
"I was in tears to my sister and my dad last week, I just felt a little bit lonely.
"That's why I sometimes find it hard to go to games."
