The birth of an extremely rare animal called the Malayan tapir has given keepers at an animal reserve in Kent hope for the endangered species.

Nias, a boy, was born to mother Malacca and father Hunter at Port Lympne Reserve near Hythe.
Only about 1,500 to 2,000 Malayan tapirs are now thought to exist.
"Nias' birth is fantastic news not only for the future of Malayan tapirs but also for our dedicated hoofstock keepers," said director Adrian Harland.
"We're all really proud of our breeding success with this species."
The animals are usually found in south-east Asia, in the forests and rainforests in the area.
Hunting, illegal timber logging and deforestation are thought to be to blame for the decline in numbers.
The Malayan tapir or Tapirus indicus is also known as the Asian tapir and is the largest of the four tapir species. It is related to both the horse and the rhinoceros.
It is an "odd-toed" ungulate (meaning a hoofed mammal), having four toes on each front foot and three toes on each back foot. Each toe ends in a hoof.
The species has a typical gestation period of around 13 months and are born with white spots and stripes on black skin.
As they grow older they turn darker, helping to provide camouflage in the moonlit forests of their natural habitat.
Nias is the 11th Malayan tapir born at Port Lympne Reserve since 1989, giving it a reputation as one of Europe's most successful breeders of the animal.
