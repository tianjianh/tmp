Sussex business leaders in Gatwick second runway call

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Business leaders in Sussex have written to David Cameron urging him to back a new runway at Gatwick, despite the recent Airports Commission's decision.

The letter, signed by 26 business figures, said they were "disappointed" Sir Howard Davies's report recommended that Heathrow was expanded.
In July, the commission said a third runway at the west London airport would make the most money for the economy.
Heathrow said more than 270 business figures publically supported its plans.
The business leaders who signed the letter sent to the prime minister included 15 chamber of commerce presidents, the chairman of the Gatwick Diamond Imitative and regional representative of the Federation of Small Businesses in East Sussex.
They claim "flaws" in the commission's report include an under estimation of the number of passengers that would use Gatwick by 2024 and a lack of acknowledgement of how many business travellers use the airport.
The letter also argues that a second runway at Gatwick can be delivered at "lower cost and risk" than expansion at Heathrow.
"We will continue to press for you and your government to ultimately choose Gatwick, as we believe it to be the right choice for the country and for the region," it states.
A spokesman for Heathrow said business leaders from across the UK were firmly behind their plans for a third runway and wrote to the prime minister in July urging him to implement the commission's recommendation.
"The Airports Commission undertook a Â£20m, two-and-a-half year, detailed study of where the next runway should be in the UK," he added.
"It unanimously and unambiguously chose Heathrow because it is the only option that will connect the whole UK to global growth."
The final decision on which airport will get the new runway will be made by the government by the end of the year.
