Rodgers has been tipped for a summer return to the club he left in 2012 for Liverpool following his departure from Anfield in October.
Guidolin is contracted to the Swans for the remainder of the season.
"I'm not uncomfortable when people talk about Brendan Rogers or any other names that are mentioned," Guidolin said.
"It is no problem for me, I am focused on my job, so no problem."
Swansea and Wales defender Neil Taylor told BBC Wales Sport the players would welcome Rodgers' return.
Guidolin, himself linked to the Italy manager's role, reiterated that he wants to remain in charge of the club for next season.
"My future is not important at the moment, but sure I'd like to stay on after this season," he confirmed.
"If I have the possibility to work here in the future I am very happy, but I don't know."
Swansea opened up a 10-point advantage over the Premier League bottom three before the international break, thanks to their tense 1-0 victory over Aston Villa.
Guidolin believes another four points from their remaining seven fixtures will be enough to secure survival.
"I think another four points would be good enough to stay up but it's not finished yet," he said.
