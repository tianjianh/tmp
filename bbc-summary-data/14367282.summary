Two people arrested by British armed forces in Afghanistan have been freed, the Ministry of Defence has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"We can confirm ... that two individuals detained by ISAF forces in mid-July were released from detention in Kandahar on 29 July," an MoD spokesman said.
The pair, a man and a woman, are both reported to be British passport holders with dual nationalities.
They were detained in a joint operation by local forces and UK troops.
Reports at the time said the two had been picked up in the city of Herat and were believed to have gone to Afghanistan from the UK.
"Detention operations are a vital element of protecting UK, ISAF and Afghan forces and Afghan civilians from those who are assessed to pose a threat regardless of their nationality," the MoD said in a statement at the time of the arrest.
The Legal charity Reprieve, which campaigns for prisoners' rights, wrote to the Foreign Office to warn that they could face torture or the death penalty if transferred to Afghan custody.
A Home Office spokeswoman refused to comment on whether the pair would be allowed back to Britain.
The MoD statement said the two had been released "in accordance with UK detention policy."
