[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woman charged after child's remains found in London home

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has been remanded in custody charged with covering up the death of a one-year-old for more than a decade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victoria Gayle, 31, was charged with preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body after police discovered the remains of a baby at her home last month.
Ms Gayle, previously of West Hendon, north London, appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Monday afternoon.
She spoke only to confirm her name, address, and date of birth.
The court heard a post-mortem examination took place at Great Ormond Street Hospital on 2 June but the cause of death could not yet be determined.
Ms Gayle was also charged with perverting the course of justice.
She was not asked to submit a plea and will appear at Kingston Crown Court on 8 July.
The charge follows a case review of an investigation into a child who went missing in 2004, which was sparked by the death of another child at an address in Barnet in 2015.
The investigation led to the arrest of a 50-year-old woman in Fryent Crescent, West Hendon in north London.
A 52-year-old man was also arrested on suspicion of preventing a lawful and decent burial.
Both were bailed until mid-July.
