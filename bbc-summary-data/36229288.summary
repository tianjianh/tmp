The Wales international 26, helped Real overcome Manchester City on Wednesday to set up a Champions League final against Atletico Madrid on 28 May.
He has scored 19 goals in La Liga this season and provided 10 assists.
Zinedine Zidane's Real are one point behind La Liga leaders Barcelona with two games to go.
A Real statement said Bale has "a joint strain in his right knee".
Keeper Keylor Navas, 29, also misses Sunday's match at the Bernabeu after being "diagnosed with tendinitis in the Achilles tendon of his left foot".
Valencia are ninth in La Liga, 40 points behind third-placed Real.
Zidane says he will not look to rest Cristiano Ronaldo, who has 31 La Liga goals this season, before the Champions League final.
"I think he is going to play. I think he is in perfect shape," said Zidane on Saturday.
