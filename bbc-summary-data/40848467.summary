All of the celebrities have now been revealed for the new series of Strictly, which begins with a launch show on BBC One on 9 September.
So who will be testing their tango and practicing their Paso Doble at the end of the summer?
Read on to find out...
Alexandra Burke is the fifteenth and final celebrity to be announced as joining the Strictly 2017 line-up.
The singer, who is currently performing on stage in the West End in London, has said that she is "so excited".
"I am very nervous as I am a singer not a dancer, but I am going to give this my absolute everything and try my best to make everyone proud."
The double Paralympic, World and European T44 100m Champion is one of the last few celebrities to be announced as taking part in Strictly this year.
Jonnie will be the first contestant with a disability to take part in the main show - an opportunity which Jonnie said was "too good to turn down".
He added: "I know this will be a challenge and a new experience. I can't wait to see what I can achieve and how far I can push myself."
Next to join the line-up is TV personality and presenter Debbie McGee.
Debbie said, "There are no words to describe how I feel about performing on Strictly Come Dancing. The excitement is overwhelming. I can't stop smiling. It's been the hardest secret I have ever had to keep!"
Ore would agree with you there, Debbie!
The former Holby City actor has already tried her hand at dancing on the BBC - she appeared on Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief.
Chizzy said: "When I was 13, I made the finals of a disco dancing competition once but there was this amazing girl who exploded onto the stage with a gorgeous sequined costume, throwing glitter everywhere.
"I knew it was game over for me. That was then, this is now and this is my chance to have even more sequins!"
Charlotte is a journalist and one of the presenters on ITV's breakfast show Good Morning Britain.
Charlotte said, "I am so thrilled to be one of the contestants on Strictly this year! I've always been a big fan of the show.
"I'm looking forward to stepping out from behind the news desk to cha-cha-cha my way across the dancefloor!"
Brian says, "I'm delighted and honoured to be asked to strut my stuff on this year's Strictly."
He added, "My family all love the show and can't wait to see me do my Dad dancing on national television."
Here's contestant number nine! Susan is a comedian from Scotland. You probably recognise her as the presenter of the CBBC game show Top Class.
Susan says she's mega-excited to be on Strictly and says "I have been a Strictly super-fan for years. This is going to be the best ride possible."
Best of luck to you, Susan!
Aston is celebrity number eight! He is a singer and songwriter, best-known for being a member of the successful British band JLS.
He said "I'm so happy to be joining Strictly 2017, it is such a brilliant show and I've followed it for years. I'm both nervous and excited to learn from the professionals about a whole new way of dancing!"
Simon is the seventh celebrity contestant confirmed for the brand new series of Strictly Come Dancing.
Simon said, "I am so excited, terrified and proud to be invited to be part of Strictly 2017. I've always been a HUUUUGE fan of the show. When I put on my sequins and hit the floor it will genuinely be my very first time dancing ballroom and Latin. Nobody will try harder, have more fun or get more out of it than me. I can't wait."
He is best-known for being the chef and co-presenter on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch.
Joe is an actor, and probably best know for playing the role of Raf di Lucca in Holby City.
He said, "Strictly is one of the biggest, most entertaining shows on TV and being asked to be part of it is a once in a lifetime opportunity that I'm thrilled and terrified about in equal measures!"
The latest member of this year's Strictly team is the Vicar of St Mary's Church in Finedon, Northamptonshire and Chancellor of the University of Northampton.
Away from his church duties, Richard hosts a show on Radio 4 and has appeared on several TV programmes.
Before he joined the church, he was in a band called The Communards, who's best known song is Don't Leave Me This Way (you'll know it when you hear it!)
Gemma Atkinson stars in Emmerdale as Carly Hope and used to be in Hollyoaks.
She said: "I'm beyond excited and incredibly nervous but I am looking forward to learning a new skill and taking on this new challenge."
Ruth is used to presenting on daytime TV programmes like This Morning and Loose Women.
She says it'll be "the scariest yet most exciting thing I've ever done".
Davood is a familiar face for EastEnders fans, where he plays the character of Kush Kazemi.
He said: "It's going to be exciting, challenging and terrifying all at once!"
Mollie King from The Saturdays was the first celebrity dancer confirmed to be taking part in Strictly.
She told Nick Grimshaw on Radio 1's breakfast show that it's "something that I always said I wanted to do.... I'm going to be giving it my all."
