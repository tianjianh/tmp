Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire: Samit Patel's century not enough to avoid defeat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Samit Patel's brilliant 68-ball century was not enough to save Nottinghamshire from a 53-run defeat by Warwickshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Notts resumed at Trent Bridge on 21-3, chasing 227 to win, but Keith Barker removed Greg Smith and Riki Wessels in two balls to leave the hosts 25-5.
Patel and Brendan Taylor put on 89 for the sixth wicket, but once Taylor was out Notts quickly slumped to 119-8.
Patel brought up his ton with a fifth six but was the last man to fall for 124 as Notts were all out for 173.
All-rounder Patel hit eight maximums in total, including seven off spinner Jeetan Patel, in an incredible display of clean hitting.
However, an over after he had smashed Patel for 19, the 31-year-old's 82-ball innings came to an end as he was caught by Sam Hain off Chris Wright.
Patel was one of only two batsmen to reach double figures, along with Taylor (26) as the other 10 batsman could only muster 49 runs between them.
Despite being without injured skipper Ian Bell, Warwickshire's first win of the season, after four draws, takes them top of a tight Division One table - a point clear of reigning champions Yorkshire.
Notts are now without a victory since the opening round of County Championship games.
Nottinghamshire director of cricket Mick Newell:
"It was a fascinating game and then we've seen a truly exceptional innings from Samit in amongst the rest of our batting.
"We should say well played to Samit but, over the course of the four days, we've got an awful lot to improve on.
"We had Warwickshire 117-6 on Sunday, dropped two catches and there's no way they should have got 370 from there."
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown:
"There were bits of that match I didn't enjoy watching particularly and I've certainly realised that Ian Bell is the worst cricket watcher in the world. But, in the end, it was really pleasing to get out with a win. To get across the line after being 17-4 on the first morning is incredibly pleasing.
"Even at three wickets down on Tuesday night, we knew it was going to be a pretty fast scoring ground. We knew that somebody would put in a cameo from somewhere and Samit has played one of the innings of the season.
"He played exceptionally well. We didn't bowl very well at him, to get him going. But, once he was in, he played as well as we've seen anybody play."
