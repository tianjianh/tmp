Bradley Moore, 43, died in hospital after an attack in Warrington Street, Ashton-under-Lyne, on Wednesday night.
His daughter, Alex, said: "He will be watching over me, my brothers, Reece and Jack, and my little sister Emma."
Four boys, including a 12-year-old, appeared at Manchester Crown Court on Monday charged with murder.
The 12-year-old was remanded into local authority accommodation.
His co-accused, two aged 16 and and a 17-year-old, were placed in youth detention custody.
Det Insp John Mulvihill said it was a "tragic case" and appealed for witnesses to contact police.
He said officers were keen to speak to the driver of a Vauxhall Corsa who parked on Warrington Street, near to the restaurant, before going inside on Wednesday night.
Staff at the restaurant have said they are raising money to pay for Mr Moore's funeral.
