The couple were called twice by a person claiming to be from their bank asking if they had received replacement bank cards, Thames Valley Police said.
On the second call in April, one of the victims, who are from Maidenhead, revealed their pin code.
The next day one of the fraudsters delivered two new bank cards and took the couple's original debit cards away.
Over the following days, the fraudsters managed to set up telephone banking and transferred funds from the victims' investment account into their current account, spending a total of Â£56,950 over three days.
Fraudulent purchases were made in Costco Hayes, Costco Sunbury and Costco Watford on 22, 23 and 24 April.
Large purchases were also made in central London at Jessops and John Lewis in Oxford Street and Brent Cross.
The fraudsters also made purchases in Starbucks and other locations in Acton, London.
A black BMW registration number AY05 XDC may have been used in connection with this fraud.
The victims were unaware of the fraud until they visited Lloyds Bank on 24 April where they presented their 'replacement' card to the cashier asking to make a withdrawal from their account.
Det Insp Jason Kew, of Maidenhead CID, said: "They have preyed on vulnerable elderly victims and understandably this crime is still causing the victims a lot of distress."
