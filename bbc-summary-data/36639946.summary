Nott, 20, started all five of England's games in Manchester, including their victory over Ireland in the final.
He camee through the Sale academy and featured twice for the first team in 2015, but did not play last season.
"I'll put this behind me and my next job is to kick on and try and get into the first team," he said.
"There's a big pre-season ahead."
Nott can also play in the second row but added: "I like to just be on the pitch, but I prefer six to lock. I'd love to get game time in any position and I'll take opportunity which I get next season."
He scored the first try of the tournament for England against Italy in what was a home-city tournament for the only Sale player in the squad.
"I've loved every minute of it," he continued. "Not just the games, just everything around it.
"Having the opportunity to have coffees in Hale and seeing all the Sale shirts in the crowd really makes a difference."
