Gareth Bale says it would "mean everything" for Wales to qualify for the second round at Euro 2016.

The 26-year-old Real Madrid forward insists Chris Coleman's side are feeling no ill-effects following their dramatic defeat by England on Thursday.
Victory over Russia on Monday would guarantee Wales' place in the last 16, while a draw would probably be enough.
"It would mean everything to us. The first goal is to get out of the group and it's in our hands," said Bale.
"We still have the chance to do that and hopefully we can grab it with both hands."
Wales made a winning start to their first major tournament finals since the 1958 World Cup, as a Bale free-kick helped them beat Slovakia 2-1.
Against England, he scored again to give his country a half-time lead, but they lost 2-1 as Daniel Sturridge scored in injury time.
When Bale was asked how long it took for Wales to recover from the disappointment, he laughed and said: "What England game?"
He added: "Obviously after the game we were very disappointed, especially to lose in that manner. But we had a chat straight away. Now we have to forget about it. It's over.
"Our fate is in our own hands. If you'd given us this at the start of the tournament, we would have taken it. We have it all to play for and we're still very excited."
Wales' match against Russia will have added significance, given their Euro 2004 play-off defeat against the same opposition.
Having hung on for a goalless draw in the first leg in Moscow, Wales lost the return fixture 1-0 in Cardiff.
A 14-year-old Bale was in the Millennium Stadium crowd on that night in November 2003, though he does not think the current crop will be affected by previous Welsh failures.
"I was actually at the game with my dad and a few of my friends," he said. "I was very young but I still remember it.
"But that was the past and this is now. No-one's even thinking of that experience. We want to go in with a fresh mind. We want to play like we've been doing and hopefully get the win."
