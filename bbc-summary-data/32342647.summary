Operation Elveden: Judge to allow majority verdicts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The jury in the latest trial of journalists accused of illegally paying public officials has been told the judge will accept majority verdicts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sun's Tom Wells, Neil Millard and Brandon Malinsky and ex-Daily Mirror reporter Graham Brough deny conspiring to commit misconduct in public office.
Ex-immigration officer Mark Blake, 43, from Slough, denies misconduct in public office.
The trial at the Old Bailey, part of Operation Elveden, began in February.
The jury began considering its verdicts on 8 April.
Juries are first asked to reach unanimous verdicts, but judges can allow them to make majority verdicts if they cannot all agree. In a full panel of 12 jurors, at least 10 must agree for a majority verdict to be reached.
Mr Wells, 34, from south-east London, Mr Millard, 33, from Croydon, Mr Malinsky, 50, from north London, and Mr Brough, 54, from south-west London, are all accused of paying public officials for stories.
Operation Elveden is the Metropolitan Police investigation into allegations of inappropriate payments to police and public officials.
