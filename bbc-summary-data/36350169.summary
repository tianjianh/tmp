[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wales will face under-strength England at Twickenham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales will face an under-strength England team in their summer tour warm-up at Twickenham on Sunday, 29 May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England coach Eddie Jones will be without Saracens and Exeter players, who face each other in the Premiership final 24 hours earlier.
It means six of the squad that beat Wales in the Six Nations will be out.
Wales' Tomas Francis plays for Exeter, and coach Warren Gatland will also be without France-based players Jonathan Davies and Luke Charteris.
England are missing Saracens forwards Billy Vunipola, Maro Itoje and George Kruis, plus backs Owen Farrell (Saracens) and Jack Nowell (Exeter), who all started in the 25-21 win against Wales in March.
Saracens' Mako Vunipola - a second-half substitute against Wales in the Six Nations - will also be involved in the final.
Leicester centre Manu Tuilagi is also likely be out after injuring a hamstring in his club's 44-17 defeat by Saracens, though he has been named in the squad.
Jones says Tuilagi's involvement in the match the subsequent tour of Australia are "very much in the balance."
He will be assessed on Monday and a replacement called up if needed.
Harlequins prop Joe Marler has ruled himself out of England action this summer.
The game is a warm-up for Wales' three-test tour of New Zealand in June while Jones will use it to hone his England squad before they play three matches against the Wallabies.
Gatland has a number of injury concerns ahead of the tour.
Captain Sam Warburton has a shoulder injury while Justin Tipuric - normally Warburton's understudy - is out until next season after taking a blow to the head against Italy.
Lock Alun Wyn Jones has not played since the Six Nations game between the teams while prop Samson Lee missed the end of the Pro12 season as he underwent return-to-play protocols after a head injury.
