[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mayor of Calais has said she is "disgusted" by David Cameron's response to the migrant crisis.

She said the offer of taking 20,000 migrants over the Parliament but none from Europe proved the prime minister was "contemptuous" of Calais people.
Natacha Bouchart said migrants in Calais saw Britain as a soft touch on benefits and illegal work.
She told MPs migrants said they could easily find work and accommodation in England and were not controlled.
Giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, via an interpreter, the French politician said less than 10% of the 3,500 migrants currently in Calais wanted to seek asylum in France, all others wanted to come to England.
She said if France made 50,000 places available, they still would not seek asylum in France, and it must be confirmed that the UK was not a "El Dorado" for migrants.
