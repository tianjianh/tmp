[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Jos Buttler has been bought for £385,000 by Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wicketkeeper-batsman decided to put himself forward for the IPL, which runs from 9 April to 29 May, after losing his Test place to Jonny Bairstow.
Ex-England batsman Kevin Pietersen was the first player sold as Rising Pune Supergiants bought him for £350,000.
Shane Watson attracted the highest bid as Royal Challengers Bangalore paid more than £950,000 for the Australian.
In contrast, Kent wicketkeeper-batsman Sam Billings, who has five one-day international caps and five Twenty20 caps for England, was picked up by Delhi Daredevils for just £30,000.
England seamer Chris Jordan and Essex's new limited-overs captain Ravi Bopara failed to attract a bid.
England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan is under contract at Sunrisers Hyderabad.
Lancashire's Buttler has scored back-to-back ODI hundreds, the latest coming off 73 balls in the series opener against South Africa in Bloemfontein on Wednesday.
The 25-year-old is taking part in the second ODI in Port Elizabeth on Saturday.
