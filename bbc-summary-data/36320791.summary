[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen set for 'Johan Cruyff pitch'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to create Scotland's first community sports facility named after football legend Johan Cruyff have been backed by Aberdeen councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Netherlands player Cruyff died of cancer aged 68 in March.
He made his name as a forward with Ajax and Barcelona, and was European footballer of the year three times.
The council is giving Â£250,000 to the Cruyff Court project at Hutcheon Court. The astroturf surface would also be used for hockey and street dance.
The plan is in partnership with The Denis Law Legacy Trust and the Cruyff Foundation.
The playing area would be called Cruyff Court Denis Law, also honouring the Aberdeen-born football great.
Law starred for Manchester United and Scotland.
There are almost 200 Cruyff Courts in more than 15 countries around the world.
