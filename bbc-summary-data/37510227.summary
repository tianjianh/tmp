Marcus Rashford: Man Utd striker left out of England Under-21 squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has been left out by England Under-21s, three days before the next senior squad is named.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old was part of England's Euro 2016 squad in the summer but was not picked for the World Cup qualifier against Slovakia earlier this month.
He instead played for the under-21s, scoring a hat-trick against Norway.
The under-21s face Kazakhstan on October 6 and Bosnia-Herzegovina five days later in Euro 2017 qualifying.
Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham, who is on loan at Bristol City, and Derby goalkeeper Jonathan Mitchell are called up for the first time.
England Under-20s manager Aidy Boothroyd will take charge of the under-21 team, with Gareth Southgate stepping up to lead the senior team for four matches after the departure of Sam Allardyce.
BBC Sport's Simon Stone
Given Rashford scored a hat-trick for Gareth Southgate on his England Under-21 debut against Norway, it is not a surprise his name is missing from Aidy Boothroyd's squad.
Former senior boss Sam Allardyce had been concerned at Rashford's lack of football in August.
There are no such issues in September - he has played more matches (five) and minutes (316) for United this month than Wayne Rooney (four and 277 respectively).

Goalkeepers: Jonathan Mitchell (Derby County), Jordan Pickford (Sunderland), Freddie Woodman (Newcastle United)
