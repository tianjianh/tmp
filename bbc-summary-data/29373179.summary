The attack took place on Friday as the students were on their way to school in Pingshan town, state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing local authorities.
It added that local police were searching for the suspect, who is believed to be a 56-year-old man.
Security at Chinese schools has been increased following a spate of attacks.
In a statement on its website, the Lingshan County government said that three of the children were killed instantly and one later died later in hospital.
Earlier this month, three children were killed and six others injured in a knife attack carried out by a man at a school in China's central Hubei province.
A separate incident in March 2010 saw a man stab eight students to death at a school in China's south-eastern Fujian province.
Chinese authorities have generally attributed the knife attacks to people with personal grudges or suffering from mental health problems.
