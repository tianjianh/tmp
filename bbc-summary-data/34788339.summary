A medieval window at York Minster is to be the inspiration for a Yorkshire garden at the 2016 Chelsea Flower Show.

God's Own County - A Garden for Yorkshire will feature a window based on York's East Window.
The window is the largest single expanse of medieval stained glass in Britain and was completed in 1408.
The garden, by Welcome to Yorkshire, will showcase Yorkshire's scenery, heritage, industries and tradespeople at Chelsea.
Materials used for the window will reflect Yorkshire's landscape.
It will feature stone pillars carved by York Minster's masons, traditional stone and timber gargoyles and sculptures loaned from historic sites across Yorkshire.
Welcome to Yorkshire say it will be their biggest garden to date for their seventh year at Chelsea.
Designs for planting beds will celebrate the colours of the stained glass in the East Window.
Matthew Wilson, former head of RHS Garden Harlow Carr in Harrogate, said: "With the materials and skills used to create the garden, we will be bringing over 600 years of living history to Chelsea."
At Chelsea, Welcome to Yorkshire has previously won one gold medal, four silver medals, one silver gilt medal and five people's choice awards.
