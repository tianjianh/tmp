[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 1-0 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham picked up their first Championship win of the season with a narrow victory over Brentford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brentford had the majority of the first-half possession, but Lasse Vibe and Scott Hogan missed easy chances.
Danny Ward then made the Bees pay when he put Rotherham ahead after 32 minutes despite appearing to be offside.
Brentford rarely threatened in the second half and could not find a way through a Millers defence which had shipped 13 goals in four games.
The Millers had not won in the Championship since a 4-0 victory over MK Dons on 9 April, but Ward took his chance well against the run of play to give Alan Stubbs his first win as Rotherham manager.
It was a frustrating afternoon for Brentford, who have been inconsistent so far this season, falling to a second defeat to go with their two league wins.
Rotherham manager Alan Stubbs: "The mood was good anyway but it has lifted the mood for the fans and the club.
"We have had as difficult a start as anybody in terms of who we have played. I thought we got a really good result against a good football team.
"It's important to win every week but this league is one of the most difficult to do it in."
Brentford head coach Dean Smith: "I can't be displeased with our performance. I thought we played well and the better team lost on the day but that's football sometimes.
"We opened them up a number of times in the first half with really good play. They just had the more clear cut of the chances."
