[SN]TITLE[SN]
Award for Orkney community energy projects

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Orkney has won an award recognising the success of its community energy projects.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Local authority areas in Scotland were placed in divisions that reflect the take-up of a range of renewable energy technologies.
Orkney was found to have the greatest amount of community-owned wind generation in a district with a population of less than 100,000 people.
The award was from the Scottish National Renewable Energy League.
Craig MacInnes, development manager of the Orkney Renewable Energy Forum (OREF), collected the award at the event in Glasgow.
He said: "This award for Orkney raises the profile of community wind projects and the benefits they bring.
"It shows how forward thinking many of Orkney's smaller and more remote communities have been in embracing renewable energy."
