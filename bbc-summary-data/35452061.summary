Scotland were crushed by nine wickets in their rain-affected opening Twenty20 international in Hong Kong.

With the match reduced to 10 overs a side, the Scots slumped to 66-7, George Munsey top-scoring on 17.
Matt Machan (10), captain Preston Mommsen (4) and Calum MacLeod (16) were all run out.
The hosts needed just 6.2 overs to reach 72-1, with their top three all posting scores in the twenties and Safyaan Sharif taking the only wicket.
The Hong Kong rain washed out Scotland's Intercontinental Cup match and the visitors were heavily beaten in one of the two planned one-day internationals to beat the wet weather.
A frustrating tour concludes with another T20 clash on Sunday.
"A 10-over game is tricky at the best of times and after being put in to bat we always knew it was going to be tough," said Munsey.
"Credit to the Hong Kong bowlers who made it difficult, restricting us to 67, and it was always going to be a hard total to defend."
