Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers has urged politicians not to let the opportunity to secure a bright future to slip away, ahead of round-table talks in Belfast.

The discussions are due to take place at Stormont on Monday.
DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party leader Peter Robinson is expected to attend the talks despite being admitted to hospital on Saturday.
Ms Villiers said the talks were "crucial" for Northern Ireland.
"We must deal with continued activity by paramilitary organisations and bring about the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement," she added.
"I recognise the scale of the task ahead. We are dealing with very difficult issues.
"But Northern Ireland's political leaders have achieved great things over the past 20 years working together. That same spirit needs to be brought into these talks.
"We must not let this opportunity to build a brighter, more secure future for Northern Ireland slip away."
On Friday, the government said it had commissioned an independent assessment of paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland.
The assessment, to be published in mid-October, will be used to inform parties at Northern Ireland's political talks.
Ms Villiers said she would also establish a fund to tackle organised crime associated with paramilitary groups.
The two unionist parties said they would join cross-party talks on Monday.
Unionists had said the issue of continued paramilitary activity was crucial to their involvement.
Mr Robinson, 66, was admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast on Saturday. A DUP spokesperson said it was as a result of a reaction to medication.
A spokesperson for Belfast Health Trust said he was admitted as a precaution and was "comfortable and doing well".
Mr Donaldson said he thought Mr Robinson would be released from hospital later on Sunday.
He told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme that he had spoken to him and he was in "good form".
Mr Donaldson said Mr Robinson intended to lead the DUP delegation at the round-table political talks at Stormont on Monday.

Mr Robinson stepped aside as first minister over a week ago amid a deepening crisis at Stormont.
It was sparked by the murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuigan Sr, last month.
