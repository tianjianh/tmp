[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old former Ospreys player has been with the Cherry and Whites since 2014.
He has played 10 times for Gloucester so far this season in all competitions and has scored four tries in his 57 appearances for the club.
Hibbard also played three times in the victorious British & Irish Lions tour of Australia in 2013.
"I've really enjoyed my time with Gloucester and, once the club approached me about extending my stay, it was an easy decision to make," he told the club website.
"I feel I've improved my game since I arrived. The Premiership is a tough league, there are no easy games and I think that's actually benefitted me as a player."
