Actor Johnny Depp was filmed waving his sword and talking to riders on Wednesday night at the theme park in California, USA.
Excited twins Sarah and Rebecca Saryan sailed right up to him and captured Depp in full costume.
Fans of Jack Sparrow will get to see a lot more of him this summer with the release of 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' next month.
