St Luke's Hospice shop at Sugar Mill on Billacombe Road was raided early on Sunday morning said police.
Those responsible got into the shop by breaking a rear window.
The charity's area Manager John Saunders said: "We are well supported by the people of Plymouth so to break a window and target us is heartbreaking."
The charity shop is still open for business, seven days a week.
