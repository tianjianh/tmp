Further Scottish farm payments probe 'not sensible', says minister

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A further inquiry into the problems of EU payments to Scottish farmers is "not sensible" because a probe of "Rolls Royce" standards is already under way, Holyrood's rural affairs minister said.

Fergus Ewing was updating MSPs on issues encountered by a new Scottish government computer payments system.
Almost 500 farm businesses in Scotland are still waiting for their Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies.
However, 17,634 businesses had been given what they were owed.
Holyrood's Rural Affairs committee heard that 473 businesses had not received any EU payment and 230 had received a partial payment.
MSPs also learned that farmers had not been left out of pocket because all those who had encountered problems getting their money had been offered loans.
The latest figures were made public during an evidence session to the committee by Mr Ewing and government officials.
The minister made clear it would be up to parliament to decide if an independent inquiry was needed, but he believed at this time it was not "sensible or prudent" to conduct one now.
Problems with the Â£178m computer system have caused delays to many claimants who were due to receive their money by the end of June.
Under CAP, about Â£4.6bn in European and Scottish government funding will be paid out between 2015 and 2020.
The money is mainly given to improve agricultural productivity and to ensure farmers have a reliable income.
The CAP Futures programme in Scotland was meant to make the rural payment process more efficient.
EU officials have given the Scottish government until 15 October for the payments to be made.
Mr Ewing emphasised that 99% of farmers had been given money, either through the awarding of the payment, or a loan from the Scottish government.
He said: "Getting this sorted in full is my top priority - a huge amount of work has gone into that and I personally won't be satisfied until every farmer has received payment of their due in total."
An Audit Scotland report earlier this year said there had been "serious cost and operational issues" associated with the payments.
Mr Ewing was asked by committee member Rhoda Grant whether an independent inquiry would take place.
The minister said: "The priority for us and for farmers is to resolve the remaining difficulties with the IT system and to restore the operation of the system to a proper footing and anything that detracts from that process, taking senior officials away from focusing on that, would I think be counter productive and would certainly be most unwelcome."
He admitted that lessons needed to be learned.
Mr Ewing went on: "Of course we have had the benefit of a very thorough series of inquiries by the auditor general - we have had a Rolls-Royce inquiry already and it has looked specifically at this, and moreover members will recall that in this report it goes into the difficulties.
"It already has conducted a forensic inquiry into these difficulties - that process continues.
"I believe there has been an appropriate inquiry - it is not over, the work is continuing, and we are appropriately being subjected to scrutiny today, that is the purpose of today.
"Questions have been asked and answered and further information will be provided."
