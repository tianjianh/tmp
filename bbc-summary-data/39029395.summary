The 35-year-old has played 34 times for Warriors joining them in 2015.
The number eight made 187 appearances for Saints during a six-year spell, helping the club win the Premiership and European Challenge Cup in 2014.
"While I'm sad to be retiring this is a great opportunity to get involved with the club that I love," he said.
The former England forward will take up the role vacated by Alex King, who left Franklin's Gardens in October.
Dowson will be part of a coaching quartet that includes attack coach Alan Dickens, defence coach Mark Hopley, who steps up from the academy, and forwards coach Dorian West.
The club are currently in eighth position in the Premiership, following a defeat by Newcastle that prop Alex Waller labelled as "dreadful".
Dowson continued: "Franklin's Gardens is a special place, and throughout the club - players, coaches, staff, ownership and supporters - everyone wants the Saints to be successful.
"It's a strong club with strong values and culture, and I'm looking forward to getting on the other side of the fence and helping the players get better and to achieve things."
