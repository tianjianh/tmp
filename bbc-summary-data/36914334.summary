[SN]TITLE[SN]
Public to vote on future of Maenclochog village toilets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People living in a north Pembrokeshire village are being asked to decide on the future of their public toilets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maenclochog Community Council currently pays about £3,000 a year to maintain the small toilet block in the village.
Residents have decided to hold a public vote throughout August on whether they should continue to do so.
Nine community councils and groups currently pay for the running costs of public toilets in Pembrokeshire.
Thirteen have closed in the county in the past few years as Pembrokeshire council aims to save money.
Eifion Evans runs one of the shops in the village.
He said: "It's a good idea because we can find out how many people want to keep the toilets going.
"There was uproar in the village when it was originally suggested they might close."
The toilets are popular with walkers who visit the nearby Preseli Hills.
Councillor Huw George, a member of the council, said its share of council tax "doesn't allow for the payment of these toilets at the moment".
But he added: "One possible way forward could be to add £7 or £10 a year to the annual precept."
