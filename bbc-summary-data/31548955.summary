Monaco have a number of "great clubs" interested in signing their £50m striker Falcao should Manchester United decide against making his loan deal permanent at the end of the season.

The Premier League club signed the Colombian, 29, on a season-long loan last September and have the option of paying £43.2m for him in the summer.
In an interview to run on Football Focus on BBC One on Saturday (12:10 GMT), Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev says: "I'm not worried for Falcao, he is a world-class striker."
Falcao has scored only four goals in 19 appearances for United.
Vasilyev adds: "If Manchester United decide not take up the option at the end of the season, we have interest from other great clubs. So I am really not worried for him at all."
United have already paid a £6m loan fee and the striker's £265,000-a-week wages.
Falcao was substituted an hour into the Red Devils' FA Cup fifth-round victory at Preston on Monday.
United manager Louis van Gaal said last month: "If a player costs £95m or £5,000, it doesn't make any difference. You have to prove yourself.
"We have made this deal and everything is clear."
