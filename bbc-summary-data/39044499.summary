[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Assel Al-Essaie, 23, was shot in Daniel Hill in Walkley, Sheffield, on Saturday lunchtime.
He was taken to hospital but later died from a wound to the chest.
Police believe a three-door silver/grey VW Golf, registration number PJ10 OJU, was "used by the suspect or suspects involved in this murder".
Det Ch Insp Steve Whittaker, of West Yorkshire Police, said the car - later found abandoned and burned out in Rough Lane, Wortley - had "an unusual twin exhaust at the back".
He added: "Did you see this car on Saturday or the days prior? Do you know who may have been driving or travelling in that car?
"Any piece of information, no matter how small, could help us with our investigation."
Mr Whittaker said he believed Mr Al-Essaie was in a black Mercedes C class car, registration number LP66 RUH, when he was shot.
He was taken to hospital in a white Mercedes C class car, registration number NU15 PZF.
The detective said all three vehicles were seen in the Daniel Hill area at the time of the shooting.
A 30-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder has been bailed pending further enquiries.
