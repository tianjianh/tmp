Will new music streaming service Tidal make the waves artists want?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Big names in the world of music made it known that they wanted a change when they all stood on stage on Monday and announced the relaunch of streaming service Tidal.

It has no free elements (after a 30-day trial) and a £20 monthly subscription fee.
It's big because it's the first artist-owned streaming service with Jay Z and 15 other stars all having a stake.
But how much of a game changer is it really?
Last June, there was a big turning point in the way music is charted in the UK, when it was announced that the Official Charts Company would start including streamed music as part of its chart round-up.
Why was that important? Well, in simple terms, it was a recognition of how consumers are listening to music.
The streaming arena is getting crowded. Spotify, Rdio, Deezer, Pandora (based in the US) are just a few of the brands already providing content.
We're all waiting for an expected announcement from Apple later this year about a Beats by Dr Dre streaming service.
But they are all competition for Tidal.
•  The Official Charts Company says it is already in talks to include streams from Tidal into the weekly chart round-up.
•  It can be used offline and you will get exclusive content from your favourite artists.
•  It will cost you £10 for a basic package and £20 to access high definition music and video content.
•  There will be no adverts.
Basically, they all want to create a "Netflix for music" model, which forces people to pay for a subscription service where all parties involved are happy.
The only unique offering appears to be the high definition quality of content.
But as Jack White points out in one of the promotional videos, "We can really educate people on what kind of digital that they're actually hearing.
"I think the average person on the street has no idea."
The good side of this - for the artists at least - is that they claim they'll get what is owed to them in terms of streaming royalties.
Ed Sheeran criticised labels saying it was actually them who were the problem when it came to artists getting their fair share of the streaming royalties.
There's no word from Tidal on whether they've got around this with the licences with big labels which were already in place before Jay Z's purchase.
There is already anger, a slew of memes and comments on social networking sites, highlighting that none of those involved are poor.
Madonna is having to defend the brand, saying on her Instagram account: "Tidal is not about consumption and greed! Its about protecting an art-form that is beloved to all of us..."
And it's not being backed by everyone in the music industry.
Naughty Boy tweeted: "No-one cares about tidal wave when there are people out here drowning."
Lily Allen posted a series of tweets which, among other things, criticised Tidal's cost, which she says will force people "to swarm back to pirate sites in droves".
"I think this is one of the things that sets us aside from someone that's a technical company that's selling advertising or selling hardware." said Jay Z in one of the Tidal promotional videos.
As great as it is having high definition quality audio and video, if you're broadband speed is poor, it's unlikely you will enjoy the benefits of the better sound.
• Swedish based Aspiro was bought by Project Panther on 13 March, for a reported $56m (£37m).
• A "summit" with some of the biggest names in music takes place, including artists, labels bosses and lawyers.
• On 30 March, 16 artists appear at a conference in New York to announce that they're co-owners of Tidal music.
Plus, what you listen to music through (headphones and speakers) makes a huge difference to the quality.
In a statement the Official Charts Company told Newsbeat: "There are around 6,500 retailers and streaming services that contribute daily sales and streaming information to the Official Chart, which captures 99% of the UK singles market and around 98% of the albums market each week.
"New outlets and services are added to this panel regularly, and we are already under way with discussions with Tidal about them joining the chart panel."
Artists like Justin Bieber have already got stakes in streaming sites, according to Forbes magazine.
Essentially, Jay Z and Alicia Keys aren't wrong, the effect of Tidal on the music industry has changed the game.
It's not simply because it comes without adverts, a better quality sound and can work offline but mainly because it opens up a number of possibilities including artists doing a Taylor Swift and pulling their content from other streaming services.
And how will it service new and emerging talent?
In a statement Spotify says: "We're going to keep working with every artist to ensure all your favourite music is on Spotify.
"Recent releases by Drake, Kendrick, Madonna and others - including the Empire cast album, which hit number one because of streaming - show how critical it is for artists and labels to be on Spotify for their own success, and we're proud to be part of that."
