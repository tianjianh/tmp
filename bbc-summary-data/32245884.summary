Mr Modi made the announcement at a press conference in Paris with French President Francois Hollande.
The deal is the fruition of years of negotiation, with India intent on buying 126 jets in total for an estimated cost of $12bn (Â£8.2bn).
Mr Modi said the deal was done after talks with Mr Hollande but that terms and conditions still had to be agreed.
He added that he wished to buy the jets ready to fly. This means that they will be built in France, not India.
The Indian prime minister is in France on the first leg of a three-nation tour which also takes in Germany and Canada.
Mr Modi will visit the World War One memorial and pay tribute to Indians who lost their lives fighting alongside France.
He will then head to Germany, where he will inaugurate one of the world's biggest trade fairs and told talks with leaders to boost trade ties.
In the third and last leg of his tour, Mr Modi will travel to Canada, marking the first standalone visit by an Indian prime minister in more than four decades.
