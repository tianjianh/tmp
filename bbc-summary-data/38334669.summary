The Moldova international came off in the 23rd minute of their 59-7 European Challenge Cup win in France on Friday.
"Since returning, Dmitri has had scans which have been reviewed," medical performance manager Chris Towers said.
"Following discussions the decision was that Dmitri requires surgery, which we hope will take place next week."
Towers added: "At this early stage we are looking at him being unavailable for a period of four to five months."
Ospreys face Grenoble again in their return Challenge Cup fixture at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday, 17 December.
