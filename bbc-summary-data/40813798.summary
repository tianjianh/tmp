[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fake policeman who was filmed killing a man during a bondage sex session fled to Italy afterwards and murdered another man, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Marshall, 28, stole cash and used Peter Fasoli's bank card to buy a ticket to Rome after attacking him in his Northolt home in January 2013.
While he was in Italy, he was found guilty of strangling one man and trying to kill another, the Old Bailey heard.
Mr Marshall, who denies murder, told the jury he did not know what happened.
Giving evidence, he said he had no memory of meeting Mr Fasoli or of events in Italy but said: "I feel bad that somebody died and it could potentially be me."
Jurors have been shown video recorded on Mr Fasoli's hard drive showing how Mr Marshall allegedly tied up, gagged and smothered his victim with cling film.
Posing as a policeman, he then set fire to the one-bedroom bungalow to hide the murder and fled abroad, the Old Bailey heard.
Prosecutor Edward Brown QC told jurors less than three weeks after Mr Fasoli died, Mr Marshall killed Vincenzo Iale, 67, using an electrical flex in his flat in Rome.
On 3 February, just over a week later, he contacted Umberto Gismondi on a gay dating site and they arranged to meet for sex at the 54 year old's flat.
While there Mr Marshall, who pretended to be working at the British Embassy, bound, gagged and attacked Mr Gismondi with the truncheon and pepper spray, the court heard.
He then demanded money and tried to smother him with a cushion but fled when Mr Gismondi alerted his neighbours.
Mr Marshall was later arrested and found guilty of murder and attempted murder in July 2014.
The Old Bailey heard British police spoke to their Italian counterparts and Mr Marshall was flown to Heathrow Airport in custody in February, where he was arrested on suspicion of murdering Mr Fasoli.
In his evidence Mr Marshall, of East Ham, accepted the man shown in the footage was "without a doubt" him.
He told the jury he had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, epilepsy, a personality disorder and depression, and had been sectioned and imprisoned at different times during his life.
When asked about impersonating a police officer, he said he had been arrested "many, many times" because of it but he did it because he liked the "respect" the uniform gave him.
Jurors previously heard it was thought Mr Fasoli had died in an accident until footage of his killing was found by his nephew.
The trial continues.
