The number of road traffic collisions in a Devon city has increased following the introduction of major roadworks.

The works on Gdynia Way near Plymouth's city centre have been in place since June to widen the road to three lanes.
But police said they had seen an increase in the number of collisions on the Maxwell Road, Macadam Road junction.
Plymouth City Council (PCC) said a new set of temporary traffic lights would be put on the junction.
Pc Ian Tanner, Plymouth's road casualty reduction officer said: "There have been some collisions since the new system was put in place, with four or five injury collisions in that area.
"The council are diverting quite large volumes of traffic on to roads that, although perfectly up to the job, people don't usually travel on, and as a result it hasn't worked as well as we would have liked it to.
"It's a balancing act for the council, as to what is the best thing to do, to keep the traffic moving as well as they can and to keep the level of injuries down."
Pc Tanner added that the increase in collisions could also be a result of drivers, familiar with the route, not reading new signs properly.
In a statement, PCC said: "During the last couple of months it has become apparent that there could be further improvements to the revised junction layout.
"The decision to install temporary lights has been made after routine discussions with various stakeholders including the police.
"The lights will reinforce the changed priorities and help drivers negotiate this junction."
The council said that up to 1,000 drivers used the junction each hour.
The new traffic lights will give priority to traffic travelling between Plymstock and the city centre in the morning and vice versa in the evening, until the work is completed in October.
