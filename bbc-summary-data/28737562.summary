The firm selling the Murco oil refinery in Milford Haven has announced that all of its UK petrol stations will also be sold.

Murphy Oil revealed in July that a deal had been signed with the Klesch Group, safeguarding 400 jobs at the refinery.
On Monday it said 228 of its petrol stations - 78 in Wales - are being sold to Motor Fuel Group (MFG) in a deal Reuters say is worth Â£200m.
The petrol stations will retain the Murco brand and name.
MFG currently operates about 60 petrol station forecourts in Britain including some operated under the BP and Total brands.
Murphy Oil put its British refining and retail fuel subsidiary Murco up for sale more than two years ago.
The company said in a statement: "Murphy is pleased to announce the signing of this agreement, following closely the signing of the agreement for the sale of the Milford Haven refinery."
The deal is expected to be done by 30 September, it added.
The future of the refinery had been in doubt since Murphy announced it was no longer buying crude oil to be processed at the site.
Workers were already fearing the worst when a Â£300m deal to save the plant collapsed in April.
But the deal with the Klesch Group was greeted with "relief" and described "great news for workforce and for Wales".
Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said MFG will also take over the responsibility for transporting fuel to all 78 stations in Wales.
He said: "This is a really positive piece of news and there's no reason to be concerned. The fuel stations should remain accessible to the communities they serve."
