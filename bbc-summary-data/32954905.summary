[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, who has not been named, was based at the Commando Training Centre at Lympstone, Devon, and was taking part in a 30-mile (48km) march.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the cause of death was unknown.
He said: "This incident is being investigated and the thoughts and sympathies of the Naval Service are with the family and friends of this man."
The man died on Thursday during the so-called "30-miler" march across Dartmoor, the last major test undertaken as part of the 32-week Commando course.
Trainees must complete it carrying at least 32lbs (15kg) of equipment in a maximum time of eight hours.
The MoD said the name and details of the man who died were not being released, at the request of his family.
