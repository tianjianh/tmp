The blast at a two-storey house in Wiggin Street, Edgbaston, Birmingham happened at about 12:20 BST.
A neighbour told the BBC she saw a man run out from the wreckage screaming.
A man, thought to be in his late 30s, made his own way to City Hospital but his burns were so severe he was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, West Midlands Ambulance Service said.
More updates on the blast and news from Birmingham.
A woman was checked at the scene and was uninjured.
Next door neighbour Tracy Clayton was at home with her husband Bilal Azhar when they felt a "huge explosion".
"The neighbour next door to us whose house was blown up, he ran out screaming," she said.
"I think he was on fire or hurt."
She added: "Everything fell on top of us. The roof gave in. There was just smoke everywhere, bricks flying.
"I switched my electric off and thought about my cat and did not know where it was but she was unharmed thank God."
West Midlands Police said a small number of homes had been evacuated as a precaution.
"Investigations at the scene are likely to be suspended once it gets dark, then continue tomorrow," said West Midlands Fire Service.
