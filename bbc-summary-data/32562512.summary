Election 2015: Wales debates highlights

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was the last televised debate for the main six parties in Wales - and a lively audience at Cardiff's Sherman Theatre saw sparks fly as leaders clashed on the economy, health and the welfare system.

Chaired by Huw Edwards, Friday's BBC Wales Report special saw Welsh Labour's Owen Smith and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood exchange blunt views on where they stand if there is a hung parliament after the ballot boxes close next Thursday evening.
Mr Smith wanted to know whether Plaid would let a "Tory government in by the back door" - Ms Wood accused Labour of "taking people for granted".
The issue of the so-called bedroom tax and welfare system changes saw the Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb and his Labour shadow Mr Smith verbally spar.
Mr Crabb accused his Labour counterpart of leading Welsh Labour MPs to vote against measures aimed at cutting the economic deficit.
Mr Smith said he was happy to have voted against welfare cuts - and would lead his MPs to vote the same way again.
The NHS might be a devolved issue in Wales - but that did not stop questions on the health service for the party leaders.
UKIP Wales' Nathan Gill told the audience that in Wales, Labour had made a "pig's ear" of the NHS.
There was no escaping the issue of welfare cuts in the debate, and that put the Lib Dem-Tory coalition at Westminster in the spotlight.
Welsh Lib Dem party leader Kirsty Williams said introducing a cap on benefits was a "tough decision" - but one she said was fair.
For the Green's Pippa Bartolotti, a key message was how austerity is being felt by women in Wales.
She said they were bearing a disproportionate burden at home - and in work.
But with the last television debate now done and dusted, all the parties are focusing on a final push across the bank holiday weekend, with the last few days counting down to Thursday's vote.
