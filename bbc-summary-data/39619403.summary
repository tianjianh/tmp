I went to Devon to see my cousins and we stayed in a hotel in Exeter to celebrate my grandpa's 70th birthday early because it is on a another day.

My best part of the Easter holidays has to be when my mum, dad and I went to the Lake District for a friend's wedding! The scenery was beautiful and the wedding was amazing!
