One story is dominating Tuesday's front pages - the deaths of two people in what is being reported as a murder-suicide near Maguiresbridge, County Fermanagh.

"Murder suicide horror" is the headline on the front of the Daily Mirror. "Murder-suicide leaves two dead" says the Belfast Telegraph. "Man and woman dead in apparent murder-suicide" reports the Irish News.
The Irish News adds that it's understood that the man attacked the woman with a knife before taking his own life.
The Daily Mirror reports that the woman's son was also attacked and has been left in intensive care with stab injuries after the "frenzied knife attack".
In the Belfast Telegraph, the paper reports that a relative of the woman said the family were deeply shocked and finding it "hard to take in".
It also says that it's understood the man was the estranged partner of the victim. The police have confirmed that they are not looking for anybody else in connection with what happened.
The News Letter also features the story on the front page, reporting that police are investigating the deaths of a 51-year-old woman and 55-year-old man.
Elsewhere in the newspaper, lawyers representing the families of those killed in the Kingsmills Massacre have accused the Irish authorities of "insulting" them.
The inquest into the massacre reopened in Belfast on Monday. Alan Kane QC, representing the families, said Irish police were guilty of a "diet of obstruction" and a "failure to assist the legacy process in Northern Ireland into the deaths of 10 people".
The coroner said the inquest would not finish until all relevant material had been received from authorities in Dublin.
Back over in the Irish News and we're getting into that time of year again - bonfire season. The paper reports exclusive figures that indicate four fines have been issued for bonfire offences in the last three years.
It said the figures, released through a Freedom of Information request, indicated that environmental officials had investigated 93 complaints about bonfires since 2014, but that no enforcement action was taken in the majority of cases.
The Northern Ireland Environment Agency defended its enforcement record, saying that many incidents are referred to local councils while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs added that "many of the incidents are subsequently referred to the local council for action".
Meanwhile, the Belfast Telegraph uses its editorial to pay tribute to Brendan Duddy, the IRA-British government go-between, whose funeral took place on Monday.
The paper says it was in "his home over three decades that the foundations of the peace process were laid".
"When the definitive history of this chapter in the existence of Northern Ireland is written - as opposed to the revisionism that is already ongoing - the name of Brendan Duddy deserves to be written large," the paper says.
"As journalist Peter Taylor said, Mr Duddy deserved a Nobel laureate. Instead his reward was going to his grave knowing that he had saved countless others from an early death."
Finally, U2 are back and touring their classic 80s opus The Joshua Tree in full - the Daily Mirror carries two pages of coverage from the world tour's second stop in Seattle.
The band sprinkled hits such as Beautiful Day and One into a spectacular-looking set that lit up CenturyLink Field, with the group set to bring the show to Croke Park in Dublin in July.
Speaking to a Daily Mirror reporter before the gig, Bono told her that US President Donald Trump was not welcome at the band's shows and revealed an unlikely source of inspiration for a new song about his wife - Irish broadcaster and football pundit Eamon Dunphy.
Bono said that the commentator had said that his wife, Ali, was the best thing about him,
"So we've written a song called You're The Best Thing About Me," said Bono.
