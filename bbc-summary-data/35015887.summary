A protest march has taken place over plans for a large housing development within the South Downs National Park.

Developers want to build more than 400 homes, alongside workshops and shops, in the Phoenix Quarter of Lewes.
The protest group have said they would support the development if it was done "sustainably" and have created their own alternative plans.
The South Downs National Park Authority will make a decision on 10 December.
The protest group, Lewes Phoenix Rising, said the current plans would wipe away the good aspects of the current area.
Its director Andrew Simpson said: "Our plan starts from where we are now and our view is that we build from that.
"We help the town increase its vitality as it moves forward and grows in the 21st Century.
"We don't think the way to do that is to wipe out what we already have, which is the council's plan."
However, Andy Smith, who is the leader of Lewes District Council, said "the alternative was not an alternative".
"There is no suggestion that anybody is going to fund that scheme," he said.
"Our scheme has not been rushed, it is available and ready to go now."
