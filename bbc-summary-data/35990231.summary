Nigel, 52, won world titles at middleweight and super-middleweight in the 1990s but believes his son has even more talent than him.
"He can achieve more than me. All I had was that I was fierce," said Nigel.
"He can box, he can bang and he's got good movement, which I did not have. He is way, way above me."
Conor, 19, is fighting on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's world title challenge against Charles Martin.
Conor won 20 of the 22 amateur fights he had in Australia, where his dad has settled, and has been matched with Bulgarian Ivailo Boyanov - a late replacement for Yorkshireman Luke Keleher - having recently joined Eddie Hearn's Matchroom stable.
Conor had been training with another British boxing great in Ricky Hatton but is now with Tony Sims, who also trains Joshua in Essex.
"I trialled training with Ricky Hatton, and then went straight to Tony. I felt like a fish out of water up in Manchester," said Conor.
"Ricky's a great trainer but all my family's down in London."
Conor added that his father would not play a similar role to his former nemesis Chris Eubank, who is taking a very hands-on approach with his son Chris Jr's career.
"My dad's going to be there in the shadows, so to speak," said Conor.
"I know he's there when I need him but he's not going to be ruling the cameras and showboating - it's going to be completely different."
