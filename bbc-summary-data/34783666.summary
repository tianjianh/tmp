The 23-year-old made five appearances for the Dunedin-based franchise.
Director of rugby David Humphreys said: "Joe is a talented young player who is learning the game.
"Joe is English qualified which is important and is looking forward to testing himself in our environment, developing as a player and helping Gloucester move forward."
Gloucester have made an indifferent start to the new season, lying ninth in the Premiership table with two wins and two losses from their four matches.
