Smith, from Peterborough, was banned for two months by British Gymnastics after the video emerged on 7 October.
The 27-year-old apologised over the clip, in which he was seen laughing and imitating Islamic prayers.
City councillor Mohammed Jamil said Smith's apology meant he had "done enough" to earn his forgiveness.
