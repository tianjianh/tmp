Goodfellas actor Frankie Sivero has filed a lawsuit against Fox claiming The Simpsons character of Louie, a member of Springfield's Mafia, was based on his portrayal of Frankie Carbone in Martin Scorsese's film.
That's according to legal documents made public on the Deadline website, a showbiz site in the US.
It's 23 years since Louie made his debut opposite the cartoon's mob boss Fat Tony.
But now Mr Sivero wants $250m for the alleged infringement.
He claims he was "the originator of the idea and character" of Louie, as he based Goodfellas' Frankie Carbone on his own personality.
In the documents he claims at that time, in 1989, he was living in the same apartment complex as James L Brooks, when "they saw each other almost every day".
He also says he was promised a film and a part in the future of The Simpsons and claims he lost money because he was "type-cast" as a result of Louie.
Like Frankie, Louie has black curly hair, but Dan Castellenata, who voiced the character, said he based the voice on Joe Pesci, also in Goodfellas.
It's not the first time this year Sivero has taken legal action after claiming his rights to the Goodfellas character were infringed.
In July he filed a suit against a Californian sandwich shop Deli Belly because they named an Italian-style sandwich "the Frankie Sivero" after he ate there.
As Goodfellas' Jimmy Two Times would say "somebody get the papers, the papers".
Fox Entertainment, which makes The Simpsons, has so far not commented on the claim.
