Cardiff City manager Paul Trollope feels the Bluebirds still need "a few" new players before the transfer window closes on Wednesday night.

Cardiff are looking at goalkeeper cover for David Marshall, a replacement for defender Fabio, who joined Premier League side Middlesbrough and are also seeking striker reinforcements.
''There are two or three positions we are looking for," Trollope explained.
"We are working really, really hard to try and secure what we want."
Trollope is anxious to hold on to highly rated keeper Marshall and midfielder Aron Gunnarsson, who featured in Iceland's memorable quarter final berth at Euro 2016.
Both players have linked with moves away from Cardiff City Stadium during the summer.
However the Cardiff boss is also realistic as he enters the last few days of transfer activity and admits every player has their price.
''It's normal practice when you come to the end of a transfer window. I have been here for a few now, with David and a number of other players to be honest. We have some good players, players who would be attractive to other teams," he told BBC Wales Sport.
''You are not going to stop speculation, stop things being written or spoken about.
''I think any manager or any coach wants to keep his best players.
"But also I think any coach will tell you all players have their value, whether they are at the top of the league or in League Two.''
