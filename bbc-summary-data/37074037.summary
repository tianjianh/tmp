Langridge and Ellis beat Poland's Adam Cwalina and Przemyslaw Wacha 21-18 21-16 to finish second in their group.
But the Adcocks went out of the mixed doubles after losing against Robert Mateusiak and Nadiezda Zieba.
"We're devastated to go out, we'll use this pain to come back stronger for Tokyo," the pair said.
The husband and wife pair were Britain's leading medal hopes going into the Games after claiming Commonwealth Games gold in Glasgow in 2014.
They lost 18-21 27-25 21-9 against their Polish opponents who progress, along with Chinese pair Chen Xu and Jin Ma with the Britons third.
Women's doubles pairing Heather Olver and Lauren Smith grabbed a consolation victory, their first of the Games, against Lok Yan Poon and Ying Suet Tse of Hong Kong.
They won 21-17 18-21 21-16 but did not qualify for the quarter-finals.
