Emily Titterington death: Voice 'not heard' by agencies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The voice of a vulnerable 16-year-old who died from a constipation-induced heart attack "was not heard" despite seven agencies being involved in her care, a serious case review has found.

Some professionals at the time questioned whether Emily Titterington's illness was induced by the emotional challenges being faced by her mother.
Her parents felt experts did not understand her issues, the review said.
Agencies across the country are being urged to learn from the case.
Emily collapsed and died at home at St Austell in February 2013.
At an inquest into her death earlier this month, the Coroner for Cornwall concluded the cause of death was "natural causes contributed by psycho-social factors".
The serious case review said seven agencies were involved with her and her family during the last three years of her life.
It said "the voice of the child was not heard or accessible" and no professional knew what Emily herself "thought would help her most in life".
Emily, who was home educated and had mild autism, lived in a rural area with her parents in a "fixed, unchallenged family dynamic" that was "difficult" to work with, according to the review.
Chairman of Cornwall's Safeguarding Children Board (SCB), John Clements, said: "The hypothesis is the mother had her own emotional difficulties, and as a consequence... whatever relationship that existed with her daughter caused a number of conditions within her daughter".
He added there was no suggestion this was deliberate and admitted "we don't really understand the full circumstances".
Emily was seen by a number of medical professionals in the lead up to her death, but had refused to go to hospital.
The serious case review found there was a lack of continuity across the healthcare system and "no clear clinical leader to grip her chronic health problem".
Mr Clements said a number of recommendations had been made, including working to make sure a vulnerable child's voice is heard.
"The last thing we ever want is for anything like this to happen again," he said.
