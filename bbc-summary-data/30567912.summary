Paul Pugh was beaten senseless and left for dead in an unprovoked attack in 2007. Seven-years on and he still struggles to cope with everyday life.

Now a new campaign is being launched to crackdown on alcohol-fuelled violent crime, with the Amman Valley sportsman's story centre stage.
Dyfed-Powys Police want young people to sign up to Paul's Pledge.
They are being asked to promise not to behave aggressively while out for the night.
They will be able to sign the pledge and then let others know they have done so by wearing campaign wristbands and by talking about it on Twitter using #PaulsPledge.
Police are launching the campaign in Ammanford on Monday and plan to take it to schools, colleges and youth clubs throughout Carmarthenshire and then across Wales.
"If I can prevent violence and get through to one person, then I know it is for the good of mankind," said the former Cwmamman United football club captain.
