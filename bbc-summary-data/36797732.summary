Aaron McEneff netted a 40th-minute penalty after a hand ball and Longford then had midfielder Kevin O'Connor sent-off for two yellow cards.
Substitute Lukas Schubert got his first goal for Derry in the 63rd minute.
Rory Patterson blazed a penalty over for Derry but Barry McNamee got their third and Patterson then made it 4-0.
For Derry boss Kenny Shiels it was a fine response by his team to the 5-0 defeat by leaders Dundalk in their last game.
Once they got the breakthrough against a team without a win for 17 league games, the result was not really in doubt.
McEneff, who successfully took over the penalty taking duties when Patterson missed in a cup game against Drogheda earlier in the season, netted from the spot for the opener five minutes before the break.
Schubert's composed right-footed finish after Conor McCormick's good pass made it two.
Derry got a second penalty in the 72nd minute after a foul on Schubert by Pat Flynn.
However, instead of earlier scorer McEneff, Patterson took the spot-kick and blazed it over the crossbar.
Just a couple of minutes later McNamee made it 3-0 by following up to score after Patterson's overhead effort had been scooped out by visiting keeper Ryan Coulter.
Patterson got on the score sheet six minutes from time, wrapping up their biggest win of the season.
