The Premiership champions beat last season's runners up 34-13 without the likes of George Kruis, Owen Farrell, Chris Wyles and Duncan Taylor.
Sean Maitland crossed twice in the bonus-point win as Sarries went top.
"The really encouraging thing for me today was that a lot of what people consider to be the big players for us weren't playing," he said.
"Jackson Wray is just getting better and better. He probably doesn't get enough attention but he's been incredibly consistent for us for a while.
"He stepped up even further today and that was a really good top level performance," McCall said.
Saracens became the first team to win at Sandy Park since January 2015 and they expect to be further boosted by the return of England fly-half Farrell, who has missed the opening two games of the season with a back injury, for the visit of Northampton on Saturday.
"There was a brilliant focus before the game today," McCall added.
"Sometimes you can sense that it's not quite right or that it is right, and there as a big contrast between last week and this week.
"They knew it was a big game, they knew it was serious and I thought they performed that way."
