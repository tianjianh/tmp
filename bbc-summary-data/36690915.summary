The 30-year-old clocked 47.73 seconds to streak away from Kenya's Boniface Mucheru, who took silver, with Turkey's Yasmani Copello winning bronze.
Clement, who holds the seventh-fastest time ever, is twice a world champion, but managed only Olympic silver in 2008 and was eighth four years ago.
Ireland's Thomas Barr missed out on a medal, finishing fourth.
Barr, looking to win Ireland's first track and field medal since 2000, finished strongly, only to be edged out by Copello by just 0.05secs.

For Clement, the fastest time in the world this year gave him a second Olympic gold to go with the 4x400m relay title won as part of the American team eight years ago in Beijing.
Puerto Rico's Javier Culson, a bronze medallist in London, was disqualified for a false start.
