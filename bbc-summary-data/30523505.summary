Ashley Talbot, 15, was struck by the bus driven by PE teacher Chris Brooks at Maesteg School, Bridgend county, on 10 December.
The hearing at Aberdare Coroner's Court was told that a police and health and safety investigation surrounding the incident is continuing.
The hearing was adjourned until a review on 9 April 2015.
A second pupil, 13, was also injured in the incident but did not need hospital treatment.
In a tribute released after his death, Ashley's family said he was taken from them in a "tragic accident".
They described him as a "typical teenager, a practical joker with a wicked infectious laugh".
Pupils at the school also paid tribute to a "good friend" and said the gap he had left could never be filled.
The school said it was co-operating with the police investigation and counselling had been offered to students.
PE teacher Chris Brooks, who was driving the minibus, said after the incident: "All my thoughts, wishes and prayers are with Ashley's family."
