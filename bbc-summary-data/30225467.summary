Farrell, 23, has been overlooked for the starting XV for the first time since June 2012 after under-performing against New Zealand, South Africa and Samoa.
The Saracens player was picked at inside centre for the game against Samoa after starting in his usual fly-half role against the All Blacks and Springboks.
Bath's George Ford remains at stand-off and will win his sixth cap after impressing against Samoa last Saturday in what was his first Test start.
England head coach Stuart Lancaster said: "It's good to be able to give Billy his first start of the series.
"He took on board the feedback we gave him when he first came into camp and he has worked hard both with us and at Gloucester and deserves his chance.
"Owen is a key part of our squad and I am sure he will make a positive contribution should he get the chance."
Lancaster also praised the contributions of Haskell and Webber in the victory over Samoa.
He added: "Tom (Wood) and Dylan (Hartley) were disappointed not to be in the XV last week and they are desperate to go out and perform on Saturday so that we finish the series on a high."
