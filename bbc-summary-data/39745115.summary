Honeymooners have been touched by the generosity of a mystery well-wisher who spotted "just married" written on their car while parked at a Skye beauty spot.

Jed and Charlotte Case, from Edinburgh, were visiting the Fairy Pools in Glen Brittle earlier this week.
When they returned from their walk they found a note on their car.
Inside was a Â£10 note and the message: "Here's to a (small) round of drinks, a good time in Skye and a great life together."
A guest at the couple's wedding in Blair Atholl, Perthshire, had written "just married" on the rear bumper of their Fiat in dry-wide marker pen.
The newly-weds later headed to Skye for their honeymoon, with the Fairy Pools being among the sites on the island they visited.
Mr Case said: "We went for a walk and came back to the car where Charlotte noticed something on the windscreen.
"Amazingly, some very kind fairies had noticed our 'just married' sign and left the hand written note with money inside, underneath our windscreen wiper.
"I was blown away to be honest, at first I thought it was a parking ticket.
"I looked around the car park but couldn't see anyone to thank.
"We got back in the car and went for drink in the Old Inn in Carbost."
He added: "It was incredibly kind and it is a moment that we will never forget.
"We'll always be able to tell the honeymoon story of the fairies who gave us the most unforgettable wedding present.
"If the fairies see this, thank you so much."
