Staff at Naughty 'n' Nice  in Liverpool said they were threatened with what appeared to be a black handgun before the man stole cash from the counter.
Police said staff at the Colquitt Street store reported the robber left the shop after a brief struggle at 17:40 BST.
Police have issued CCTV images of a man wanted in connection with the incident.
The suspect was described as wearing a red dress, wig, grey cap and white gloves.
Det Insp Steve McGrath from Merseyside Police said: "The staff at the shop were thankfully unhurt but understandably distressed to be threatened with what had the appearance of a firearm, regardless of whether it was real or fake.
"I would appeal to anyone in the Colquitt Street area who saw a man dressed as described and acting suspiciously to contact police."
