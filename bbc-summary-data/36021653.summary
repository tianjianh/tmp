Joe Pigott put the Hatters ahead with a cool finish in the first half, and Josh McQuoid tucked in a close range second after the break.
Carlisle gained hope when Jack Stacey drilled in from the edge of the box.
However, the visitors defended resolutely to climb above the Cumbrians to 13th in the League Two table and remain six points off the top seven.
