The cities are linked by the A6, long stretches of which are not dual carriageway
Stormont's 2016/17 budget made money available for improvements, as part of its infrastructure priorities.
On Sunday, the Transport Minister Michelle McIlveen said work would begin this year on dualling the section between Randalstown and Castledawson.
She said: "This is a major investment for the north west and will be very welcome news to the local construction industry.
"The A6 dualling scheme is a significant project that will help to remove a major bottleneck and so improve safety and journey times on this strategically important route."
A  Graham/Farrans joint venture has already been awarded the contract for the work and the minister said the scheme is "shovel ready".
