It follows inspections at Brighton's Royal Sussex County Hospital and the Princess Royal Hospital, in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, in April.
Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust has until the end of August to improve its performance.
The trust said it was "working hard on delivering an improvement plan".
Deputy chief inspector of hospitals, Prof Edward Baker, said patients were "entitled to a service that is consistently safe, effective and responsive to their needs".
"We have told the trust they must improve and treat patients in a timely manner with care, dignity and respect."
He added that inspectors would be returning to the hospitals "in the near future to check that the trust has got an improved grip on these immediate issues".
The CQC report is due to be published later in the summer.
Dr Gillian Fairfield, interim chief executive at the trust, said the warning notice had made "difficult reading".
"We are very sorry that we have let down our patients, their relatives and our local communities.
"For the trust board and our executive leadership the priority now is to do everything we can to put matters right and ensure that our patients receive the safe and high quality care that they deserve and have a right to expect.
