'Frank's Law' dementia campaigner to seek election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners for a change to Scottish dementia care are to field a Holyrood election candidate against Health Secretary Shona Robison in Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Kelly is to stand in the Scottish Parliament elections on behalf of the "Frank's Law" group.
Amanda Kopel, wife of former Dundee United footballer Frank, who died last year, has been calling for free care for dementia patients aged under 65.
Mrs Kopel said the current system of care represents "age discrimination".
Mr Kopel, who made 407 appearances for the Tayside club, died in April 2014 aged 65 after battling vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
He only qualified for free personal care after he turned 65, and Mrs Kopel has been campaigning for this "loophole" to be closed.
She led a demonstration outside Ms Robison's Dundee office, and was invited in to discuss the matter with the health secretary in person.
Mrs Kopel said: "For 27 months we've been begging and pleading with the Scottish government to change the ruling on free personal care for under 65s.
"It's age discrimination. We keep getting excuses and excuses.
"To be honest I'm saddened and delighted - I'm saddened that it's had to come to this, to do a demonstration, but I'm delighted that there are so many people supporting us all across Scotland."
Mrs Kopel said she had been urged to stand in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections herself, but said she would throw her support behind Mr Kelly.
Former health secretary Alex Neil met the couple at their Kirriemuir home before Mr Kopel died, and pledged to bring their concerns to parliament.
