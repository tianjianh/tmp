Sarah Groves murder trial 'at risk of collapse'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lack of evidence has placed the trial of a man accused of murdering Guernsey woman Sarah Groves in Kashmir at risk of collapse, the BBC understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dutch national Richard de Wit, 43, denies charges of murder and illegally fleeing the state.
Earlier, the trial was adjourned as the prosecution again failed to provide the murder weapon before the court.
BBC reporter Riyaz Masroor said there was "every chance the case could collapse" if no evidence is produced.
Sarah Groves was found stabbed to death on a houseboat in Srinagar, where she had been living with a local family, on 6 April.
During Mr de Wit's trial, the court heard that there was an issue with the forensic evidence.
The prosecution lawyer said the state authorities did not have the proper facilities to rule if the items seized from the houseboat were actually used in the murder.
The items seized, believed to be several knives and a pair of scissors, have been sent to the neighbouring state of Punjab for analysis, the BBC's reporter said.
Mr de Wit's lawyer said the prosecution had put forward no convincing or substantial evidence and claimed the authorities were "framing" his client, he added.
The trial is due to resume on 16 September.
