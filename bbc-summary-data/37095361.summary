[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer who carried out sex attacks on three girls dating back decades has been jailed for three-and-a-half years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Duncan Mulholland denied abusing the girls at Torrylinn Farm, Arran, and a house in Uplawmoor, East Renfrewshire, between April 1987 and September 2008.
But a jury at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court found him guilty of abusing the girls, aged seven, 12 and 15, after hearing how he entered rooms as they slept.
Mulholland, 55, was also placed on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
The jury found Mulholland guilty of three charges of lewd and libidinous behaviour.
He claimed the allegations were fabricated and made as a result of a feud.
Giving evidence in his own defence, Mulholland said there was always a lot of children about the 50-acre farm, which he compared to a Highland croft.
"It was a big area and a safe place for them to play," he said, adding he had never sexually abused any child.
When cautioned and charged by police, Mulholland replied: "I know where this is coming from."
He told the jury: "I knew somebody was plotting against me."
Sheriff Alistair Watson told him "no other method of disposal was appropriate" other than custody.
