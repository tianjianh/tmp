Sadiq Khan proposes scrapping London crime targets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mayor of London has proposed to scrap city-wide crime targets as part of a new Police and Crime Plan.

Sadiq Khan called the targets "crude" and said allowing local areas control of where they prioritise work would "restore real neighbourhood policing".
The draft plan also proposes that each ward will have two dedicated police officers and suggests measures to cut knife crime and improve victim support.
Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the plan would enable "the best police service".
The "MOPAC 7" targets were introduced by Boris Johnson and aimed to reduce crimes by at least 20% in seven categories: burglary, vandalism/criminal damage, theft from motor vehicles, theft of motor vehicles, violence with injury, robbery, and theft from the person.
But the policy was recently criticised by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary who said police efforts were too focussed on these crimes resulting in children being "put at risk".
Mr Khan said his police plan would "make sure local priorities reflect local concerns" and "build trust and confidence in policing".
Other proposals include:
Sir Bernard, the Met commissioner, said the force would "need to change the way it recruits, operates, and evolves".
"These changes will touch every element of our organisation, making us more diverse [and] more efficient," he said.
A public consultation will take place until 23 February with the final plan published by the end of March 2017.
