Ards Borough Council failed to appoint a contractor to undertake the work at the attraction in Portaferry, County Down, earlier this year.
As a result, £214,000 promised by the Department of the Environment to secure the centre's future has been lost.
The aquarium will now be closed until at least the end of the year.
It is not clear when it will open again.
Elaine Roddy, from Friends of Exploris, said the attraction should reopen its doors to the public, at least for the summer period.
"We don't believe there is any reason why it can't be reopened," she said.
"Most of the tanks are still operational. There are seals in the sanctuary at the moment.
"We are embarrassed living in Portaferry and we don't know what is happening."
Portaferry SDLP councillor Joe Boyle said the process had been a "total mess" and was "very disappointing".
"While we thought the biggest battle was getting the awarding of the funding, it now transpires the biggest battle to get Exploris open is actually finding somebody to do the work," he said.
Last year, Environment Minister Mark H Durkan committed £914,000 to refurbish and save the aquarium.
But since £214,000 was not claimed by Ards Borough Council, it is no longer available, leaving £700,000 for the refurbishment work if its carried out by the end of this year.
The new Ards and North Down Borough Council is trying to get the £214,000 reinstated.
A council spokesperson said the council "remains committed to the Exploris facility".
"[The council] has both written to and met with Minster Durkan and asked him to consider reinstating the amount to match the £914,000 offered in September 2014," the spokesperson added.
Portaferry café owner Patricia Donaldson said the local economy was being hit by the continued closure of Exploris.
"I don't think we have felt the full impact of this," she said.
"People come here from as far away as Dublin. They come through Strangford. They get the ferry across. It's all part of the experience.
"I think it is affecting everywhere.  It is places on the way here, too. They are all suffering."
Ms Roddy said people often turned up in the town unaware that the attraction was closed.
"We think the communication has not been in place properly," she added.
Ron O'Connor, from Boston in the United States, is one tourist who was left disappointed to find Exploris was closed.
He said: "I'm a little bit sad. We've come a long way, it would've been very nice to see it. It's unusual to have an aquarium that works the way it did."
But the council spokesperson rejected Ms Roddy criticism and said the closure of Exploris was "well publicised in the media".
"The council has undertaken significant social media activity to reinforce the message over the past few months. Signage about the closure has been put up.
"The council remains committed to completing the refurbishment of Exploris and ensuring it has a sustainable future."
The council spokesperson added that a further update would be provided when the minister responds with regard to the capital funding offer.
The seal sanctuary at the aquarium will remain open, but there will be no access to the general public.
This is the first summer since the facility was opened by Ards Borough Council in 1987 that the aquarium has been closed to the public.
