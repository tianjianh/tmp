[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cape Verde Islands 0-0 Zambia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cape Verde and Zambia both bowed out of the African Cup of Nations after a game which at one point looked as though it would stop because of torrential rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Persistent showers fell through the first half and the rain became extremely heavy during half-time and in the early stages of the second half.
Puddles appeared on the pitch but play continued and the rain finally stopped.
Zambia's Evans Kangwa missed a great chance late on while Antonio Varela earlier headed over at the other end.
Cape Verde missed out on qualifying on goals scored after only finding the net once in three matches, with a penalty, compared to DR Congo's two strikes.
The weather will be the main talking point in a match from which either side could have qualified for the quarter-finals.
Tunisia's first-half goal against DR Congo left Cape Verde, who only needed a draw to go through, in pole position but the equaliser in that match meant that both teams progressed.
Zambia, winners in 2012, needed a victory to progress and Rainford Kalaba came close to putting his side ahead in the 24th minute when he cut inside and hit a shot which deflected past the post.
Seven minutes later, Zambia failed to clear a free-kick which was hit deep into their penalty area and the ball broke to Calu who blazed over the bar.
Kalaba caused Cape Verde more problems three minutes before half-time when his free-kick from 25 yards forced goalkeeper Vozinha to punch the ball away.
But the Blue Sharks nearly went ahead seconds before the interval when Varela stooped to meet a free-kick six yards out but could only head over the top.
The early stages of the second half were farcical with players struggling to keep their footing and pass the ball more than a few yards at times.
But the match continued and as the rain stopped falling, the conditions eased for the players.
Cape Verde substitute Djaniny tried his luck from 20 yards out midway through the second half but Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene was equal to it.
Djaniny caused more problems nine minutes later when he combined with fellow substitute Odair Fortes but he could not quite beat Mweene.
Zambia's moment arrived in the 78th minute when a lovely centre from Chisamba Lungu set up Kangwa but he somehow missed the target from 10 yards.
Cape Verde coach Rui Aguas:
"I'm very sad and disappointed with the result but not with my players. They did all they could.
"We missed a lot of chances in three games but we gave 100 per cent, we gave our all.
"Zambia and us were the best teams in the group. For Congo there is happiness. One goal makes all the difference, one miss makes all the difference. Football is often cruel and it is now our turn to feel it."
Zambia coach Honour Janza: "It is sad but let us be positive that the future looks bright for our team, the young boys we came with here will be a force in African football in the next two to three years."
