Immigration numbers: How many are coming to the UK?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP has unveiled its policy on immigration.

It's a big part of their campaign.
Party leader Nigel Farage says he wants immigration back to "normal" levels.
What does that mean?
There have been a lot of numbers flying around.
We've broken down some key statistics for you.
Net migration is the difference between the number of people moving into and out of the country.
UKIP want an "Australian-style points-based visa system" which they say will ensure only skilled workers are allowed into the country.
298,000 is the net migration figure to the UK for the year up to September 2014.
That's up 88,000 from the year before - a "significant" increase, according to the Office for National Statistics. Additionally it's up 46,000 from the last election.
But that number is still below the peak of 320,000 which was recorded in the first half of 2005.
Other things you might find interesting about immigration in 2010:
In 2011, the prime minister promised to get net migration down to "tens of thousands" each year.
At first it looked as though that target might be hit.
Immigration began to fall during 2011 because of policies like cracking down on "bogus" colleges and making fewer non-EU visas available.
But the worsening economic situation across Europe meant that people from countries like Spain and Portugal began to head to the UK in search of work.
Chancellor George Osborne says that the target still stands.
Net migration from EU: 251,000 people
Net migration from the rest of the world: 292,000 people
The number of people coming to the UK from outside the EU is higher than those from non-EU countries.
