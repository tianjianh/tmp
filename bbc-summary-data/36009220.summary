[SN]TITLE[SN]
Llangwm archaeological dig to unearth Flemish past

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An archaeological dig is taking place on a Pembrokeshire farm in a bid to unearth more about its Flemish past.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Volunteers will be taking part in a three-week dig on the farm near Llangwm with Dyfed Archaeological Trust.
It forms part of the Heritage Llangwm project, which aims to find out more about the village's 12th Century Flemish founders.
The dig site is home to a medieval dovecote and possibly a Flemish manor house.
James Meek, of Dyfed Archaeological Trust, said: "The ideal would be to find a rubbish tip with medieval artefacts and other material that's come from Flanders."
Heritage Llangwm has received grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Cadw.
Money has already been spent on restoration works to the village's St Jerome's Church, which was built by Flemish craftsmen about 800 years ago.
