Kim Little and Rachel Corsie have been left out of Scotland women's squad for Thursday's friendly against Netherlands in Livingston because of injuries.

Uncapped forward Zoe Ness, of Mallbackens, and Scotland Under-19s captain and midfielder Erin Cuthbert, who has one senior cap, are included.
Defender Frankie Brown returns to the squad after long-term injury.
The visit of the Dutch is part of the preparation for Euro 2017, which will be hosted by the Dutch.
Scotland manager Anna Signeul told BBC Scotland: "They have gone two years without any qualification games, but they have had good preparation and had lots of time together, so I expect a very good Holland side to turn up.
"They have world-class players and have done really well and had two very good players playing here for Bayern Munich against Hibs this week, so I expect a tough game."
Signeul believes that the Dutch are the right kind of opponents for the Scots to resolve some tactical failings they encountered in recent matches.
"We have had problems against physical teams," she admitted. "Holland is a tall team, quite physical, quite fast.
"They also have some brilliant players, such as Vivianne Miedema, who plays for Bayern Munich with Lisa."
Midfielder Evans is named in the squad having helped Bayern Munich knock Hibernian out of the Women's Champions League in the round of 32.
However, Signeul will be without two of her other top players - Little and Corsie having picked up injuries as Seattle Reign's season drew to a close in the United States.
"Unfortunately for Rachel, she had a knee operation in August," Signeul pointed out. "We thought she was coming back for the Iceland game, but it was a bigger operation than expected, so she missed the whole end of the season with Seattle.
"She had a little set-back last week, so it's better that she focuses on rehab - and Kim has a little bit of an issue as well.
"We have Frankie back in the squad after a long injury and she is just back playing in Bristol so might not play the full game.
"It's nice to have Erin Cuthbert back involved in the squad as she has a great footballing brain and technique for a young player.
"She had a great debut against Belarus earlier this year and we're looking forward to seeing her continue to develop."
Scotland Women reached their first major tournament before last month's final qualifier against Iceland - a match Signeul's side won 2-1 - and the team boss will be prioritising another confidence-boosting win ahead of any experimentation.
"We're still on a high from qualification for the Euros and everyone is looking forward to preparing as best as possible for next summer," she added.
