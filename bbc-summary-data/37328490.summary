Celtic 5-1 Rangers: Pat Bonner & Steven Thompson rate the players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first league meeting between Celtic and Rangers in four years proved to be a one-sided affair as the Scottish Premiership champions routed their great rivals 5-1 at Parkhead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
French striker Moussa Dembele became the first player to score an Old Firm league hat-trick for 50 years, while Swiss defender Philippe Senderos marked his Rangers debut with a red card.
So how did the players perform individually?  Former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner rated the home side, while ex-Rangers striker Steven Thompson gave marks out of 10 for the visitors.

Dorus de Vries (goalkeeper) 7
He won't get a quieter game. He was maybe caught a little bit with the goal going over his head, but will be delighted to have made that big save right at the end.
Mikael Lustig (defender) 6
Maybe got caught a bit for the goal, moving out of position, but a steady game.  Rangers didn't do too much down his side.
Kole Toure (defender) 7
A very solid display, showing his experience.  He gave nothing away and cruised through the game.
Erik Sviatchenko (defender) 7
Same as Toure.  Very steady, and they made a good solid partnership in central defence.
Kieran Tierney (defender) 7
Didn't give anything away defensively and bombed forward as the creator down the left-hand side for Celtic, giving them width. He was the one who cut the ball back to Stuart Armstrong for the final goal.
Scott Brown (midfielder) 7
Great performance. He won his battle with Joey Barton, although they didn't come into contact too often.  He certainly dominated the middle of the park.
Nir Bitton (midfielder) 6
A quiet match for him alongside Brown, but the Israeli was nice and steady.
James Forrest (midfielder) 7
Had an exceptional start to the game, and was a very effective 'out' ball for his side. A very creative player.
Tom Rogic (midfielder) 6
A quieter outing than of late; he looked a bit tired from all his travels during the international break. Didn't quite happen for him but did well enough.
Scott Sinclair (winger) 8
In the first half he was a real creative force, getting in behind the Rangers defence. Has the turn of pace to unsettle anyone and got another goal.
Moussa Dembele (forward) 9
I don't give nines too often but he scored a hat-trick on his Old Firm debut, and that doesn't happen too often. He took all his goals well, especially his second and third, but his all-round game was exceptional - he held the ball up well, brought people into the game and also set up Sinclair for his goal.
Patrick Roberts 5 - Has the ability, but I thought he could have done a bit more later in the game after replacing Forrest.
Stuart Armstrong 7 - A really big impact.  Influenced everything in that second half, and took his goal well with a really composed finish.  Looked sharp and alert.
Callum McGregor 6 - Came on when the game was almost over, but sat in midfield and helped control the game with his passing.
Wes Foderingham (goalkeeper) 5
Didn't really have much chance with the goals but he has eventually conceded five, which will hurt.
James Tavernier (defender) 5
Didn't offer as much of a threat going forward as usual, but put in a good ball that led to Rangers' goal.
Philippe Senderos (defender) 3
Sent off on his debut for an inexcusable handball.  You expect better for a player of his experience.
Rob Kiernan (defender) 3
Was at fault for the second Celtic goal after a terrible pass and never looked truly comfortable.
Lee Wallace (defender) 5
I thought James Forrest got the better of him on a few occasions.  Tried his best going forward but lost the battle.
Joey Barton (midfielder) 5
Started the game reasonably well but was eventually overrun by Celtic's dominant midfield.
Josh Windass (midfielder) 6
Was Rangers' best player in the first half.  At least he tried to be positive on the ball.
Niko Kranjcar (midfielder) 3
Ineffectual, lost possession regularly, booked and off the pace again.
Barrie McKay (forward) 5
He looked quite bright in the first half and went close with a curling effort in the second half. Tried to make things happen.
Kenny Miller (forward) 5
Did well for the goal, but was played out of position out wide and spent most of the match having to defend.
Joe Garner (forward) 5
He scored the goal - albeit right on the line - and worked hard, but was largely ineffectual.
Andy Halliday (midfielder) 5 - Tried his best to add energy to the Rangers midfield, but lost the struggle, like his team.
Martyn Waghorn (forward) 3 - Came on for the last half-hour. Missed Rangers' best chance in the last minute, but had little impact.
Harry Forrester (winger) 3 -I can't remember him touching the ball. Never got involved.
