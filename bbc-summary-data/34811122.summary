A meeting of Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) decided to retain the ban, which has existed since Metrolink's launch in 1992.
The authority decision follows a consultation of more than 2,400 completed online and Metrolink passenger surveys.
TfGM reiterated the ban did not apply to assistance dogs.
Councillor Andrew Fender, chair of the TfGM committee said the decision was taken on safety grounds.
"While the vast majority of dog owners are responsible, there is no way to guarantee all dog owners will ensure their dogs behave appropriately and do not represent a nuisance or, worse still, a risk to passengers," he said.
Dog lovers had campaigned on social media for the ban to be lifted.
