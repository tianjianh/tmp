The Toomebridge rider is making the switch after his Aspar Ducati team signed Alvaro Bautista.
Bautista will compete in a GP16 model next year while Laverty faced the prospect of racing the older GP15.
Laverty, who is poised to sign a superbike deal with SMR to ride a new factory Aprilia, said he has "unfinished business" in WorldSBK.
The 30-year-old is currently 11th in the MotoGP standings with 63 points from 11 rounds.
Laverty, who was runner-up in WorldSBK in 2013, had hoped to continue in MotoGP beyond this year but feels he would not be competitive in 2017.
"I kept pushing to try and get a GP16," Laverty told Crash.net.
"But when I knew that my team-mate was going to be on a GP16 and there was just going to be a GP15 [for me] it was a case of head over heart.
"Ultimately it was the competitiveness of the machinery that tipped the balance for me.
"I would really be up against it in MotoGP if I was to continue riding a two-year-old bike, whereas in World Superbikes I will have a bike and team capable of winning races each and every race weekend.
"At the end of the day the very reason I go racing is to win.
"Perhaps I could return to MotoGP one day as World Superbike champion, that really would be something very special."
