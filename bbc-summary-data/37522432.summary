Anderson, 44, will form part of the staff alongside head coach Wayne Bennett and fellow coaches Denis Betts and Paul Wellens.
He will also support football manager Jamie Peacock to prepare training and recovery sessions for the squad.
"I thought it would be a good fit for me," Anderson said.
"The biggest factor in taking this job was the opportunity to work alongside Wayne, Denis and Paul.
"To see people who have been in the game for long periods and learn from them is something I'm looking forward to."
England will face Australia, New Zealand and Scotland in the Four Nations, which starts on 28 October with Scotland against Australia at Hull KR's Lightstream Stadium and England against New Zealand at Huddersfield's John Smith's Stadium on 29 October.
During Anderson's time at Huddersfield, the Giants finished top for the first time in 81 years with the 2013 League Leaders' Shield, posting three top-four finishes in three full seasons in charge.
As a player, the Castleford-born prop made 10 appearances for Great Britain and five for England.
