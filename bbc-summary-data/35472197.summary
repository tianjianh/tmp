Porsche boss rejects driverless cars

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Porsche has no plans to develop driverless cars, unlike most other carmakers who are embracing the autonomous driving revolution, its chief executive has said.

Oliver Blume told German newspaper Westfalen-Blatt that people wanted "to drive a Porsche by oneself".
He added that Porsche did not need to team up with any tech firms.
Analysts Boston Consulting Group predict that by 2025, 13% of cars will have autonomous features.
Porsche does, however, intend to launch electric vehicles, and a plug-in hybrid of the 911 model with a range of 50 km (31 miles) will hit the market as early as 2018, Mr Blume said.
Porsche also plans to spend about 1bn euros ($1.1bn) on production facilities to build the Mission E, its first-ever all-electric model, a move reflecting parent VW's growing commitment to increase its electric offerings as it struggles to overcome an emissions scandal.
VW, along with most of the big carmakers, has signalled its intention to work on driverless cars and at tech show CES revealed a partnership with Mobileye, which produces real-time image processing cameras. It plans to put the cameras in future cars to create high definition maps of roads and environments as a basis for driverless cars.
Meanwhile rival Ford is expected to announce a tie-up with Google to work on its driverless cars.
Tesla boss Elon Musk predicts that it will have a fully self-driving car by 2018.
