Captain Sean Newton says Wrexham's new-look squad has bonded well ahead of the National League season.

Wrexham kick off the new season at home to Dover Athletic on Saturday after making 18 summer signings.
Newton, 27, is one of only three players to remain from last season but says a much changed squad is ready for the new campaign.
"It doesn't feel like a totally new squad to me," Newton told BBC Wales Sport.
"The lads have come in and they've bonded really well and really quickly.
"I think the few days away together in Nottingham helped massively. We've trained everyday together and gone for food together."
Wrexham's trip to Nottingham included a 2-0 win against a Forest XI during an unbeaten pre-season campaign.
Defender Newton, an ever present last season, says he has been happy with their preparations and is "raring to go."
"We've seen what our strengths and weaknesses are," added Newton, appointed captain for the new season following the departure of Connor Jennings to Tranmere.
"We've worked on our weaknesses and I think we've put them to bed.
"Hopefully by the first game those weaknesses will have gone and we'll get three points on the board."
