Brendan Rodgers was delighted to keep Celtic's "incredible run" going as a 4-0 win over Hearts set a new record for the club's best start to a season.

The Premiership leaders are unbeaten in 27 domestic games, eclipsing the 1966-67 opening from the European Cup-winning Lisbon Lions side.
"It is a huge achievement considering the great history of this club," manager Rodgers told BBC Scotland.
"We are very proud and it was an outstanding performance."
Midfielder Callum McGregor, who only started because Stuart Armstrong pulled up with a tight hamstring in the warm-up, fired Celtic in front after 29 minutes.
Scott Sinclair, who began the game at centre-forward as Moussa Dembele and Leigh Griffiths missed out through injuries, netted a double - the second from a late penalty, while Patrick Roberts was also on target in a one-sided contest.
"It is an incredible run and every accolade they get they deserve because of their focus, the spirit within the team and the quality of the football they are producing," added Rodgers, who has won all but one of his 22 league matches since taking over in the summer.

"We have set the challenge going forward.
"We have to keep winning and that comes from our work, our concentration and making sure we take care of all the background noise that goes around them and just focus on the job. The players were magnificent.
"I can see what [head coach] Ian Cathro is trying to do and, given time, he should improve Hearts, but we wore them down.
"Great credit to the players. We tried something, playing one of our wingers as a striker.
"After the first 20 minutes, it wasn't working and we put Scott Sinclair back into his natural position and we put Pat Roberts in there and his movement was better.
"It shows how well the players work together, the different ideas which they can take on board."
