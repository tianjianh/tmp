Election 2015: Sir Bob Russell loses Colchester seat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Long-standing Liberal Democrat MP Sir Bob Russell has lost his seat to the Conservatives.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First elected as MP for Colchester in 1997, he was returned in 2010 with a 7,000 majority.
He has lost his seat to Conservative Will Quince who was voted in with a 5,575 majority.
Sir Bob said: "Last week I thought it might happen. I got elected on a national tide in 1997 and the national tide has taken me out."
His ousting means the Liberal Democrats no longer have a seat in Essex.
