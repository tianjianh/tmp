[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are more children in care in Northern Ireland than ever before.

At present, 2,875 children are in the system, the highest figure since current records began in 1995.
It can take at least three and a half years for a child in care to be placed with a new family, and many argue that's just too long.
As part of National Adoption week, BBC Northern Ireland is showing a two part documentary looking at the intricacies of the child care system here.
Over two nights filmmakers follow 11 young people, aged between 18 months and 18-years-old, on their individual journeys through the care system.
The documentary hears from social workers dealing directly with each case, and from the families and individuals who have a child going into care as well as those hoping to provide them with a new home.
One social worker who features in the documentary, Patrick O'Connor, works in Antrim.
He has helped hundreds of children over the years and says adopting a child can be difficult but extremely rewarding.
"You're constantly dealing with issues that shouldn't happen, and that is coming from sexual abuse and physical abuse, abandonment and all those things, and one child could suffer all those things.
"The emotional impact on the child is so devastating for them, what can you do to resolve it for that child?  That's the task.
"You have to build a relationship with that child that carries them through the worst of times and the best of times," he said.
A lot of people consider adoption to be an option just for couples who cannot have their own children.
However foster parent, Jackie Bradley, says that is just not the case.
She says fulfilling the role of mum and dad is just one small part of it.
"Primarily it's all about that child having permanence and finding security and stability in their life for maybe the first time ever."
Producer Rachel Hooper said the resilience of the children she spoke with was "just remarkable".
"They are carrying an enormous amount of complex need - the result of neglect and abuse that they have suffered, and they need amazing people who can take them on.
"I knew it was a big thing to do, but I had no idea just how important it was to have these carers there," she said.
"There is such a need for carers, such a need for people to say 'how can I help?'"
Rachel said one of her motivations was to help document a part of each child's life story for them to see when they are older so that they know a bit more about where they came from.
"You don't walk out when you've walked in - so it's inevitable that we'll stay in touch with them.
"I can't wait to hear about the changes in their lives and the different journeys they embark on."
Find Me A Family can be seen on BBC One NI on Monday, October 19 at 21:00 BST, with the second programme scheduled for broadcast on Monday, October 26 at 21:00 BST.
