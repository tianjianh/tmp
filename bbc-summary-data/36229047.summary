[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour loses total control of Manchester City Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour has lost full control of Manchester City Council after the Liberal Democrats won one seat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lib Dems' John Leech won the Didsbury West, ending Labour's 100% control of the authority.
Labour had held all 96 seats since 2014. Its candidate Barnaby Lane was beaten by 702 votes.
Mr Leech, who was an MP for Manchester Withington before he lost his seat in the 2015 General Election, took 53% of the vote.
"I couldn't be happier to be back on the council and back in a position to help local residents," he said.
"Thank you so much to everyone who voted, supported and campaigned. This is a dream."
