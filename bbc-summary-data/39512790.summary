The construction supply and packaging firm has posted increased pre-tax profits of 6.8 million euros (Â£5.8m) for 2016.
The company, comprising of operations once run by Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, employs more than 770 people.
Its headquarters is in Derrylin in Fermanagh, but has operations in the Republic of Ireland and England.
Chief executive Liam McCaffrey said: "We see Brexit as presenting challenges, which we will continue to assess as a clearer picture emerges from trade negotiations.
"Whatever the outcome our focus is on those factors which fall within our control and ensuring an efficient supply chain to the UK mainland, which accounts for 50% of our sales."
Mr Quinn left his position as a consultant at the firm a year ago.
