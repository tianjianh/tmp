Insp Boris Lasserre said: "The bolt has gone right through the lower part of the goose's head. Incredibly he was still alive.
"He was taken to the RSPCA Birmingham Animal Hospital for treatment and X-rays to establish the damage that has been caused by the bolt and the safest way to remove it.
"This poor bird was the victim of a mindless cruelty. It beggars belief that someone would get enjoyment out of doing something like this."
