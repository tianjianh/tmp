Adam Scott clinched his maiden major title and became the first Australian winner of the Masters with victory against former champion Angel Cabrera in a sudden death play-off at Augusta.

Scott, 32, holed a 15ft birdie putt in deteriorating light across the 10th green on the second extra hole to deprive Argentina's 2009 winner after both players birdied the 18th in regulation to reach nine under on a dank, drizzly day.
The Masters in numbers
Australian Jason Day, runner up with Scott in 2011, was third at seven under with Tiger Woods (70) and another Australian Marc Leishman (72) tied for fourth at five under.
"It fell my way today, there was some luck there but it's incredible to be in this position. I'm honoured," said Scott, who squandered a four-shot lead with four to play to lose the Open to Ernie Els last year.
"This is the one thing in golf we hadn't been able to achieve," he added. "It's amazing that it's my destiny to be the first Australian to win."
Scott rolled in a stunning long birdie putt on the 18th for a 69 to snatch a one-shot lead over Cabrera, who was waiting back down the fairway in the final group. The Argentine kept his focus despite the roars from the green and hit his approach to a few feet before making his birdie for a 70 to join Scott.
Both came up slightly short of the 18th green on the first extra hole and Cabrera, playing first, almost holed his chip and tapped in from a foot for a four.

Scott left his chip three feet shy but holed it and they went back down the 10th. They both hit good approaches to the heart of the green but Cabrera, who won a play-off against Chad Campbell and Kenny Perry three years ago, missed his putt before Scott made his.
"That's how golf is. I came back and I had that chip on 18, I could have won it," said Cabrera.
"But Adam's a good winner. I would have been happier if I had won but he's a great player, I get along with him, we've played together in the President's Cup and I'm happy for him."
Cabrera, the joint overnight leader with Brandt Snedeker, held a two-shot lead at nine under during the first nine but on the way home he shared the lead with Scott and Day, who was two in front with three to play before bogeys at 16 and 17.
Woods was four behind at the start of the day after being penalised two shots for an illegal drop on Friday, but struggled to ignite his round and carded a two-under 70 for a seventh top four in his last eight Masters following his last win in 2005.
"Everyone felt for Adam after the 2012 Open. 'Under-achiever' is an unfair tag, but everyone thought that he would have more by the age of 32. He'll now start to plan more and more for the majors, I would not be surprised if he starts contending at all of them. This is the shot in the arm that Australian golf needed. This will get people back on the golf course and start the kids playing again. It will be such a big thing."
The 14-time major champion, chasing his fifth Green Jacket and first major title since 2008, said his putting cost him.
"I played well, unfortunately I just didn't make enough putts and also missed a few shots here and there," said Woods, the world number one.
"I certainly had an opportunity.  If I shot 65 I thought I could win it outright, and it looked like that might be the number. I just couldn't quite get the peed right the first eight holes I left them short."
American Snedeker slumped to a 75 for four under with 23-year-old Danish debutant Thorbjorn Olesen, who finished with a 68 to head the European challenge.
England's Lee Westwood once again led the British challenge and got to four under at the seventh before finishing three under with a 71. The 39-year-old, who was second in 2010 and third last year, is still chasing his first major at the 60th attempt.
"Any time you finish top 10 in a major you've got to be pleased with that," said Westwood. "There's not too many negatives to take away."
Sergio Garcia (70) and Matt Kuchar (73) also finished three under, while Open champion Ernie Els and Friday's halfway leader Fred Couples, 53, ended in a group on one under.
World number two Rory McIlroy improved on his third round by 10 shots with a 69 to end on two over.
"I didn't feel that I played that differently today, but this golf course, if you get on the wrong side of it, can make you look a little silly at times," he said.
"Yesterday [round of 79] was very disappointing. If I had kept that round under control then I might have been in with a chance today. But I was pleased with my round today and that is something to build on for the rest of the season."
England's Luke Donald (72) and Justin Rose (74) also ended two over along with two-time former champion Bernhard Langer, 55, who enjoyed a little cameo with three straight birdies to start before running out of steam, finishing with a 76.
"It was fun while it lasted, just didn't last long enough in the end," said the German.
Defending champion Bubba Watson took a 10 at the short 12th in a round of 77 to end seven over.
"I made a good putt for a 10. No big deal," said Watson, who found the water with his tee shot and then had trouble after firing long with his replacement.
Scotland's Paul Lawrie ended four over after a 72, English debutant David Lynn finished with a 71 for five over and Sandy Lyle, 25 years after winning the Green Jacket, finished nine over alongside three-time champion Phil Mickelson.
Chinese 14-year-old amateur Guan Tianlang finished with a 75 for 12 over on his remarkable debut that saw him become the youngest Masters competitor and youngest player to make the cut at a major, and winner of the low amateur prize.
