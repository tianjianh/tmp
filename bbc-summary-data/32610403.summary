[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Army recruitment sergeant who used his power to "control" young female recruits has been found guilty of three further sex assaults.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edwin Mee, 46, of Glasgow, had denied targetting cadets while working at Croydon's Mitcham Barracks in 2010 and 2011.
In total, the father-of-five was convicted of 16 offences against nine victims.
He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 12 June.
On Tuesday, Mee was convicted at Southwark Crown Court of 10 sex assaults, two rapes and an assault by penetration.
He preyed on his victims, whose ages ranged from 15 to the early twenties, at the barracks' careers and information office.
During his trial, the court heard Mee would stay late at the careers centre and conduct interviews with applicants out of hours to "deliberately" target his victims.
One 15-year-old told the trial she was kissed against her wishes while a 16-year-old said Mee slapped her bottom.
Another said she saw Mee as a father figure until he raped her.
Prosecutor Rosina Cottage told the court: "This is a pattern of bullying sexual behaviour that was repeated again and again to the female cadets to make them feel that he had power over them and control over their future."
Jurors were discharged after failing to reach a verdict on one count of rape and one of sexual assault, having spent more than 30 hours deliberating.
Mee had denied all 21 charges against him and was cleared of three sex assault allegations.
