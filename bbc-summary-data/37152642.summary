Sid Rollason, who died aged 100 on 12 August, kept his service medals on display in the sitting room of his Bilston home.
He served in Africa, Greece and Italy during the conflict.
West Midlands Police confirmed it is investigating the theft.
The break-in is believed to have taken place between 09:00 on 18 August and 07:30 BST on 21 August.

Aside from his wartime service Mr Rollason lived his whole life in Bilston, and was married to wife Dolly for 77 years until her death last year.
The couple had three children, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
His family has now launched an appeal on social media to find his medals.
Rory Rollason, from Coseley, said it was desperate to find his great-grandfather's decorations.
"They completely trashed the house and when we were down there we found they'd taken the World War Two medals," the 16-year-old said.
"It's shameful that they've been stolen like that."
Paul Rollason said his grandfather's wartime service was an important part of the family's history.
"[Dolly] always told a story of going to the cinemas and seeing him on the Pathe News - the only way she knew he was still alive," he said.
"We cannot believe that someone would break in. Obviously it must be someone who was aware of the situation."
