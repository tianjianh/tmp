Just 10 children were responsible for a quarter of all missing person reports in Aberdeen last year, with one going missing 45 times, it has been revealed.

Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) reviewed the way police in Aberdeen dealt with missing person inquiries.
The report said 10 children accounted for 290 of the 1,120 episodes.
A total of 41% of all missing person cases related to children aged between 12 and 15.
The HMICS praised the force's "strong leadership" and said reports of missing people were being properly investigated.
HMICS has made four recommendations for improvements for Aberdeen city division and seven for Police Scotland nationally.
The creation of the single police force meant Police Scotland "inherited a complex and divergent approach to the management of missing person investigations across Scotland", the report found, with different systems for recording missing persons cases and different risk assessment tools.
HM Inspector of Constabulary Derek Penman said: "The importance of dealing with missing person investigations effectively from the outset cannot be over-emphasised and experience has shown that in some instances the report of a missing person is the first indicator that a serious crime has occurred.
"There is usually a reason why a person goes missing and understanding the circumstances and causes creates an opportunity for the police and other authorities to identify measures that can stop or minimise further disappearances.
"More importantly, it can draw attention to safeguarding issues for the young and most vulnerable in our communities and help in the identification and investigation of crimes which are linked to, or are the cause of, someone going missing."
Ch Supt Adrian Watson said: "We have seen improvements in the way we deal with missing people and the creation of Police Scotland and the specialist Missing Persons Unit has no doubt assisted us in the progress we've made."
