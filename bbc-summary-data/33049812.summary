The Doonhamers hosted Status Quo, Big Country and Reef in the first ever live concert at the Dumfries ground.
Organisers said the event had been a success with a crowd of thousands turning out.
Chairman Billy Hewitson said the event had shown it had the "perfect outdoor facility" for concerts in the town.
Commercial manager Victoria Thomson added: "It's been months of hard work, but it was worth the effort.
"It proved to be a fantastic night and lived up to be more than we expected it to be.
"For our first venture into the music business, we are delighted with the way it went."
