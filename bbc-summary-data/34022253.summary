The clothing was put on Beeston's Beeman statue on Thursday evening for the I Love Beeston Arts Trail but was gone less than 12 hours later.
The Nottinghamshire knitters said they were heartbroken. The council said it was a genuine mistake and apologised.
Organisers called for more "guerrilla knitters" to create new clothes.
The arts trail event was organised by Beeston Business Improvement District, a group established to promote local companies.
Becky Kennedy, one of the knitters, created 24 bees and said it took weeks of planning and knitting.
"It's just so heartbreaking. It wasn't even up 12 hours. While we were doing it, there were a lot of passersby and everyone was really into it, taking selfies and commenting.
"It's just a bit odd that they cleared away the colourful knitting, but left the tags which explained what it was all about.
"There has been a great response on social media. It has inadvertently brought people together."
A spokesman for the council said it was a genuine mistake and the cleaners did not know about the art trail.
"The council wishes to offer its sincere apologies to the organisers of the Beeston Arts Trail for this error and any distress caused to those who spent time making the items," she added.
