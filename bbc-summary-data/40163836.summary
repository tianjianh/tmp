Tributes have been paid to a "monumental" arts figure in Wales who died following a road crash in Monmouthshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Goodridge, from Abergavenny, died on 1 June after a single vehicle collision in Llanfoist.
The 61-year-old's company ArtWorks transports art throughout the UK and across the world.
His family said he would be greatly missed by the artists, curators and technicians he worked with.
They said the National Museum in Cardiff had its flag at half-mast in his honour.
In a tribute, issued via police, the family said: "Pete was a larger than life character, and not just his height of six foot six.
"He connected with so many people, he loved what he did and was a unique part of so many people's lives. He will be greatly missed."
