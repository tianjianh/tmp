Nyki Taylor, 39, died at the scene when the Vauxhall Astra she was in struck a lamp post on Blackpool Road, Lytham, at about 06:10 GMT on Sunday.
A 27-year-old man from Lytham was arrested on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by driving without due care and consideration.
Lancashire Police is appealing for witnesses to come forward.
Mrs Taylor's family described her as "a loving daughter and sister who was taken from us too suddenly and too soon".
They added: "Words cannot describe our loss, she will be in our hearts forever."
Sgt Rob Gomery, who is leading the investigation, said officers were keen to speak to the driver of a red Audi who may have stopped at the scene.
