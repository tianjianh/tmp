[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
RB Leipzig lost their unbeaten record and the Bundesliga leadership after a surprise defeat at Ingolstadt.

The home side, bottom of the table at kick-off, went ahead when midfielder Roger glanced in a free-kick from Anthony Jung, on loan from Leipzig.
Ingolstadt lost keeper Martin Hansen just before the hour mark after he was injured saving from Marcel Sabitzer.
Home striker Mathew Leckie was sent off late on as he was booked for a foul, then again for kicking the ball away.
But Ingolstadt held on, meaning Bayern Munich replace Leipzig at the top on goal difference after beating Wolfsburg 5-0.
RB Leipzig had never lost a match in the top flight of German football, having been promoted from the second division as runners-up last season.
Their rapid rise from the fifth tier has caused significant controversy, with a highly commercial approach attracting criticism from fans and officials of rivals clubs, who believe it goes against the spirit of the game in Germany.
Coach Ralph Hasenhuttl left Ingolstadt to take charge of Leipzig last summer, guiding them to the top of the table thanks to a sequence of eight successive Bundesliga victories.
However, Hasenhuttl - who has suggested that he could be Arsenal's next manager - saw his hopes of a triumphant return to his former club thwarted in what was a below-par performance.
Maik Walpurgis has improved Ingolstadt's results since replacing the sacked Markus Kauczinski in November, and they showed plenty of spirit to hold on as the visitors increased the pressure in the final half-hour.
After Hansen's injury, replacement goalkeeper Orjan Nyland made a fine reflex stop to deny Emil Forsberg.
Yet their hard work was almost undone inside the final three minutes, as Naby Keita sprinted in from the left to set up Forsberg, who had time to take a touch six yards from goal - yet somehow slid his shot wide.
