Harry Greaves, originally from Bronygarth near Oswestry, Shropshire, was visiting friends in the South American country and planned a lone mountainside expedition on 7 April.
The 29-year-old, who lives in Wrexham, has not been in contact since - which his family says is "out of character".
A Go Fund Me page has so far raised nearly £15,000 of its £25,000 target.
Mr Greaves' mother, Sarah, and cousin Lucy, who is a Spanish speaker, flew out on Sunday in the hope of finding him.
"As you can imagine flights to South America are costly as are search helicopters and guides. We need your help," his family wrote on the page.
Mr Greaves flew to Peru to meet two friends who live in Pisac, near Cusco, on 20 February. He emailed his family twice saying he was enjoying his trip.
On 7 April he told his friends he planned on going on a mountain hike alone in Kinsa Cocha, an area of high altitude Andean lakes, and expected to return by 10 April.
"He's done a number of outdoor trips before," his sister Ellen Greaves said.
"We understand he went with provisions - with a tent and food."
The family described Mr Greaves as self-reliant and practical. They said it was "out of character [for him] to be out of touch for so long".
Lucy Greaves said she had a meeting about her cousin at the British Embassy in Peru on Monday and was going with his mother to Pisac.
She added: "They've told us that they are going to contact the chief of police here, the tourism minister and try and get pressure on Peruvian officials to get things moving as much as possible.
"We're doing as best we can... it's a really, really anxious time for us all."
