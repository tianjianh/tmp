Owner Cuerden Leisure is selling Blackpool's South and Central Piers and the Grade II listed Llandudno Pier.
St John Stott, director at Cuerden Leisure, which also owns Eastbourne Pier, said the company was "restructuring its assets".
Blackpool North Pier was bought by a local businessman in 2011.
Collectively, they are on the market for offers of around £12.6m, with individual guide prices of £4.8m for Blackpool Central, £3.3m for Blackpool South and £4.5m for Llandudno Pier.
Blackpool Central Pier is home to a 33m high (108ft) Ferris wheel, Blackpool South Pier and Llandudno Pier were all built in the 19th Century.
Llandudno, which is 695m long (2,280ft), is the only pier with listed building status meaning any future owners would require Listed Building Consent to make changes to the structure.
Known as the "Queen of Welsh Piers", it nestles in the crescent bay between the outcrops of the Little and Great Orme.
Blackpool Central Pier, which stands at 341m long (1,118ft), and Blackpool South Pier, which is 150m (492ft), do not benefit from listed status, despite opening in 1864 and 1892 respectively.
Richard Baldwin, a director at Bilfinger GVA, which is selling the piers for Cuerden Leisure, said it would be very unlikely that a new owner would make significant changes.
He said: "In our opinion, the value is in the existing use and this is unlikely to change at either of the Blackpool piers."
A spokesman for the National Piers Society, which promotes the preservation and continued enjoyment of seaside piers in the UK, said: "These piers are all in good order and trading successfully, and, given that Easter is almost upon us, I have no doubt that they will quickly find a buyer or buyers."
