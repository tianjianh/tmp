A 90-year-old RAF veteran from Leicestershire has celebrated his birthday with a wing-walk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Weston, from Groby, was strapped to the upper wing of a 1942 Boeing-Stearman biplane and flown 500ft (152m) into the air for 15 minutes.
Mr Weston, a rear gunner on a Lancaster Bomber in World War Two, was raising money for the Alzheimer's Society after his wife's death.
The event took place at Wickenby Aerodrome, in Lincolnshire.
After he landed Mr Weston said: "It's windy up there!"
The veteran, who had to lose 12 lbs (5.4 kg) for the challenge, raised an undisclosed amount for the Alzheimer's Society.
He said: "For three years [my wife] was reasonably active, then she got very poorly and for the last eight months it was cruel to see her.
"She'd lost the use of her arms, legs, speech and couldn't swallow."
The World War Two airman added he felt grateful that no one was trying to "shoot him down".
