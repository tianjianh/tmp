The Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in Glasgow is to be renamed the Scottish Event Campus (SEC).

The iconic events venue has developed over the past 30 years and the site now includes the Clyde Auditorium (Armadillo) and The SSE Hydro.
Live entertainment has now become significant part of its business.
SEC chief executive Peter Duthie said the rebrand aimed aimed to reflect these changes and showcase its ability to stage large-scale events.
He said the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and the Ignition Festival of Motoring were both "great examples of utilisation of all areas of our campus, internally and externally".
"The name Scottish Event Campus (SEC) better describes the site, is more representative of what we do and reflects a vision for the future," he said.
"We believe that this is the perfect time for a revamp of our brand, building on the success of the business to date.
"Historically, we have found that many people don't necessarily realise that all of our buildings are part of the SECC."
Separately, the three buildings will be known as The SSE Hydro, SEC Armadillo and the original building, SEC Centre.
The SEC worked with local Glasgow design agency Freytag Anderson on the rebrand.
