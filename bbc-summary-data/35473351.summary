[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ceredigion school bus charge consultation to begin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sixth formers could be hit with a £390 annual charge to catch school buses in Ceredigion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local authority's cabinet has agreed to start a consultation over the proposal that could save it £500,000 a year.
Currently, 773 post-16 students benefit from free travel, which costs the council £900,514 annually.
The consultation starts on 22 February and if given the go-ahead, charges will come into effect in September 2017.
Council leader Ellen ap Gwynn called it "a very difficult situation" but said Ceredigion needed to take note of similar moves in other authorities.
The charges would see post-16-year-old students charged £130 per term to catch a bus to and from college and school.
