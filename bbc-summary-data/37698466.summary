Daniel Garza: Mexican tennis player banned for match-fixing offence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mexican tennis player Daniel Garza has been banned for six months and fined $5,000 (Â£4,062) after being found guilty of a match-fixing offence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old tried "to influence the outcome of a match" on the third-tier ITF Futures Tour in California in March 2015, the Tennis Integrity Unit said.
The offence took place at that year's ITF USA Futures 11 tournament, in which Garza did not play.
Ranked 1,065th in the world in singles, he reached a high of 294 in 2012.
Garza's ban takes effect immediately, and he is barred from competing in or attending any tournament or event organised or sanctioned by the governing bodies of tennis.
