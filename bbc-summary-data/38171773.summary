British boxer Joshua, 27, will have McCracken in his corner when he defends his IBF heavyweight title against Eric Molina in Manchester on 10 December.
Joshua won Olympic gold at London 2012 under McCracken before turning professional in 2013.
McCracken, who will also retain his role at Team GB, previously worked with Carl Froch before he retired last year.
Trainer Tony Sims, who has overseen Joshua's progress as a professional, will continue to work with Joshua as McCracken's assistant.
"I have remained close to Rob and the GB Boxing squad since 2012," said Joshua.
"I have consistently turned to him for advice and guidance so I am really excited to have him in my corner."
