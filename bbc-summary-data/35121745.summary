Travelling on the 10:44 GMT train from King's Cross station in London, the royal couple arrived three minutes late at King's Lynn at 12:24.
Some travellers were unaware she was on board until they alighted to be greeted by a large police and media presence.
One said: "What's all the fuss about - are you expecting somebody?"
The Press Association reported the Queen paid for a standard ticket costing Â£34.40.

Wearing an overcoat and headscarf, she mingled with passengers on the platform before being escorted to a waiting Range Rover.
The Duke of Edinburgh, who in recent years has travelled separately, escorted her.
The couple spend Christmas at Sandringham House, close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Anmer Hall home on the Sandringham estate.
They will be joined by the rest of the family for Christmas Day.
