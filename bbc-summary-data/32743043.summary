[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kickboxing instructor jailed for raping teenage girl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "evil and twisted" kickboxing instructor has been jailed for 15 years and six months for raping a teenage girl at his martial arts studio.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Drury, 57, admitted three rapes and four offences of making indecent images at Exeter Crown Court.
He raped the girl shortly before her 13th birthday at his home and at the Black Belt Academy he ran in Dawlish.
His sexual attacks took place more than a decade ago in Devon but his victim only went to the police last year.
His victim described him to officers as "'a sick, evil, twisted man".
Drury, of Maudlin Drive, Teignmouth, has run his Black Belt Academy for more than 20 years and specialised in teaching kickboxing and Tae Kwon Do.
After his arrest, police found child images on his computer as well as web chats in which he boasted of abusing children.
Judge Simon Carr also ordered him to sign on the sex offenders' register for life and made a Sexual Harm Prevention Order, which bans him from contact with children under 16.
He told him: "You started your sexual grooming when this girl was just 11 or 12 and your sexually inappropriate behaviour was clearly intended to prepare her for the rapes that followed.
"You told her this was normal and she would have to accept it, and despite she had the enormous courage to fight back, it had no effect on you whatsoever.
He added: "It is self evident this will have devastating psychological consequences which she will have to live with for the rest of her life.
"Sexual images of children were found on your computer, but more troubling are the conversations in chat rooms which indicated your interest in child abuse and showed you seemed to positively revel in it"
