Super League: Wakefield Wildcats 62-0 Wigan Warriors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In-form Wakefield hammered a badly-weakened young Wigan side to record a fourth successive Super League win.

Jacob Miller claimed a hat-trick, while skipper Danny Kirmond and prop Nick Scruton got two each as Wigan suffered their worst defeat in 11 years.
Wingers Tom Johnstone and Ben Jones-Bishop and full-back Max Jowitt all crossed too as Trinity scored 11 tries.
Scrum-half Liam Finn also grabbed a second-half try to supplement his nine conversions for a 22-point haul.
After a week in which a virus has affected a number of players, second-placed Wigan were also without injured captain Sean O'Loughlin, as well as most of their big hitters.
Michael McIlorum is out for the season with a broken ankle, John Bateman did not make his expected return following concussion, Liam Farrell was suspended, Dom Manfredi and Dom Crosby were also missing and Sam Tomkins is yet to reappear since his winter return from New Zealand.
Wigan handed debuts to Jack Wells and Joe Bretherton and had two other youngsters, Jack Higginson and Nick Gregson, making only their second full Super League appearances, and the inexperience showed.
It was Wigan's heaviest Super League loss since going down 70-0 to Leeds in June 2005, eight days before the club's all-time heaviest defeat, 75-0 to St Helens in the Challenge Cup.
The Wildcats' 11-try romp comfortably surpassed their previous best Super League win over the Warriors, a 40-14 success in April 2006.
After being bottom of the table when Wakefield coach Chris Chester took over last month, their winning run has coincided with the return of skipper Kirmond, who came into his own with two tries in six second-half minutes.
Wakefield were simply irresistible as they showed no mercy to a Wigan side lacking a total of 10 front-line players - and even had two early tries disallowed, for loose forward Michael Sio and Jowitt, who lost the ball over the line in being tackled by Joel Tomkins.
Victory came almost 12 months to the day since they themselves suffered a humiliating defeat, 80-0 at Warrington - and they left the field to a standing ovation from the jubilant Belle Vue faithful.
Wakefield coach Chris Chester:
"I thought it was going to be hell of a lot closer. I know they've been struggling with injuries and they've had a bug go through the camp but I certainly wasn't expecting that scoreline.
"It just shows what a little bit of belief does to a group of players. From 1 to 17, they were outstanding. What pleased me was what they did without the ball.
"We scored some really fancy tries but to keep a Wigan side to zero points takes a special effort. That's probably the best team performance there's been in a long time in Super League.
"What we did was exceptional and I'm proud of everybody involved. They are starting to believe in themselves a bit more. It's been a good few weeks. But we need to make sure we're grounded."
Wigan coach Shaun Wane:
"I'm not stressed one little bit. I know what we have and where we're at. I loved the fact that so many Wigan fans stayed behind to clap the players because I'm sure they know the situation we're in.
"I don't want to take anything away from Wakefield. Let them enjoy their day and, if they want to book their coaches to London, let them book them.
"Wakefield were very good. But I know what we've got in the club and how we can play so that result doesn't stress me in the slightest. Don't confuse that with the games at Catalans and Castleford, where we went with strong teams.
"We made it hard for ourselves by giving them too many sets. A combination of us being really lethargic, tired and lacking energy gave them good field position."
