A new fund set up to encourage children and teenagers to use new technology was so oversubscribed that more funding has been made available.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The extra curricular activities scheme, Digital Xtra, is supported by public bodies and the Scottish government.
It was launched in May to help young people to code, develop websites and create digital animations.
Already Â£250,000 has been shared out among 12 projects. Now a further Â£150,000 has been made available.
The deadline for submissions is 4 November this year.
Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said: "The Scottish government is determined to close the digital skills gap faced by all sectors across the economy.
"We made clear our commitment to invest in the digital skills of our young people in the digital teaching and learning strategy we published last week.
"This additional funding for Digital Xtra will give thousands more young people opportunities to strengthen their digital skills through their engagement in a range of innovative projects."
