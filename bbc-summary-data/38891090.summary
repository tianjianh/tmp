Five chickens were found squeezed into a bucket and abandoned in an alleyway.

They were left on Friday near Broadwood Road, Bestwood, in an old fence preservative container with a piece of wood on top.
RSPCA inspector Dave McAdam said they were kept in cramped conditions with no access to food and water and could have been attacked by foxes or cats.
"It is saddening that owners feel the need to abandon animals for whatever reason," he said.
