A car bomb in the northern Shaab district killed at least 10 people, and a suicide bomber struck at a nearby market, claiming more lives.
Another car bomb exploded in the Bunouk district killing at least nine people. Scores of others were wounded in the attacks, medics said.
No group has so far said it was behind the bombings.
However, the militant Islamic State (IS) group often says it is behind such attacks.
Iraq is also plagued by deadly sectarian violence.
Security forces said on Sunday they had sealed off areas of northern Baghdad and were sweeping for further bombs.
IS has occupied parts of Iraq and is battling government forces in the north and west of the country.
