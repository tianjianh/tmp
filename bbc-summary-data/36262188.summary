Kole Lulgjuraj was arrested in Darlington in 2012 on suspicion of fleecing people out of their savings, but fled the country while on bail.
Durham Police said many of his alleged victims had since died.
He has now been tracked to Indianapolis, in the USA, and is to be charged with six counts of theft.
Durham Police officers will travel to the USA and bring the 50-year-old from Montenegro back to the North East where he will face another charge of fraud.
Det Con Dave Wearmouth, of the force's major crime team, said: "This has been a long investigation and sadly several of the victims in this case have died.
"However, we have never given up."
An investigation began when the family of one of the alleged victims queried her bank account when working out the funding of care home bills.
That led to other alleged victims in the County Durham area, many of whom were elderly and had lost their savings and assets, Durham Police said.
In January this year the suspect was arrested by the FBI in Indianapolis, Indiana, after he started work at a bank.
A colleague had carried out an internet search of his surname leading to a newspaper article which said he was wanted by police.
Mr Wearmouth said: "It goes to show that, there is truly no hiding place for suspected criminals in today's digital world."
