Theresa Villiers says IRA existence no surprise to government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police belief that the Provisional IRA still exists did not come as a surprise to the government, the Northern Ireland Secretary has said.

Theresa Villiers said in her time in office she had been aware some of its structures remain in place.
But she said there was no evidence the Provisional IRA was involved in any paramilitary or terrorist activity.
Her comments came after Northern Ireland's police chief said members were involved in killing an ex-IRA man.
Kevin McGuigan Sr was murdered in Belfast earlier this month as part of what police believe was a "fall-out" in republican circles.
Chief Constable George Hamilton said an infrastructure exists at a senior level of the Provisional IRA, but that it is not on a "war footing".
Ms Villiers said that "didn't come as a surprise to me".
"My understanding is, very much in line with that of the chief constable, that a number of the organisational structures of the Provisional IRA still exist but that there is no evidence it's involved in terrorism or paramilitary activity," she said.
She added that she was satisfied for the moment that all parties in the Northern Ireland Executive were supportive of the principles of democracy and consent.
But she said she "wouldn't shy away from dealing with the consequences and taking action" if that was found to change.
