Fears are being raised over a Bristol roundabout becoming a fresh magnet for aggressive begging, homelessness and drug-taking despite a major revamp.

Bristol City Council spent £1.2m improving the Bear Pit on the James Barton Roundabout in 2014.
Bearpit Social Cafe owner Miriam Delogu said pedestrians trying to get through the area are "just getting harassed or intimidated".
The city council said it is working with police to address the problem.
A council spokesman said: "We are working proactively with the police and traders within the area to address these problems.
"We have used our powers to prevent a number of individuals from entering the Bearpit and we have obtained two injunctions, which has led to an arrest.
"As well as this, we have helped two people back into accommodation and are working with another two people to try to find a similar outcome."
In 2014 the council built new pedestrian and off-road cycle routes aimed at making the area more welcoming.
A community gardening project was also set up by the Grow Wild charity to cultivate wild flowers.
Ms Delogu added: "We've noticed we've been having to clear up large messes, you can tell there have been parties.
"We've been having to scrape off faeces, blood and vomit on the deck (an outside seating area for customers).
"Every morning we've been delayed opening up and sometimes we've been getting aggression because no-one likes to be woken up."
Ch Insp Andy Bennett said: "It's the coming together of some really complex social issues, we've seen a massive increase in homelessness, we're seeing an increase in alcohol and drug addiction and the use of legal highs."
He added that a squat was closed down eight weeks ago so rough sleepers were going back to the Bearpit.
"We have to problem-solve in a more sustainable way," added Mr Bennett.
