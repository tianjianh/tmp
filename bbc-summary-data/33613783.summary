A police dashcam video showing the arrest of a woman who died three days later in custody has been released by officials in Texas.

Footage of the 10 July arrest shows Sandra Bland's car being pulled over for failing to signal and then an ensuing confrontation with the officer.
The coroner said she hanged herself in her cell but her family dispute that and allege a police cover-up.
State officials and the FBI are both investigating her death.
In the video, released by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the policeman is seen issuing a ticket and then asking her to stub out her cigarette, which she refuses.
When she refuses to step out of the car, he tries unsuccessfully to pull her out. He then appears to threaten her with a Taser and says the words: "I will light you up."
She gets out of the car and the two of them move out of vision, but the audio suggests the confrontation becomes physical during the arrest before more officers arrive.
The arresting officer said he was kicked. He has been put on administrative leave.
Earlier on Tuesday, local district attorney Elton Mathis said the case - like all deaths in a jail cell - would be investigated like a murder.
The death of the 28-year-old is one of several under national scrutiny in which a black person has died while in police custody.
Other high-profile cases, since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson last summer, have sparked protests and sometimes unrest.
Bland's family has ordered an independent autopsy and called for an investigation by the Department of Justice.
Video footage did not show what happened inside Bland's cell, but did suggest no-one entered or left it until someone found her unconscious.
Jail Sheriff Glen Smith said his staff checked on Bland less than an hour before she was found dead.
Her sister Shante Needham said Bland called her from jail, saying she did not know why she had been arrested and that an officer had possibly broken her arm.
