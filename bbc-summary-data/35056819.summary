The footage, released by Hammersmith and Fulham Council on Wednesday, shows the deluge of debris narrowly missing pedestrians walking along Uxbridge Road in Shepherd's Bush.
No-one is believed to have been hurt in the collapse, which happened at 15:20 GMT on Saturday.
Hammersmith and Fulham Council said on Twitter that "high winds caused a roof to collapse in Shepherd's Bush, sending bricks falling".
