The 30-year-old was the only man to play every minute of the Rams' extra-time FA Cup defeat by Leicester and Saturday's 3-3 draw with Bristol City.
McClaren was unhappy his rested regulars did not match Keogh's display as they had to come from 3-0 down against the Robins.
"I thought Richard was magnificent," McClaren told BBC Radio Derby.
"He was magnificent throughout the 95 minutes and he played two hours on Wednesday.
"We made eight or nine changes in midweek and they performed magnificently, fought with the Premier League champions for two hours.
"Max Lowe and Cyrus Christie were crawling off the field.
"We made eight or nine changes again (against Bristol City) and we didn't get the same reaction. That really was disappointing and upsetting."
McClaren praised the Derby supporters for not losing faith on Saturday, despite seeing their side fall 3-0 down after just 38 minutes.
"I thought the crowd really helped us," he added.
"They stayed with us and once we got the first goal, momentum took us."
