Wrexham binman Aabid Ali admits terrorism charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Wrexham council binman has pleaded guilty to a string of terror offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aabid Ali - known as Darren Glennon before he converted to Islam - was found in possession of two terror manuals.
Married Ali, 49, from Yale Park, Wrexham, also published a statement on YouTube encouraging others to take up jihad and terrorism.
He pleaded guilty at Manchester Crown Court to three offences under anti-terror legislation on Friday.
He worked as a council refuse collector before his home was raided by counter-terror police last autumn, after he became radicalised.
Ali, who had a shaved head, ginger beard and who wore a grey sweatshirt, appeared in court via a video link from HMP Chelmsford.
He will be sentenced on 24 April by the Judge David Stockdale.
The defendant spoke only to confirm his name and enter his guilty pleas.
He admitted on 25 October last year he had an electronic document, Inspire 13 - believed to be an online publication by Osama bin Laden's terror group al Qaeda - which included instructions on how to make explosives.
Ali was also found to have a copy of another document, which again showed how to make bombs.
Counter-terror police also found he had posted a comment on YouTube, on or before 10 November last year, intended to directly encourage others to commit, prepare or instigate acts of terrorism.
