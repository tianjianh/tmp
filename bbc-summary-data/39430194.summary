[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Simpson, 29, of Elgin, sent the video of him kissing the infant to his boyfriend.
The hotel worker admitted sexually assaulting a child, and indecent images charges.
Simpson was jailed for a total of 16 months at the High Court in Aberdeen and was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years.
The case had previously been dealt with at Elgin Sheriff Court but was referred to the high court for sentencing.
At the earlier hearing, fiscal depute Alison Wylie said: "The baby was distressed and crying during the video footage."
Defence lawyer Jonathan Crowe said his client had a difficult upbringing.
Mr Crowe said Simpson had been pressurised into committing the child assault by his then partner and was horrified by his own behaviour.
Lord Woolman told Simpson: "It is in your best interests that you engage in every social work programme which is recommended to you."
