[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A north Wales health board must ensure staff are properly trained after the death of a heart attack patient, a coroner has ordered.

John Rogers, 78, from Denbigh, collapsed on a coronary care ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital in March 2015.
A defibrillator machine being used to revive him was not set-up to deliver enough of a shock, his inquest heard.
The hearing in Ruthin also found a nurse operating the machine was no longer properly qualified to use it.
"We thought he would be safe and in responsible hands. Unfortunately, that could not have been further from the reality," said Mr Rogers' family following the end of the three-day inquest.
"We feel completely betrayed and let down by the lack of adequate care and honesty.
"We hope that changes are made. They have to be. Nobody else should have to go through this."
Delivering a conclusion of natural causes, coroner John Gittins said the attempts to revive Mr Rogers failed "due to an inappropriate use of a defibrillator" by ward nurse Vanessa Humphreys, which meant "resuscitation was unsuccessful".
However, he described the incident as a result of a "single human error" rather than neglect.
Mr Gittins said he would now write to the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, who run the hospital, to order improvements in the way staff training is implemented.
Nurse Humphreys admitted during the hearing that her training certificate to use the heart equipment ran out a month before Mr Rogers arrived at the hospital.
She told the inquest: "I just wish it hadn't happened and I hadn't made the mistake."
Both she and another nurse remain suspended from their posts.
The coroner told the health board that staff "must be as well and appropriately qualified as possible".
"It is a tough call but one that I feel public confidence demands they address," he said.
The hospital's assistant director of nursing, Alison Griffiths publically apologised to Mr Rogers' family in the inquest, and said she wished to offer "the sincere condolences of the health board" to them.
"We are continuing with our own internal review processes to make sure that our systems for ensuring staff training and accreditation are effective and up to date," she added.
The health board must now present the coroner with a report within 56 days on how it will address his concerns.
