Celebrity injunction: The Sun on Sunday pays damages

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Sun on Sunday has agreed to pay damages to a celebrity who won the right to keep his name out of a "kiss and tell" story.

The celebrity, referred to as PJS, took legal action in May after allegations of an extra-marital relationship.
Mr Justice Warby said News Group Newspapers (NGN) had agreed to pay a "specified sum" in damages and costs.
NGN has also agreed not to use, disclose, publish or republish any material identifying PJS.
In May, PJS successfully appealed against a court ruling lifting the ban on media in England and Wales publishing his name.
The Sun on Sunday argued it should be able to run the story as his name had been published in Scotland and the US.
The man had taken legal action saying that he had a right to privacy.
He has young children with YMA - as his spouse is known in court documents - and both are described as "well-known individuals in the entertainment business".
Legal proceedings had started earlier this year when the Sunday tabloid wanted to publish a story about the celebrity, alleging he had taken part in what the courts described as a "three-way sexual encounter".
The man sued NGN, claiming that publication of information about the alleged extra-marital activity would be a misuse of private information and a breach of confidence.
At London's High Court on Friday, Mr Warby said that PJS and NGN had agreed a final order in the action for breach of confidence and misuse of private information.
The proceedings were "stayed" on the basis that NGN pay a "specified sum" in full and final settlement of PJS's claim for damages and costs.
NGN also agreed not to publish any information which identified or was liable to identify PJS as a party to the action, including identifying his partner or three other individuals.
The judge said: "I accept the undertakings offered by the defendant, which are clear and plainly given on advice.
"I see no reason not to make an order for payment of the agreed sum. There is no reason not to allow the parties to keep the figure confidential."
