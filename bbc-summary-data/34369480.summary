[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened at Tyndale Drive in the Old Park area at 09:50 BST on Saturday.
Police said they received a report that two men, "armed with what is believed to be a Taser, approached two postmen and made off with a post van".
The vehicle was set alight a short time later on Crumlin Road. Police believe post bags may have been stolen from the van before it was burned.
The postmen were not injured. Police have appealed for information.
