Arson attacks on community bus 'demoralising'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An arson attack on a bus for disabled and vulnerable people has left staff at the charity that runs it "demoralised".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £20,000 seven-seater van operated by Kirkby Our Centre helps provide medical transport for disabled and vulnerable people.
Local residents who use the service said they were "shocked and disgusted" by the attacks, the first of which took place on 12 October.
The second attack happened just a day later.
The first incident was at noon in Kirkby-in-Ashfield when the driver was having some lunch.
The second attack took place the next evening "to finish off the job", Kirkby Our Centre manager Tim Cooper said.

The specially adapted bus was designed to transport wheelchair passengers.
It would cost more than £20,000 to replace, but insurers have only offered about £14,000, Mr Cooper said.
The Ashby centre has 12 vans and has helped transport 42,000 passengers so far in 2016.
"It is so demoralising - I see the people who need our services and I know what a lifeline it is," Mr Cooper added.
Nottinghamshire Police has appealed to anyone with information about the arson attack to contact them.
