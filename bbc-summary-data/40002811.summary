Scotland squad: Gordon Strachan tips Scott Brown to play for 'long time yet'

Scotland manager Gordon Strachan says midfielder Scott Brown can continue playing for years to come.

The 31-year-old Celtic captain retired from international football in August 2016 but returned for the match against England at Wembley in November 2016.
After naming Brown in his squad to face England at Hampden in June, Strachan said: "He can play for a long time yet.
"His fitness level is not a worry and shouldn't have been a worry - 30 or 31, that's no age at all."
Brown captained title-winning Celtic to their historic unbeaten league campaign this term and, with the League Cup already won, can help them complete an unbeaten domestic treble if they see off Aberdeen in Saturday's Scottish Cup final.
And Strachan is delighted to have the in-form midfielder in his ranks for the World Cup qualifier against England on 10 June.
"He is a huge influence on the game," he said. "When he was young he had influential points in the game with some of the wonderful things he does, but he is commanding 90 minutes now."
Brown is one of six Celtic players named in Strachan's squad, all of whom started in the 1-0 qualifying win over Slovenia in March.
And the manager suggested he could again start Brown, Craig Gordon, Kieran Tierney, Stuart Armstrong, James Forrest and Leigh Griffiths of Celtic when England visit Glasgow.
"Well, it worked the last time, but you've got to remember there were other players playing and I've got to say they were terrific as well," Strachan said.
"The Celtic players did very well. It was just a continuation of what they've been doing all season.
"You can tell from the squad that is at the forefront of my mind, but it was easy to pick these players."
Strachan felt his players were unlucky in the 3-0 defeat at Wembley last November but believes the win over Slovenia has reinvigorated the squad.
Should they beat Gareth Southgate's side it would be the Scots' first win over England at Hampden since the 1-0 triumph in 1985 - a match Strachan played in - thanks to a Richard Gough header.
"I wasn't very good," Strachan said. "I remember the goal. I think the ball was coming to me if Richard Gough had missed it.
"With the game I was having, I was so delighted that Richard got to it first because you wouldn't be talking about a victory.
"The media coverage was not as big back then as it is now. We are saturated with it.
"There will be a big build-up, but the players are used to that now."
