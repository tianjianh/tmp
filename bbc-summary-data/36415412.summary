New call in Poland to extradite Roman Polanski to US

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Poland's justice minister says he will appeal against a decision not to extradite film director Roman Polanski to the US for statutory rape.

Zbigniew Ziobro, who is also Poland's prosecutor general, said he would make the appeal in the Supreme Court.
A judge rejected Polanski's extradition in October as "inadmissible".
The director, who lives in France, fled the US ahead of sentencing in 1978 after admitting having sex with a girl aged 13.
Polanski's victim, Samantha Geimer, described the ordeal of giving testimony against Polanski in an interview for the BBC's HARDTalk programme in 2013.
Polanski has French and Polish citizenship. France does not extradite its own citizens but the director occasionally visits Poland, attending a press event in Katowice just last week.
Swiss authorities turned down a US extradition warrant in 2010, after placing Polanski under house arrest for nine months.
