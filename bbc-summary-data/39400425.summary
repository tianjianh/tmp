Tomas Francis: Cardiff Blues look to sign prop from Exeter Chiefs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues are looking to sign Tomas Francis from Exeter Chiefs for the start of next season on a dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The York-born 24-year-old has a year season on his Exeter contract and it is understood a deal would involve a fee.
The WRU, the Blues and Exeter are in discussions over the fee, but the feeling is the deal is edging closer.
Francis has usurped Samson Lee as Wales' tight-head prop, starting four of five 2017 Six Nations games.
Francis, who has won 22 international caps, has never played rugby in Wales, having previously played for Doncaster and London Scottish.
