[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hearing into a social worker who allegedly failed the murdered toddler Liam Fee has been told it should find every charge against her proven.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Social Services Council hearing has heard that Lesley Bate was erratic, disorganised and chaotic.
The 60-year-old faces 13 conduct charges relating to her work at Fife Council, two of which involve two-year-old Liam.
She has chosen not to appear at the hearing but denies the charges.
Ms Bate is accused of failing to take the necessary steps to minimise actual or the potential risk of harm to Liam Fee and a number of other children between December 2011 and August 2014.
The hearing has been told Ms Bate failed to follow up on a referral that Liam had bruising to his face and concerns he had a sore neck.
Liam's mother Rachel Trelfa, 31, and her partner Nyomi Fee, 29, were found guilty of murdering the toddler at a house near Glenrothes in Fife on 22 March 2014.
Rachel Trelfa was ordered to spend a minimum of 23-and-a-half years in jail and Nyomi Fee, a minimum of 24 years.
The Scottish Social Services Council's lawyer has told the hearing that the witnesses who have given evidence were highly-credible and experienced,  and the charges were supported by documentary evidence.
The committee has been told Ms Bate has relinquished her social work registration but does not admit any of the charges.
The hearing has also been told that the child protection team in Glenrothes was divided and dysfunctional, some staff would not speak to others unless they had to and that had an impact on two other cases.
The committee will deliver its findings at a later date.
