The 21-year-old, who can also play on the wing and outside centre, has made seven Pro12 appearances for Leinster.
Kelleher has represented Ireland at U18, U19 and U20 level and travelled as part of last summer's Emerging Ireland squad to Georgia.
"It's great to have someone with Cian's versatility joining our squad for next season," said Connacht coach Pat Lam.
Kelleher also came on as a replacement for the Ireland XV side that played the Barbarians at Thomond Park last year.
He added:  "As a full-back who can also play on the wing and outside centre, his arrival will bring more competition and depth in the backs as we prepare for Champions Cup rugby.
"I was really impressed when I first saw Cian play for Lansdowne and Ireland U20s a couple of seasons ago.
"He showed real X-factor qualities with some of the tries he scored as well as those he set up for his team-mates.
"With the way we train and play the game I have no doubt he will be able to showcase his ability on the Pro12 and Champions Cup stage to chase his big goal of representing Ireland."
