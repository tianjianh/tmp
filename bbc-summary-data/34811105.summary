[SN]TITLE[SN]
Schoolboy to stand trial over Dundee police chase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 15-year-old boy is to stand trial accused of leading police on a 15-mile high-speed car chase through Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager is alleged to have driven at excessive speeds for the road conditions and failed to slow down or give way at junctions on 30 July.
He is also accused of driving on the wrong side of the road and failing to stop when told by a marked police car.
His solicitor entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. The boy cannot be named for legal reasons.
At Dundee Sheriff Court, prosecutors said the chase went on for 15 miles from Liff, on the western outskirts of Dundee, through the Charleston, Lochee, Technology Park and Riverside areas of the city.
The teenager, who is from Dundee, faces charges of dangerous driving, driving without a licence, driving without insurance and driving a car without a valid MOT certificate.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael set a trial date in February.
