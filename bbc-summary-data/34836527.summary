[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight contenders have been shortlisted for the 2015 BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality of the Year award.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Footballers Gareth Bale and Ashley Williams, rugby player Dan Biggar and athlete Aled Sion Davies are on the list chosen by a panel of experts.
Taekwondo athlete Jade Jones, boxer Lee Selby, triathlete Non Stanford and cyclist Geraint Thomas are also named.
A public vote will decide the winner, who will be revealed at the Wales Sports Awards in Cardiff on 7 December.
Voting will open at 08:00 GMT on Monday, 30 November and will close on 18:00 GMT on Saturday, 5 December. More details on how to vote will be available in due course.
The annual awards evening, in its third year, is a collaboration between BBC Wales and governing body Sport Wales to celebrate the very best elite and grassroots sport in the country.
Jason Mohammad and Dot Davies will host the event from the Sport Wales National Centre, with the show available to watch live on the BBC Wales Sport website and on BBC iPlayer (UK only) from 20:00 GMT on Monday, 7 December. Further coverage will be on BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru.
The pinnacle of the awards ceremony will be to crown the 2015 BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year from the following nominees (listed in alphabetical order):
Bale was the driving force behind Wales' successful qualifying campaign for Euro 2016. He scored seven goals in the 10 games, including the winner against Belgium in Cardiff in June that gave such impetus going into the final four games. The Real Madrid forward, 26, played all but three minutes of the campaign as Wales finished second in their group behind the Belgians to ensure their place in the finals in France next summer.
His performances were recognised when named Wales Player of the Year for a record fifth time, while also being voted Players' Player of the Year and Fans' Player of the Year.
Biggar gave outstanding performances for Wales during the Rugby World Cup, the Six Nations and for regional side Ospreys. The 26-year-old scored 23 points in a man-of-the-match performance in the 28-25 win over England in the pool stage at the World Cup, including a long-range winning penalty. In total he scored 56 points in four matches as Wales were knocked out in the quarter-finals against South Africa.
In the Six Nations, he scored 26 points in five games as Wales missed out on the Championship on points difference with four wins from five. He also helped Ospreys to the semi-finals in the Pro12.
Davies won two gold medals at the IPC World Championships in Doha in October. He won the F42 discus, throwing a world record 49.59 metres, and then added another gold in the F42 shot put with a Championship record effort of 14.95m. Davies, 24, had a hernia operation 10 weeks before the championships, which had put his participation in doubt.
His latest success takes him up to 10 medals at major championships since 2011.
Jones won gold for Great Britain at the inaugural European Games in Baku in June. Further gold medals followed at two legs of the World Taekwondo Grand Prix series, winning in Samsun and Manchester. The 22-year-old took silver in Moscow.
Her achievements have already secured Team GB a berth in her -57kg division for the 2016 Rio Olympics. As world number one, she is set to take that place and be given the chance to defend her title.
Selby became the 12th Welsh world boxing champion by beating Russia's Evgeny Gradovich to claim the IBF featherweight title in May. Selby then defended his title against Mexican Fernando Montiel in Phoenix, Arizona on his debut on American soil.
The 28-year-old has signed with one of boxing's most influential figures, American Al Haymon, advisor to five-weight world champion Floyd Mayweather.
Stanford returned to action this year after a long injury lay-off to book her place in the GB team for the 2016 Rio Olympics by finishing second at the World Triathlon Grand Final in September. She was also second in a Rio test event in August.
After 20 months out with a foot injury, the 26-year-old competed again in April and secured her first podium finish of the year at an ITU World Triathlon Series event in Hamburg.
Thomas became the first British rider to win the formidable E3 Harelbeke race in Belgium in March. The 215km race - known as one of the Cobbled Classics - is among the hardest on the professional circuit. Thomas was then a key member of Team Sky that led Chris Froome to a successive Tour de France victory.
The 29-year-old rode through the pain barrier, and at one point into a telegraph pole, in helping Froome and was up in fourth in the overall standings until the latter stages of the final week, eventually finishing 15th.
Williams captained Wales to Euro 2016 qualification, marshalling one of the tightest defensive units in the qualifying stage. Wales had the fourth-best defensive record, conceding just four goals in 10 games. The Swansea City defender, 31, played every minute of every game and reached the 50-cap milestone during the campaign.
At club level, he captained Swansea to their highest Premier League finish of eighth last season and is rated as the best British centre-back by former Wales and Celtic striker John Hartson.
In addition to the main prize, there will also be 12 other awards on the night:
The Unsung Hero award has already been given to Jane Roberts and Nerys Ellis for their work at Llanrwst Swimming Club. They will appear at the ceremony on 7 December to collect the award and will go on to represent Wales at the UK BBC Sports Personality of the Year event in Belfast on Sunday, 20 December.
A review of the sporting year will be broadcast on BBC Wales television on Friday, 18 December at 21:00 GMT.
Please note the event is not connected with the UK Sports Personality of the Year and is for the Wales award only.
The BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year will be named during a live awards show at the Sport Wales National Centre, Cardiff, on Monday, 7 December 2015.
The nominations processes, criteria and voting details (where applicable) for each award are outlined below.
MAIN AWARD - NOMINATION PROCESS & CRITERIA
This award goes to the sportsperson whose actions have most captured the public's imagination during 2015.
An expert panel (hereafter 'the Panel') will be convened in November 2015 in Cardiff to decide the shortlist of 5- 10 sportspeople for the BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year award.
The BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year production team will provide the Panel with an extensive list of the top sportspeople from 2015, including information on their achievements. The Panel will be free to consider other potential candidates.
The Panel will comprise 5 members this year:
Nigel Walker (chair)
Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson
Non Evans
Christian Malcolm
Nathan Blake
The Panel will also:
• Undertake a back-up vote for the main award (in the unlikely event of voting difficulties on the night of the show).
The Panel will select a short list of sportspeople for the main award on the basis of the following criteria:
• Reflects Wales' sporting achievements on the national and/or international stage;
• Represents the breadth and depth of sport in Wales; and
• Takes into account 'impact' over and beyond the sport or sporting achievement in question.
Sports people are eligible to win the main BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year award if they represent or are eligible to represent Wales at international sport.
Non-playing coaches or management are not eligible.
The Panel will endeavour to produce a shortlist based on reaching a consensus view. If a consensus view cannot be reached on all or some of the candidates, then the Panel will be asked to vote for the remaining candidates. In the event of a tied vote, the chairperson's decision (Nigel Walker) will be binding.
The shortlist of contenders was announced during BBC Wales Today on BBC One Wales and on Newyddion 9 on S4C later in November, and will also appear on the BBC Wales Sport and BBC Cymru Fyw websites.
MAIN AWARD - PUBLIC VOTE
The public will decide the winner from the shortlist of contenders from Monday 30 November - Saturday 5 December 2015 inclusive with a vote. This will be overseen by an independent adjudicator.
In the unlikely event of:
• A tie in the public vote amongst the two contenders obtaining the highest number of votes, the award will be shared amongst those two. There will be no award in second place category and the third place category award will go to the contender scoring highest after the two in the tie.
• A tie in the public vote amongst the three contenders obtaining the highest number of votes, the award will be shared amongst the three and there will be no awards in second and third place categories.
• A tie in the public vote amongst two contenders obtaining the second highest number of votes, the second place award will be shared amongst those two and there will be no award in third place category.
• A tie in the public vote amongst two contenders obtaining the third highest number of votes, the third place award will be shared amongst those two.
