Election 2017: What you want to know about the result

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the Conservative Party loses its overall majority in the general election, the outcome has prompted many questions to be asked about the vote itself and what happens next.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From the parties' inability to work together, to fears of another election or even a bad Brexit deal, voters want to know what the future holds and what sort of government the UK will get in the end. Here, we tackle some of the questions being raised by BBC audiences.
Why doesn't the party with the most votes automatically become the governing party? Why do they have to reach 326 seats?
There are 650 MPs elected to the House of Commons and for a party to turn its policies into law, it needs the support of more than half of that total, which is 326.
If a party has 326 MPs or more it will be able to form a majority government and secure sufficient backing to ensure it can pass legislation. If it has fewer than 326 MPs it will always need to rely on the support of others - either from other parties or Independents - in order to implement its decisions.
So the party which forms the government must be able to guarantee that it can push its agenda forward and be effective in its leadership of the country.
Why can't the Conservatives and Labour work together to run our country?
Numbers-wise, both parties could join to form a working majority that could vote legislation through. However, the biggest problem could be agreeing on policies in the first place. You can see from their manifesto pledges that there may be more issues that divide them rather than unite them.
While both Labour and the Conservatives have ruled out a second referendum on Brexit and seem to both favour a "hard" Brexit, the Labour Party has not been explicit about many of its aims on the issue.
The parties differ enormously on the future funding of the NHS, taxation and social care to list only a few important areas where reaching a consensus could prove more of an issue than simply having a big enough cohort of MPs.
Could there be another election?
It is possible to have another election but as Theresa May has learned, forcing the public into another round of voting is not always a good idea. Voter fatigue could set in as the electorate may feel it cannot face going through a fourth vote (including the EU referendum) in three years. Another vote could backfire with a drop in turnout.
However, the prime minister has said she will not resign and will find a way to form a government, indicating the Conservatives will work with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to support her minority government.
Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, general elections take place on the first Thursday in May every five years but there are some ways in which another election could be called.
First, it could happen if two-thirds of MPs back a motion calling for an early election. It's two-thirds of all the seats in the House of Commons - not only those who vote - and it includes vacant seats. With 650 seats, that means 434 MPs must back an early election. This would be the quickest way.
Alternatively, an election could come about if a motion of no confidence in the government is passed in the House of Commons and no motion expressing confidence in the government is subsequently passed within 14 days - the wording of these motions has to be precisely as set out by the Act.
How will a hung Parliament affect Brexit and the single market?
The single reason Mrs May said she called the election was to strengthen her position in negotiating a good Brexit deal. It is inevitable now that with a reduced majority she will have to compromise her aims in order to get support from the other parties.
In particular the DUP - with whom Mrs May has said she will work - could be very influential here.
Time is of the essence though, as negotiations with the remaining European Union (EU) countries is due to start on 19 June.
The new government and its partners will have to work hard to agree a strategy, although the EU's budget commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, tweeted that the UK is now a weaker negotiating partner than prior to the election and questioned whether the Brexit negotiations could start on schedule.
What is The Queen's Speech and how can you be 'defeated' on it?
The Queen's Speech is the address that the Queen reads out on the occasion of the State Opening of Parliament in front of MPs and peers.
It is written by the government and outlines the programme of legislation that it wants to pass in the forthcoming Parliamentary year.
It is an event filled with pageantry dating back many centuries and generally happens at the start of each Parliamentary session - although in 2011 the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government decided against having one.
After the pomp and ceremony of the occasion, the Queen returns to Buckingham Palace and MPs move to the House of Commons to debate the Speech. This can last a number of days.
While the vote at the end is generally symbolic, it is possible that someone could take the opportunity to voice their opposition to its contents by voting against it.
With a minority government therefore it is feasible that Mrs May's proposals could be rejected before they pass this first hurdle.
Members of the House of Lords also debate the Queen's Speech but do not vote on it.
