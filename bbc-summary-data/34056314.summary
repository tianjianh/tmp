The smaller in a pair of newborn panda twins at the National Zoo in Washington is getting less attention from her mother than the larger one.

Zoo officials said the mother, Mei Xiang, is refusing to let the smaller one get swapped in for feedings.
Pandas do not usually nurse twins on their own, but the zoo said it will continue to try to get Mei Xiang to nurse the smaller cub, too.
The zoo is feeding the smaller cub and eyeing its fluctuating weight.
The small cub weighed 86 grams when it was born, while the larger cub weighed 138 grams. The 17-year-old Mei Xiang weighs 238 lbs (108kg).
Additional veterinarian staff and zoo keepers have been brought in from out of state to help keep the panda cub twins stay alive.
Mei Xiang's first cub, Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and returned to China in 2010. Her second cub, Bao Bao, just celebrated her second birthday.
Giant pandas are one of the most endangered species in the world and are notoriously hard to breed in captivity.
The National Zoo is one of only four zoos in the US to have pandas, which are on loan from China.
