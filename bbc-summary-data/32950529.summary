The singer took the number one spot at the expense of another new release, The Vaccines' English Graffiti, which made its chart debut at two.
In the singles chart, Jason Derulo's Want to Want Me has ended Cheerleader by Omi's four-week reign at number one.
This week's rundown sees Sweden's Mans Zelmerlow chart just outside the top 10 with Eurovision-winning song Heroes.
The track had been placed at five in the mid-week music chart but makes its official debut at 11 in Sunday's countdown.
Want to Want Me is Derulo's fourth UK number one, a feat the US singer insisted was one that "never ever gets old".
"It feels just as good every time, if not better," he told the Official Charts Company. "I just want to say thank you to all the fans for giving me this tremendous pleasure."
This week's album chart sees the 53rd consecutive appearance by Sam Smith's In the Lonely Hour, equalling a feat only previously managed by the Beatles.
One year on from its release, Smith is the only debut act since the Fab Four to spend nearly a whole first year inside the album chart top five with their debut album.
Apart from one week when it charted at six and another when it charted at eight, In the Lonely Hour has remained in the top five since its release in May 2014.
"Seeing this statistic genuinely makes me feel very weird, but also insanely happy and just so thankful to everyone who has purchased the album," said Smith.
Fleetwood Mac's The Very Best Of is this week's highest-climbing album, jumping 68 places to chart at 17.
