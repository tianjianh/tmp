Birmingham City 0-0 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham and Cardiff fought out an entertaining goalless opening day stalemate in the sun in St Andrew's.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff should have been ahead at half-time but Frederic Gounongbe missed an open goal and Tomasz Kusczak saved brilliantly from Peter Whittingham.
After the break it was Bluebirds goalkeeper David Marshall's turn to shine with outstanding saves from Diego Fabbrini and Jack Storer.
When a goalkeeper was beaten, Cardiff's Lex Immers' shot crashed off the bar.
New Cardiff head coach Paul Trollope's side - including defender Fabio, who is being linked with Middlesbrough - started with a purpose.
And had it not been for former Manchester United player Kuszczak's brilliance and some sloppy finishing Cardiff would have been out of sight at the interval.
With takeover rumours dominating the build-up to the game, it took Gary Rowett's Blues 50 minutes to hit their stride.
When they did, Scotland international Marshall was equal to the task, although substitute Storer should have scored.
The pace slowed in the energy-sapping heat, and Immers' late effort almost stole all the points for Cardiff.
Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett told BBC WM:

"It was probably the right result on the overall reflection of the game. I don't think we deserved to win but we didn't deserve to lose.
"To keep a clean sheet was a real positive and some strong displays from Ryan Shotton and Tomasz Kuszczak played leading roles.
"I admit that I am trying to bring in two players that will give us a bit more quality and win us games in the final third. We certainly need to improve in that area."
Cardiff City boss Paul Trollope:
"There is an influence from the Euros. Obviously a few teams used it in the Euros like the team I worked with. A lot of teams have used this system and got out of this division.
"With the players I have at my disposal at the moment I think it is a good way for us to go."
"We came with positive intentions to win the game but were frustrated we didn't win. We controlled good spells which was pleasing. We want to be progressive and dynamic but it is what happens in the box.
"The signs are good and we defended when we were put under pressure. It is, however, work in progress. Hopefully we will improve. A clean sheet on the road is not bad."
