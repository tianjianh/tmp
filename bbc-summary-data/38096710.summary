Welsh leader Carwyn Jones rules out Scots single market deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh first minister has said he does not support the idea of Scotland retaining separate access to the European single market after Brexit.

Carwyn Jones said he supported the UK keeping its access to the market, but said individual deals for any of the home nations were unworkable.
He is due to host a British-Irish Council summit in Cardiff.
Nicola Sturgeon, who is calling for Scotland to retain single market access, will be among those attending.
Also in attendance will be figures from the UK government and the devolved nations as well as Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny, with whom Ms Sturgeon will hold a bilateral meeting.
Carwyn Jones told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that he wanted the UK government to push for full and unfettered access to the European single market.
However, the Labour politician said he could not foresee any separate arrangements being made to ensure any of the home nations had individual access.
The Welsh first minister told the programme: "Well, I don't think a separate arrangement works if I'm honest with you. I don't see how there can be separate market access arrangements for the different nations within the UK that share the same land mass."
His comments come after it emerged earlier this week that Alex Salmond had held informal talks at the European Free Trade Association.
His successor Nicola Sturgeon has said she is exploring ways of keeping Scotland within the European single market even if the UK government withdraws.
But Mr Jones said: "It's a matter for the Scottish government who they talk to, of course, but I can't see how it would work.
"For example, if Scotland had separate market access arrangements, that would mean possibly different customs arrangements, that would mean there would be customs posts on the border. There's no other way to deal with that.
"If you're Greenland and you're a long way away from the European land mass, it's easier. But otherwise, how do you control the flow of goods that are traded at different terms on the same island?"
Scotland's External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop, who will also attend the summit, insisted there was agreement with Carwyn Jones over the importance of retaining access to the single market following Brexit negotiations.
She told Good Morning Scotland the main aim of the meeting was to ensure the UK government did not pursue a so-called "hard Brexit".
She also acknowledged that she had met numerous foreign officials in recent weeks in order to further Scotland's case.
It follows claims in Friday's Daily Telegraph that Spain would oppose any plan for Scotland to retain single market access.
Ms Hyslop said: "I've met the Spanish ambassador twice in the last two weeks, I've met most of the ambassadors and a number of ministers in UK capitals as well.
"Nobody is negotiating just now. The UK isn't negotiating because they don't have a position. The EU are not negotiating because the UK doesn't have a position.
"What we are doing is making sure that people understand Scotland's perspective and there's a lot of understanding of the fact that 62% of Scots voted to remain and we want to be part of that European market."
The Scottish team attending the talks in Cardiff also includes Ms Sturgeon's Brexit minister Mike Russell and Early Years Minister Mark McDonald.
This will be the third summit for the normally biannual group in 2016, after an emergency session also hosted in Wales following the EU referendum.
