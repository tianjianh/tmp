WW2 pilot died after two attacks on Yeovil District Hospital ward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A World War Two veteran died after twice being attacked by another patient on a hospital ward, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Spitfire pilot Kenneth Tyrer, 90, was "barged" to the floor by a patient at Yeovil District Hospital, Somerset, on 9 June last year.
Three days later the frail pensioner was kicked to the ground by the same patient and died 48 hours later.
In a narrative conclusion, the coroner said there was "no risk assessment or action taken" after the first assault.
Mr Tyrer, from Milborne Port in Somerset, had dementia but had been declared medically fit to leave hospital on 15 June.
The Grandfather-of-two was due to move into a care home with Sheila, his wife of 66 years.
An inquest at Wells Town Hall heard the first attack on Mr Tyrer had been recorded as a "no harm" fall by hospital staff.
In the second attack, he suffered a fractured hip but after undergoing an operation he developed pneumonia and died.
Mr Tyrer's assailant, referred to only as Patient A in the inquest, could not be detained, interviewed or charged in relation to the incident as he has dementia.
Tony Williams, senior coroner for Somerset, reached a narrative conclusion. The hospital previously identified two "missed opportunities" in Mr Tyrer's care.
Mr Williams said: "No formal wandering risk assessment had been completed.
"There had been no risk assessment or action taken as to the impact of Mr Tyrer's behaviour or that of his assailant prior to the assault on 12 June."
