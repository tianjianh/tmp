Shafiq Latif missed Dundee City Council warden Maureen Feuntos by "inches" after she put a Â£30 fine on his vehicle.
The incident happened in the city's Strathmartine Road in November last year.
Latif was fined Â£600 and banned from driving for a year at Dundee Sheriff Court.
The court heard Latif had parked his car up on the pavement opposite an RBS bank branch beside the city's Kingsway dual carriageway.
Ms Feuntos then fined him because his Peugeot 207 was on double yellow lines.
When Latif returned to the car, Ms Feuntos was standing nearby.
In an incident captured on the warden's body camera, Latif then revved his engine and drove at her.
Fiscal depute John Adams told Dundee Sheriff Court: "She saw the accused's car which had two wheels on the pavement and was on double yellow lines.
"She placed the ticket on the windscreen then stood two metres away with her back against a wall.
"The accused then returned to his car and revved the engine then drove towards the lady.
"The car missed her by inches and appears to have been driven at her to give her a fright."
Latif, 33, of Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge of dangerous driving.
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC fined Latif and imposed the driving ban.
She said: "This lady was just doing her job. She had her body against the wall and you missed her by inches which makes this serious."
