They say residents of a slum in the Malad area fell ill after drinking the alcohol on Wednesday morning.
More than 30 other people are being treated in hospitals, and the death toll could rise further.
Toxic alcohol deaths are a regular occurrence in India, where people often drink cheap country liquor.
Five suspects have been detained in the latest case.
Eight police personnel were suspended for suspected negligence following the incident, local media reported.
Tayra Khan, wife of one of the victims, told the Mid-Day newspaper that her husband was admitted to hospital early on Thursday after "he complained of vomiting and pain in the stomach".
"He died three hours later, leaving me and my three little children alone."
Outlook India magazine quoted a police official as saying they were going door to door trying to locate more potential victims.
As a result of the search eight people have already been admitted to hospital, the official said.
At least 29 people were killed after consuming toxic alcohol in Uttar Pradesh state in January.
India has witnessed many other incidents of toxic alcohol deaths in the past:
