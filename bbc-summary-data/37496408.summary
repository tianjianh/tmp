White, 35, was injured during Connacht's win over Leinster at the Sportsground in Galway in March.
The former Waikato captain made his debut for Ireland in August last year and won 13 caps in all.
"While it's disappointing to finish this way I can look back at my career with a lot of pride," said White.
The New Zealand-born prop featured in all five of Ireland's 2015 World Cup matches and all of their 2016 Six Nations games.
He joined Pro12 champions Connacht in the summer of 2012, having spent a season at Leinster under present Ireland coach Joe Schmidt.
The dynamic front-rower played in 58 games over four seasons with Connacht and was introduced off the bench against Scotland at the Aviva Stadium to make his Ireland bow in a World Cup warm-up game.
The prop added: "I am retiring at 35 years of age and with so many great memories from my time playing in both New Zealand and Ireland.
"To have the chance to represent Ireland at the World Cup was an extremely special time in my life and something I will cherish forever."
