[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colum Martin, from Motherwell, was caught with three of the smoke grenades during a search outside St Johnstone's McDiarmid Park last season.
He was banned from attending any SPFL match prior to being sentenced at Perth Sheriff Court on 3 August.
Martin admitted possessing controlled items on 13 December last year.
A second charge of possessing cocaine at Perth police station on the same date was dropped by prosecutors.
Depute fiscal Tina Dickie told the court: "The St Johnstone v Celtic match was due to take place at McDiarmid Park.
"Security staff were standing outside the turnstiles.
"They stopped the accused as he was about to enter because they suspected he was in possession of some kind of controlled item.
"From his coat pocket was recovered a small black container, a smoke grenade.
"Police were called over and they found a further two inside his coat pocket."
Sheriff Fiona Tait continued the case for reports and the bail condition preventing Martin attending any SPFL match was also kept in place.
