The taoiseach has also indicated that his government is considering setting up a security and intelligence unit.
Mr Kenny was responding to questions from Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin.
He said he has called a meeting for Thursday morning "of all the agencies - defence, justice, transport, health" to look at the security situation.
"I have to say that I was very impressed with the immediate response of the first responders in Manchester to the tragedy," he said.
"There is an issue here as to whether we should have a security and intelligence unit, separate from the way the structure currently operates and we will reflect on that.
"It's important for the government to be able to give assurance to people that everything humanly possible is done to protect innocent people and the citizens of the our country."
He said that he would share that information with the House as it is important to get it right.
Gardai (Irish police) have said they are liaising closely with the security and law enforcement agencies in the UK following the attack in Manchester.
