The emergency services were called to Prestonhill Quarry in Inverkeithing at about 21:20 on Thursday following reports of a teenager in the water.
It is understood the teenager is 18-year-old John McKay from Kirkcaldy.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "Inquiries are ongoing to determine the full circumstances surrounding this incident."
In August 2014, Cameron Lancaster, from Burntisland, Fife, died at the quarry.
Alice McGarry, councillor for Inverkeithing, Dalgety Bay and Aberdour, told the BBC Scotland news website she was meeting with MSP Annabelle Ewing to talk about using the new Community Empowerment Act to take over the privately-owned quarry in a bid to make it safe.
She said: "Following the tragedy last year the police conducted a safety assessment of the quarry and found there were steps needed to be taken.
"The council has tried to contact the owners but they don't communicate.
"Two deaths in a year at the quarry just cannot be allowed to go on."
