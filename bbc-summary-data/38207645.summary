[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A GP surgery in Wrexham county borough will end its NHS contract after being unable to fill two vacant doctor posts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Health officials have said Ruabon Medical Centre, which has more than 9,000 patients, will not close and there is no need for patients to register elsewhere.
It follows similar decisions by surgeries in Denbighshire, Conwy and elsewhere in Wrexham.
The contract will end on 31 March.
A Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board spokesman said: "This is a high performing practice, which is very popular and well thought of by patients, and the GPs can take pride in their ability to sustain a high level of service.
"However, they have not been successful in recruiting doctors to replace two full time partners who left the practice earlier this year."
