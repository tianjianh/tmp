Cristiani Girelli's goal in first-half injury-time gave Italy a deserved lead with Melania Gabbiadini's 76th-minute strike doubling their advantage.
Girelli hit Italy's third in injury-time to complete a straightforward win.
NI keeper Emma Higgins made a number of fine saves while Girelli also struck the woodwork.
The Irish remain fourth in Group Six with qualification out of reach as Italy edge closer to a place in the Netherlands next year.
Group leaders Switzerland are already through as they cannot be caught after winning their opening seven games.
The Swiss host Northern Ireland in Biel in the final round of qualifiers on Tuesday evening.
Italy, managed by 1982 World Cup winner Antonio Cabrini, have guaranteed second place and victory over the Czech Republic on Tuesday will ensure their qualification as one of the six-best group runners-up.
Home keeper Higgins was kept busy in the first half as she saved a Barbara Bonansea effort superbly and also denied Alice Parisi and Gabbiadini.
However Higgins was beaten right on the stroke of half-time as Girelli put the Italians ahead after being set up by Gabbiadini.
Italy were even more dominant in the second period, forcing a series of corners, with Higgins denying Daniela Stracchi and Girelli hitting the frame of the goal.
The inevitable second goal came on 76 minutes as Bonansea set up Gabbiadini to score and Girelli added the third in added time.
