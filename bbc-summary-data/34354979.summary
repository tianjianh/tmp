Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital maternity care concern

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concerns have been raised about the long-term future of maternity services at a hospital in north Wales.

An internal document, seen by BBC Wales, raises the possibility of downgrading the unit at Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd when a new specialist centre is established for the region.
The document from Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said the number of deliveries could drop to 500 a year.
The health board said the document was part of a review of all its options.
About 2,000 babies are born every year at Ysbyty Gwynedd, another 2,000 at Wrexham Maelor Hospital and about 3,000 at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan - where the new centre will be created.
The board is consulting on temporarily removing consultant-led maternity care at Glan Clwyd or one of the other hospitals because of staff shortages.
The internal document outlines three options, including one which would keep the service similar to its current form.
Gwynedd councillor Sian Gwenllian said: "It just does not make sense, but we have to take it seriously because it's there in black and white, it's being considered."
