Kidderminster Harriers have agreed a deal with West Bromwich Albion to host Under-21 Premier League matches at Aggborough next season.

The agreement could also see the National League side's home being used for the Baggies' Under-18 side and may include potential FA Youth Cup ties.
"We're excited about getting this completed for some time," said Harriers chief executive Colin Gordon.
"West Brom are great to deal with. It's an arrangement that'll benefit us."
Harriers have been working on finding a new partnership since the start of March when it was announced that National League North side Worcester City would  end their groundshare arrangement after three years at Aggborough.
Gordon, who will give up his temporary role as head coach at the end of the season, says the new deal will help move the club forward off the field.
"There is a financial aspect to the deal that suits us as a club," he said. "But, more importantly, we're looking forward to hosting some exciting games with some of the brightest young talent in the country.
"The pitch at Aggborough has held up magnificently this season thanks to the work of our own groundsman but, from next season, the wear and tear will be significantly less and we'll be able to tap into some of their expertise in that area as well."
Harriers have also confirmed that Albion will play a pre-season friendly at Aggborough this summer, the date of which will be confirmed in due course.
With only six wins all season, Harriers' difficult season is likely to end in relegation this weekend.
Bottom of the table and 14 points from safety with five games to play, they have to win at Welling on Saturday and hope that Halifax, Guiseley and Torquay all lose.
A point for either Halifax or Guiseley would leave Harriers with only a mathematical chance of survival.
