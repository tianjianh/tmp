[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eastleigh 1-1 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling Guiseley came from behind to earn a point against Eastleigh and maintain a three-point cushion above the National League relegation places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors conceded a calamitous goal after two minutes when Adam Lockwood passed to keeper Steven Drench, but the ball bobbled over his foot and in.
Drench later kept out Jai Reason's shot and a James Constable's effort to redeem his early howler.
James Hurst scored from a free-kick to restore parity in the second half.
Guiseley remain in 18th place in the table, a position they have held for the last nine matches.
Eastleigh slipped a place to seventh and are two points outside the play-off places.
