[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People who become seriously ill overnight in North Somerset could be sent to hospital in Bristol or Taunton.

It is one of the ideas put out for public consultation by the area's clinical commissioning group because of funding and staffing problems.
The plan would affect people who suffer major trauma, heart attacks and strokes between 22:00 and 08:00.
Those with broken bones, or needing stitches, would still be seen and treated in Weston General.
The overnight A&E plan will mean those needing urgent care in a specialist unit would be sent to Southmead Hospital, Bristol Royal Infirmary, or Taunton's Musgrove Park Hospital.
An alternative plan is to expand Weston's critical care unit to make it more efficient by investing in more staffing and resources.
The consultation will run for eight weeks before any decisions are made.
Dr Mary Backhouse, chief clinical officer at NHS North Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group, said it was also looking at increasing other operations provided in Weston.
"Weston has four really good operating theatres - they've got all the technical facilities that we need for a whole range of operations.
"At the moment people go to a variety of places and we want to make sure as many people can have surgery there," she said.
The commissioning group said by offering more capacity for non-complex surgery, it could boost its share of NHS funding and enable more people to be treated closer to home.
The group wants feedback by 6 April.
