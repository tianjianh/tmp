[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man died at the Gunmakers Arms, Aston, Birmingham, on 10 December.
A coroner's inquest later ruled the customer died from acute ethyl alcohol intoxication and a pre-existing heart condition.
Police have asked the city council to review the pub's licence, which it will do at a meeting of the Licensing Committee on Tuesday.
The committee will be shown documents including police witness statements, ambulance and police logs and the coroner's report.
In a statement to police the bar manager, Radoslav Halabrin, said the customer had been in the pub since about 18:00 GMT on 9 December, drinking cider and spirits.
He told police the customer later grabbed a bottle of spirits and drank directly from it.
At about 23:30 GMT he fell asleep in a chair, Mr Halabrin said.
He was still asleep at 00:30 GMT when Mr Halabrin and another customer decided to get some food.
The bar manager told police he placed the customer on the floor "in the recovery position", locked the pub and went to get food with the other customer.
They called an ambulance when they returned after half an hour and could not revive the man, the police statement said.
West Midlands Police later submitted a sudden death report to the coroner.
The committee can take a number of actions, including modifying the conditions of the pub's licence, suspending it for up to three months or revoking it completely.
