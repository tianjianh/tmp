[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have appealed for help from the public after an angler was swept away by strong waves while fishing from rocks in the Borders on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A major search operation was started at about 17:20 when Marek Zoldak, 32, and a friend fell into waters at Eyemouth.
The other man managed to scramble to the shore and was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary with minor injuries.
Mr Zoldak has not been found and police are asking anyone who was in the area on Sunday afternoon to contact them.
The two men were fishing just east of Killiedraught Bay when the incident occurred.
Emergency services were called and a search operation involving police, HM Coastguard, the RNLI and the RAF took place to try to find Mr Zoldak.
The search of the waters was called off on Monday morning at 08:00.
Insp Bryan Burns asked anyone who might have information about the incident to contact the police.
"Killiedraught Bay is a popular destination for fishermen as well as with dog walkers and local holidaymakers," he said.
"Given the mild conditions on Sunday, I am hopeful that a number of people would have noticed the men standing on top of the rocks between 1:30pm and 5:20pm.
"Anyone who remembers seeing the fishermen is asked to contact police on 101."
