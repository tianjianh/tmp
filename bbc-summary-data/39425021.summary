[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fabian Cowdrey: Kent announce 24-year-old's departure by mutual consent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fabian Cowdrey has left Kent by mutual consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cowdrey, 24, the son and grandson of former Kent and England captains Chris and Colin respectively, made his first-class debut for the county in 2013.
The academy graduate featured more in limited-overs cricket as a top-order batsman and part-time slow left-armer.
"It was not an easy decision for me and I'm sad to be leaving," Cowdrey said. "I believe for the club and my own well-being, it's the right time."
