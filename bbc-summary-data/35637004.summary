The Shakers had the majority of the early pressure and top scorer Leon Clarke finished Chris Hussey's cross.
Ryan Lowe doubled the lead with a placed effort before Marcus Maddison gave Posh hope with his strike.
However, Ricardo Santos was sent off for a second bookable offence for the visitors and Andrew Tutte smashed home from the resultant free-kick.
Bury go above Peterborough into 13th in League One and Graham Westley's side has lost every game since losing to West Bromwich Albion on penalties in an FA Cup fourth-round replay.
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"It was a positive result and a positive performance. Another win at home.
"In the first half we tore them to shreds in every way. Every time we attacked them we looked threatening.
"Some of what we've missed at times was totally on display tonight.
"It was a real makeshift team, and that's what pleased me more than anything. It was about the lads that keep stepping up."
