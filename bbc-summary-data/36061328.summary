Joel Thomas gave Raith the lead in seven minutes but immediately went off injured to be replaced by Ryan Hardie.
Falkirk deservedly levelled in 56 minutes when McHugh set up Craig Sibbald to score.
Blair Alston blunder allowed Hardie in for his sixth goal for the player on loan from Rangers, only for McHugh to earn the draw in the dying minutes.
Falkirk's superior goal difference advantage over Hibs means they should clinch second place with a home win against Morton next weekend.
It was a short but eventful second start for Thomas as the former Hamilton Accies striker scored the opening goal in seven minutes and was substituted immediately.
He forced home a Harry Panayiotou cross but got injured in the process and had to be replaced by Hardie before the game could be restarted.
That goal did settle a side that showed five changes from the one that beat Dumbarton the previous weekend and the pace of Hardie through the middle was a constant threat.

So much so that the player on-loan from Rangers should have double Raith's lead on the half-hour mark after being set up by another incisive pass from Panayuioto.
His first attempt was blocked and the teenager lifted the rebound over goalkeeper Danny Rogers but also over the crossbar which was a real let off for the Bairns.
Veteran striker Lee Miller squandered two decent chances to get the visitors level before the break, first when he tried to be too precise with a header just after the Rovers opener.
Then shortly before the break Sibbald got clear down the left and picked out Miller at the back post with a clever cross that the former Aberdeen striker failed to connect properly.
Falkirk were fired up from the start of the second-half knowing how important avoiding defeat was, and Sibbald's initial leveller was the least they deserved from the pace and penetration they brought to the game.
However, a blunder by Alston allowed Raith to regain the lead in 70 minutes as Hardie pinched possession and finished in style for his sixth goal for the Kirkcaldy club.
But Falkirk have proved on numerous occasions just how resilient they are, and McHugh's eighth goal for the club leaves them within touching distance of pipping Hibs to the runners-up spot.
