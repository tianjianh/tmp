[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sloe gin-makers have gathered at a Kent pub to compete for a coveted World Champion title.

Tasting of the hand-crafted entries took place at the 18th Century George Inn at Tunbridge Wells on Wednesday.
Sloe berries are used to make the red liqueur which normally has an alcohol content of between 15 and 30%.
Edinburgh-based Demijohn was crowned Champion Artisan Sloe Ginster for the second year running.
Kevin Ladley, of Dartford, Kent, won the best homemade title based on the "colour, bouquet, sweetness and character" of his sloe gin.
Landlord Greg Elliot said Mr Ladley initially tied with another contestant but he was crowned on the "character" of his concoction after a "drink-off".
This year marks the 7th annual event, which organisers say began when pub locals began arguing over the perfect sloe gin recipe.
Sloe berries are hand-picked from the blackthorn bush and ripen in late September.
Andrew Ferguson, of 2014 winners Demijohn, said the berries are "inedible" and "disgusting" when picked because they are so dry but "put it in gin with a bit of sugar and it is amazing."
Mr Elliot said hand crafted sloe gins are "generally superior" to commercially-produced products, which he said produce "an inferior flavour akin to a fruit cordial taste".
Organisers said all proceeds from the event will be donated to the MS Society.
Making sloe gin is slow but there's no cooking required, just patience.
Ingredients:
450g/1lb sloes
225g/8oz caster sugar
1 litre/1ยพ pint gin
Preparation:
Prick the tough skin of the sloes all over with a clean needle and put in a large sterilised jar.
Pour in the sugar and the gin, seal tightly and shake well.
Store in a cool, dark cupboard and shake every other day for a week. Then shake once a week for at least two months.
Strain the sloe gin through muslin into a sterilised bottle.
