Caledon Estate opens to public for church fundraiser

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A privately-owned country estate in Northern Ireland will open its gates to the public tomorrow, for the first time in more than two decades.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Caledon Estate in County Tyrone will play host to a family fun day and craft fair in aid of St John's Parish Church in Caledon.
Caledon Castle was built in 1779 by James Alexander, a member of the Irish House of Commons for Londonderry.
Special guest at the fair will be Dame Mary Peters.
"I consider it a privilege to hold this event for the local community and further afield," said Lord Caledon, the seventh Earl of Caledon.
"People can come and share something that is special to me and my family and hopefully, it will be special to them for a day."
The estate has for many years been hidden away from view behind heavy ornate gates and a stringent security regime.
However, the grounds and the gardens, which sweep down to the Blackwater River, have been beautifully maintained.
A monument in the grounds of the estate was blown up in 1973.
But Lord Caledon is keen to acknowledge and reflect how the situation has changed since those dark days.
"I think the past is the past," he said. "This current climate that we live in here has been different for some time.
"It's wonderful for us to be able to do it to the extent that we can do it.
"The last time we opened the estate, we had a great big fence round the house and very obviously visible security.
"We don't have that any more and that is wonderful for us as a family, and hopefully it will also enhance the visitor experience."
Lord Caledon, the Queen's lord lieutenant for Armagh, also owns a house in Oxfordshire and another estate in Hertfordshire.
"I've lived and worked in London for a lot of my life," he said.
"And like most people who do that, I love to get away from it, so it's a real privilege to live in Northern Ireland.
I think we have a great quality of life here. The people are great and we're not too overcrowded so all in all, I think we have a wonderful country."
The estate was bought from the seventh earl of Cork for Â£94,400 in 1776 ,by James Alexander (later first earl of Caledon).
Between 1806 and 1811 the first earl of Caledon spent more than Â£17,000 when he employed English architect, John Nash, to extend and repair Caledon Castle.
