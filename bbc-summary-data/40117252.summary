[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scotland v England: Goalkeeper Allan McGregor withdraws from Gordon Strachan's squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull City goalkeeper Allan McGregor has withdrawn from the Scotland squad to face England, with Hearts' Jack Hamilton being recalled in his place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hamilton had been one of four goalkeepers named in Gordon Strachan's initial 29-man squad, but that was cut to 24 last week.
The 23-year-old is now back in because McGregor, 35, has a thumb injury.
Celtic's Craig Gordon is expected to retain his place against England for the 10 June World Cup qualifier.
McGregor's Hull team-mate, David Marshall, is likely to be back-up to the 34-year-old.
