Elliot Bradbrook and Duane Ofori-Acheampong dragged the hosts level three times, but goals from Deacon, Craig Eastmond, Maxime Biamou and Stearn clinched Sutton's first away win since August and puts them into the second round for the first time in five years.
With less than a minute played Biamou crossed low to Eastmond, whose shot trickled through the hands of Deren Ibrahim.
Dartford recovered quickly, with Bradbrook striking from 25 yards to level the scores, but 10 minutes later failure to clear a Sutton corner allowed an unmarked Deacon to fire home.
In the 17th minute referee Samuel Allison awarded a debatable penalty for an Eastmond handball, and Bradbrook duly converted.
But just six minutes later Deacon burst through a statuesque Dartford back four and squared to Biamou, who shot low in the bottom left-hand corner.
Ofori-Acheampong equalised early in the second half, but goals from Stearn and Deacon put distance between the teams before Stearn's 20-yard effort capped the win three minutes into injury time.
