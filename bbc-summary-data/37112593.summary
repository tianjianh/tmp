The 26-year-old Ghana forward, a Â£20.5m signing from Swansea, was injured 35 minutes into his Hammers league debut in the 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on Monday.
"It is not good and he needs surgery," said manager Slaven Bilic after his side's 1-1 Europa League qualifying draw against Astra Giurgiu.
"Four months is a big, big blow for us but we have to cope with it."
West Ham co-chairman David Gold earlier tweeted: "Sad news. Ayew has injured his quadriceps and will need surgery.
"He will be out for 4 months. Good luck Andre."
