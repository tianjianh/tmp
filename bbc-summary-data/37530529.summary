Graham Westley is the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Warren Feeney as Newport County manager.

Feeney was sacked on 28 October with the club bottom of League Two.
County director Gavin Foxall would not confirm Westley was in the running, but admitted the former Stevenage manager is well qualified.
''We are looking for somebody with that type of pedigree and profile to get us out of the position we are in today,'' he said.
Newport hope to appoint a new boss in time for next Saturday's League Two game at Colchester.
Currently without a club, Westley, 46, was in charge at Peterborough from September 2015 until last April, having also been manager at Preston.
Westley led Stevenage into the Football League and then into League One.
Foxall told Radio Wales the process to find a new boss was continuing this weekend, with a view to an appointment next Thursday.
Newport were due to host Stevenage at Rodney Parade on Saturday, but the game was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.
It was the second time in a month that Newport have had a home game called off after heavy rain.
Newport share the ground with owners Newport Rugby Club, who played on Thursday night, and the Newport Gwent Dragons regional rugby team, who lost 26-17 to Glasgow on Friday.
