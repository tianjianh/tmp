[SN]TITLE[SN]
Heathrow Airport compensation views in Berkshire wanted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People in Berkshire who think they should be compensated if Heathrow Airport is expanded are being urged to attend a series of exhibition events.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A proposed new runway north-west of the airport would affect residents living in and around Slough and Windsor.
Slough Borough Council said it was important residents were compensated for an increase in noise and the impact on property values.
Three events across Slough and Windsor will be held next month.
The airport has already set aside Â£550m for compensation and said owners of 750 homes that would need to be demolished would be offered 25% above the market value of their properties.
Slough council is also making copies of the consultation document available at a number of its public buildings, including all of the town's libraries.
The Heathrow Airport consultation runs until 12 October.
