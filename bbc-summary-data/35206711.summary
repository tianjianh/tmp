Emanuel Lutchman, 25, from Rochester, was charged on plotting to kill people at a restaurant on New Year's Eve.
Mr Lutchman told an FBI informant he would use a machete and knives in the attack, officials say.
Before his arrest, he made a video pledging allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the FBI said.
Mr Lutchman came to the attention of authorities after he began expressing support for IS online.
"I will take a life, I don't have a problem with that," Mr Lutchman is quoting as saying in court documents.
A convert to Islam, he has a history of mental illness and lengthy criminal record, officials said.
Authorities in major US cities such as New York and Los Angeles are on high alert for an attack during well-attended New Year's Eve festivities.
New York has deployed about 6,000 police officers to patrol Times Square, which is expected to draw about a million people.
