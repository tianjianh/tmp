Paige Chivers murder trial:: Accused says 'victim' is alive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering a 15-year-old girl from Lancashire has told a jury he believes she is still alive and had referred to her as a "hide and seek champion".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paige Chivers went missing in Blackpool in 2007 but her body has never been found.
Robert Ewing, 60, denies killing her and perverting the course of justice.
Co-defendant Gareth Dewhurst, 46, denies helping dispose of her body and a serious sexual offence.
Giving evidence at Preston Crown Court, Mr Ewing was asked by defence barrister Stuart Denney why he had made references to Paige being a "hide and seek champion".
He answered: "I'm absolutely convinced to this day she is still alive somewhere. Just hiding."
The prosecution has claimed Mr Ewing had an inappropriate sexual interest in the teenager and took advantage of her "chaotic and dysfunctional" upbringing.
But when asked by Mr Denney if he ever had any kind of sexual contact with Paige, he replied: "None at all."
Mr Ewing, of Kincraig Place, Blackpool, earlier told the court that the reason he moved carpet and flooring tiles from his flat shortly after she disappeared was because of his smelly cat.
The jury also heard he was once a member of the National Front and was interested in right-wing politics.
Mr Ewing met his co-accused when he applied to join the British National Party in Blackpool and they became close friends.
The court heard pages of his diary had been torn out during 2007 - the year Paige disappeared.
He said he suffered from memory loss and would write entries as reminders, and had removed them when no longer required.
The trial continues.
