Excrement returns to Eton Wick waterway

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Excrement from a sewage works has been appearing in a Berkshire waterway - despite a clean-up operation to rid it of sewage caused by the floods of 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Environment Agency had ordered Thames Water to clean Roundmoor ditch at Eton Wick by August 2014.
But residents said the stream, which flows into the River Thames, is brown again and causing damage to wildlife.
Thames Water apologised for the "unsightly" solids but said the sewage was "not raw" as it had been treated.
The company installed new flow meters in August after the winter floods of 2013-14 increased flows into treatment works at nearby Slough and caused sewage to be discharged.
The stream had to be restocked with 3,500 fish after an earlier clean-up.
Resident Mark Cannon said the sewage had "inexplicably" returned and he is demanding answers from Thames Water.
Thames Water said: "While we understand the solids floating in the stream look unsightly, we would like to reassure local people they are not harmful to the stream itself or to the wildlife and fish that depend on it.
"We've been testing the water in the stream throughout the day and what can be seen is not raw sewage but matter which has been through the treatment process."
Mr Cannon said: "This is flowing through three miles of public access land before it gets into the Thames.
"I don't think people should be going anywhere near it."
