[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Watkins struck either side of the break and late on while David Wheeler tapped home on 53 minutes for the Grecians.
Sean Rigg's late header proved a mere consolation for the struggling Exiles.
The win moved the visitors up to 11th, but leaves Newport County bottom of the table and five points from safety.
Manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I thought we played with good character in the first half.
"To concede before half time was tough. In the second half we slumped a little bit and were still feeling sorry for ourselves.
"By the time we kicked ourselves out of that we were 3-0 down.
"We effectively lost the game in the five or ten minutes after half time."
