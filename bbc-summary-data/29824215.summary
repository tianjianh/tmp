Mark Clattenburg has been suspended from refereeing in the Premier League after driving away from a match alone.

He had tickets for an Ed Sheeran concert, and was worried about being late.
He also spoke to Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock on the phone too, which was also against the rules.
We're looking at other personalities from the world of sport who have picked up suspensions for bizarre reasons - real or otherwise.
Tevez was told he was "finished" at Manchester City by then boss Roberto Martinez after he refused to warm up in a Champions League match against Bayern Munich in 2011.
The Argentine was fined a record Â£792,000. He was suspended, so decided to fly to Argentina without permission for a few months.
Despite the fall out, Mancini performed an impressive about-turn by picking Tevez once he did return to Manchester.
The Frenchman was handed a 12-month ban for drug abuse after he tested positive for cocaine in 2009.
After serving some of that ban, it was overturned on appeal after his explanation that he had tested positive after kissing a girl in a nightclub and had inadvertently let cocaine into his bloodstream as a result.
A university sports team has been suspended from playing for the rest of the academic year after calling female students "slags" and "mingers" in a leaflet handed out at a Freshers' Fair.
The men's rugby club apologised for the leaflet admitting it contained "inexcusably offensive and stigmatising language". The leaflets were withdrawn on the second day of LSE's Freshers' Fair.
Ireland missed an international match back in 2007 by falsely claiming his gran had died.
The midfielder hasn't played for the Republic of Ireland since it was discovered he had lied about the death in the family.
Earlier this year it was reported that the same grandmother bumped into Roy Keane on an aeroplane and pleaded with him to end her grandson's international exile.
The Uruguayan had already used his teeth as an offensive weapon when he decided to take another nibble out of a player at this year's World Cup.
Having missed the start of the tournament because of injury, Suarez had stormed back by scoring against England in the group stages.
But it was against Italy that Suarez really left his mark, literally. He took a bite out of Giorgio Chiellini, picking up a four-month ban in the process.
It is the longest ever ban in World Cup history.
