Ross McCormack capitalised on poor defending to round the goalkeeper and slot Fulham ahead early on.
Marnick Vermijl's fine solo effort drew Preston level but Moussa Dembele tucked in to earn Fulham back-to-back wins for the first time since October.
The hosts almost levelled through Jermaine Beckford late on but he could not keep his close-range effort down.
A first-half that lacked quality saw Preston's Tom Clarke suffer a serious-looking injury and he had to be replaced early on.
But, despite the absence of their captain, Preston rallied after half-time and equalised when substitute Verrmijl skipped past two defenders and lashed in a low shot.
But Dembele's winner inflicted a first home defeat since January on Preston.
Fulham have now scored more goals away from home than any other Championship side so far this season, netting 29 times on their travels.
Preston manager Simon Grayson:
"It was a frustrating night. Sometimes in games you don't get what you deserve.
"I thought that was the case tonight. We were the better team, created the better chances.
"They got the early goal but we passed the ball better and there was only one team looking to win the game. We weren't helped by some of the tactics they used at times."
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic:

"We are not safe. With six games in front of us, now it's six points we don't have reason to think about a holiday.
"We need to do much for our away supporters who travel with us and push us towards safety.
"It's not time for holiday, we need to give these people something back because we haven't given them too many happy afternoons. We can fix that in these six games ahead of us."
