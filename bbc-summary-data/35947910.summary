Holyrood 2016: Brewing up arguments to win over voters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
So there I was, touring a brewery. Ok, ok, stop sniggering at the back. And, before you ask, I wasn't there to organise anything - other than some reaction to our opinion poll on priorities for the Scottish election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some journalists say they dislike conducting vox pop interviews. Myself, I love them. They are frequently a salutary reminder of what really matters to voters and, more significantly, what does not.
I have carried out vox pops in umpteen locations across Scotland, with varying success. I still bear the scars of trying to ask folk in Stornoway about religion - and folk in Thurso about nuclear energy.
But, more often than not, the experience is highly positive. It was thus during the referendum, in particular. I recall an occasion in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street when one kind lady opted to drum up trade for me by inviting pedestrians to stop and listen.
I had a similar experience in the City Square in the great and noble city of Dundee. They formed a polite queue to offer their views on the telly.
The referendum, of course, energised politics like never before and, possibly, since. However, in the Edinburgh Beer Factory, I found more than a touch of that energy had returned to the debate. The topic? Tax.
There was drollery, naturally. What tax measure did they favour in a brewery? Complete abolition of the tax on beer, of course.
But there was thoroughly engaged argument too. They had thought, seriously and in detail, about the sundry offers on tax. I encountered talk, avid talk, about the possible penny increase on all rates, proposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
I heard reflected back to me the argument that folk in Scotland should not pay more at all than folk in England: that position courtesy of the Conservatives.
I heard discussion of the SNP position, the reversal of the Chancellor's effective cut for higher earners, achieved by altering the threshold for Scotland. And of the Labour plan to increase the very top rate from 45p to 50p.
There was a complete absence of zealotry. A delightful lack of minds firmly made up. These were big decisions, to be taken carefully.
Production only started at this small craft brewery last summer. They are all keenly aware that their success rests with the state of their market, mainly Scotland initially, with ambitions elsewhere.
That means the state of the economy really counts. That means tax and spending really matter. The choices to be taken at this election are critically important.
See the main articles on this site for details of the poll. But I was struck by two characteristics among my informal brewery focus group.
They wanted product, discernible product. That view was expressed more than once - and tended to draw nods of assent.
Eight questions on tax, council tax and welfare (plus mean score)
All figures are mean scores based on answers provided between one and 10. One means the policy should never be put in place, and 10 means that it is very important and should be put in place quickly.
