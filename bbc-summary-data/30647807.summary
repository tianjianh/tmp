Tens of thousands of people flocked to Edinburgh and London to attend the annual parties there, and other events took place across the UK to welcome the new year.
Read more about the celebrations.
Edinburgh held its customary Hogmanay street party, culminating in a shower of fireworks over the castle.
Around 75,000 people from across the world could be heard counting down the final moments of 2014 in Edinburgh before joining in a mass rendition of Auld Lang Syne.
The traditional torchlight procession through the streets of the Scottish capital included men dressed as Shetland vikings.
Revellers also flocked to London in their thousands to see the fireworks display along the Thames.
The sky was illuminated in pink over the London Eye.
It was the first year attendees have had to buy tickets to watch the fireworks in central London - a step which London Mayor Boris Johnson said would help ensure the safety of the 100,000-strong crowd.
Although attendance was kept at lower levels than in previous years in London, the clean-up operation in London will last well into 1 January.
Fireworks marked the unveiling of a Rugby World Cup 2015 emblem over the River Tyne in Newcastle, one of the tournament's 11 host cities.
