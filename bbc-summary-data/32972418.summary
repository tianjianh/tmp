[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Sydney man has been found guilty of murdering his estranged wife, who was originally from Bangor in County Down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Victoria Comrie Cullen, 39, was found in the grounds of a fishing club in Sydney in January 2014.
She had been stabbed repeatedly and had her throat cut.
Christopher Cullen, 51, had admitted inflicting the injuries, but pleaded not guilty to murder on the grounds of self-defence and provocation. He will be sentenced at a later date.
His plea of guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter was rejected by prosecutors.
A few months before her death, Cullen ordered his wife out of their home and threatened to kill her, accusing her of having an affair.
Cullen was arrested after emerging from mangroves at the anglers club in Taren Point, in southern Sydney, in January 2014.
The body of his Mrs Cullen was found kneeling face down on grass behind the car that had been used to drive her to the location.
An Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) had previously been taken out against Cullen, after an incident at his wife's workplace, a hair and beauty salon in Sylvania Waters.
Cullen had gone to the business while his wife was at work, and held up signs saying she was sleeping with clients.
