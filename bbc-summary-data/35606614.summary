The 46-year-old victim was in the office of his van hire shop on Court Road in Greenwich, south east London when the men burst in.
They choked him until he lost consciousness and made off with the £15,000 watch.
Police have released the footage in a bid to track down the two thieves.
The man was sitting at his desk when the robbers pounced and gripped him in a headlock before wrestling him to the floor and swiping the watch from his wrist.
The pair ran off and were driven away by a woman and a third man in a black Peugeot 206 on nearby Middle Park Avenue.
Police describe the first suspect as a 25-30 year-old white male, with a goatee beard.
The second is described as a 38-40 year-old white male with a scarred complexion.
Det Con Andrew Payne said: "The suspects stood outside the van hire shop in broad daylight for some time, appearing to look at the price list before entering and violently attacking the victim, choking him to the point where he lost consciousness.
"We have taken the decision to release the footage to show the level of violence used, and ask the public for help in apprehending the persons responsible.
"We believe the victim was targeted by the suspects to steal his watch."
