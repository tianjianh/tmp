A man once dubbed the world's fattest has said having a fiancee has given him new responsibility and fear as he waits for life-changing weight loss surgery.

Paul Mason, 54, from Ipswich, used to weigh 70 stone (440kg) but has lost about 45 stone (285kg).
Mr Mason, who hopes surgery to remove excess skin will shed seven stone (44kg), is engaged to Rebecca Mountain.
"I am really worried, because I've got a little bit more responsibility this time," he said.
"I just can't wait to get over the recovery period.
"I'll be glad to take my dog for a walk down the road. I want to start looking for a job, and get on with life."
Mr Mason, who used to have Â£75 worth of takeaways and chocolate delivered to his door daily, is due to have the first operation in New York later, thanks to the donation of time by Dr Jennifer Capla.
"The surgeon is going to move the main lump on my right leg, which since Christmas has been infected," said Mr Mason, who has previously undergone gastric bypass surgery.
"It feels like I've been carrying somebody around with me.
"That's stopped me from doing anything - I've been bed resting most of the time so it doesn't flare up again."
He said an area around his waist, known as "the apron", will be removed but further operations would be needed for the "bat wing" arms.
"It would be ideal if I could have it all done in one, but your body can't stand that," he said.
Mr Mason travelled to the United States last year and has been living with Massachusetts resident Miss Mountain, who proposed to Mr Mason during filming for TV programme The View.
He hopes to continue living in the US and said his new life with Miss Mountain had given him a new outlook on the eight hour surgery.
