The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps) said there were 51,140 surgical procedures last year - up from 45,406 the year before.
It overturns a recent decline, which was blamed on the recession and the scandal over faulty breast implants.
Nine out of 10 procedures were in women, although the rise was seen in both genders.
The top 10 procedures were:
Overall, the number of procedures increased by 13%.
Consultant plastic surgeon and Baaps council member Ash Mosahebi said many reasons were contributing to the increase.
He told the BBC: "I think partly because the economy is improving and people are spending more on luxury items.
"And social media is becoming more popular, people are sending pictures of themselves frequently and want to look good.
"And I would say the Botox generation who got older using Botox and fillers, those things are not working any more for those age groups so they're taking the next step up and that is surgical options."
However, he said people were more educated about cosmetic surgery after thousands of women were fitted with substandard breast implants made by the French firm Poly Implant Prothese.
"I have patients asking, 'What are you using?' and that's a good thing to have come out of that."
