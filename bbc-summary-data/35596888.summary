The teenager is the youngest player to captain a team in the Tippeligaen, which is presently in its close season.
He flew to Scotland from Alicante, where he had been at a pre-season training camp in La Manga.
And speaking after arriving at Glasgow Airport on Tuesday, Ajer said: "I'm really happy. I enjoyed it last time."
Celtic bolstered their first-team squad during the winter transfer window by signing Denmark defender Erik Sviatchenko and Turkey forward Colin Kazim-Richards and also brought in Manchester City's English winger Patrick Roberts.
