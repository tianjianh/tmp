The first-half ended scoreless with Warriors prop Ben Flower producing a try-saving tackle to deny Rhys Hanbury as the break approached.
Joshua Charnley broke the deadlock with his 16th try of the season before Matty Smith added a drop-goal.
Charnley produced a last-ditch tackle to deny Chris Dean from crossing as Wigan prevented Widnes from scoring.
In front of England head coach Wayne Bennett, defence was on top for the majority of the game in tricky, slippery conditions.
The Warriors handed a full debut to 20-year-old half-back Jake Shorrocks after George Williams on Thursday morning, and he looked composed as they won a fifth game in a row.
Denis Betts' side have now lost six of their last seven games in front of their own fans at Select Security Stadium.
Widnes head coach Denis Betts:
"If we had taken the chances we created we would have won.
"We defended tough but Matty Smith pulled them round the field. It's hard not to have admiration for Wigan who came here with a beaten up side.
"It's hard to take because we were just about to put the ball down over the line several times and didn't manage it."
Wigan head coach Shaun Wane told BBC Radio Manchester:
"We were brave, though, showed lots of desire and I've just said all those things to the players.
"We're finding ways to win, we've got a never say die attitude to the way we defend and we never think we're beaten.
"I thought with the adversity we've been through today with the injuries I thought is was one of the best efforts we've made all year.
"For us to nil them I thought was a great effort as they did throw a lot at us."
