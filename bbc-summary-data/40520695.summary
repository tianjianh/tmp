Police officers get extra leave to help 'wellbeing'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police officers are to have extra days off as part of a "wellbeing" plan by Lincolnshire Police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The additional two days' paid leave will be used by officers to engage in sport or community activities.
Other initiatives introduced by newly-appointed Chief Constable Bill Skelly, include a temporary tennis court at the force's headquarters.
Mr Skelly said it was "an investment" in the workforce to try and improve the physical and mental health of officers.

The chief constable said Lincolnshire officers were averaging six days a year in sick leave, costing the force about Â£1m per year.
Mr Skelly said the idea was to help staff deal with "the stress and anxiety of an increased workloads and reduced [police] numbers".
"This isn't about distracting or diverting from their core duties that the public pay for," he said.
"The whole thrust of the wellbeing agenda is that if people are happier, people are feeling well about themselves and they are healthier and more active, then the job that they are employed to do, to help reduce harm in our communities to protect our public they will be able to do that better."
