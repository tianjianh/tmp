The 26-year-old joined Boro for £1.5m in January 2014 after four years at Peterborough.
He scored 10 goals in 50 appearances last season as Boro lost to Norwich in the Championship play-off final.
"Lee is a player who we are excited about and will get fans off their seats," said Bournemouth chief executive Neill Blake.
Premier League newcomers Bournemouth signed former Leeds United winger Max Gradel from St Etienne on Tuesday.
Blake added: "We are very pleased with the business we have done this week, and on the whole this summer, and feel it is a marker of our ambitions this season."
