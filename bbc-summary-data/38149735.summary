What I See, which will be released in May 2017, will consist of 300 photographs taken by the 17-year-old alongside new images of him.
Penguin said the photos "offer his followers a rare glimpse at the world through his eyes".
The images will be accompanied by a written foreword and captions written by the model and social media star.
The son of David and Victoria Beckham has 8.8 million followers on his Instagram account, where he currently posts many of his own photographs.
He has also fronted a number of promotional campaigns for brands such as Burberry and Pull & Bear.
Francesca Dow, managing director of Penguin Random House Children's, said: "Brooklyn Beckham's images inspire a generation across the globe, and this book will give his fans a broader insight into the world seen through his unique and creative perspective."
