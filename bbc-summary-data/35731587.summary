Seaside communities to get £800,000 for improvement projects

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A number of seaside communities in the South West will get a share of £800,000 from the Coastal Communities Fund in a bid to help attract visitors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Communities Minister Mark Francois MP said the money would be spilt between eight seaside community projects.
He said it would help create jobs, training places and boost the local economy as well as attract visitors.
The South West Coast path in Devon, Cornwall, Somerset and Dorset will get £130,000 for repairs and improvements.
Clevedon Pier in Somerset, Britain's only Grade 1 listed pier, is another project getting financial support from the scheme.
Mr Francois said: "Over the past three years we've already funded more than 200 projects along the shorefront.
"Now this extra £800,000 will help put another eight coastal communities back on the map and kick-start their own exciting regeneration plans."
