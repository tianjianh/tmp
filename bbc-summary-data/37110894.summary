The results are in and you've got a place at university. But what if your wallet's empty and the Bank of Mum and Dad has run dry?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is still possible to get funding through a scholarship or an award, especially if you're studying in a particular discipline. Criteria can be based on all sorts of things, like academic merit, where you live, what your parents do, whether you're athletic or even how good you are on camera.
Here's some of the cash on offer that you might not have heard of - and for more information go to the Scholarship Hub.
