[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of a seven-year-old girl who died of brain injuries has told a murder trial she noticed "signs of bruising" on her daughter after she was put in care.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shanay Walker was found dead in her bed in Nottingham in July 2014.
She was living with her aunt, Kay-Ann Morris, 24, who denies murder.
Shanay's mother Leann Walker told Nottingham Crown Court she had struggled to cope after the birth of Shanay's sister.
She told how she developed depression and anxiety in the year after her second child's birth and eventually agreed to Shanay being put into care.
Ms Walker said she was unhappy when Ms Morris was granted guardianship in 2011.
She said Shanay's father nominated his sister Kay-Ann Morris, of Beckhampton Road, Nottingham, as guardian - which was eventually made official.
The court heard in subsequent visits Shanay showed signs of bruising and "seemed distant".
She told the jury she received a phone message on the morning of Shanay's death from Ms Morris saying: "I'm sorry. I wasn't strong enough."
A post-mortem report showed Shanay had more than 50 injuries on her body and had died of a brain injury.
The court has heard Ms Morris told police officers Shanay had accidently fallen down the stairs.
The prosecution said the aunt was "covering up the truth" that she had subjected her niece to a "sustained, vicious and brutal beating".
Shanay's grandmother Juanila Smikle, 53, of Easegill Court in Top Valley, also denies cruelty charges relating to Shanay and four other children.
Ms Morris is also charged with cruelty against two other children in 2011.
The trial continues.
