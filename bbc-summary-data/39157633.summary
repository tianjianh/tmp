Mary Kelly got the goal early in the second half to put the Ulster side 1-7 to 0-6 up and they held off a revival by the Galway side to clinch the win.
Now Slaughtneil will try to complete a remarkable double as their footballers play in their final on 17 March.
Eglish of Tyrone lost out to Myshall of Carlow in the Intermediate final.
"This means so much to the people of Slaughtneil," said the team's manager Dominic McKinley.
"It was great to get over the line.
"We have four or five of the best players in Ireland and people have to realise that.
"Hopefully the footballers can take something from it.
"The footballers are very close to the camogie team - and it is not a false closeness, they have a great deal of respect.
"If you saw the messages received last night and at training the footballers give them their place and time on the field.
"Everyone has their place in this club and that is what makes it so special."
