Arek Jozwik, 39, was attacked in Harlow, Essex, last month. Two Polish men were assaulted in the town a few days later at a vigil for Mr Jozwik.
Polish officers are there to "reassure the community", Essex Police said.
Essex's police commissioner said there had been an increase in people saying "rude things to people who aren't British" since the Brexit vote.
Police and Crime Commissioner Roger Hirst told the BBC: "I think there's certainly a swell of opinion... that wasn't there a few months ago. It seems to coincide with the Brexit vote."

The officers - 2nd Lieutenant Bartosz Czernicki and Chief Sergeant Dariusz Tybura - will be working in the town for seven days "on the community engagement side, to meet and greet the public and to reassure the community," he said.
Ch Insp Alan Ray, from Essex Police, said some people told him: 'We don't trust police officers... from our experience from Poland.
"Others are saying, 'we welcome these Polish police officers in'."
Mr Jozwik died from head injuries on 29 August, two days after he was believed to have been knocked to the floor by a single punch in The Stow, Harlow.
The presence of the Polish officers was "about reassurance in all communities", Ch Insp Ray said.
"There is a fear of Polish police and there is a fear of English police, and that comes from all different communities. Some people will trust us, some people won't."
Six teenagers have been arrested and released on police bail in connection with Mr Jozwik's murder.
