The Volvo hit two men, believed to be aged 18 and 20, and then struck a man and a woman before smashing into a telegraph pole at about 05:00 GMT.
Two men and the woman were taken to Southmead Hospital where the 18-year-old died. The man he was with is in a critical condition.
The driver is being held on suspicion of drink driving, police said.
The fourth person hit by the car - a man who was walking with the injured woman - was treated at the scene but not admitted to hospital.
Avon and Somerset Police said the two groups of two people were walking along Clevedon Road near the fire station.
"The woman in her late 20s was also taken to Southmead Hospital - she is not believed to have suffered life threatening injuries," the force added.
"The man she was with was allowed home after treatment at the scene."
The road has been shut as part of the police investigation and is likely to remain closed for most of the day.
Police have asked anyone who was in the area at the time to make contact.
