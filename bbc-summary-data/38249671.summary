[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt Smith, 22, was found by friends at the Val Thorens resort in the Alps on Sunday morning during the annual Oxford and Cambridge Varsity ski trip.
In a statement his father Howard said "he would have wanted the party to carry on without him".
A prosecutor told the Times medication could have contributed to his death.
Jean-Pascal Violet, the state prosecutor in Albertville, told the newspaper: "We suspect a heart failure linked to a combination of consuming alcohol and medicines, but we have no certainty about that."
He said: "We believe complications from his health and medications, and possibly altitude, led to his tragic early death."
The St John's College history undergraduate, a former pupil of Bedford Modern School, had served as social secretary of the Oxford University Ski and Snowboard Club
Mr Smith, writing on behalf of his wife and other son, said Matt always looked forward to the yearly Varsity trip.
He said: "He would have applauded the way his fellow snow-lovers took his snowboard for one last ride this week.
"Matt was adventurous and imaginative in life, and kind, generous and loyal to his friends.
"Matt made friends everywhere, and seemed to capture the hearts of whomever he met.
"He intensely wished everyone to strive to achieve all they could; he felt anything was possible and did not believe in regrets.
"It is amazing to hear about the sheer amount of joy he'd spread, even though we sometimes do not know whether to laugh or cry."
Tributes have also been paid to Mr Smith by friends, the Oxford University Ski and Snowboard Club, his university and auction house Sotheby's, where he had undertaken an internship.
