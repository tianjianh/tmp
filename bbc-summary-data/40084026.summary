England captain Eoin Morgan said his side had learned a lesson "with bat and ball" after their seven-wicket defeat by South Africa at Lord's.

The hosts collapsed to 20-6 in the first five overs after previously dominating the series with the bat.
England, who have never won a 50-over competition, are the favourites for the Champions Trophy, which begins on Thursday on home soil.
"We have put in a lot this series but this was a hiccup," Morgan said.
England, who were bowled out for 153 with 18.5 overs remaining, had previously scored 330 and 339 against number-one ranked side South Africa, but struggled to come back from losing early wickets in the final match.
"It's a lesson with the bat and ball - our bowlers to be disciplined and to our batsman that, sometimes, you have to sit in," Morgan said.
"They made us play a hell of a lot and managed to get the ball moving around. Certainly, it's not down to a lack of trying."
England coach Trevor Bayliss said his side had not read the conditions as well as they could after losing the toss and being asked to bat in overcast conditions.
"This result ensures we go into the Champions Trophy without big heads," Bayliss told BBC's Test Match Special.
"We should have done better than we did but a 2-1 series over South Africa, we'll take that every day."

Morgan said he had no concerns over the form of opening batsman Jason Roy, who has struggled this summer.
Prior to the series against Ireland, Roy averaged 53 in one-day internationals, but since the start of May he has reached double figures just once in five innings.
"Jason has scored a lot of runs and been a part of our team for a long time now. A player like him, the score is always around the corner," he said.
Morgan added that all-rounder Ben Stokes, who was rested for Monday's ODI, would play in the Champions Trophy even if he could not bowl.
"He's a guy we really need in our team if we're going to win the Champions Trophy or be real contenders," Morgan told TMS.
"He is a huge part of our team. I'm anticipating he will be be 100% fit for Thursday against Bangladesh."
