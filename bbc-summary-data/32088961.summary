[SN]TITLE[SN]
Baby Amelia Jones suffered brain damage, murder trial hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A five-week-old baby girl allegedly murdered by her grandfather had suffered "significant brain damage", a jury has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amelia Jones was critically injured leaving her paralysed following an attack possibly motivated by Mark Jones's strong dislike for her father, Newport Crown Court was told.
Mr Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, denies killing Amelia in Pontnewydd.
He was looking after her when she was injured  in November 2012.
The jury was told the little girl was rushed to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital in a state of cardiac arrest on Sunday 17 November, 2012.
Mr Jones had called 999 because, he said, Amelia had stopped breathing when he went to make a cup of tea.
At his trial on Friday, in a statement read to the court, a consultant paediatrician who treated Amelia said she had been suffering seizures, her eyes were flickering and she was "unresponsive".
The court heard Amelia had been in cardiac arrest for 35 minutes, and was put on life support when she arrived at hospital.
She was later transferred to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, but two days later Amelia's mother, Sarah Jones, and father, Ian Skillern, were told their daughter had "significant brain damage, and would not recover".
Doctors withdrew life-support and Amelia died that evening.
She had a fractured skull, brain swelling and multiple rib fractures. She had been injured at least three different times, the court heard.
Previously, the jury heard the defendant had been mostly absent from his daughter, Ms Jones', life until she was 16 and he strongly disliked Mr Skillern.
