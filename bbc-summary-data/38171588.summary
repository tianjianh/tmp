[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arkadiusz Jozwik, 39, was assaulted on 27 August in The Stow, Harlow, and later died in hospital.
The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, will appear at Chelmsford Youth Court in January.
Mr Jozwik, who was also known as Arek, was with a friend outside a takeaway when they were attacked. His friend, 43, suffered hand and stomach injuries.
Mr Jozwik was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge following the attack and died from head injuries.
His family described him as a hard-working man who loved spending time with them.
Police said they had been authorised by prosecutors to charge a 15-year-old boy from Harlow with manslaughter in connection with Mr Jozwik's death.
He has been released on police bail until his first court appearance.
In a statement, the Crown Prosecution Service said police had decided to take no further action in relation to five other youths who were at the scene.
