Gethin Jenkins: Wales prop to miss summer tour after surgery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' record cap holder Gethin Jenkins will miss their summer tour against Tonga and Samoa with a knee injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jenkins has had surgery and, despite being tipped to be Wales captain this summer, he will now miss out on Tuesday when Robin McBryde names his squad.
The 129-time capped prop will also miss Cardiff Blues' European Champions Cup play-off with Stade Francais.
The 36-year-old has suffered an injury-hit season after a pectoral injury ruled him out of all the Six Nations.
