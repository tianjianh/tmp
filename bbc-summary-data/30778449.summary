Teignmouth minor injuries unit (MIU) could be closed under plans by the NHS.

Patients would have to travel to Dawlish instead, South Devon Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said.
The CCG said the move would improve the quality of services at Dawlish, with longer opening hours and X-ray facilities.
Richard Younger-Ross, former Liberal Democrat MP for Teignbridge, said the plan put the future of Teignmouth Hospital at risk but the CCG rejected the claim.
Mr Younger-Ross said: "The proposals will enhance the MIU at Dawlish but we believe that Teignmouth needs its own MIU and that its removal may undermine the long-term future of Teignmouth Hospital."
Dr Matthew Fox of the CCG said Teignmouth would be take on more long-term care and rehabilitation of patients.
"If we don't combine our two units we will lose them both," he said.
According to the plans, the new unit would be open from 08:00 to 20:00, instead of the current 10:00 to 18:00.
The plans state: "Nurses need to treat enough people each year to maintain their skills.
"To be safe, sustainable and cost effective, every minor injury unit in South Devon and Torbay will in future need to see at least 7,000 people a year."
In 2013/14 Dawlish saw 4,232 people and Teignmouth 3,285.
Teignmouth MIU patient Helen Saw said: "If you go in there with a broken wrist or arm you go straight to Torbay Hospital.
"Unless you are going there for a bit of tea and sympathy, there's very little point in going there."
