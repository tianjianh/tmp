Minichiello put Hull ahead in a tight first half, before Joe Arundel replied for the struggling visitors.
Hull opened up a 16-4 lead at the break as Minichiello grabbed a second try and Curtis Naughton went over soon after.
Carlos Tuimavave's second-half try was added to by Marc Sneyd for his third conversion from four attempts.
New Wakefield coach Chester initially watched from the stands, but did head down to the touchline as the Wildcats crashed to their sixth defeat of the season.
For Hull, it was a good response following last week's 46-6 defeat at Widnes, a result which prompted the players to ask the coaches to leave the dressing room so they could hold their own debrief.
Minichiello opened the scoring for Hull when he crashed over next to the posts, with Sneyd converting.
Arundel went over near to the left touchline as Wakefield hit back within eight minutes, although Liam Finn put his conversion attempt wide.
But Minichiello scored his second try from close-in and Frank Pritchard freed Naughton to go over for the final score of the half.
Danny Washbrook's fine feed saw Tuimavave go over and Sneyd converted from in front as Hull went 22-4 ahead for a lead they never relinquished.

Hull FC coach Lee Radford: "I was really pleased with the defence. We had lots of opportunities to defend our line and did it well.
"It's been an issue in recent weeks so I'm over the moon to fix that. To come through that with just four points against is really pleasing to me. We have been so professional since last week."
Wakefield coach Chris Chester: "There were bags of effort and the attitude was first class. We lacked a bit with the ball, we didn't really ask any questions and will work on that this week.
"It will take time, but we just need a little more structure there. We're a workmanlike team at the moment."
