Carolyn Keeling, now 64, was accused of having sex with the boy who is now 34 and cannot be named for legal reasons.
Mrs Keeling, of Taynton near Gloucester, had denied six counts of indecent assault.
The mother-of-two, who had an unblemished career, was accused of having sex with the boy on at least 100 occasions between 1993 and 1996.
A jury took three hours to find Mrs Keeling not guilty at Gloucester Crown Court.
Speaking after she was cleared, she said she was very grateful to the National Union of Teachers for backing her financially and her ex-colleagues, friends and family.
"These two years, two months and however many days have been very stressful and now I have a life that I can lead," she said.
"It is with you every minute of every day and it just never goes away."
Mrs Keeling added it is important young people feel they will be listened to if they reported alleged abuse to the authorities.
"But there must be a way of doing more research as if the police had done this they would have known that I hadn't done it."
The boy, who is now a father of three and battling a heroin addiction, made the allegations to his mother in 2012 after reading of the Jimmy Savile scandal.
He later reported it to police in April 2013 and an investigation started.
Mrs Keeling told detectives of her shock at what the boy was saying.
"He was just a nice lad. (I am) gobsmacked that he would do this. This is my worst nightmare," she said.
Mrs Keeling rejected claims that she had smoked cannabis and drank wine while teaching him, and insisted she had not slept with him.
She said she took the boy out on trips to Gloucester city centre, to the countryside and horse riding, and accepted she had not stopped him smoking cannabis at his home.
In a statement Gloucestershire Police said the evidence was put before the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) "who deemed it appropriate to bring charges and prosecute Carolyn Keeling".
"The trial was thorough and fair and Gloucestershire Constabulary respect the decision of the jury. We would always encourage anyone who has been the victim of historic sexual abuse to come forward," a spokesman said.
