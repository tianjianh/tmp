Middlesbrough have confirmed former Leeds United boss Garry Monk as their new manager.

Boro interviewed several candidates, but Monk emerged as the club's first choice and will be unveiled on Monday.
Monk, 38, left Leeds on 25 May after being unable to "reach an agreement" with new owner Andrea Radrizzani.
He managed Swansea City in the Premier League between 2014 and 2015 before guiding Leeds to a seventh-placed finish in the Championship last season.
Middlesbrough finished 19th and were relegated from the Premier League after winning just five of their 38 games under previous bosses Aitor Karanka and Steve Agnew.
Agnew took over from Karanka on 16 March on a temporary basis and could not prevent Boro going down, but is expected to stay on at the club in some capacity.
Former Southampton and Everton striker James Beattie, who worked with Monk at Leeds, is expected to be part of his coaching staff again at Middlesbrough.
Monk, who was appointed on a one-year rolling contract at Leeds in June 2016, had been expected to sign a new deal with the Yorkshire club after Radrizzani gained full control from Massimo Cellino.
However, Monk left saying he was unable to "agree a suitable way for us all to move forward together".
