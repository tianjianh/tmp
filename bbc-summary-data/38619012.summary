Midfielder Pajtim Kasami and defender Danny Fox are back in training after injury but may not be ready in time.
New Bristol City keeper Fabian Giefer could start if international clearance for his loan deal from German side Schalke is received in time.
The visitors have no new injury worries but midfielder Korey Smith is out for up to six weeks with a hamstring issue.
The Robins, who have lost their past seven consecutive league games, go into the match level on points with Forest.
Nottingham Forest interim manager Gary Brazil:
"The chairman asked me to step in on a caretaker basis. I will carry on with the role until told otherwise.
"We have brought a greater intensity to the training ground which the players have enjoyed. All the focus is about the game.
"The players have responded very well to the work we have done with them. We are looking forward to going out and getting ourselves a win."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol:
"We want to get a win. We definitely don't want to lose it. We can go there in full belief that we can get a win.
"We failed miserably in the last 15 minutes against Cardiff but, apart from that, we've had three very assured performances.
"We need to make sure we lock out that last 15 minutes a bit better, but that will come."
