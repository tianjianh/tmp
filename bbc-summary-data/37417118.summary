[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former policewoman from County Tyrone has denied causing the death of a man by dangerous driving and drink driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eilish MacSherry, 41, was a serving off-duty PSNI officer at the time of the fatal collision on Omagh's Clanabogan Road on 10 October 2015.
She pleaded not guilty to causing death by driving dangerously, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and driving while unfit through drink or drugs.
Paul Mills, a 49-year-old father of two from Killyclogher, was killed.
At Dungannon Crown Court, Ms MacSherry's defence barrister told the court he had no instructions to challenge the primary facts of the case.
He said that his principal issue of concern was his client's "state of mind" on the night of the fatal collision.
The case was adjourned for four weeks and will resume on 18 October.
