Worcestershire have appointed local businessman Tom Scott as their interim chief executive.

He will take over when current CEO David Leatherdale leaves New Road in March for a similar position with the Professional Cricketers' Association.
Scott is a member of the Division Two side's informal strategic group, having previously been a police detective.
"Replacing David is a hard act for anyone to try and follow," he told the club website.
"I am clear on what needs to be done and hope to continue to help this great club run smoothly during the next six months, continuing the excellent work David and the team have been doing in recent years.
Worcestershire were relegated from Division One of the County Championship last season, winning just three matches, after a solitary season in the top flight.
Chairman Stephen Taylor said of Scott's appointment: "I said when David announced that he was leaving that enormous shoes would have to be filled.
"But it is reassuring to know that we have someone filling those shoes for the interim period in Tom Scott who cares passionately for the club and has done so since he was a young boy."
