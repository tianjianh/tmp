The author whose Sea of Poppies was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2008, is being hosted as a writer-in-residence at Rashtrapati Bhawan.
He has been posting regular tweets and pictures, including the dining table Nelson Mandela ate at and guest rooms foreign dignitaries have stayed in.
His latest book is on climate change.
The Twitter tour was not limited to just the interiors of the official residence.
Ghosh pointed out aspects of the famed gardens, and also drew attention to a sewage treatment plant on the premises.
The Mughal gardens are hugely popular in India, and are opened to the public once a year.
Ghosh also took the time to meet members of the president's security detail including Vikrant, the horse that leads all the ceremonial parades the president participates in.
Many social media users have thanked the author for giving them an "unseen glimpse" into the President's house, while others have been offering their own insights- and even criticisms- of the residence..
One user suggested that some of the rooms could "use more light", while others said that "heavy dusty carpeting" could "smother the will to live".
