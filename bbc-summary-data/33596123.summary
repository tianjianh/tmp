Lancashire's Prince & Petersen share 501-run stand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alviro Petersen and Ashwell Prince became only the 13th pair to share a stand of more than 500 runs in first-class cricket as Lancashire continued to dominate against Glamorgan.

They put on 501 for the third wicket as the visitors declared on 698-5, with Glamorgan 165-6 at the end of day two.
Both Petersen (286) and Prince (261) made career-best scores.
They also passed Lancashire's previous highest stand for any wicket of 371, a record that had stood for 87 years.
The South African duo had scored 319 runs together on the first day at Colwyn Bay and passed two notable landmarks on the second morning.
First, they beat the county's previous highest third-wicket stand of 364 between Michael Atherton and Neil Fairbrother against Surrey in 1990.
Seven runs later, Petersen and Prince had the highest partnership for any wicket in Lancashire's history - beating the 371 by Frank Watson and Ernest Tyldesley, also against Surrey, in 1928.
But their mammoth effort came to an end just 22 runs short of the County Championship record for the third wicket, set by Hampshire pair Michael Carberry and Neil McKenzie in 2011, when Prince was caught at long-off shortly after passing his previous career-best of 257 not out.
Petersen was denied a maiden triple-century, also falling to David Lloyd (3-164) in the same manner.
Steven Croft (57 not out) and James Faulkner took Division Two leaders Lancashire towards 700 before the latter's dismissal for 21 brought about their declaration.
Glamorgan's reply started badly as veteran seamer Glen Chapple reduced the hosts to 60-3 with three early wickets, including captain Jacques Rudolph bowled for 32.
Faulkner, Arron Lilley and Simon Kerrigan claimed further scalps to leave the Welsh county 533 runs behind at the close.
Glamorgan's Mark Wallace told BBC Radio Wales Sport:
"A difficult couple of days at the office, but hats off to them because sometimes you come across performances like that.
"Alviro Petersen and Ashwell Prince were absolutely world-class today and it's a reminder of how good these international players are at times.
"That batting was as good as you're ever likely to see. You want to take wickets but at times you've just got to admire these players."
