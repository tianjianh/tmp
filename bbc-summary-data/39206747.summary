Ex-Cumbria PC Nicholas Pool admits child more sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former police officer has been warned he faces jail after pleading guilty to more child sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicholas Pool admitted 11 charges, including possessing indecent images and attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity.
He was dismissed by Cumbria Police at a misconduct hearing in February after he admitted three other incitement crimes.
The 29-year-old will be sentenced at Carlisle Crown Court for both sets of offences on 28 April.
Pool, of Newton Rigg, near Penrith previously admitted three charges of attempting to incite a 12-year-old girl - really an undercover officer posing as a young girl - to engage in sexual activity.
The more recent charges include six counts of attempting to cause or incite a child to engage in sexual activity, and possessing indecent photographs of youngsters - some classed as category A, which is the most serious.
The offences occurred when he was off-duty as a PC based in south Cumbria between 2013 and 2016,
Remanding him in custody, Judge Peter Davies said: "You must look forward to a custodial sentence."
