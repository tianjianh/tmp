A convicted child sex offender who has been on a police wanted list has been arrested in Cambodia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Prestidge, 35, from Plymouth, Devon, was arrested by Cambodian police on Saturday.
The former scout leader was jailed in 2007 for photographing naked boys and possessing indecent pictures of children.
He is now being questioned by Cambodian immigration officials and faces deportation back to the UK.
Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed they were working with the National Crime Agency (NCA) on getting Prestidge returned to the UK.
The NCA said the arrest of Prestidge on immigration offences was a "matter for the Cambodian authorities".
Prestidge is wanted by police for breaking the conditions of a sex offenders order after he failed to return from a trip to visit relatives in Spain in 2010.
During Prestidge's trial, Exeter Crown Court heard he encouraged boys aged nine and 10 to strip off and invented a game called Sahara in which they pretended they were so hot they had to take off all their clothes.
He also photographed boys during camping trips.
Judge Jeremy Griggs told him at the trial that he had "betrayed the scouting movement".
