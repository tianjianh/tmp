Villy is a Nigerian Afro-fusion singer and songwriter, who splits his time between Lagos and Accra. He sings in Igbo, Yoruba, Pidgin and English.
His anger at what he sees as complacency inspired Make Me Mad, the song he performs with his group, the Xtreme Volumes, for BBC Africa Beats.
Inspired by a variety of artists, his sound reflects rock, soul, hip hop, jazz and African influences. Villy is bucking the digital trend and putting his energies into delivering strong live performances based on good old fashioned musicianship.
