A first-half David McAllister own goal was all that separated the sides in a tight affair at Mourneview Park.
Coleraine hammered Glentoran 4-1 at the Showgrounds with James McLaughlin scoring twice.
David Jeffrey's Ballymena United ran out easy 4-1 winners away to Carrick Rangers to move into the top half of the table.
Relive the action from Friday's Premiership matches
Despite suffering their first defeat of the season, Ards are still tied on points at the top of the table.
There were few clear chances in the game, with defences on top before McAllister nodded past keeper Aaron Hogg and into his own net after 17 minutes of play.
Crusaders and Linfield can overtake the joint leaders if they win their respective games on Saturday.
The Bannsiders put four goals past Glentoran, who continued their disappointing start to the league campaign.
Coleraine took the lead after eight minutes when referee Mervyn Smith pointed to the penalty spot when Elliott Morris was adjudged to have brought down James McLaughlin despite getting a strong palm on the ball.
Neil McCafferty made no mistake from the spot by slotting past Morris, although the Glentoran keeper may feel aggrieved that he wasn't ready to face the kick.
Three goals in nine minutes assured Coleraine of the points. Darren McCauley tucked home after being played through by Rodney Brown, before McLaughlin drove the ball home from the edge of the penalty area three minutes later.
McLaughlin grabbed his second just after the hour mark to wrap up the victory, before Jonathan Smith fired home after some good work from Nacho Novo to give Glentoran a consolation goal.
Defeat for Glentoran means that the East Belfast side slip into the bottom half of the table, while Coleraine's first victory of the season carries Oran Kearney's side up to eighth.
Ballymena responded from last weekend's defeat by Ards in perfect style, putting four goals past Carrick Rangers.
Allan Jenkins opened the scoring, slamming home from a corner after just three minutes.
Cathair Friel doubled Ballymena's advantage on 22 minutes by heading in from a Tony Kane free-kick.
Carrick Rangers were provided with a glimmer of hope when Alan Blayney picked up a back-pass and Gareth McKeown's free-kick rebounded off the United wall for Nathan Hanley to make no mistake from the rebound.
Jonny McMurray scored Ballymena's goal of the evening, letting fire with a fine 30-yard strike which flew over Simon Steele in the Carrick goal.  Ballymena completed the rout when former Carrick player Conor McCloskey slotted home just after the hour mark.
