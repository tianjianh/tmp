Ronnie Pickering was filmed asking the rider "do you know who I am?" and challenging him to a "bare-knuckle fight" after being overtaken in Hull.
His expletive-laden rant has been seen more than a million times on YouTube.
Humberside Police said it would "not be taking the matter further" because no complaints had been made.
In the footage, Mr Pickering asks the motorcyclist: "Do you know who I am? You soon will do."
The motorcyclist replies: "Do I care? Who are you then?"
"Ronnie Pickering", responds Mr Pickering.
The pair's exchange captured the imagination of social media users, prompting dozens of parodies and tweets.
Former BBC Two Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne tweeted: "Who is Ronnie Pickering?"
And, referring to the "supermoon" seen around the world earlier this week, Comedian Jack Whitehall tweeted: "Ronnie Pickering was so angry last night he turned the moon red."
In a statement, Humberside Police said it had looked at the footage and had spoken to Mr Pickering about his driving.
Insp Philip Hinch said: "Having reviewed the footage of the incident, a man has now been spoken to about his actions and manner of his driving and the matter is now closed.
"To date we have not received a complaint about this incident and unless one is forthcoming we will not be taking the matter further.
"I would like to take this opportunity to remind all drivers to drive in a courteous and considerate manner at all times."
The BBC approached Mr Pickering for a comment.
According to reports, the 54-year-old grandfather has since apologised.
Mr Pickering told the Hull Daily Mail, the rider was "baiting me so I thought I would give him a few of my thoughts".
