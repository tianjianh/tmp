A new 3D app which allows users to explore what Dundee Waterfront will look like in 2018 has been launched.

The free app has been developed by Edinburgh-based Luma 3D Interactive and is aimed at giving users a bird's eye view of the area.
Dundee Waterfront is a £1bn regeneration project transforming 240 acres of land along the River Tay.
The project is now well past the halfway mark.
The waterfront skyline will change with the construction of a new railway station, V&A Museum of Design Dundee, a new marina, port developments, offices, hotels, bars, shops, cafes and residential accommodation
Mike Galloway, director of city development at Dundee City Council said: "The 3D app is an astonishing piece of technology that unveils how Dundee Waterfront will look in the future.
"We are expecting a surge in tourism and visitor numbers as the waterfront develops, so the app will allow prospective visitors or investors a chance to virtually visit and experience Dundee Waterfront now."
Kevin Archibald, from Luma 3D Interactive, added: "It's great to work on a project of this profile that allows us to demonstrate how Scotland is leading the way in this design technology.
Director of V&A Dundee, Philip Long, said he wanted to using the latest technologies to "showcase and celebrate" Scottish innovation and design.
"This app helps bring V&A Dundee and its superb location on the waterfront at the very heart of the city to life‎ in a fun and inspiring way," he added.
