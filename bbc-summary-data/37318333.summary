[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tim Sheens: Hull KR to sign Salford Red Devils director of rugby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salford Red Devils director of rugby Tim Sheens will leave to become head coach at Hull KR next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Australian World Cup-winning coach replaces interim boss James Webster.
Sheens, 65, is one year into a three year contract at Salford but owner Marwan Koukash said: "I always said I would release Tim if he got the opportunity to become a head coach."
Hull KR and Salford are playing in the Qualifiers trying to secure a place in the Super League for next season.
Sheens will stay working with Salford head coach Ian Watson but would stand down if the two teams had to meet in the play-off to avoid relegation to the Championship.
Former Rovers captain Webster, 37, was put in charge for the 2016 season after Chris Chester was sacked in February - three games into the new campaign.
