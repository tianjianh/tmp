Alpaca dies following New Forest dog attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An alpaca which was seriously injured in a dog attack has been put down, its owner has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oberon was one of three animals mauled by a dog in their field in the eastern part of the New Forest on 22 December.
Owner Susan Sears said she was "devastated" Oberon's wounds had not healed, and, despite further surgery, he was found to be "beyond recovery".
The two other injured animals have received further treatment for their wounds.
Mrs Sears said: "After nearly two weeks of round the clock monitoring and nursing, poor Oberon's wounds were not healing as well as hoped and, despite further surgery, were found to be beyond recovery.
"As alpha male, it is likely that Oberon would have put himself between his herd mates and the attacking dog,"
Another alpaca had also been the victim of a dog attack in the same field earlier last year.
Oberon was part of a herd of about 80 animals which Mrs Sears and her husband have bred for their wool for the past six years.
A crowdfunding appeal to help pay for the animals' treatment raised more than Â£1,900.
