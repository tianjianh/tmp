Darcie Butler had been playing at her home in Malvern Road, Oldbury, when she became trapped at about 06:30 BST.
"I was in bed when I heard my partner shouting 'come downstairs, Darcie's got her foot stuck'," said her father Steve, a car salesman.
"It was a nightmare. I tried to pull it apart but in the end we had to call the fire station."
Firefighters had to saw the Minion toy in half to free Darcie, but Mr Butler said it had not fazed her.
"She did like the toy but she's not too bothered," he said. "She's playing with both halves and keeps saying 'it's broken.'"
