Dancing in dystopia: How Nineteen Eighty-Four became a ballet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ballet know the huge name-recognition for George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four will help draw audiences to their new stage version.  But choreographer Jonathan Watkins has had to take a story focused on the nature of politics and the use of language and make it all work with music and dance.  He explains how the production came together.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The novel Nineteen Eighty-Four appeared in bookshops in the summer of 1949.  Set in an imaginary future where people are controlled by surveillance and propaganda, it follows the story of a minor government employee, Winston Smith, who is arrested and subjected to monstrous brainwashing techniques for harbouring thoughts of rebellion.
Few modern works proved so irresistible so quickly.
In the US, a radio version appeared within months and the first screen adaptation was on American TV as early as 1953.  The following year, the BBC shot another version.  Now Bourne Ultimatum director Paul Greengrass is attached to a new cinematic manifestation of Orwell's unsettling world, where personal liberty has disappeared and thought can be a crime.
A decade ago came an opera at Covent Garden and the latest stage adaptation has just finished its run in the West End.
Yet Northern Ballet, based in Leeds, is the first company to grasp the challenge of a full-length Nineteen Eighty-Four in dance.  The choreographer is Jonathan Watkins.
"Of course the way people use language is a part of what Orwell engaged with.  But there are a lot of concepts in the book and I have to accept that I can't get it all into two hours of ballet.  That would be true of any stage adaptation.  We concentrate on the relationships between individuals and between different groups.
"At the same time I don't automatically assume our audiences will know the action in advance.  Almost everyone knows the title but some people only have a vague idea of what actually happens in the book."
Watkins worked with dramaturg Ruth Little to pick out the narrative line the ballet should follow.
"We're pretty true to the narrative arc and the Winston Smith character remains at centre.  I was keen the narrative action should be very clear.  I've been delighted when people sat in on rehearsals who didn't know the story at all but could easily follow what was going on.  That's part of my job."
The BBC watched final rehearsals at Northern Ballet's rehearsal studios, before the cast headed over the road to the West Yorkshire Playhouse where public performances start this weekend.
Tobias Batley (as Winston Smith) and Cuban dancer Javier Torres were performing an intense scene dramatizing Smith's ambivalent relationship with O'Brien, the senior party member who tortures him but who, perhaps, he also needs.  For now the cast is still dancing to the music in recorded form: At the Playhouse a genuine orchestra awaits.
Alex Baranowski's score is cinematic and each step is crammed with tension.  Music and choreography combine to create a sense of dread.
It's a relief to talk to Toby Batley later when he's amiable and surprisingly relaxed.
"There is pressure on a dancer when you're originating a big new role that no one's ever danced before.  But I quite like the fact that our first performance is also the press night, with all the critics and the VIPs."
"At first I thought that my character Winston was a bit opaque.  But I came to see that what he does is really brave: He stands up against the power of the party, which is personified by O'Brien.  And he has an emotional relationship with Julia -  which people sometimes forget.
"Love is a massive theme in Nineteen Eighty-Four although it's not in any conventional sense a love story.  It's up to me and Martha (Leebolt), who dances Julia, to communicate the power of the relationship.   Big Brother commands love for the party.  And there's almost a kind of love between Winston and O'Brien - there's something weird between the two men that's maybe a form of Stockholm syndrome."
Batley says it was a great moment when the cast first heard Baranowski's score on CD.
"It's not like dancing a Nutcracker, where the dancers all know the score already.  I was puzzled beforehand what genre Alex would write in.  So it was a huge relief because immediately you can picture yourself dancing to what you hear.
"Moments of the score are quite lyrical and the pas de deux at the end of Act 1 is very passionate.  But there are also the scenes in the cell with O'Brien which are dark and disturbing.
At 31, Alex Baranowski's credit is increasingly cropping up as a composer for the stage and elsewhere.  Credits range from the Young Vic theatre in London (A Streetcar Named Desire) to indie band The xx, collaborating on orchestral versions of their music.
"The idea for the ballet was Jonathan's," he says. "I knew I enjoyed working with him - we did Kes last year in Sheffield.  But I'd never read Orwell's book and when I did so, I could hear a musical journey in it straight away."
He says the basic storyline emerged chiefly in discussions between Jonathan Watkins and Ruth Little.  "And it's the same with the music: It's a long discussion between me as composer and Jonathan as choreographer-director."
"Sometimes Jonathan would hear some little thing I'd written which he wanted me to expand or try a bit differently.  There could be a moment for a clarinet which he'd see possibilities in - or he'd get excited about something I'd barely noticed.  It's a great way to write.
"When I started I thought I'd listen to the big Russian composers but I soon realised it's not about emulating anyone.  It's only worthwhile if you're creating something new."
Baranowski says his score had to represent the element of love story between Winston and Julia.  "But that doesn't mean you have to write a huge love theme: Their relationship is tentative.
"There is a lyricism there but the moment's a bit staccato too.  That makes it quite hard to write - but also liberating."
Northern Ballet's production of 1984 opens in the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, on Saturday 5 May, then tours the UK until next year.
