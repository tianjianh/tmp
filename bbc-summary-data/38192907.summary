[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dundee 0-0 Ross County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee and Ross County drew a blank in their Scottish Premiership meeting at Dens Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam Boyce headed into the net early in the second half but had fouled the hosts' Darren O'Dea.
Christopher Routis dragged a shot wide for the visitors and team-mate Alex Schalk's header was saved by Scott Bain.
Marcus Haber might have won it for Dundee but missed the target after showing good control.
Ross County, unbeaten in their last four matches, looked the more assured side, passing more fluently and creating the better opportunities.
That said, none of those early efforts seriously tested Bain - Andrew Davies, Michael Gardyne and Routis all trying their luck to no avail.
Their greater attacking threat appeared to have paid off at the outset of the second half but Boyce's aerial challenge on O'Dea was penalised as he guided the ball past Bain.
As the chances for County came and went, Dundee, with Australian Jesse Curran playing in the Premiership for the first time, began to creep into the game.
Their great problem this season has been a failure to score enough goals.
Their tally of 14 is the lowest in the league and again they looked pretty toothless, with only a Craig Wighton shot into the arms of Scott Fox to show for their first-half efforts.
Wighton was one of the home side's few bright spots and he lobbed just off target as Paul Hartley's side looked to impose themselves on the match.
Tom Hateley, renowned for his dead-ball ability when at Motherwell, curled a free-kick straight at Fox and O'Dea headed wide from a good position as Dundee enjoyed their best spell.
The best chances of the match were still to come though and County twice had the opportunity to claim the victory their endeavours probably merited.
Routis, an impressive presence in the County midfield, passed up the first of those as he dragged a shot wide of goal after being slipped in by Boyce.
And Bain pulled off a terrific save to push away Schalk's diving header after the striker was picked out by Jonathan Franks' cross.
In between times, Haber could have won it for Dundee, but after collecting Kevin Gomis' clearance, he blazed off target.

Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "A clean sheet, another point - I think every point's going to be vital. We could've won it with Haber's chance but at the other end Scott makes a great save.
"Scoring goals wins you games, but keeping clean sheets you don't lose games so there's a balance there.
"We haven't scored enough goals but it's something we're looking hard towards and I think in January we need to look and see can we strengthen the group?"
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "We had a lot more play than Dundee in the final third. Where we were lacking today was just with our finishing touch.
"We switched the play really well, got into some great positions. Their big chance came with Haber from a ball over the top - other than that I don't think they cut us open.
"The last four games we've got back to the team I know we are but we know that to get away from the teams beside us, we need to put wins together. That's the only thing that's going to take you into that top six."
