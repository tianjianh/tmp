A rail traveller has spoken of his "humiliation" after being twice detained by armed police at Reading station over concerns about wires seen in his pocket.

Jaz Oberoi, from Hanwell in west London, said he was "accommodating" with police when they found the wires to be a headphone lead, but found being questioned a second time "unnecessary".
His train was held for 30 minutes on Friday evening while he was questioned.
Police said the matter was "concluded".
Mr Oberoi said: "They explained to me someone had put in a complaint there's an Asian man with a backpack with a wire hanging out of his bag.
"They saw pretty quickly it was a headphone cable - I understood they were just doing their job."
He said he was allowed back on the Paddington-bound train, only to be removed again for further questioning.
"To be marched off twice was a bit much - I wasn't rude, I was very accommodating. I felt it was completely unnecessary to humiliate me twice," Mr Oberoi said.
Thames Valley Police said its officers had supported British Transport Police after "concerns were raised about a group of passengers".
"The incident has now been concluded as far as Thames Valley Police involvement and no arrests have been made," a spokesman said.
