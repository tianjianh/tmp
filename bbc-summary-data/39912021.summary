[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swansea City v West Bromwich Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City have no new injury concerns ahead of Sunday's game and Paul Clement could name the same side that beat Sunderland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Borja Baston faces a fitness test but Wayne Routledge is back in contention after hernia trouble.
West Brom are likely to once more be without winger Matt Phillips, who is still nursing a hamstring injury.
Salomon Rondon and Gareth McAuley should both recover from respective hamstring and thigh issues.
Mark Scott: "When Paul Clement took over at the start of January surely not even the most optimistic Swansea fan would have predicted safety with a game to spare.
"But Clement has produced an upturn that would have the Swans eighth in a league table based on results since his appointment and he's been nominated for the Premier League's Manager of the Season award as well.
"Tony Pulis was also on that shortlist, but things have tailed off dramatically for West Brom in the last few months, with Pulis seeing one of his teams suffer a post 40-point slump once again.
"But the Baggies do still have the incentive of an impressive eighth-place finish to play for."

Swansea City head coach Paul Clement: "We're delighted to have got safe with a game to spare, but we still want to finish strongly.
"The season is not over yet and we want a good performance at home - there's lots of motivation going into the last game. If we win on Sunday, we could end up with 29 points from the second half of the season. so let's finish in style.
"I don't think a major overhaul is required. Of course we want to strengthen, but I don't see it being a lot of players."
West Bromwich Albion head coach Tony Pulis: "The results have been disappointing but apart from maybe one or two, I think the players have given everything and have been a little bit unfortunate not to get anything.
"We could still finish eighth with that win, which would be an absolutely fantastic achievement for this club, the players, and everybody associated with the football side."
This could have been a very tense affair but the pressure is off Swansea after they secured their survival last weekend, and instead it will be party time for them.
