The Aspar Ducati rider had qualified in 11th position and moved up to eighth place in the race, before dropping down the field in the latter stages.
The Toomebridge man had scored points in all nine previous rounds of this year's series and lies 11th overall.
Italian Andrea Iannone took his maiden victory despite nursing a rib injury.
Iannone's triumph at the Red Bull Ring was the first for Ducati since Casey Stoner won at Phillip Island in 2010.
Iannone hit the front with seven laps remaining and had a 0.938 seconds advantage over Andrea Dovizioso at the chequered flag, with Jorge Lorenzo third, Valentino Rossi fourth and Marc Marquez fifth.
Marquez leads the championship standings on 181 points, followed by Lorenzo on 138, Rossi on 124 and Pedrosa with 105.
Laverty has 53 points, the same as 10th-placed Scott Redding, with the next round to come at Brno in the Czech Republic next weekend.
The Irishman's best result of the season came in Argentina in early April, when he finished fourth.
Petrucci has been handed a three place grid penalty, plus one penalty point, for the Czech round as a result of the incident with Laverty at the end of the race.
