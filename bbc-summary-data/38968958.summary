Here are five facts you need to know about Prue:
1. She grew up in South Africa and helped to start a cooking college there, now called 'Prue Leith's Chefs Academy'.
2. She went to the famous Le Cordon Bleu cookery school in London.
3. But she's not just a cook, she opened her first restaurant in 1969 and she already knows what it's like to be on TV... She spent 11 years as a judge on BBC Two programme The Great British Menu. She's also a writer and has written seven novels so far.
4. She loves her mad dog Meg, a rescue mongrel, and her beautiful cat Magnificat (known as Mags).
5. And she's received a couple of royal awards, an OBE in 1989 and a CBE in 2010.
