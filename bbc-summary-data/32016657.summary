UKIP has denied being responsible for a leaflet accusing other parties of backing state benefits for extremists.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The leaflet, referring to the London-raised Islamic State fighter "Jihadi John", was reported to police in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan.
Officers contacted UKIP who claimed it was a "deception" by political rivals.
Meanwhile, a public meeting by UKIP in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, was disrupted by angry exchanges with Welsh language campaigners on Monday evening.
Referring to the leaflet, UKIP MEP Nathan Gill said: "This latest attempt to damage the reputation of UKIP and paint us out to be something we are not is an utter disgrace."
The two-sided leaflet urged people to vote UKIP if they objected to welfare payments to the families of extremists, or said they should support another party if they wanted "a jihadi for a neighbour".
UKIP said no-one at the party authorised or printed the leaflet, which bore no official logo.
South Wales Police said it was looking into the matter.
In north Wales, UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall was heckled by two people, including well-known language campaigner Dr Simon Brooks, angry there was no option to ask questions in Welsh at the meeting in Porthmadog.
Mr Nuttall told them: "The fact is that we are one nation. We are the United Kingdom.
"If you come into this country it should be a prerequisite in certain jobs like being a doctor or a nurse that you should speak the language of the land and that language, believe it or not, even here for the majority of people in Wales, is English."
Dr Brooks said: "No translation facilities, no Welsh leaflets, no Welsh-speaking representatives, in this town where the majority of people speak Welsh is a disgrace."
