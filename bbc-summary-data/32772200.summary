Pakistan v Zimbabwe: ICC declines to send umpires for series

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The International Cricket Council will not send umpires to Pakistan to officiate in their upcoming limited-overs series against Zimbabwe because of security concerns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The world governing body said local officials could instead be appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
There will be two Twenty20 and three one-day internationals from 22-31 May.
On Thursday Zimbabwe cancelled the tour after news of a terrorist attack in Karachi, then retracted the statement.
No top-level international cricket has been played in Pakistan since Sri Lanka's team bus was attacked there by gunmen in 2009.
