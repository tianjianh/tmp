Falkirk street sweepers factory to close with up to 53 job losses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new Austrian owners of a Scottish manufacturing company are to close its factory in Falkirk with the loss of up to 53 jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Green Machines Sweepers UK Ltd, which was founded by two brothers, is set to close its premises in Bankside before Christmas.
Production will move to a "third-party supplier" in Macedonia in the Balkans.
The company, formerly Applied Sweepers, said a decline in sales and a serious fire, were factors in the decision.
The fire, which happened in July, badly damaged the company's assembly hall.
The street-sweeping machines, famous for their quiet efficiency, have been used in locations across the world.
Founder Allan Galashan, who died in 2007, built the first sweeper in 1965 and was later joined by his brother Francis.
In the mid-2000s, Francis Galashan said: "We've supplied the machines from Broadway to Buckingham Palace, where we have royal assent from the Queen to clean up outside the palace.
"In America they can be found from San Francisco to Times Square.
"We even had the voice of actor Tony Randall installed in one of our machines telling people to 'Keep New York Tidy'."
In 2008, the Galashan family sold the firm to the Minnesota-based Tennant Commercial Cleaning Company for $68m (Â£54m).
Then at the end of February this year it was sold on again to Austria-based M and F Management and Financing, which had formerly acted as Tennant's distributors in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
M and F Management and Financing chief executive Otto Rainer said the company planned "to close their manufacturing facility in Falkirk and manufacture through a third-party supplier based in Macedonia".
Mr Rainer said: "The company has suffered from declining sales and suffered a fire in July 2016. Although a short-term solution was found, the disruption to the business of either relocating to new premises or the rebuild of the existing one, is substantial and unsustainable.
"The company sees the move as a viable solution to ensure continuation of the Scottish-born brand and ensure it can effectively compete in the marketplace.
"The company is in consultation with its employees but, should the solution be implemented, it may result in up to 53 redundancies."
M and F Management and Financing promised it would "engage" with Skills Development Scotland and government redeployment agency Pace (Partnership Action for Continuing Employment) as part of its "support to employees".
Falkirk Council leader Craig Martin said the local authority was "seeking a dialogue" with Green Machines.
He said: "This will allow us to better understand the reasons for the closure, consider any options, and at the very least lessen its impact for the workers involved.
"The company is a great example of an innovative product, developed locally and taken to a worldwide market.
"It has been based in the Falkirk area for more than 50 years, and is a big loss to our local economy."
