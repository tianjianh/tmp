When a BBC Inside Out team set up hidden cameras in a shoe shop, unsuspecting customers were shocked at what they found.
Unbeknown to them, each shoe on show represented an amputation carried out due to diabetes.
There were 140 shoes on one wall, illustrating the 140 amputations carried out in England every week.
Their reactions were telling: "I'm shocked", "it's really sad" and "that many?"
