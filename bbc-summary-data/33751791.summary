The duchess has passed her Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) advanced open water diver qualification.
This means she can now dive to a depth of 30 metres (98ft).
The Duke of Cambridge is also an experienced diver and follows his father and grandfather in heading the British Sub-Aqua Club (BSAC).
When he took on the role as president of the BSAC, the duke said he hoped his son Prince George would follow him by taking up snorkelling and scuba diving.
The duchess is thought to have gained the qualification from a diving school on the Caribbean island of Mustique, according to the Telegraph.
During the course the duchess would have completed a deep adventure dive to learn how to deal with the physiological effects and challenges of deeper scuba diving.
Photography, buoyancy control, fish identification and exploring wrecks are also part of the course.
BSAC chairman Eugene Farrell said: "We are thrilled that The Duchess of Cambridge shares her husband's interest in the underwater world and has further progressed her diver training.
"Last summer while diving with BSAC, the Duke of Cambridge suggested George may also one day follow in his footsteps, so we hope in the future the whole family may share the same passion for scuba diving."
