A severe storm has rolled through the southern US, killing at least two people and leaving over 43 injured.

Eight people remain missing in northeast Texas and southwest Arkansas.
The storm, according to the National Weather Service, likely produced a tornado that hit Van Zandt County and the city of Van on Sunday evening.
Officials said on Monday the two people died when a twister hit a trailer park in Nashville, Arkansas.
The storm hit Van - a town of about 2,000 people - only days after a tornado tore through Eastland county, Texas, on Saturday. One person was killed and another was seriously injured.
Chuck Allen, the Van Zandt County fire marshal, said at a news conference on Monday that about 30 percent of the city was damaged in the storm.
"Damages range from completely destroyed homes, damaged homes, to trees and power lines down," Mr. Allen said.
About 50 people were staying in a church shelter on Sunday night and the American Red Cross has set up a shelter in Van.
Utility companies have started restoring power and road and bridge crews began working to open streets and highways to allow for first responder access, he said.
Floods from the storms caused also damage across Texas on Sunday.
A 40-foot-wide sinkhole opened in Granbury, Texas, on Monday morning. The sinkhole consumed the parking lot of a Brookshire's supermarket and damaged water and sewer lines.
