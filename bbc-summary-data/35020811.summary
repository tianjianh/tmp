The 68-year-old has managed a host of English clubs, including Tottenham, West Ham and more recently Queen's Park Rangers.
Redknapp was eagerly following Cove's 4-1 home win that set up a fourth-round tie with Premiership side Motherwell.
"They're my Scottish team without a doubt," said Redknapp.
Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound, he explained: "The big result for me yesterday, I was following the Cup game up there.
"The chairman [Keith Moorhouse] invited me up to their Christmas lunch. It was a great day. [Former Scotland coach] Craig Brown was there, the chairman of Aberdeen [Stewart Milne] was there. We had a real good time.
"The chairman at Cove Rangers is a great guy a real character. So I was watching that result all day yesterday, I was looking at my phone all day because they were such good company, I really enjoyed it."
Cove Rangers faced league rivals Formartine in a replay after a 1-1 draw last week.
Jamie Watt and Daniel Park scored before the interval, with Neil Gauld pulling one back early in the second half.
However, Blair Yule and Harry Milne added to the hosts' tally to ensure a lucrative trip to Fir Park.
"I was hoping they would get through and get Motherwell, which they've got now," added Redknapp. "It'll be a big game for them."
