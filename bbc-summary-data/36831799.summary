Brechin City 1-1 St Johnstone (4-2 on penalties)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brechin City earned what could be a valuable bonus point in a penalty shoot-out after a battling 1-1 draw against St Johnstone at Glebe Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The League One side took a first-half lead through Andy Jackson, but Chris Kane notched an equaliser late on.
But Kane and Michael Coulson both missed their penalties in the shootout for Saints as Brechin prevailed 4-2.
The Perth outfit still top the group on seven points, and host second-placed Stirling Albion on Saturday.
City on the other hand still have an outside chance of qualifying but require a win at Falkirk in the final round of group fixtures and for other results to go their way to clinch one of the best runners-up spots.
Questions were asked about the Saints defence after Brechin took the lead.
Chris O'Neil was allowed space and time down the right flank to float a cross deep into the visitors' 18-yard box.
Jackson, who began his career with Saints, nipped in between both Steven Anderson and Tam Scobbie to nod the ball beyond Zander Clark.
Despite having the bulk of possession in the opening half, Graeme Smith in the home goal was only tested once by a Joe Shaugnessy header that he blocked from close range.
Saints boss Tommy Wright introduced Blair Alston, signed this summer from Falkirk, at half-time with the ineffective Craig Thomson making way, and the visitors noticeably upped the pace.
Michael Coulson had a volley from 12 yards that he fired straight at Smith.
Then only a last-gasp challenge by Dougie Hill denied Kane a clear run through on goal.
City almost grabbed a second when the Saints defence failed to clear a corner, but Gareth Rodgers' effort was saved by Clark at the second attempt.
Danny Swanson replaced Liam Craig and within seconds of coming on almost scored the equaliser.
Bearing down on goal from the left, his effort was tipped just wide by Graeme Smith, who was proving to be a real thorn for St Johnstone as they tried to force their way back into the game.
The goalkeeper was in sparkling form as he denied Murray Davidson, Kane and Coulson in succession.
The breakthrough eventually came when Graham Cummins nodded a deep cross back into the six-yard box where Kane was waiting to bundle the ball home and set up the penalty shoot-out.
