Scottish League Two ins and out - Summer 2015

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Many had tipped Clyde as promotion favourites last season based on their appointment of Barry Ferguson as manager, but the former Rangers midfielder has had to return to the drawing board after failing to even reach the play-offs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Blackpool boss has been ruthless with a squad that even flirted with bottom spot and appears to be placing his faith this time on players with recent experience of the Scottish Championship.
Fellow former Scotland international Gary Naysmith has had a similar clear-out of an East Fife squad that also under-performed by finishing fourth in the table, although they did pick up in time to reach the play-off final, where they lost to Stenhousemuir.
Defender Julen Etxabeguren Leanizbarrutia and goalkeeper Alan Martin have made the biggest jump up the ranks during the close season.
Former Real Sociedad 24-year-old Leanizbarrutia has left East Fife to sign for Dundee, while Martin has left Clyde for Hamilton Academical.
Annan Athletic and East Stirlingshire have had their annual mass cull of their squads, with Berwick Rangers the most active in adding to their numbers.
Key signing: Jordan Hart spent the second half of last season on loan from Celtic and the 19-year-old goalkeeper has now made the move from the Scottish champions permanent.
Intriguing arrival: Having started his career with Partick Thistle, versatile 24-year-old Nigeria-born Smart Osadolor headed to Tiffin University in Ohio after spells with junior outfits Irvine Vics and St Anthony's, but the left-side player returns to Scotland after his scholarship.
One that got away: Former Rangers youth defender Andrew Mitchell returned to Annan on loan from Southport in February, but the 23-year-old has now moved to Crusaders in his native Northern Ireland.

Last season: 5th
Prediction: 2nd. Having knocked Airdrieonians out of the Petrofac Training Cup then came close to ousting Queen of the South in the League Cup, Jim Chapman's side look to have the basis for a promotion challenge this season.
Key signing: Arbroath have high hopes for Kane Hester, a 20-year-old striker signed from junior club Arbroath Vics after scoring four goals in three pre-season games.
Intriguing arrival: Midfielder Sergio Cecilia Alvarez, previously of Atletico Victoria of Tenerife in the fourth tier of Spanish football, won a contract after the 25-year-old impressed on trial.
