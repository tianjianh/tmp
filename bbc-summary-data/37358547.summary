The former boss of collapsed retailer BHS will take over as chief executive of fashion chain LK Bennett.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Topp has been appointed to lead the business, which counts the Duchess of Cambridge among its customers.
It also provided Theresa May with her signature leopard print kitten heels on her first day in Downing Street.
Mr Topp endured a difficult time at BHS as the department store disappeared from the High Street just over a year after being sold by Sir Philip Green.
LK Bennett said Mr Topp was a "30-year veteran of British retail" who has also held senior positions at Marks and Spencer.
He will be tasked with boosting sales at the premium womenswear brand as he replaces interim boss Robert Bensoussan.
LK Bennett, which has 114 shops in the UK and Ireland as well as stores in the US and Middle East, saw sales decline 1.8% to Â£93.6m last year.
Mr Topp said: "LK Bennett is a fantastic business and we look forward to building on and continuing Robert's strategy of developing LK Bennett as a premium accessible luxury brand."
He will be joined by his former BHS finance chief, Michael Hitchcock, who joins LK Bennett as chief financial officer.
The two repeatedly clashed with former BHS owner Dominic Chappell, who they blamed for the retailer going out of business.
In particular, Mr Topp said he challenged an attempt by Mr Chappell to transfer Â£1.5m of BHS money to a company owned by a friend of Mr Chappell.
