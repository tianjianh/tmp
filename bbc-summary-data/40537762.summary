This will allow live coverage of sport or other major events using next generation technology.
Work on the new BBC building is on track, with construction work expected to be finished next April.
The first staff will transfer from the existing Broadcasting House in Llandaff in the autumn of 2019.
The new building is expected to be fully operational in 2020.
It will be the first major BBC site to use the latest IP (Internet Protocol) broadcasting technology and it will have virtual reality enabled studios.
In total, about 1,200 staff will be based in the new headquarters, including BBC Studios and some staff from S4C.
BBC Wales has also announced plans to provide training opportunities to more than 250 people over the next two years, including an additional 20 full-time, paid trainee and apprenticeship placements.
The development scheme will focus on attracting people from under-represented communities, putting them through an intensive training programme.
An independent report published in 2015 estimated that the BBC Wales relocation to the centre of Cardiff could provide an economic boost of more than Â£1bn directly and indirectly for the Welsh economy.
