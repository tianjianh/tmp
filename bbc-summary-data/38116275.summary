A man's body has been found in a river after search and rescue teams were called in to try and find a missing 19-year-old student.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body was found in the River Avon in Bath, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers said although formal identification had not yet taken place, Henry Burke's family had been told.
Earlier officers said they were looking for Mr Burke, who was last seen leaving a nightclub in George Street late on Thursday.
A force spokesman said the death was being treated as unexplained and inquiries were continuing.
Mr Burke's girlfriend, Em Comley, earlier said he had been texting her "throughout the night" but then the messages suddenly stopped just after midnight.
