Ardel O'Hanlon, who starred alongside Kelly in the show, and its creators Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews, were among the hundreds of mourners.
Irish President Michael D Higgins was also there to pay his respects.
Speaking after the service, Matthews said Kelly had been "a legendary figure in Irish comedy".
Kelly, who died on Sunday, spent 60 years in theatre and on screen, most recently in Emmerdale and Mrs Brown's Boys D'Movie, but is best remembered as the ill-tempered perennially-drunk priest Father Jack in the hit show.
Addressing the mourners at the Church of the Guardian Angels in Blackrock, Kelly's son Emmet said it had been "pretty cool" that Father Jack was trending on Twitter shortly after his death, ahead of Donald Trump and Leonardo DiCaprio.
Despite his well-known role though, chief celebrant Father Bill Fortune said Kelly had been a devoted churchgoer.
Pointing to the seat Kelly had taken "Sunday after Sunday", Fr Fortune said it was "probably contoured to his person".
The service also saw a copy of the Irish Times crossword, which he did every day, and a picture of the 40 Foot swimming hole in Dublin Bay, where he took a daily dip, brought to the altar.
Speaking outside the church, Matthews said Kelly "had a great life".
"He packed a lot in. He'll be missed, he was a legendary figure in Irish comedy," he said.
The actor is survived by his wife of 51 years Bairbre, seven children and 17 grandchildren.
