The 21-year-old hit 39 sixes, including five off the final over, as he posted a round 300 and his team Maavi finished on 416-2.
His total dwarfs the top-tier record of 175 scored by Chris Gayle in the 2013 Indian Premier League (IPL).
"I have put my name in the IPL auction but I am not sure if this will help people notice," Ahlawat told ABP Live.
Ahlawat played three first-class matches for Delhi in October 2015 alongside India internationals such as Gautam Gambhir and Ishant Sharma.
He was dropped after scores of 1, 4, 0, 0 and 0 in his five innings.
