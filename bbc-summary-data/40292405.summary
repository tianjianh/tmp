[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Durham surgeon cleared of child sex assault

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A retired orthopaedic surgeon has been cleared of sexually assaulting a girl during an examination.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Magdy Eskander was accused of touching the then-14-year-old while carrying out an examination at Darlington Memorial Hospital in 2011.
The 59-year-old had denied three charges of sexual assault, and was cleared by a jury following a trial at Teesside Crown Court.
Another charge regarding a second girl was dropped earlier in the trial.
The court heard that during his career as an orthopaedic surgeon he had examined about 600 children a year, and always insisted on a chaperone in the room.
He denied sexual assault, saying it was "offensive" to be compared to a "low-life paedophile".
The jury took just three hours to clear him.
After the verdict his legal team, speaking on his behalf, said it had been a "difficult and distressing time for everybody".
Dr Richard Stacey, from Medical Protection, said: "[Mr Eskander] has welcomed the opportunity of clearing his name.
"Now in his retirement, he is going to concentrate on his church and charity work."
