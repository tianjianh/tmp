Prop Jones, 33, of Merthyr Tydfil, was doing 36mph in a 30mph zone on the A4109 near Glynneath in Neath Port Talbot in his Mercedes E220.
The Cardiff Blues player already had nine points on his licence.
Cardiff magistrates rejected his appeal that not being able to drive would cause "exceptional hardship".
He was banned for six months.
Jones said it would place a strain on his wife and parents who would have to give him lifts.
The court heard that if he is picked for Wales for the 2015 Six Nations campaign he will have to go to training camps at "all hours of the day".
Jones told the hearing: "I can get called in at random times to do random training sessions.
"I wouldn't be able to say when I would get back from games. It's not unknown to get back at one or two in the morning."
The court heard Jones, who has 95 Wales caps, had already been caught speeding three times during the past two years and had done a speed awareness course.
Magistrates banned him from driving for six months, saying that he was wealthy enough to be able to afford his own private chauffeur.
Chairman of the bench Hywel Thomas said: "This may cause some difficulty or inconvenience but we can find no exceptional hardship in your circumstances.
"You have indicated you have the means to pay a driver.
"You have not been treated any differently to any other member of the public today."
