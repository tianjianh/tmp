South Africa v England: Nick Compton & Taylor lead recovery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nick Compton and James Taylor added 125 for the fourth wicket as England fought back after an early collapse against South Africa on a rain-affected first day of the first Test in Durban.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair came together at 49-3 after openers Alastair Cook and Alex Hales failed and Joe Root fell for 24.
They showed resilience and patience to each make a half century before Taylor (70) became Dale Steyn's third victim.
Compton was unbeaten on 63 as England closed on 179-4.
Rain and then bad light meant only 65 overs were possible during the day.
It means an early start on day two is possible, with good weather forecast for the remainder of the Test.
And all five days are likely to be needed if there is to be a result on a slow, flat wicket that offers little for the bowlers and rewards diligent batting.
Compton's last Test appearance came in May 2013 in the second match of the home series against New Zealand, after which he was dropped as a result of a fourth straight failure with the bat.
However, successive Test hundreds in New Zealand two months earlier had demonstrated his ability, something he underlined by scoring 1,123 runs for Middlesex in last season's County Championship.
Taylor had endured a similarly lengthy exile from the Test side from August 2012 before a combination of domestic form and consistent impressive displays in the England one-day side prompted a Test recall against Pakistan in November.
Initially, they had to repel the South African attack before steadily building a partnership and while they never truly took the game to the home side, their comfort grew as the ball aged.
Taylor was the more aggressive, scoring his 70 runs from 137 balls, in contrast to Compton's 63 from 41 balls more.
Unfortunately, Taylor was unable to survive the day and give himself a chance of a maiden Test century as Steyn had the final word shortly before the close.
Steyn missed the last three Tests of South Africa's recent series defeat in India with a groin problem, but was declared fully fit for this series, much to the concern of England, who are without their own attack leader - James Anderson - for this Test through injury.
With fellow seamer Vernon Philander ruled out of the first and second Tests with an ankle problem, the presence of Steyn is vital for the Proteas and his two early wickets put England on the back foot.
Just 6.1 overs were managed at the start of the day before play was halted because of the weather but in that time England lost their captain as Steyn brushed off his seven-week absence to nip one away from Cook and find an edge that carried to Dean Elgar at second slip.
And in Steyn's resumed over after the break, during which lunch was taken, Hales fuelled the detractors who feel he is ill-suited to opening in Test cricket with a loose shot outside his off stump that nicked the ball to keeper AB de Villiers.
Such is the 32-year-old's class, even after a day of toiling in the field, he was still able to muster a last burst of pace to have the final say, dismissing Taylor courtesy of a thin edge to De Villiers from an attempted back-foot drive to leave the bowler with figures of 3-29.
More to follow.
