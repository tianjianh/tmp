[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The A&E department at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth has missed the four-hour waiting time target for the last nine months, a report has said.

Chief Executive Anne James said there had been a "sustained increase" in the numbers attending the department, creating "significant pressure".
In the report to the hospital board, she said warned of a "further detrimental impact" on patients.
The hospital is on "black alert" meaning it is overwhelmed by demand.
The alert has been in place since January. Ms James said 745 operations were cancelled in February.
The last time the hospital reached the government target of treating 95% of emergency department patients within four hours was last May.
"These pressures continue to affect our ability to meet the accident and emergency four hour standard and the cancellation of a large number of elective operations and planned investigations," Ms James said.
"In spite of these challenges, we continue to provide our patients with a safe and compassionate environment in which to receive their care.
"The current operational pressures cannot, however, be sustained without having a further detrimental impact on our patients and staff," she said.
The board of Plymouth Hospitals Trust will discuss the report later.
