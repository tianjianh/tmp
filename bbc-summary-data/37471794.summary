The pair, who were wearing stage make-up, fake blood and white contact lenses, were returning from filming online sitcom Dead Town on Sunday.
Steve Lowe and Diane Holden of Ashton-under-Lyne were on the M62 near Warrington when they were pulled over.
Police shared a picture and tweeted "posing as Zombies - takes all sorts".
The pair were filming the third and final episode of Dead Town which is based in Runcorn, Cheshire when the North West Motorway Police officer pulled them over in an unmarked car.
Mr Lowe said the officer burst out laughing when he saw their attire.
"I think he was very surprised; he wasn't frightened but pleasantly amused.
"He asked if he could take a photograph because no-one would believe him back at the station."
Mr Lowe, 60, said he has been dressing up as a zombie for a couple of years.
"It is brilliant; really good fun. There is a big zombie community - it's a nice big zombie family."
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police added: "No further action was taken."
