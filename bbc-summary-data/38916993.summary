Eamon Bradley: Police research on Syria 'done on internet'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating a Londonderry man charged with Syrian-related terror offences had to rely on the internet for their research, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A detective constable involved in the case said at no stage did the police receive any input from the security services.
Londonderry Crown Court heard the officer was out of his "comfort zone".
Eamon Bradley, 28, a Muslim convert originally from Melmore Gardens in Creggan, denies all the charges.
He faces six charges, including attending a rebel training camp in Syria and receiving training in guns and grenades.
Mr Bradley was arrested on his return to Derry in November 2014.
The court heard the detective constable knew virtually nothing about Jaysh al-Islam- the rebel group the accused allegedly trained with in Syria - before the defendant came to their attention.
He said officers had to work through open source research, which, he told the court, meant using the internet to research information about the case.
"We had to move on and do the best we could," he added.
Earlier, a forensics expert told the sixth day of the trial that weapons Mr Bradley was pictured with in Syria were probably authentic.
However, Jonathan Greer said it was impossible to confirm if they had been deactivated "without examining them".
The jury was again shown a photograph of Mr Bradley sitting behind a tripod of assault rifles.
Mr Greer said the photograph showed two AKM assault rifles, which had the capacity of firing 600 rounds a minute, and an AK-47.
The forensics expert said that from looking at the photograph, which police had told him was taken while Mr Bradley was at a Syrian training camp, he believed the weapons were authentic assault rifles.
However, he agreed with the defence barrister that many such weapons had found there way into "bric-a-brac stores" in the UK for sale, once they had been decommissioned.
He also agreed that holiday snapshots of tourists dressed up in combat gear and holding a weapon had become popular in many countries.
His trial continues.
