Pete Ganton regularly uses Great Western Railway (GWR) to transport his bike from Reading to London, but now has to book a space on the train for his bike.
When followed by a BBC reporter on a service he reserved a space on he was prevented from getting on the train because he did not have any paperwork, according to the train guard.
GWR began the policy in May, meaning bicycle users must book two hours in advance.
The BBC's Ben Moore reports.
