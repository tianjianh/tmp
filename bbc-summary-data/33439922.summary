[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joni Mitchell has made "remarkable progress" since she suffering a stroke and brain aneurysm in March, according to court documents.

The singer is talking and "expected to make a full recovery", her lawyer said.
Rebecca J Thyne said she had visited Mitchell on 26 June, and the singer was "happy to be home".
The comments came in papers relating to Mitchell's conservatorship, and follow reports last month that the Big Yellow Taxi singer was unable to speak.
David Crosby - who dated Mitchell in 1967 - told The Huffington Post the star faced a long "struggle" after  being found unconscious in her home on 31 March.
"She took a terrible hit," he said. "She had an aneurysm, and nobody found her for a while. And she's going to have to struggle back from it the way you struggle back from a traumatic brain injury.
"To my knowledge, she is not speaking yet."
But Mitchell's lawyer has painted a more optimistic picture.
"When I arrived she was seated at her kitchen table feeding herself lunch," Thyne wrote.
"She also told me that she receives excellent care from caregivers round-the-clock. It was clear that she was happy to be home and that she has made remarkable progress.
"She has physical therapy each day and is expected to make a full recovery."
The court filing recommended that Mitchell's longtime friend Leslie Morris, who has been acting as her temporary conservator, be officially appointed her conservator.
According to Thyne, Mitchell should be judged to lack the capacity to give informed consent for medical treatment.
