Based near Wakefield it has 500 acres of parkland and five indoor galleries.
The attraction was worth more than Â£10m annually to the local economy, according to the organisation.
Peter Murray, the park's executive director, said he was delighted and it was "a rare and unparalleled experience" for visitors.
The sculpture park has held exhibitions for Eduardo Paolozzi, Lynn Chadwick and Ai Weiwei. Its collection of works by Castleford-born Henry Moore is one of the largest open-air displays of his bronzes in Europe.
Works by Wakefield-born Barbara Hepworth are also on display.
Last year, the park was awarded the Art Fund Prize for Museum of the Year.
The sculpture park, the first of its kind in the UK and the biggest in Europe, opened in 1977.
