Families of patients who died at Stafford Hospital have met the prime minister ahead of the publication of a report into the hospital's failings.

The public inquiry report into high death rates at the hospital over 2005-09 is due to be released on Wednesday.
Julie Bailey, who set up protest group Cure The NHS, was among those who met David Cameron.
The campaigners said they wanted assurances any recommendations made in the report would be implemented.
Robert Francis QC compiled the report after overseeing a public inquiry, which was held last year.
His report is expected to recommend wide-ranging reforms of the NHS.
Over the weekend it emerged five doctors from the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust are to face disciplinary hearings over their work between 2005 and 2009.
The General Medical Council said three of them had managerial responsibilities at the trust at the time.
The GMC said all five would appear before a fitness to practise tribunal.
