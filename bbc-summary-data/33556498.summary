The BBC's Tulip Mazumdar has returned to Freetown, Sierra Leone to see how plans to eliminate Ebola are progressing.
Tulip answered a selection of your questions on the topic in a live Twitter Q&A on Friday 17 July 2015 at 1100 BST. This is a transcript of that session - you can see it on twitter using the hashtag #AskBBCTulip.
Ms Kennedy asks by email: Is it safe to assume a survivor of Ebola will always carry the virus in his/her body?
Tulip answers: Not enough research to be conclusive Virus found in survivors' eye & semen. Believed to stay in semen for at least 3 months
G Strachan asks: Is treatment available to those overseas accessible to Africans yet?
Tulip answers: Yes, Zmapp trials are underway here in Sierra Leone. Vaccine trials also happening in all three worst affected countries
Finn Kelly asks: Is Ebola a threat to the western world?
Tulip answers: As long as cases anywhere in world, rest at risk. Only takes someone getting on plane to bring virus to another country
Daniel in Malaysia asks: What is the easiest way to prevent Ebola?
Tulip answers: Ebola passed via infected body fluids so don't touch fluids of sick people. Here in Sierra Leone still "AVOID BODY CONTACT"
Ms Kennedy asks: Why are Guinea & Sierra Leone still struggling with Ebola? What's Liberia doing differently? asks Ms Kennedy
Tulip answers: Cases peaked in Liberia before Sierra Leone. "How to prevent virus" advice seems to be taken on board more comprehensively
Haidar Alaamery asks: Is there a cure for Ebola?
Tulip answers: No proven cure - yet. Trials for treatment underway. Best chance of survival right now = getting supportive treatment early
Adam asks: It seems that a lot of Africans on twitter seem to think Ebola is a weapon? Why is this?
Tulip answers: Ebola rumours on social media have helped fuel fear/mis-information. Scientists believe bats a natural reservoir for virus
Dan asks: Is #Ebola spreading again?
Tulip answers: Liberia #Ebola free for 2 months. Now 6 new cases in 2 weeks. Ebola spreading since Dec 2013, slowed but not stopped since
Daniel asks: How do you identify early symptoms in those suffering from Ebola?
Tulip answers: Ebola usually starts with sudden fever, fatigue. Then vomiting & diarrhoea. Can also be internal & external bleeding,
Peter Onkendi asks: Why are we yet to take control of #Ebola spread in West Africa?
Tulip answers: This is biggest Ebola outbreak in history. Resources were slow to get here to fight virus, but are here now. Pockets of fear & resistance in some communities mean sick people are hiding & infecting others.
Nansinguza Jacob asks: How long does Ebola virus stay in its survivors?
Tulip answers: Research ongoing, but thought to stay in semen for at least 3 months. Also found in eye fluid & breast milk
Mewael Berhe asks: How do you describe the fear that Ebola has created in the majorly affected areas?
Tulip answers: People now used to living with Ebola, but still strikes fear in communities. Constant reminder #Ebola is still here with trading restrictions & "Avoid Body Contact" policy.
Tausif AB asks: What is status of #Ebola vaccine trials by GSK and Merck in Africa?
Tulip answers: Need to check latest. My understanding: trials struggling to get volunteers with #Ebola exposure to generate enough data
Bernard Phiri asks: How many times can a person catch Ebola virus?
Tulip answers: Evidence so far suggests someone can only catch #Ebola once, but research is ongoing
Jetset Eat Repeat asks: Is eradication of bats considered a preventative measure? If so, is it feasible?
Tulip answers: This is not something being considered as far as I am aware
John asks: What is the origin of the Ebola disease?
Tulip answers: Fruit bats thought to be natural #Ebola reservoir. Scientists believe 2014 Ebola outbreak started when two year old infected playing in hollow tree housing bat colony.
