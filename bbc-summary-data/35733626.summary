Gulls striker Shaun Harrad came closest when he glanced a header just wide.
Alfie Pavey shot wide for the Shots, who rallied to keep a clean sheet after Tuesday's 8-2 drubbing at Chester.
Rhys Browne forced Torquay's debutant goalkeeper Brendan Moore into a decent save before he reacted quickly to deny Pavey on the rebound.
Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey:

"The fans see a fighting spirit. We have shown that in the majority of games this season. It shows that these players are up for the challenge to grit their teeth.
"We were all disappointed with the result on Tuesday but the players took responsibility, held their hands up and said it wasn't good enough.
"The important thing was a clean sheet and the boys defended as a group. They threw themselves into challenges and we made sure that there was a fight to stop them scoring. In front of your home fans you want three points but, given Tuesday's result, it was important to get that clean sheet."
