The 21-year-old joined the Potters from Birmingham City in January 2013 and had loan spells with Barnsley and Leeds last season.
Butland comes in after Lee Grant was injured in the 3-0 win over Reading.
Derby boss Steve McClaren told the club website: "We know a lot about Jack and he is someone who [goalkeeping coach] Eric Steele rates very highly."
Butland has made two competitive appearances for Stoke this season, both in the League Cup, and six in total.
McClaren added: "Jack is a promising young goalkeeper and, after Lee Grant picked up an injury on Saturday, we quickly set about identifying someone to come into the group."
Butland was part of the England Under-21 side that recently saw off Croatia over two legs to qualify for next year's European Championships.
He will be available for the Rams' league trip to Blackpool on Tuesday.
