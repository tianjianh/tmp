The ex-Portugal Under-19 international, 22, originally signed for League Two Stanley in February but was unable to play because of registration issues.
He then joined non-league Tranmere for the rest of the 2016-17 season in March and played four games.
Meanwhile, striker Terry Gornell has left the League Two club by mutual consent, despite having a year left on his existing deal.
In his third spell at the Wham Stadium, the 27-year-old played 24 games last season although 11 were as a substitute.
"It's sad to see Terry go, he was a great professional around the place and he was beneficial to younger players over the past couple of years," Stanley manager John Coleman said.
