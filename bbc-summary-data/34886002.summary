Tom Pattison, 23, died after a crash landing at the Blaxhall Circuit on Sunday, 13 September.
The coroner's court heard his bike landed on its front wheel and he went over the handlebars.
His Honda 250 then landed on his chest. He died at the scene as a result of his injuries.
Mr Pattison, from Beccles, who had been taking part in a time trial at the Eastern Centre Solo Motocross Championships, was the only rider involved in the accident.
The crash happened at the jump known as the Table Top.
The inquest in Bury St Edmunds heard Mr Pattison had blood in his lungs and ambulance crews could not save his life.
Yvonne Blake, Suffolk assistant coroner, said the circuit had accreditation with motocross's governing body, the Auto Cycle Union.
There had only been one other death in Blaxhall's 50-year history when a marshal was killed, she said.
She recorded a narrative conclusion that he "died as a result of multiple injuries following a road traffic collision".
Mr Pattison was married to Rachel and they had a three-year-old daughter.
Mr Pattison's family and friends did not attend the inquest, but Ms Blake said they "understood the risks" inherent in motocross.
A memorial ride at his favourite track at Blythburgh, Suffolk, the weekend after his death was attended by 400 people, including 170 motorcyclists.
