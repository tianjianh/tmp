Officers found the body at a house in St George's Avenue in Yeovil, Somerset, after receiving a tip-off.
A 29-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of infanticide has since been released on bail.  Officers said the discovery was not connected to the property's current tenant.
Avon and Somerset Police said it could not confirm whether the arrested woman was related to the baby.
"As our inquiries are continuing, we would ask the public not to speculate on the circumstances surrounding this incident," a spokesman said.
"We are continuing to work closely with the family concerned and helping them through this difficult time."
Officers said they launched an investigation last week after police were tipped off that a child may be buried there.
