Military sources quoted in Turkish state-run media said the air and artillery strikes took place on Sunday within 10km (six miles) of the border.
They said the militants were killed as they prepared to fire rockets.
On Monday, Turkey reportedly detained seven suspected IS members including one described as an IS "executioner".
The suspects were held in raids in the Elazig area of eastern Turkey, state-run Anatolia news agency reported.
The agency said the alleged executioner had carried out several killings in Syria for the militant group. The others detained included an unidentified man described as a senior leader.
The IS suspects had gone to Elazig on a recruiting mission, according to the Dogan news agency.
Sunday's strikes on IS destroyed five fortified defence posts and two gun posts, Turkish media said.
They were the latest in a string of attacks on IS in the area, aimed at preventing further assaults by the militants on the Turkish border town of Kilis.
The town has been hit by rockets fired from Syria multiple times in recent months.
