[SN]TITLE[SN]
Government-ordered review of Crofting Commission under way

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish government-ordered review has begun into governance arrangements at crofting's statutory body.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows the Crofting Commission having to make a public apology for its actions in a row with crofters at Bohuntin, Upper Coll and Mangersta.
The dispute concerned the running of common grazings, areas of land shared by crofters to raise livestock.
The row has also seen the commission ask its convener to resign, but Colin Kennedy has refused to stand down.
Mr Kennedy has said he has done nothing wrong and last month submitted an official complaint about the minister in charge of crofting, Fergus Ewing.
The government said the review it has commissioned would the governance arrangements relating to the commission's board and a review of the systems, procedures and support mechanisms "to underpin effective decision making".
Also under review are the systems, processes and procedures in relation to decision-making in the three common grazings cases, but the government said the decisions taken would not be examined.
Arrangements for handling conflicts of interest also form part of the review.
Mr Ewing said: "Crofting is a vital part of many rural communities in Scotland.
"That is why it is essential that it has an effective regulator to protect and enhance the crofting way of life.
"This review will help to promote effective governance within the Crofting Commission and it is an opportunity to take stock, learn from experiences and examine positives as well as opportunities for improvement."
