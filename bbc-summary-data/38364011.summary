A man has admitted murdering a couple found stabbed on a street near the Cardiff city centre Matalan shop where they worked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zoe Morgan, 21, and Lee Simmons, 33, were found dead near the Queen Street store on 28 September at 5:50 BST.
They had been in a relationship since July.
Andrew Saunders, 20, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to murder at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday. He will be sentenced in the New Year.
The discovery of the bodies of the couple led to the street being closed as police began their investigation.
Saunders was arrested later that day and then charged with their murder.
Miss Morgan, who worked as a window dresser, had recently graduated from the University of South Wales with an honours degree in fashion marketing and retail design.
It is believed the couple struck up a romance while working together.
In a tribute following the deaths, Miss Morgan's family said she was a "beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter and auntie who had a heart of gold and would do anything for anybody."
Mr Simmons was a described as a genuine and lovely young man by a childhood friend, who added: "he always had a smile on his face and he was well loved".
Hundreds also attended vigils in memory of the couple around the city.
Judge Eleri Rees, the Recorder of Cardiff, remanded Saunders into custody.
The defendant, who had short brown hair and a beard and wore a blue hooded top, spoke only to confirm his name before entering guilty pleas.
He will be sentenced next year by Mrs Justice Nicola Davies.
Prosecutor Michael Jones said she would have to watch "disturbing" CCTV footage.
