Durham County Council said it hopes Wharton Park will become a tourist attraction. Work begins on Monday.
The money from the Heritage Lottery Fund will pay for a heritage centre, play and fitness areas and restoration of an amphitheatre, battlements and miniature car track.
It opened in 1858 and became known as the People's Park.
It hosted the first Durham Miners' Gala in 1871.
Maria Plews from the council said: "The city will benefit from yet more new leisure facilities and this will become a tourist attraction for both local people and visitors alike."
