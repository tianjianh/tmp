Flanker Jamie Macartney, winger Jack Howard and centre Nicolai Koplewsky scored tries for Campbell in the first half at Kingspan Stadium.
Number eight Jack Barry-Glendinning added a fine try in the second half.
Scrum-half Malcolm Corry landed two conversions while Dalriada's points came from a Stewart Moore penalty.
"Coming here means a lot to both teams," said Campbell coach Brian Robinson.
"It was a physical and well-contested match and Dalriada should be proud of what they have achieved."
