A four-day security operation at the farm in Kinawley ended on Saturday evening.
Police said bomb timers, detonators and fuses were also seized, as well as a gun, 100 rounds of ammunition and forensic suits and gloves.
A 43-year-old man arrested on Wednesday remains in custody.
Police have linked the weapons to dissident republicans.
PSNI Det Supt Kevin Geddes said: "Firstly, I would like to thank the members of the public in the Kinawley area for their patience whilst my officers carried out a professional policing operation over a number of days which has recovered a quantity of munitions.
"The items we have recovered have the potential to cause injury, damage and death, and Northern Ireland is a safer place with these items beyond the reach of the dangerous individuals who would seek to use them."
Police began searches of buildings, vehicles and fields at the farm, which is located in a remote spot off a quiet road that leads to the border about 1km mile away, on Wednesday.
Neighbours said they heard what sounded like three controlled explosions on Friday evening. They said there had been no sign of activity at the farm before the security operation.
