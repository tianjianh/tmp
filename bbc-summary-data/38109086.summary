The 37-year-old, who set a new lap record of 134.089mph at the Ulster Grand Prix in August, will also race in the British Superstock 1000cc series.
The Bingley rider won Superstock races at the North West 200, TT and Ulster GP this year.
He was also a double winner in the Superbike class at Dundrod on his BMW.
The Yorkshireman finished second in this season's British Superstock 1000cc series.
Hutchinson is also set to continue to compete in the Supersport class, in which he has enjoyed substantial success with Keith Flint's Team Traction Control Yamaha outfit in recent years.
A hat-trick hero at this year's TT and a four-time winner at this year's Ulster Grand Prix, Hutchinson has set his sights on further improvement next year.
He finished second to Michael Dunlop in both the Superbike and Senior TTs in 2016,
"Having now worked together for a season, we know where we need to improve with the obvious goal, to go on now and challenge for the Superbike wins at all of the big three internationals," said Hutchinson.
"The BMW S1000RR still has so much potential in Superbike trim on the roads and with another season of British Superstock planned, the aim there will be to go one step better and win the championship next season."
"Hutchy did a great job for us this season and whether it was in British championship or the roads, he was always in contentions for wins and podiums and provided both our sponsors and fans with a lot of entertainment," added team owner Hector Neill.
"His international hat-trick in the Superstock class and his terrific season in British Superstock proved how well he got on with the Tyco BMW, and to go on and take the world's fastest track lap record at Dundrod was the icing on the cake.
"The goal going forward is to build on that success and I've never hidden the fact that the Senior TT trophy is the one we really want to win in 2017.
It's the blue-riband road race on the season's calendar, and along with Hutchy and our dedicated team we will be giving it our very best shot."
