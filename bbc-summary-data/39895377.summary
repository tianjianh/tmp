Masaga, 30, has won the Super Rugby title with Chiefs in his native New Zealand and has one All Blacks cap.
More recently, he has played in Japan with Honda Heat and Masaga will work with his former Chiefs head coach Dave Rennie at Glasgow.
"I'm excited to be joining my new club Glasgow Warriors in August," Masaga told the Warriors website.
"I'm looking forward to being there under Dave Rennie as head coach. I can't wait to start this new journey in Scotland."
Rennie will replace new Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend at Scotstoun this summer and Jason O'Halloran will assist New Zealander Rennie.
And O'Halloran said of Masaga: "Lelia is an experienced and powerful player who has proven himself at the highest level in Super Rugby.
"He knows Dave well through their time together at the Chiefs and will be an excellent addition to our squad."
Masaga follows back Huw Jones, prop Oli Kebble and flanker Callum Gibbins in agreeing to move to Glasgow before the 2017-18 Pro12 season.
