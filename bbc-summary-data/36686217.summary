Florence will compete again for a medal on Thursday in the men's C2 double with Richard Hounslow.
Florence became Great Britain's first Olympic slalom medallist with a C1 silver at Beijing 2008 but has never won gold at a Games.
"I'm most disappointed not to have put in a good run. I just didn't really get it right today," Florence said.
"I'm lucky that my Olympics isn't over just yet."
