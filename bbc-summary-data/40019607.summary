Three explosions hit the bus carrying Dortmund to their home Champions League quarter-final match against Monaco.
Defender Marc Bartra had an operation after breaking a bone in his wrist in the attack, with the game postponed until the following day.
"I'm afraid to get on the bus, I am afraid to drive to games," said Kagawa.
"I was frightened - and I am still frightened, to be honest," added the 28-year-old Japan player.
Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed.
Police charged a man identified only as Sergej W and investigators say the motive for the attack was financial and not terror-related.
"I was petrified," wrote Kagawa on his blog. "I looked back and saw the shattered window panes.
"I saw Marc Bartra curled up. Like everybody else, I was completely shaken."
The former Manchester United player said he and his team-mates "couldn't imagine" playing the rearranged first leg, which Dortmund lost 3-2.
"In my head was only the scenes from the bus and thoughts of the hellish detonation," he added.
