The singer said the concert in London's Hyde Park, part of the Proms end of season celebrations, was "magical".
Tenor Alfie Boe and vocal group Il Divo also sang at the event, held in tandem with the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall.
Coverage of the traditional Prom finale was screened live in 3D at cinemas around Britain for the first time.
Thousands flocked to Hyde Park to hear Kylie perform such hits as On A Night Like This and Can't Get You Out Of My Head.
The Australian performer was accompanied by the Royal Choral Society and the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Richard Balcombe.
Following the concert, the 44-year-old send thanks "to all involved" on her official Twitter account.
Open-air events were also held in Belfast, Glasgow and Caerphilly.
The National Youth Choir of Scotland were among the acts at the City Halls in Glasgow, while the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales appeared near Caerphilly Castle.
The traditional closing concert at the Royal Albert Hall featured such flag-waving favourites as Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance and Sir Hubert Parry's Jerusalem.
Czech conductor Jiri Belohlavek led the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Albert Hall for the last time in a programme that featured Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti and Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja.
The Daily Telegraph described the soloists as "starry" and "as perfectly contrasted as you could wish".
In an unscheduled addition, Team GB Olympic and Paralympic winners joined in on a sing-along version of Rule Britannia.
Eight 3D cameras captured the concert, which millions watched and listened around the world.
The Financial Times described the 118th Proms season as "silver medal-winning".
"Artistically, it was a season of highs and lows," wrote Richard Fairman. "Happily, though, the ending came on a high."
Other reviews were generally positive, with The Guardian's George Hall calling it "a lively Last Night that never threatened to become too raucous".
The "stroke of genius" he said, was "bringing on to the platform gold- and silver- medal-winning members of Team GB and Paralympics GB as part of the patriotic bonanza".
Mr Belohlavek, who has lived in Britain for the last six years while working with the BBC Symphony, received a big cheer when he when he pulled out the CBE medal given him by the Queen and hung it round his neck.
He described this summer in London as the perfect example of "kalokagathia" - an ancient Greek philosophy of harmony in mind, body and virtue.
The conductor told the BBC's World At One that this was "because the attention towards the Olympics was immense and at the same time the interest of the audience in the Proms was very high.
"The attendance went up to 93%, so this is something which is very rare and very encouraging for the future."
He added: "I simply [have] got great admiration of Britain and the people. I love their correctness, I love their humour, I love their diligence and I felt in my second home there."
The 118th Proms season began on 13 July and included performances of all nine Beethoven symphonies by Daniel Barenboim and his West-Eastern Divan Orchestra.
There was also a special family-themed concert featuring Wallace and Gromit and a full performance of the classic musical My Fair Lady.
