[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent have signed Nottinghamshire's Will Gidman on a one-month loan deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old all-rounder will be available for six matches, of which four are in the One-Day Cup and two are in the County Championship.
Gidman has spent time on the sidelines with an ankle injury this season but has recently returned to action for Nottinghamshire's second XI.
He has taken 198 wickets at an average of 23.48 in his first-class career and averages 37.06 with the bat.
"He will bolster our resources and I'm sure he will do a great job," Kent skipper Sam Northeast said.
"He is hungry to play and we hope he will come into the side and buy into what the team is all about."
