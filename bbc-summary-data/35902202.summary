[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moussa Dembele and Ross McCormack inspired Fulham's first win in seven games to ease their relegation worries and increase those of visitors MK Dons.

McCormack hit a post in the first half before putting the hosts in front when he slotted in his 20th of the season from Dembele's pinpoint cut-back.
Josh Murphy levelled superbly for the Dons when he coolly lobbed over Marcus Bettinelli from Alex Revell's flick.
But Fulham won it when Dembele swept in after McCormack teed him up.
Slovisa Jokanovic's side remain 21st despite their victory following Rotherham's 2-1 win over Leeds - the Millers' fifth in six matches.
The Dons still occupy the final Championship relegation place and are now four points from safety with just seven games of the season to go.
Fulham's success was no more than they deserved, but they were frustrated in the first half as Cody Cropper made fine saves to deny Tom Cairney and Dembele.
The Dons keeper later thwarted McCormack and Dembele in the space of 30 seconds after the break, but was powerless to keep out the latter's winner, his 14th goal of the season.
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic:

"It's the end of the run without any wins, in front of us are seven cup finals. We are not safe with this three points today.
"I can be satisfied with many things today, with the way my team played, but it's not time for a holiday.
"We have a job in front of us. In three days' time we have another cup final in front of us.
"We made one mistake and I believe we can avoid this situation where MK Dons scored their goal."
MK Dons boss Karl Robinson:
"The officials cost us, his goal was onside - they know that, they understand that and they know they made an error.
"At 1-1 it's a big decision. It's a bitter pill to take. A draw would have been a fair result on the balance of the game.
"I don't think we deserved to win here, but I don't think they deserved to win either. But we've been beat and we have to take it on the chin."
