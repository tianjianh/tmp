[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Cameron, who had convictions for causing death by reckless driving, attempted murder and rape, died on Sunday.
Darrell Smith, who was convicted of shoplifting in May, died the day before.
The SPS said next of kin had been informed and fatal accident inquiries "may be held in due course."
Cameron had appeared in court on Friday on petition, where he was fully committed and remanded in custody. He was alleged to have breached a sexual offences prevention order.
A spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service said: "George McCallum Cameron, 37, a prisoner at HMP Perth has died. He was untried.
"Darrell Kerr Smith, 39, a prisoner at HMP Perth has died. He was convicted at Dundee Sherriff Court on 6 May 2016."
Police Scotland have been advised in both cases and reports sent to the procurator fiscal.
