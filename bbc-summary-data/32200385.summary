Operation Elveden: Daily Mirror journalist trial delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of a former Daily Mirror journalist has been delayed pending a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) review.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Journalist Greig Box Turnbull had been due to stand trial alongside prison officer Grant Pizzey and his partner Desra Reilly, starting this week.
All three are charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office as part of the Metropolitan Police's investigation, Operation Elveden.
The review comes after the conviction of another journalist was overturned.
The former News of the World journalist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been convicted last year of illegally paying a prison officer for stories.
The Court of Appeal ruled that a direction by the trial judge did not take fully into account the "seriousness" of the offence, and whether the supply of information by the prison officer "has the effect of harming the public interest".
Home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said the Met's Operation Elveden - which is investigating payments by journalists to public officials including police officers, prisons officers and soldiers - had been thrown into disarray by the ruling.
Mr Box Turnbull's trial is the second trial to be delayed while the CPS looks at all the prosecutions again in light of the Court of Appeal decision.
Nine trials and re-trials relating to Operation Elveden, involving 11 journalists, are due to take place over the summer.
A further hearing relating to the case of Mr Box Turnbull, Mr Pizzey and Ms Reilly is due to take place on 27 April.
