The holy grail for economic development in Northern Ireland is the creation of locally owned, hi-tech, export-focused firms which employ lots of skilled people.
That is exactly what Eddie Haughey did with Norbrook Laboratories.
Drawing on his farming background and early career in pharmaceutical sales, he built Norbrook into a major player in veterinary medicine.
The firm now employs about 1,700 people.
The success of the business made Mr Haughey fabulously wealthy.
His fortune was estimated at more than Â£600m and he had a series of luxury homes, including a Belgravia town house and a Cumbrian castle.
He had the drive, confidence and single-mindedness of the successful entrepreneur.
He was a robust, sometimes abrasive character, who always fought his corner.
Norbrook pays about Â£50m a year in salaries which is a mark of his huge economic legacy.
In 2008, he was made an Honorary Doctor of Science (DSc) by the University of Ulster, in recognition of his contribution to the development of the international pharmaceutical industry.
The peer's fortune was estimated at more than Â£600m.
Lord Ballyedmond once owned Carlisle Airport and he started an air travel business, principally Haughey Air, which owned a helicopter charter company.
He owned Ballyedmond Castle in Rostrevor, County Down, and Corby Castle in Cumbria.
He also had a six-storey town house in Belgrave Square in London and owned land in Uganda, and several islands in Lake Victoria.
In 2004, Edward Haughey was made a life peer as Baron Ballyedmond of Mourne in County Down and sat in the House of Lords on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, before switching to the Conservative Party.
He was appointed to the Irish Senate in the 1990s by Albert Reynolds, and then by Bertie Ahern.
He was a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. He also served as an honorary consul to the Republic of Chile.
He leaves his wife, two sons and a daughter.
