My Day: Prakash the Bharatpur bird guide

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bharatpur bird sanctuary near India's capital Delhi is a haven for many species of wildlife. In winter the Unesco-recognised reserve - also known as Keoladeo National Park - becomes an important stopping point for thousands of migratory birds. Prakash Chand Gotam, one of the sanctuary's resident guides, tells the story of the park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
I have been working here in Bharatpur for a very long time!
My father was also posted here - but he's now retired.
There are a total of 375 bird species in the park. Mostly, I am a bird specialist - we are known as naturalists. In the park there are 91 of us naturalists. We have more detailed knowledge of the birds compared with the other guides in the reserve.
You need naturalists or visitors can get confused and pick up the wrong information.
I come to work at 6am every day. Winter time is the busiest for visitors, when Bharatpur is full of migratory birds. Every day is busy between October and March. By April there are fewer birds here and few tourists come. Winter is the best!
In April, May, June and July I mostly work on the farm, but by August some tourists start to return.
We don't get paid by the government - all the money we make is from guiding visitors. My normal working day ends at 6pm.
There are many rare species here - and some we don't see anymore. I last saw a Siberian crane here in 2001.
There are lots of other rare species too - the Siberian rubythroat is very rare here, and there are nightjars.
You also find the Brahminy starling (Brahminy myna) at Bharatpur. It has the hairstyle of a Brahmin, a holy man, with a yellow body. People joke that Sanjay Dutt the movie star has the same hairstyle.
You can also see spotted owlets - I can make the call of the spotted owlet! It has a brown body and white spots.
I've also seen the Steppe eagle here, as well as booted eagles and greater spotted eagles. You've maybe even got a chance of a marsh harrier.
In birdwatching the call is very important - you have to use the ear and the eye. Without the ear there is nothing. Sometimes you can see a bird just by hearing its sound.
You need hearing, a good eye - and learning.
The long-billed vulture is finished here because of pesticides. The vultures would eat the carcasses of dead cows and be poisoned. The kind of tall trees the vultures went in are also no longer here.
With habitat finished, so are the vultures. There are different species of vultures still in India - at Jim Corbett park and Ramnagar, and about 50km (30 miles) from Bharatpur - and long-billed vultures are at Nainatal. You also sometimes get king vultures there - but the only vulture these days at Bharatpur are Egyptian vultures.
I've got many favourite birds at Bharatpur - painted storks are a very beautiful colour. Flamingoes too. And another one is the pintail, a beautiful duck. and also the common kingfisher.
Professional birdwatchers come here with their lists. Raj Singh is one. He is an ornithologist who was  born at Bharatpur. He is very famous. Different tour companies come too.
Lots of tourists already know the birds, but without the naturalists in the park they get nothing. About 90% of people hire a naturalist, and we are compulsory for groups of more than 10.
I advise that taking a naturalist with you in the park is necessary! With a naturalist you get good information - without a naturalist you get the wrong information.
We get three months of continuous training before we can work here, given by the Indian Forest Service. Every two years, we have to do a refresher course and renew our licence - it takes five days. There is a training charge, and another one to renew the licence.
Sometimes we go with tourists to other reserves in the area - mostly it's English people who come. Bharatpur naturalists are very famous.
Naturalists only charge the government rate.  It costs more if we bring a telescope too - a few of us have our own. You can hire binoculars from the park.
My job makes me very happy - good nature, good oxygen, good environment. And you meet lots of people, some become friends.
I am hopeful about conservation in India. I think there is a new awareness.
