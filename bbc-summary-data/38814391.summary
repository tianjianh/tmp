Truro City have appointed ex-Eastleigh boss Chris Todd as assistant manager following Rory Fallon's departure.

Truro, who are 17th in the National League South, parted company with New Zealand international and player-coach Fallon by mutual consent in December.
Todd joined Truro in October on a short-term playing contract, but will now assist manager Lee Hodges instead.
"It's a challenge that I have accepted with relish and excitement," the former Exeter defender told the club website.
Since being sacked by Eastleigh in August, Todd has opted to take a teaching role, rather than return to professional football.
Meanwhile, the White Tigers have signed Exeter City full-back Connor Riley-Rowe on loan for a month.
The 21-year-old, who has made 14 appearances for the League Two side, has previously had a spell at Treyew Road.
