The two-year-old was found an hour and 45 minutes later after she was tracked via CCTV cameras to a park about three miles away from the Newcastle store.
Sentencing the pair, aged 13 and 14, the judge at Newcastle Crown Court referred to internet searches on a tablet belonging to the younger girl.
These related to topics including children having sex, rape and slavery.
Mr Justice Globe said although the child came to "no actual harm", there had been intent, planning and enticement.

Just before the kidnap, in April, the teenagers, from Tyneside, had shoplifted dummies, baby milk and a bottle. They cannot be named due to their age.
The girls were initially charged with kidnap with the intention of committing a sexual offence but this was dropped after the prosecution accepted a plea to the alternative charge of kidnap.
The judge said the two girls put forward different accounts of the incident, but neither had explained to his satisfaction what actually happened.
He said their accounts "produce more questions than answers", and rejected the proposition they had taken the child "for no reason... with no specific intent".
"I bear in mind no physical harm was caused," he said.
"However, the extensive psychological harm to her mother was devastating. She won't let her daughter out if her sight and won't let her go to nursery,"
He added that it was clear that some aspect of physical or sexual harm or exploitation would have been carried out if the toddler had not been rescued swiftly.
"It was the true reason as to why she was taken. Her [the mother's] fears are well founded."
Mr Justice Globe said the guidelines recommended a five-year sentence and he deducted one third of this because the girls had pleaded guilty.
The initial sentences were three years and four months, but the judge later took off a month after hearing the teenagers had been subject to a curfew since their guilty plea in June.
