Southampton: Ronald Koeman 'vital to keeping star players'

Southampton executive director Les Reed hopes the appointment of manager Ronald Koeman will convince players to stay.

Midfielder Adam Lallana, 26, and left-back Luke Shaw, 18, have been linked elsewhere following striker Rickie Lambert's move to Liverpool.
"I hope the announcement will prick up a few ears and they will think that's a good positive move from the club," Reed, 61, told BBC South Today.
"If players leave, it will be because we believe it is right for the club."
Following Mauricio Pochettino's departure to become Tottenham's new manager and the sale of Lambert, Southampton insisted they would not contemplate any further transfers until a new manager was appointed.
However, with Monday's confirmation that former Dutch defender Koeman, 51, will succeed Pochettino, discussions on the squad for next season will take place over the coming days and weeks.

"We need to sit down, assess and audit our squad and look at the strengths and weaknesses," Reed said.
"We'll look at players that we'd like to bring in and then look at the individual cases of the players who may want to leave."
Lallana and Shaw, both members of England's World Cup squad in Brazil, are reportedly targets for Liverpool and Manchester United respectively.
Reed, who managed Charlton Athletic for six weeks in 2006, said he hoped Lallana would remain at St Mary's for at least another season.
"Lallana's been here long enough, we've brought him to this level and we feel that perhaps he should give it a little bit longer," he added.
"Anybody seriously considering coming for our players are going to have to think very significantly about the size of the fee.
"If we do take money it will be because it's the right amount and it enables us to improve the team and move forward."
