League One side Charlton Athletic have appointed former MK Dons manager Karl Robinson as their new boss.

The 36-year-old left Stadium MK last month after six and a half years in the role and replaces Russell Slade, who was sacked by the Addicks last week.
Robinson has agreed a two-and-a-half-year deal at The Valley and will take charge on Monday.
"Joining such a huge club with a large, passionate fanbase is a really exciting proposition," he told the club website.
Robinson becomes Roland Duchatelet's seventh managerial appointment since the Belgian businessman bought Charlton in January 2014.
Slade was sacked after just 16 league games in charge of the Addicks, with the club 15th in the table. They have won their last two games under caretaker manager Kevin Nugent and are 11th, three points off the play-offs.
Robinson was the third longest-serving manager in the top four divisions of English football before his departure from Milton Keynes, with only Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and Exeter manager Paul Tisdale having been in their posts longer.
He led the Buckinghamshire club to promotion from League One to the Championship in May 2015, but the club spent just one season in the second tier before being relegated.
Charlton chief executive Katrien Meire described Robinson as the "outstanding candidate" to take charge of the south-east London club, who were also relegated from the Championship last season.
"He is a very talented, forward-thinking manager," Meire said.
"Our main focus is bringing Championship football back to The Valley at the earliest opportunity.
"Karl has vast experience of League One and, having won promotion just two seasons ago, we believe he has the necessary credentials to lead the club forward."
Robinson's first game in charge is set to be against his former side MK Dons in an FA Cup second-round tie on Saturday, 3 December.
