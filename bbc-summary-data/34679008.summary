The three-week-old was found close to a public footpath at the back of the beach at Rhosneigr and has since been transferred to a rehabilitation centre.
RSPCA has urged people to keep their dogs away from seal pups.
Inspector Mike Pugh said: "Dog walkers should also be vigilant if they walk their dogs near seal hotspots."
