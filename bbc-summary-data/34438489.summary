Ibrahim Halawa, the son of the most senior Muslim cleric in the Republic of Ireland, was arrested during a siege on the Al-Fath mosque in Cairo in 2013.
The mass trial of Mr Halawa, 19, and more than 400 others began in March. This was his ninth court appearance.
He could face the death penalty if convicted.
Mr Halawa was on a family holiday to his parents' homeland when he and three of his sisters were arrested by Egyptian security forces during a crackdown on protests in the country's capital.
He was 17 at the time.
His family said he had taken refuge in the building during violent clashes between supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi and the security forces.
His sisters were allowed to return to Dublin in November 2013.
In a statement, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Charlie Flanagan said Mr Halawa's lawyers made an application for his release at Sunday's hearing with the Irish Embassy's "support for the application being directly conveyed by the lawyers to the judge".
"We now have to wait for the judge to make a ruling on this application," he added.
Mr Flanagan said he was continuing to remain in contact with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry over the issue.
