Perry Beeches III The Free School, in Ladywood, Birmingham, was put in special measures in 2015.
An Ofsted report at the time said too many students were underachieving and described teaching as "inadequate".
The school's acting chief executive officer Paul Wheeler said the latest report was a "fantastic result".

"Ofsted's "good" assessment is testimony to our dedicated professional staff, who have driven the improvements needed, and to our hard-working students who have embraced the changes necessary to improve our school," said Mr Wheeler.
Ofsted said the leadership and management had been "comprehensively reformed to take the school forward with success and confidence".
When the school was put in special measures, the then chief executive Liam Nolan said he "fundamentally disagreed" with the inspectors.
The school's head teacher, Darren Foreman, its senior leadership team and chair of governors resigned.
Mr Nolan resigned in May 2016, saying he was stepping aside so the trust "can move forward".
The latest inspection was carried out on 25 and 26 January 2017.
The school is part of the Perry Beeches Academy Trust, which runs five schools in the city, and was opened in September 2013.
