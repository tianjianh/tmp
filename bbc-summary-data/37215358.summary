Norwich United defender Andy Eastaugh, on his 30th birthday, was knocked unconscious at Soham Town in a clash of heads with another player.
He was taken to hospital, with his club tweeting later that he had "severe concussion" but no brain damage.
The Ryman League Division One North match was halted after consultation with both managers.
Norwich are managed by Eastaugh's brother Steve.
"Nobody wanted to play after seeing something so traumatic," Soham chairman Stuart Hamilton told BBC Sport.
"We wish him all the very best and a speedy recovery."
The Division One North is the eighth tier of the football pyramid, four divisions below League Two.
