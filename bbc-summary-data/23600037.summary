The spin bowler, who plays for Sussex County Cricket Club, was fined for being drunk and disorderly outside the Shooshh club early on Monday morning.
Sussex Police said a 31-year-old man had received a fixed penalty notice for being drunk and disorderly.
Sussex County Cricket Club said it was investigating the incident.
It said in a statement: "Sussex County Cricket Club can confirm that an incident took place involving Monty Panesar in the early hours of Monday August 5.
"The matter is under full investigation and the club will make no further comment at this stage."
A spokesman for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said the incident was a matter for Panesar's club and the ECB would not be commenting on it.
Simon Hoole, general manager of the nightclub, said: "Unfortunately we can only confirm that there was an incident at that time."
He said the club would not make any further statement because the club valued its customers and their need for privacy.
It is the second drink-related incident involving Ashes players this summer.
In June, Australian batsman David Warner was reprimanded for striking England opener Joe Root in the face during a night out in Birmingham.
Warner missed the first two Ashes Tests against England, but featured in the drawn Test at Old Trafford.
Panesar was part of the 14-man England squad that retained the Ashes at Old Trafford on Monday but did not play in the match.
The left-arm bowler, who has taken 164 Test wickets for England, has not been included in the squad for the next Ashes Test at Durham, which starts on Friday.
