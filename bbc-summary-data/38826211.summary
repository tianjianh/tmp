[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 23-year-old Afghan woman has described to the BBC how her husband tied her up and cut off both her ears in a domestic violence attack in the northern province of Balkh.

The woman - Zarina - is now in a stable but traumatised condition in hospital.
"I haven't committed any sin," she said. "I don't know why my husband did this to me."
The woman's husband is on the run in Kashinda district following the attack, police have told local media.
Zarina told Pajhwok news that the unprovoked attack took place after her husband suddenly woke her up.
She was married at the age of 13, and told BBC that "relations with her husband were not good".
Zarina complained that her husband had tried to prevent her from seeing her parents, she said in another interview, with Tolo News. She said she no longer wanted to remain married to him.
"He is a very suspicious man and often accused me of talking to strange men when I went to visit my parents," she said.
She has demanded his arrest and prosecution.
Her account is the latest in a series of high-profile domestic abuse incidents and cases of violence against women in Afghanistan.
The Afghan government has repeatedly tried to introduce laws to protect women from domestic abuse.
But President Hamid Karzai during his time in power was unable - or unwilling - to sign off legislation even though it had been approved by both houses of parliament.
In 2014, for example, he ordered changes to draft legislation that critics said would severely limit justice for victims.
Mr Karzai's successor, Ashraf Ghani, has also yet to give his assent to legislation passed by Afghan parliament late last year. It was drafted to protect women and children from violence and harassment.
