A man walked into a stranger's house while hunting for monsters playing Pokemon Go, police have said.

He entered a property in Norwich and, when questioned, told officers it was because he was using the gaming app.
It was among 19 Pokemon incidents recorded by Norfolk police in July and August. Assaults, driving offences, noise nuisance and thefts were also logged.
The data was released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act.
Other reports included a motorist driving "erratically" while Pokemon hunting.

And in another, a man's phone was snatched out of his hand while the offender distracted him by talking about the gaming app.
A Safer Neighbourhood Team in King's Lynn has been made aware of monuments in the town being turned into Pokemon gyms.
Complaints have been made in King's Lynn, Hoveton, Norwich, Gorleston and Thetford.
In most of the cases, police officers attended but no action was taken.
Supt Dave Buckley, from Norfolk Police, said: "If any offences are committed whilst playing the game they will be investigated fully and offenders will be dealt with appropriately."
A spokesman for Pokemon Go developers Niantic also urged people playing the game to "abide by local laws".
