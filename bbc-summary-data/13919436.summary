Earlier, Prince Charles visited students, businesses and community projects on a tour of mid Wales.
In Aberdyfi, Gwynedd, he unveiled a new community bell on the village's jetty and meet local businesses.
He was also meeting children and students at the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth, Powys.
Ms Stone, 24, who will intially hold the position of official harpist to the prince for two years, will play a harp given to the prince in 2006 by the Victor Salvi Foundation in recognition of his contribution to the promotion of the instrument.
The post is designed to help celebrate and foster musical talent in Wales, and she takes over from Claire Jones, who was appointed in June 2007.
"I am proud to be promoting the harp, a central part of our Welsh heritage, and to follow the fantastic example set by Claire," she said.
"I am excited to get started and can't wait for the coming months.
"It's a big responsibility. I hope to promote the harp as much as I can in Wales. I intend to make that my full-time job."
Ms Stone played earlier this month at the opening of the fourth Welsh assembly for the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall.
The Guildhall School of Music graduate is currently studying under Caryl Thomas at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardiff.
She made her debut at a reception at the prince's home in Llwynywermod, Carmarthenshire.
Her official debut coincided with a reception to mark the launch of the Cambrian Mountains Ambassadors Scheme.
The project aims to promote rural enterprise, protect the environment and sustainable tourism in mid Wales.
It was launched by the prince, who wants to help sustain traditional upland farms and rural communities.
Before the reception, he visited the seaside village of Aberdyfi to unveil the new jetty bell, which rings at high tide.
He saw beach donkeys and visited local businesses, including a Prince's Trust-assisted jewellers.
He was also due to arrive at the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth, by funicular railway.
The prince supports the eco-centre, which receives more than 55,000 visitors annually.
Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are on their annual week-long tour of Wales, which this year sees them visiting diverse locations from a squirrel conservation project on Anglesey to a Carmarthenshire sock factory.
