[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2013, Dr Habeeb Mohammad Abdul Latheef, 45, of Yeovil, Somerset, was cleared of four counts of sexual assault but the jury failed to reach a verdict on a further three.
A re-trial was ordered and Dr Latheef was cleared of all remaining counts at Taunton Crown Court on Wednesday.
He had denied all the allegations, which were said to have taken place in 2008 and 2011.
