Peake will star as Titania, Lucas will be Bottom and stage star Elaine Paige returns to TV as Mistress Quince.
The former Doctor Who writer has written what is described as a "bold and accessible" adaptation of Shakespeare's play.
It will be shown as part of a new Shakespeare season on BBC One in 2016.
Bernard Cribbins and Richard Wilson will also star in the adaptation as Snout and Starveling respectively.
Also appearing in the cast is John Hannah, as Theseus.
PhoneShop's Javone Prince will play Snug and Fisayo Akinade who starred in  Russell T Davies' Banana and Cucumber will play Flute.
Maxine Peake played Hamlet on stage last year, saying she took the role of the vengeful prince because of a scarcity of great parts for women.
She added she found Shakespeare's female roles "quite problematic".
Russell T Davies said: "This is such an exciting range of actors from stage and screen, from wild comedy to high drama, and some making their first ever appearance on camera. The Dream is coming to life like never before."
The adaptation is described as having "as much attitude and invention as any theatrical interpretation".
It is being aimed at all age ranges, said the BBC, from "children, who can laugh at Bottom and his Mechanicals and marvel at the fairies' awesome powers" to "adults, who know those broken hearts and star-crossed lovers all too well" and "whole families, united in front of the television to enjoy the play's dazzling world of danger, jokes, scares, poetry, thrills and fun."
