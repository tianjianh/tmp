Police have been searching the site in Milton, Cambridgeshire, for five weeks.
Despite a high-profile missing persons campaign, it is thought by police he ended up in a bin lorry.
Mr Mckeague's father Martin said it was "breathtaking" to see how much waste officers have combed through.

He has been to the site five times and is staying in a nearby campsite with his wife Trish.
"It's heartbreaking to think when you are there Corrie could be under foot," he said.
"Everything leads to Corrie being there and when I'm looking at and watching these guys rake through, I know the police wouldn't be here going through all these tonnes of rubbish if they didn't expect Corrie to be there."
Mr Mckeague, from Dunfermline in Fife, vanished while on a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September.
He was last seen on CCTV at about 03:25 BST.
A bin lorry collected refuse a short time later from the area the RAF Honington gunner was last seen.
Suffolk Police said officers were trawling through 60 tonnes a day at the site in Milton, near Cambridge.
The search is now in its fifth week and is expected to take up to 10.
