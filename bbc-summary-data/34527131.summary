Scotland hooker Ross Ford and lock Jonny Gray are free to play with immediate effect after appeals against three-week suspensions were upheld.

The forwards were given the bans for a joint-tackle during Saturday's 36-33 Pool B victory over Samoa.
Both were left out of the team for Sunday's World Cup quarter-final with Australia but Vern Cotter can alter his side up until an hour before kick-off.
Scottish Rugby chief executive Mark Dodson said "justice has been done".
"Ross and Jonny are now free to re-join the tournament, ahead of the biggest game for Scottish Rugby in recent years," he added.
"We find it hugely disappointing they were put in this position by a judicial process, which is inconsistent and unfair. Justice delayed is justice denied.
"It is regrettable that this has overshadowed a massive week for the sport and our focus continues to be on the match against Australia."
The appeals were formally lodged on Friday and heard on Saturday by a committee chaired by Justice Lex Mpati, from South Africa, sitting with Justice Graeme Mew from Canada and Robbie Deans from New Zealand.
Scottish Rugby challenged the length of ban, not the guilty verdict.
And, a statement on the Rugby World Cup website read: "Having conducted a detailed review of all the evidence, including new submissions from the players and their representatives, along with all available camera angles, the appeal committee dismissed the finding that the players had committed an act of foul play as the player had not been dropped or driven and therefore the tackle was not dangerous.
"The players are therefore free to play again immediately."
Australian citing commissioner Scott Nowland charged Edinburgh's Ford of breaching rules on dangerous tackles.
Glasgow Warriors' Gray, meanwhile, was alleged to have committed an illegal tip tackle during the win that clinched Scotland's place in the last eight.
Both players denied committing an act of foul play.
