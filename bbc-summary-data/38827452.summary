Striker Taylor became the first player to join City from Rovers since Trevor Morgan did so in January 1987.
The 26-year-old had been with Rovers since July 2014, scoring 61 goals in 118 league appearances for the club.
"If his mindset's good and strong, there's no doubt our fans will take to him," Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol.
"For me it's purely about the football, of course it is, but I think the player's been very, very brave to make this step across the city.
"It'll be interesting to see and I fully believe that he'll hit the ground running."
