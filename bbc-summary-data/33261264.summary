Lucia Richardson found the metal spike in a burger from Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) in Martlesham Heath on Saturday.
KFC apologised and gave her vouchers. They also asked to meet her and earlier showed her revised kitchen procedures.
The spike was from a brush used to bread chicken. These would now be checked regularly, KFC said.
Miss Richardson, 29, of Wickham Market, said: "I thought at first it was a bone but it wasn't, and I pulled out a bit of metal.
"It was like a Kirby grip - about two-and-a-half inches long. It was a corrugated bristle.
"I  went back into the store and showed them what I had found in my burger. They got their manager, she cleaned it up and apologised profusely."
Miss Richardson said she was not interested in compensation, but concerned about health and safety procedures at the restaurant.
"Thank God it wasn't my niece or any other child," she said.
The manager later contacted her and asked to show her around the kitchen area to "see what they have done as a result of what happened".
"The bristles that are used to fluff up the flour are now being changed every three months instead of six months. It isn't part of their procedure everywhere, but they are doing it in this store now," Miss Richardson said.
"They are also checking the chicken thoroughly before put it into the fryer."
A KFC spokesman said: "We're very sorry that on this rare occasion we failed to meet our usual high standards."
Staff had been reminded to be "extra vigilant", he added.
