An arrested man was lifted off his feet with such force it broke his collarbone, a police misconduct hearing has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Pritchard, 42, had been in the police cells in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, when the incident happened in December 2015.
Sgt Jethro Christie, who was in charge of the custody suite, denies gross misconduct.
He denied using a wrestling-style manoeuvre on Mr Pritchard.
Mr Pritchard, who spent the night in the cells after being arrested for threatening behaviour on Boxing Day, claimed Sgt Christie lifted him up off the floor when he asked him about his son the next morning.
"It happened so quickly," Mr Pritchard told the hearing at North Wales Police head office in Colwyn Bay.
"I can't recall much of my reaction, just being lifted up into the air by him, then another officer grabbed my legs and I was thrown into the cell with a pain in my shoulder."
When questioned by Stephen Crossley, a barrister representing Sgt Christie, Mr Pritchard admitted he could not remember all of the exchange which led to him being restrained.
Sgt Christie told the hearing Mr Pritchard seemed angry and aggressive and approached him "with his chest puffed out".
He said he attempted several different techniques to restrain him but they failed.
"I went for the low level minimal force option first, but he just broke out of that.  He broke out of each technique I put on him," he said.
He denied using a "full Nelson" manoeuvre, similar to that used in wrestling - which involves passing both arms around the opponent's armpits and neck - to restrain Mr Pritchard.
"I've never used that manoeuvre in any sports event or any police event," he said.
Sgt Christie said Mr Pritchard had fallen off the cell bed onto his shoulder. Mr Pritchard earlier denied this was how the injury occurred.
The hearing continues.
