Kilmarnock: Injury worries not derailing Lee Clark's transfer plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Injuries to central defenders have not yet forced Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark to change his January signing targets.

But negotiations with parent clubs over five players who are at Rugby Park on loan could alter his plans.
Kilmarnock presently have two fit central defenders, but two should return for their Scottish Cup fourth-round tie following the winter break.
"In January, we expect Miles Addison and Scott Boyd to be available for the Hamilton cup tie," said Clark.
"We are looking at one or two things, we've already been looking at certain positions and that hasn't changed our mindset.
"If we were to get some kind of setback with those lads' injuries, we might have to reconsider that."
The Scottish Premiership club also have six players who could potentially return to their parent clubs at the end of their loan spells.
Clark signed 17 players, including nine on loan, in a major overhaul of his squad this summer.
Burnley midfielder George Green was the latest to return to his parent club.
The former Everton 20-year-old followed the path of Swansea City goalkeeper Oliver Davies and Stoke City defender Mark Waddington after only four appearances for Kilmarnock.
However, defender William Boyle and striker Florent Bojaj both remain on loan until January from Huddersfield Town, along with Luke Hendrie from Burnley and fellow midfielder Charlee Adams from Birmingham City.
Defender Jonathan Burn is another who is presently sidelined and unlikely to be fit again until after his loan deal with Middlesbrough expires at the start of January.
As well as being injured, there is uncertainty over Boyd's future at Kilmarnock because the terms of his season-long loan from Ross County mean their Premiership rivals have the option of recalling the 30-year-old next month.
"We are not in total control of their destiny," Clark said of the six loan players.
"Even if we want them to stay, it is whether their parent club wants them to stay and whether they want to stay."
Clark had previously stressed that there would be no repeat of the summer overhaul of his squad during the January transfer window.
"Continuity is a big thing," he said when asked if he would like to extend the players' loans.
"The lads have grown into playing for the club, they've grown into the group and progressively we've improved over the course of the first half of the season and all those lads have made a contribution."
