[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belfast City Council defer decision on student housing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belfast City Council Planning Committee have deferred making a decision on a proposed student development on the Dublin Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The committee said it was necessary to visit the site before they could approve or turn down the application.
It is is expected to rule on two other separate applications from different developers on Tuesday evening.
The Dublin Road application caused controversy with 57 objections lodged.
Concerns have been raised by residents in nearby streets who say it will overbear their homes and lead to noise and anti-social behaviour.
However, the planners say the design of the building "should not result in an unacceptable level of overlooking or overshadowing".
Among the three latest applications, one is also on the northern fringe at a site on York Street.
The second application is for a site at McClintock Street/Blackstaff Square, which is due to be developed on behalf of Queen's University.
