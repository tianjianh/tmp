Two of his goals were long-range efforts and coach Dunga said Coutinho had seized his chance.
"He's been acquiring more trust and belief in himself and taking more risks. That's what we wanted," he said.
"We've been encouraging Coutinho during training to be the player he is in Liverpool and he did that for us."

The victory in Orlando moved Brazil level on four points with Peru, whom they play on Sunday.
Coutinho, 23, had previously only scored one goal for his country, in a friendly against Mexico last year.
"We have to keep our focus for the next game. We have to be dreaming about big things, but we also have to prepare well for the next game. Peru is a very strong team," said Coutinho.
