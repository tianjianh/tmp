Nepal 'may fly in fuel' as protests disrupt supplies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) is considering flying in fuel to the landlocked nation as it continues to face a crippling shortage of petroleum products.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Protests in southern Nepal against a newly adopted constitution have seen hundreds of supply trucks from India stuck at the border.
Many Nepalese, however, have accused India of blocking supplies to show its disapproval of the document.
Fuel is now being rationed in Nepal.
Deepak Baral, an NOC spokesperson, told BBC Nepali that the state-owned fuel supplier was "exploring the possibility" of flying in fuel from a "neighbouring country".
As well as India, Nepal is also bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north.
Public anger towards India has been growing in Nepal.
KP Oli, a senior lawmaker tipped to be the next prime minister, has accused India of breaking international law by imposing a blockade.
He denied protesters were blocking roads.
New Delhi has denied the accusations and urged Nepal to defuse tensions  over the constitution in its southern plains.
Clashes between police and protesters have seen more than 40 people killed in recent weeks.
Some minority ethnic groups are unhappy with the new constitution, which creates a federal system they fear will see them under represented in parliament.
