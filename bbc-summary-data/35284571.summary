[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael McDonough, 31, of Pateley Close in Kirkby, Merseyside, admitted fraud by false representation against his former employer Yodel.
Police said while working in payroll, McDonough worked a system that allowed him to duplicate a redundancy payment and pay himself the same amount.
He was sentenced to 32 months in prison at Liverpool Crown Court.
McDonough used eight of his own bank accounts to commit the fraud, police said.
He also paid money into the accounts of family and friends without revealing "the criminal source of the cash".
Merseyside Police launched an investigation after a report was made to Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and internet crime.
The case has taken two years to investigate.
Det Insp Phil Mahon said: "He was trusted to make payments to colleagues and he breached that trust for his own criminal gain."
