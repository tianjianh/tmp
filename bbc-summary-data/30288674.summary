The Surrey town's centre was closed off for several hours on Monday as emergency teams tackled the blaze on the Renshaw Industrial Estate.
Fire crews stayed at the scene overnight and investigators are still waiting to assess where the fire started.
Part of the High Street remained closed on Tuesday but Surrey Police tweeted that the road had reopened.
Surrey's Assistant Chief Fire Officer Steve Owen-Hughes said crews were still in attendance on Tuesday, more than 24 hours on from the blaze.
A structural engineer was also at the scene.
"At the moment the cause isn't known and it's going to be quite difficult until we can get closer in to determine the actual place where the fire started and possibly the cause as well," he said.
Firefighters had spent the night damping down and were there with a "watching brief", he added.
A number of businesses in one unit on the industrial estate in Mill Mead had been completely destroyed, he said.
Repairs had been carried out on gas and electricity supplies and the telephone network, and the focus was now on the industrial unit where the fire started, he added.
"As soon as it's safe to do so, we'll allow businesses to get back in there and keep on trading," Mr Owen-Hughes said.
