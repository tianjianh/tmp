Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong donned goggles, masks and raincoats to brace for a showdown with police.

The activists, including supporters of the Occupy Central movement, are protesting against China's involvement in how Hong Kong's new chief executive will be elected in 2017.
Thousands of protesters took to the streets over the weekend.
Martin Lee, an activist and former legislator, is seen below wearing goggles and a face mask to protect himself against the use of pepper spray by the police. Some activists even wrapped their eye-ware in plastic wrap as an added precaution.
Umbrellas were also used by protesters to shield them from pepper spray.
The protective gear was supplied by volunteers who carried food and water to demonstration areas around the city.
Police threw tear gas canisters into the crowd on Sunday evening in a bid to drive them back.
The standoff between protesters and police brought parts of central Hong Kong to a standstill.
But the tear gas and pepper spray did not deter the protesters...
Police arrested dozens of people on Sunday, with more than 25 people hospitalised for injuries sustained in scuffles with police in riot gear.
Thousands of protesters remained on the streets into the early hours of Monday, threatening disruption to public transport and school closures.
