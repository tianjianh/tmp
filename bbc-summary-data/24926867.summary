Dwr Cymru Welsh Water has submitted a planning application for a depot at the old Hotpoint site in Bodelwyddan.
Meanwhile, the Welsh government has offered financial aid to help a car components firm relocate to the site.
Hotpoint, which once employed 1,000 people, closed in 2009 with 300 job losses.
Dwr Cymru Welsh Water has applied for permission for a depot and offices on the Kinmel Park Industrial Estate which would accommodate staff and contractors.
In a second development, the Welsh government has offered financial aid to help a Denbighshire car components firm relocate to the site, safeguarding 200 jobs.
Earlier this year, Reflex and Allen, which manufactures pneumatic and hydraulic tubing, announced plans to move into the former Hotpoint/Indesit site as part of a scheme to create an "automotive industrial park."
However, the deal with developers Hadleigh Industrial Estates fell through because of funding issues.
In a letter to Vale of Clwyd AM Ann Jones, Economy Minister Edwina Hart wrote: "I am pleased to inform you that Reflex and Allen has recently been offered a non-repayable RBF (Repayable Business Finance) to assist with the purchase of new equipment and fitting-out their proposed new premises in the old Indesit/Hotpoint factory site in Bodelwyddan, securing in the long term 200 jobs."
Ms Jones described it as an "exciting deal," adding: "This is the result of some protracted negotiations.
"We need more high-tech jobs in this area and I hope that other companies will show as much confidence as Reflex and Allen by investing here."
