[SN]TITLE[SN]
Management committees sought for eight village halls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight council-run village halls and community centres in the south-west of Scotland could face closure next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council wants to transfer the properties to local management committees in the final phase of a Â£283,000 savings plan.
Where local people are unable to assume responsibility, halls will be closed.
Buildings at Drummore, Portpatrick, New Luce, Sorbie, Glenlochar, New Galloway, Thornhill and Eastriggs will be affected by the move.
The council wants to transfer the facilities to local committees by 31 January 2016. Where that cannot be achieved, they will be shut at the end of February.
Council officers will work with community groups affected by any closures to find "reasonable alternative accommodation".
Members of the community and customer services committee will be asked to approve the process at a meeting on Tuesday.
