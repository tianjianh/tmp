[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 1-1 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In-form Shay McCartan rescued a point for Accrington with a late free-kick in the draw with fellow mid-table side Grimsby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McCartan, who has now scored seven goals in his last 10 games - five from free-kicks - fired home from 20 yards in the 89th minute to extend Stanley's unbeaten run to 10 games.
Grimsby had looked on course for victory thanks to substitute Akwasi Asante's first league goal.
Asante, who scored 12 goals for Solihull Moors before signing for the Mariners in January, made space for himself on the right of the penalty area before firing the ball home in the 70th minute.
Stanley had hit the woodwork twice prior to that with Hull loan defender Harvey Rodgers firing a long-range effort against a post and Matty Pearson rattling the crossbar with a long-range strike.
Dutchman Asante, a 57th-minute replacement for Scott Vernon, almost claimed a winner in the second minute of added time when he was denied by a superb save from Aaron Chapman.
