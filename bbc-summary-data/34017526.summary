Indesit UK household goods delivery staff strikes planned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 warehouse staff and delivery drivers are staging a series of strikes across the UK after rejecting a 1.5% pay increase.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Indesit UK staff distribute fridge freezers, washing machines, cookers and other household appliances.
They are planning to strike for 24 hours on 21 August; for 48 hours on 27 August and 24 hours on 1 September. Staff are also working to rule.
Italian-based Indesit have been asked to comment but have so far declined.
Depots affected are at Andover; Barnsley; Chepstow; Gateshead; Grangemouth; Hayes in west London; Mallusk  in Newtonabbey, Northern Ireland; Trafford Park  in Manchester; Raunds in Northamptonshire; Sharpness in Berkeley, Gloucestershire; Wednesbury  in the West Midlands and West Thurrock in Essex.
Unite regional officer Mark Plumb said: "They are seeking a substantial increase in their basic pay after years of below inflation pay rises."
As the drivers deliver more than 16,000 items each week across the UK, the strikes will severely disrupt deliveries, he said.
