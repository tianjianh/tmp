Provision for cyclists has improved at a number of councils across Scotland over recent years, a study has found.

Cycling Scotland said the top performing councils were Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife, Clackmannanshire and Aberdeenshire.
Its report found that others still needed to do more in terms of developing infrastructure, resources and leadership.
The study was launched by newsreader and keen cyclist Jon Snow in Glasgow.
Cycling Scotland rated the performance of every Scottish council in their efforts to get more people cycling.
The organisation said all 32 councils participated, with some performing extremely well and others needing a more focused approach.
The 2013 edition of the report follows two previous assessments carried out in 2005 and 2008.
Councils found to have greatly improved their approach to cycle use were Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Highland, North Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire and Stirling.
Mr Snow, who is also president of national cycling charity CTC, said: "Having the right infrastructure is vital to getting people out on their bikes.
"Good quality segregated cycle lanes make cycling safer and give people who are nervous about mixing with traffic the confidence to travel through towns and cities on a bike.
"This type of infrastructure has to be planned, designed and installed at a local level, and so local authority commitment is essential."
Cycling Scotland has called for consideration to be given to cycling across council policies and strategies, including infrastructure, promotion, monitoring and understanding the needs of local cyclists.
Chief executive Ian Aitken added: "I hope that the analysis in the report, along with the areas for development we've highlighted, will support more local authorities to develop local cycling strategies, as recommended in the Cycling Action Plan for Scotland."
