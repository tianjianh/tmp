Paris Cowan-Hall: Wycombe re-sign winger from Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers have re-signed winger Paris Cowan-Hall on loan from Millwall until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cowan-Hall, 25, left Adams Park a year ago, but has played just 11 games in total for the Lions, 10 from the bench.
He had a month with Bristol Rovers at the end of last year, making three appearances without scoring.
"We're delighted to have Paris back with us. We all know what he brings to the team," Chairboys manager Gareth Ainsworth told the club website.
"He's the type of player to get the fans on their feet, running at defenders and creating chances, and I've no doubt that he can recapture the form that he showed us during his first spell."
The London-born forward began his career at Portsmouth and moved to Wycombe after stints with Grimsby, Scunthorpe, Rushden & Diamonds, Woking and Plymouth.
