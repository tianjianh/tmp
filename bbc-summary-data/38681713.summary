M25 killer Kenneth Noye appeals open prison decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Killer Kenneth Noye has launched a High Court battle to be moved to an open prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Noye, 69, murdered 21-year-old electrician Stephen Cameron in a road-rage attack on the M25 in Kent in 1996.
In September 2015 the parole board declined to order his release, but recommended he be transferred to open conditions. That was rejected by former Justice Secretary Michael Gove.
However, a judge will be asked to rule whether that decision was "unlawful".
Noye stabbed Mr Cameron to death then went on the run for two years. He was arrested in Spain and in 2000 sentenced to life, with a minimum of 16 years.
Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Noye, told a hearing earlier Mr Gove had "failed to give proper or adequate weight to the recommendation of the parole board and is therefore unreasonable and contrary to law".
Tom Weisselberg, who is QC for the current Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, said many factors were considered in Mr Gove's decision.
They included Noye's "use of excessive violence" and doubts over any change of attitude to violence, as well as the "risk of absconding posed by the claimant's links to Spain".
It is the justice secretary who ultimately decides if a prisoner should be transferred to open conditions.
