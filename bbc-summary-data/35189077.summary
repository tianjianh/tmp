The charity, which runs the London blue plaques scheme, will be erecting a plaque to Bobby Moore, captain of the team which beat Germany 4-2 at Wembley.
The Battle of Hastings in 1066 and the World War One Somme Offensive in 1916 are also being commemorated.
English Heritage will also mark William Shakespeare's death at 52 in 1616.
The charity said Bobby Moore's blue plaque would be erected at his former home in Barking, east London.
Moore, who captained West Ham United for more than 10 years, won a total of 108 caps for England.
"Birthdays or weddings are often opportunities to remember key events in our own personal lives," said English Heritage chief executive Kate Mavor.
"The same is true of historic anniversaries - they provide a meaningful moment to look back on pivotal points in English history.
"Next year is a particularly rich one for anniversaries - from the Battle of Hastings to William Shakespeare, these events and people from the past left a profound mark on our history and on our lives today."
English Heritage is custodian of more than 400 significant historic sites, including the battlefield believed to be where the Battle of Hastings was fought 950 years ago in East Sussex.
A new exhibition opening in the summer will tell the story of the battle and for the first time, visitors will be able to stand on the roof of Battle Abbey's Great Gatehouse - founded by William the Conqueror on the spot where King Harold died.
The 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare, England's greatest playwright, will be marked at sites including his birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon and The Globe Theatre in London.
Remembering the Somme Offensive, which took place between 1 July November 1916, will be one of the key points in commemorations marking the centenary of World War One.
Plans have been announced for a number of events at home and in France, including a memorial service on the anniversary of the first day of the battle.
