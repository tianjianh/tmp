Family completes Shackleton's abandoned South Pole trek

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relatives of a scientist on Sir Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated Antarctica expedition in 1915 have reached the South Pole 100 years later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The original party was forced to leave the ship Endurance in 1915 after it became icebound.
The family of James Wordie, chief scientific officer, had set out to "complete unfinished family business".
The feat means funds will be raised to digitise Wordie's and other explorers' work papers deposited in Cambridge.
Wordie's diaries and relevant papers by other members of the expedition will be made available for research at St John's College where Wordie was a student, fellow, and later master as well as the Scott Polar Research Institute.
Twelve people, led by explorer David Hempleman-Adams, walked and skied the final leg of Shackleton's intended route to the Pole.
They arrived on 17 December - 100 years and two days after the original party hoped to do so.
The trip was conceived by Tim Holmes and his wife, Alice, who is Wordie's granddaughter.
Speaking from the Antarctic, Mr Holmes said: "It has been a very rewarding trip and very hard at times too, with extreme cold, wind and snow ridges to deal with."
Wordie's detailed volumes capture the spirit, courage and determination of the men trapped in gruelling conditions in Antarctica for nearly two years after setting off in early 1914, he said.
After being forced to abandon ship, the crew drifted on ice floes for several months before reaching uninhabited Elephant Island.
From there, Shackleton and five others made a daring, 800-mile sea crossing to South Georgia from where a rescue was mounted.
