[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Yorkshire trio charged over Makayabella drug plot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three people have been charged in connection with a plot to smuggle cocaine with an estimated street value of £150m into the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The drugs were found on luxury yacht Makayabella after it was stopped off the coast of Ireland in September.
David Webster, 44, Philip McElhone, 29, and Dawne Powell, 56, all from West Yorkshire, have been charged with conspiracy to import cocaine.
All three will appear at Leeds Crown Court on 8 April.
Mr Webster, of Rillmead, Otley, Mr McElhone, of Freemantle Place, Halton Moor, in Leeds, and Mrs Powell were remanded in custody following a hearing at Wakefield Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
Mrs Powell, of Netherfield Road, Guiseley, is also charged with money-laundering.
It is believed the drugs, which came from Venezuela, would have had a street value in excess of £150m.
The Makayabella was intercepted by Irish authorities while investigators also seized a 25ft (7.6m) motor boat called Sea Breeze, moored in Pwllheli, north Wales.
Three men are awaiting trial in Ireland in connection with the seizure.
