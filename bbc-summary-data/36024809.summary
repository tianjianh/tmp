Ah Van, 28, moved to the club in 2012 from Bradford after starting his career at NRL side New Zealand Warriors.
Wales international Dudson, 25, joined last season from Wigan, having previously played for Celtic Crusaders.
Both players have agreed new two-year deals which tie them to the Vikings until 2018.
"When the club approached me to re-sign I was only ever really going to sign here," Ah Van told the club website.
Dudson said: "I feel I have developed as a player within the team and I am looking forward to building on the exciting things that are starting to happen here."
There have been a number of players who have signed new deals with Denis Betts' side in recent weeks, including Rhys Hanbury, Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean.
