Peterborough United 3-1 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough United ended a run of six league games without a win as they came from behind to beat third-placed Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors went in front early on when defender Hayden White stabbed Zeli Ismail's angled drive into his own net.
Chris Forrester levelled after a neat one-two in the box and two goals soon after half-time put Posh on top.
Marcus Maddison slotted home for his sixth of the season and Bury defender Antony Kay put through his own net as he tried to cut out Tom Nichols' cross.
Peterborough's victory lifted them from 13th to eighth, just one point outside the top six, while Bury's defeat was their third in a week.
The home side were all at sea at the back initially and could have conceded a second after White's own goal, although Bury soon lost striker Tom Pope with a rib injury.
But their midfield diamond gradually took control and Shaquile Coulthirst hit the post with a low near-post header before Forrester combined well with Nichols and netted the equaliser.
Maddison ran onto Gwion Edwards' pass to put them in front with an easy side-footed finish and Bury's defence were caught napping again as Nichols retrieved a free-kick and played the ball low into the middle where it came off the sliding Kay's thigh and went in via the crossbar.
