Sunil Narine: West Indies spinner banned for illegal action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Indies off-spinner Sunil Narine has been banned from bowling in international cricket after his action was judged to be illegal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An independent assessment ruled that the 27-year-old from Trinidad bent his elbow beyond the 15-degree limit in all variations of his deliveries.
Narine was reported during this month's third one-day game against Sri Lanka.
He is the number one bowler in the world rankings for one-day and Twenty20 internationals.
An International Cricket Council statement said: "Narine's international suspension will also be recognised and enforced by all national cricket federations within domestic cricket events played in their own jurisdiction."
However, the world governing body added that he may be able to play domestically in the West Indies with the consent of the West Indies Cricket Board.
Narine was twice reported for a suspect action in September and October while playing for Kolkata Knight Riders in the Champions League Twenty20.
He withdrew from the West Indies squad for this year's World Cup in order to spend time remodelling his action.
