A dismembered and badly burnt body found in a suitcase in a lay-by near the Peak District is not a missing RAF serviceman, police say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A murder investigation began when a man's remains were found on Monday just off the A628 at Tintwistle, Derbyshire.
There had been speculation the body was that of Corrie Mckeague, 23, who vanished after a night out in Bury St Edmunds in September.
However, police have said the victim's identity remained unknown.
The force has urged people to get in touch about any missing friends and to think about people they have not have seen for a while.
Post-mortem examinations revealed the remains belonged to a white man under the age of 50, but no DNA matches have been found on the national database.
The cause of death is still unknown.
Assistant Chief Constable Bill McWilliam said: "We are asking our other police forces to check their missing person records but it is possible that this man might not have been reported missing at all.
"We want to hear from members of the public who may have not seen a neighbour, a friend or colleague, or indeed any members of their family recently."
A dedicated phone line went live on Thursday and detectives have received about 30 calls so far.
Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline in Fife, but based at RAF Honington, Suffolk, was last seen on CCTV at about 03:20 BST on 24 September.
He was walking alone, eating fast food, in Bury St Edmunds.
Officers said there had been no positive sightings of him on CCTV despite an extensive search.
His mother believes somebody else must be involved in his disappearance.
