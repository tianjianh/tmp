Assistant manager Chris Davies says Celtic will not resign themselves to battling for third place despite the strength of Bayern and PSG.
"I think we're happy with that," he said. "We've got two massive challenges there in Bayern and PSG.
"Anderlecht are a team we can look to exploit as well."
PSG, who were among the second seeds in the draw and were second in French Ligue 1 behind Monaco, bring with them a familiar face in the shape of the world's most expensive player.
Brazilian forward Neymar was in the Barcelona team that topped Celtic's group last season, but the 25-year-old moved to Unai Emery's Parc des Princes outfit for Â£200m this summer.
Bayern, who have been German champions for five seasons, are the top seeds in the group, while Anderlecht were Belgian champions for the 34th time.
Managed by Carlo Ancelotti, Bayern's squad features a host of German internationals, including Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels, Jerome Boeteng and Thomas Mueller, as well Poland striker Robert Lewandowksi and Netherlands winger Arjen Robben.
Rene Weiler's Anderlecht squad is less well-known but features midfielder Sven Kums, a summer signing from Watford, goalkeeper Matz Sels on loan from Newcastle United and forward Henry Onyekuru on loan from Everton, who have in turn shown an interest in the Belgian side's 22-year-old midfielder, Leander Dendoncker.
This season's campaign will be Celtic's 10th appearance in the group stage and their second under Brendan Rodgers, who joined the club last summer.
They have reached the tournament's last-16 stage on three occasions but finished bottom of a group containing Barcelona, Manchester City and Borussia Monchengladbach last season.
While he realised the Glasgow side would face another difficult task to qualify, Davies said: "The record that Celtic have in the Champions League at home is really strong.
"The feeling straight away, as the names come out, is excitement. We're looking forward to the games."
The Scottish champions came through two qualifying rounds and a play-off this season to reach the 32-team group phase.
"It's a big journey that you have to go on to qualify," said Davies.
"It's great for the city of Glasgow and great for the country.
"Massive credit should go to the players and the manager for qualifying and I think it should never be taken for granted."
Olivier Ntcham, the France Under-21 midfielder who joined Celtic from Manchester City this summer, had special reason to be "very happy" with the draw.
"I'm a supporter of Paris Saint-Germain," he said. "I am very excited. I said to my friend beforehand that I hoped we would play PSG.
"It is always good to play against a big player like Neymar."
Asked if he thought Celtic could qualify, the 21-year-old said: "Maybe. Everything can happen in football.
"For the fans of Paris, they are going to think it is an easy game for them, but in the Champions League we don't have easy games."
Celtic, who were in the fourth pot of seeds for Thursday's draw in Monaco, were in the same Champions League group as Bayern and Anderlecht in 2003-04.
The Glasgow side drew 0-0 with Bayern in Glasgow before the Germans triumphed 2-1 in Munich, while Anderlecht were 1-0 winners at home before losing 3-1 at Celtic Park.
With Celtic finishing third that season ahead of Anderlecht, the group was won by one of PSG's French rivals, Olympique Lyonnais.
The last time Celtic faced PSG in European competition was in the 1995-96 Cup-Winners Cup, with the French side winning 3-0 in Glasgow and 1-0 in Paris.
