Scottish government increases Reston and East Linton station support

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has offered an "unprecedented" level of support towards reopening stations in the Borders and East Lothian.

It has increased its contribution offer for plans for Reston and East Linton from 50% to 60%.
It would see about Â£6m going towards the scheme in the Borders and Â£7m for the East Lothian project.
Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said the Scottish government was a "strong supporter" of the schemes.
"Currently, we fund new stations via the Scottish Stations Fund with central government funding limited to 50%; the balance being matched by contributions from promoters, whether local authorities or private developers," he said.
"Recognising the budgetary pressures facing all parties concerned, I have written to both local authorities outlining my two potential solutions to the current funding shortfall.
"My first option seeks to address the shortfall by increasing the central government contribution to an unprecedented 60%, the second by incorporating the stations within a larger programme of works."
He said that with either option he would be seeking a "long-term commitment" from the councils for "improved connectivity".
