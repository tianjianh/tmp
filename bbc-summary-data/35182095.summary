Indi Weligamag died after her Citroen C1 crashed on the junction 24 slip road near Pensarn, Abergele, at 07:30 GMT on Christmas Eve.
She was taken to hospital but later died.
Esther Turner said: "Unfortunately Indi's husband died in a car accident in 2010."
Mrs Weligamag and her husband had moved to north Wales seven years ago and she worked as a waitress.
Ms Turner, a close friend, said she had continued to make friends in the area after her husband's death.
"She was a very likable person and was always kind and helpful to those she was with," she said.
"She was very dear to us all. Her sudden passing has left us broken hearted in that we will miss such a special person."
