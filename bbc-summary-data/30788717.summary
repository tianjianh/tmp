Police investigating the murder of a man in County Antrim have revisited the scene a week after he was killed, in an attempt to find more witnesses.

Brian McIlhagga, 42, was killed by a masked gang at Riverview Park in Ballymoney just before 22:30 GMT on 5 January.
The father-of-five was dragged from the house, beaten and shot.
Three men, aged 22, 31 and 46, have been questioned by detectives but were later released unconditionally.
The detective leading the investigation said officers had carried out searches and interviewed dozens of people.
"It is my firm belief that there are still people in the community, in Riverview Park, in Ballymoney and in Ballymena who have yet to come forward," said Det Ch Insp Michael Harvey.
"These people may have information about the events of last Monday night, something they saw or heard, or they may have information about Brian McIlhagga or the men who were involved in his murder.
"I would ask them to think about the devastation his death has caused to his immediate family, not least his five children, and his wider circle of friends.
"For as long as those responsible for this attack remain at large, they represent a threat to anyone in the north Antrim area even though it is a largely peaceful community."
A 32-year-old woman and four children under the age of 13 were in the house when Mr McIlhagga was killed. The woman was assaulted by the gang.
The detective said it was a "vicious, brutal and sustained attack on a man who was visiting his friend".
He appealed for anyone who saw or heard anything in the Riverview Park area at the time to contact police.
"I am also still interested in activity around the railway station in Ballymoney which is in the same general area as the house at Riverview Park where Brian was attacked," he said.
