The Birmingham-born 19-year-old could make his Ireland debut in a friendly against the United States on 18 November.
However, he could still opt to play for England until he plays for the Republic in a senior competitive international.
Earlier this week Grealish, capped by Ireland at under-21 level, signed a new four-year deal with Villa.
It is understood Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill met with Grealish and his father in September and was happy for a decision to wait until the player's club future had been settled.
Grealish made his breakthrough with Villa this season, coming on as a substitute in four Premier League matches and playing the full 90 minutes of a Capital One Cup tie.
The midfielder, a product of the Villa academy, spent last season on loan at Notts County.
His grandfather comes from Gort in County Wicklow and, after the Republic's 1-1 draw in Tuesday's Euro 2016 qualifier in Germany, he tweeted: "Come on you boys in green."
On Friday, Dublin-based newspapers the Irish Times and the Irish Independent reported that Grealish was likely to play against the USA.
