The 39-year-old took 577 first-class wickets at an average of 31.80, with 145 of those coming for the Foxes.
He has not played for Leicestershire's first team since April's County Championship game against Glamorgan, a match in which he took 1-141.
"I look back with fond memories of my time," said Shreck.
"I would like to thank everyone that has helped along the way, the umpires for putting up with me and the supporters that stay with you through thick, thin and rain."
