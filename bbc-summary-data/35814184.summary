Premiership: Harlequins 15-21 Worcester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester made it three Premiership wins in a row for the first time since March 2007 with victory at Harlequins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First-half tries from centre Wynand Olivier and an opportunist score from captain GJ van Velze gave the Warriors an 18-9 lead at the break.
A cagey second half saw few clear openings for either side as Ben Botica and Tom Heathcote exchanged penalties.
Harlequins missed the chance to climb into the top four while Worcester look almost certain to avoid relegation.
Controversy surrounded Van Velze's try towards half-time when an assistant referee appeared to raise his flag on the halfway line for a Worcester line-out.
Harlequins winger Henry Cheeseman had just managed to stay in touch though and the assistant quickly lowered his flag.
Some players stood still and waited for the whistle, but Worcester's Van Velze took advantage of the loose ball and the sudden space to race clear unopposed.
Referee Craig Maxwell-Keys let the try stand, but Quins never recovered from the setback.
Conor O'Shea's side failed to find a way through a stubborn Warriors defence and Ben Botica's five penalties were all they had to show for their efforts.
Worcester's sixth win of the season took them to 30 points - 17 ahead of bottom-placed London Irish, who host Gloucester on Sunday.
