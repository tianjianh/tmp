The former Sweden under-17 international, 24, joins from Norwegian third-tier side Hamarkameratene.
Mbamba, who began his career at Swedish top-flight club IFK Gothenburg, has signed a two-year contract.
He made his debut for Vale in their 4-0 pre-season friendly win over Newcastle Town on Saturday.
Mbamba is the latest recruit at Burslem as new boss Bruno Ribeiro continues his overhaul of the playing squad.
Ribeiro, who replaced Rob Page on 20 June, has already brought in Curacaoan striker Rigino Cicilia, Dutch defenders Kjell Knops and Calvin Mac-Intisch, French midfielders Quentin Pereira and Anthony de Freitas and Portuguese trio Paulo Tavares, Kiko, and Carlos Saleiro.
"I'm very happy that we've got one more player to help us," Ribeiro told BBC Radio Stoke.
"Now I have a good squad and I'm waiting on two more players to maybe come in on loan. If not, I'm happy with how it is."
Meanwhile, Vale have announced that current Rochdale chief executive/secretary Colin Garlick is to join the club at the beginning of October.
Garlick will work alongside chairman Norman Smurthwaite at up-for-sale Vale.
