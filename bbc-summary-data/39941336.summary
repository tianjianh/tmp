[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leicester machine death inquest hears of 'prior accident'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The factory where a worker died after being hit by a piece of machinery had a similar accident years earlier that went unreported, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tarsem Singh, a 52-year-old father of two, died after being injured at Nylacast Engineering Plastics Solutions in Leicester in 2016.
A former employee said he was hit by a machinery end cap in 2010 or 2011.
Sukhwinder Singh said "a form was filled out" but a company spokesman said the accident was not recorded.
Mr Singh told the Leicester assistant coroner that when he tried to open an end cap on a plastic moulding machine, it came out "very forcefully" and hit his hand.
The cap then flew "right across the factory floor" although he was not seriously injured, the jury was told.
The firm's general manager Damien McCormack, who was not at the firm at the time of the earlier accident, said there was no record of the episode.
Mr McCormack said Tarsem Singh's injuries were caused when he removed an end cap on a "long length rod machine" and it struck him in the chest.
He said the cap would have come off "very fast under pressure" and there were no "fail safes" to prevent an operator removing the end cap if it was under high pressure.
Mr Singh was an experienced machine operator who had worked at the firm for 23 years.
The inquest continues.
