Art, design, fashion, science and technology will be showcased in the new space at the Edinburgh museum.
More than 3,000 objects will be on display in the galleries, ranging from a bionic hand to ornate furniture.
Around three-quarters of the artefacts have not been exhibited in over a generation.
The redevelopment marks the 150th year of the national museum in Edinburgh's Chambers Street and it is part of an Â£80m masterplan to transform the building.
The latest stage of the project restores the original Victorian layout and sightlines, but with modern interpretation.
A network of digital labels, audio visual programmes and interactive exhibits have been installed as part of the upgrade.
Science and technology will be the focus of six new galleries and a dramatic atrium in the west wing of the building.
Early aircraft, a three dimensional print of the human brain and Dolly the Sheep are among the items going on display.
Art and design will be showcased in four new galleries at the heart of the museum.
Curators said the collection represents creativity and innovation in sculpture, metalwork, ceramics, glass, furniture, woodwork, dress and textiles.
A new gallery dedicated to fashion and style will feature historic material and the work of eminent designers such as Jean Muir, Mary Quant, Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood.
