[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A patient at Morriston Hospital in Swansea has tested negative for Ebola, Public Health Wales has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A sample was taken as a precaution because the patient has a history of travel in west Africa, where almost all of the recent deaths have occurred.
Dr Marion Lyons, PHW director of health protection, had already said it was "unlikely" the patient had the disease.
The virus has killed more than 6,800 people this year but no cases of Ebola have been diagnosed in the UK.
Earlier, Ms Lyons said: "Based on our established evidence-based risk assessment protocol, we are confident that all appropriate actions are being taken to ensure there is no risk to public health.
"It is important to remember that there has never been a case of Ebola diagnosed in the UK and the infection can only be transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.
"We have advised all frontline medical practitioners dealing with patients to be alert to signs and symptoms of Ebola in those returning from affected areas. Following such advice we would expect to see an increase in precautionary testing.
"Should there be a positive case in Wales, this information will be made available to the public."
