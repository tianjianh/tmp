A flood protection scheme in the south of the Isle of Man will cost £2.3m, according to the Manx government.

The work in Castletown, which received planning permission last year, will get under way on 8 May, and could take nearly 10 months to complete.
In January 2014 homes and businesses in the area were badly hit by widespread flooding and storm damage.
Reinforced concrete walls will be built at the edge of the harbour to combat further flooding in several streets.
Infrastructure Minister Ray Harmer said: "Climate change is making weather events of this nature a more frequent part of our lives.
"Castletown is one of the locations most at risk and we have prioritised a scheme around the harbour to protect people's properties and livelihoods."
