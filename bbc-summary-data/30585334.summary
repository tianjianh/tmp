Has one of Australia's greatest sporting mysteries been solved?

A bodysuit thought to be the one Cathy Freeman wore when she lit the 2000 Olympic flame in Sydney has turned up 14 years after going missing.
The suit vanished from the 400m gold medallist's dressing room after the opening ceremony and was thought either stolen or accidentally removed.
The garment was mailed anonymously to the National Sports Museum last week but has yet to be authenticated.
The moment aboriginal athlete Freeman lit the Olympic cauldron is seen by many as a statement of reconciliation with indigenous Australians.
The returned suit has been sent for forensic testing after being handed in at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), which houses the National Sports Museum.
A statement from the Australian Olympic Committee said: "We are hoping the item of clothing handed to the Museum is authentic and the mystery is finally solved."
An Athletics Australia spokesperson added: "It is a very iconic Australian moment, and Catherine's involvement was a very proud moment for a true champion of our sport."
