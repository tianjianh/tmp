They tell BBC producer Tammi Walker and Evening Standard columnist Rosamund Urwin singing is not only a great opportunity to perform but is also a good way to engage with other colleagues and leaders in the company.
Isha, on the left, works in human resources runs the bank's choir. She says singing with her colleagues and performing in front of them gives her courage.
Bridget, on the right, works in finance, says "pushing the boundaries" gives her confidence.
