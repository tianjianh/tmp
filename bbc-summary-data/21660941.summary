Worcestershire have signed New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram for this summer's Twenty20 campaign.

Oram, 34, who retired from Test cricket in 2009 after winning 33 caps, was released from his central contract with the Kiwis last December.
Sri Lanka's Thilan Samaraweera is scheduled to be Worcestershire's overseas player for the whole season.
He should now be joined by Oram for the county's opening FL t20 game on 28 June against Glamorgan at New Road.

"I have never played county cricket. It has always been a goal of mine," said Oram.
"The opportunity to play for Worcestershire in this season's Friends Life t20 was something I could not turn down.
"Another attraction to Worcestershire was the chance to play at New Road.
"I have played a few games there for New Zealand, in 2004 and 2008, as well as the New Zealand youth team in 1996.
"It's a beautiful ground and one that I will be privileged to call home, at least for a month."
Oram now only plays T20 cricket, reaching 99 appearances when he helped Chittagong Kings to the third preliminary final of the Bangladesh Premier League three weeks ago.
He looks set to reach his century during the forthcoming Indian Premier League season, in which he is part of the Mumbai Indians franchise.
He has also played 160 one-day internationals and 36 Twenty20s for New Zealand, his most recent appearance for the Black Caps having come against Sri Lanka last November.
"I've admired Jacob's all-round qualities for some time now and his Twenty20 experience, which he has gained from global competitions, is a major plus factor," added Worcestershire coach Steve Rhodes.
"He can bowl at the start, middle or end of the innings and can clear the ropes as a batsman."
