[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Premiership: Hamilton Academical 0-4 Kilmarnock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock produced a huge performance to thump Hamilton Academical and move to within four points of their hosts in the battle to avoid a play-off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Accies were claiming that the ball had already gone out of play when Greg Kiltie cut across goal and fired his side into an early lead.
Kiltie then played a one-two at the edge of the penalty box with Kris Boyd before providing the finish.
A Boyd penalty and a Josh Magennis strike added pain for hapless Hamilton.
The third-bottom hosts, who could have guaranteed their place in the Premiership next season with their third straight victory, were poor throughout.

But Kilmarnock, sitting a place behind, were dominant from the off and fully deserved the three points.
The result not only narrows the gap between the sides with three games left to play but also means that Dundee United can be relegated on Monday night against city rivals Dundee.
Kilmarnock came flying out of the blocks and a cross from Craig Slater went into the box, Hamilton defender Michael Devlin miscued his header and it rebounded off his own bar.
The ball fell to Kiltie, but the midfielder's shot was brilliantly saved by Michael McGovern.
Kilmarnock would make their early momentum pay, albeit with a slice of controversy.
Kiltie cut in from the left wing before arrowing a superb shot into the top corner with the Hamilton players complaining to the referee that the ball had gone out of play in the build up.
It would get even better for Kilmarnock - and Kiltie. A perfectly judged through ball from Boyd found the young winger, who showed real composure to finish well past McGovern. A hint of offside, but again the goal stood.
Accies saved their best move of the half right until the end. A shot from Ali Crawford from eight yards out forcing a one-handed save from goalkeeper Conor Brennan.
Another moment of controversy came in the second-half. Lucas looked to accidentally strike the ball with his arm in a jostle with Magennis, but the assistant referee put the flag up for a penalty.
Boyd showed no mercy from the spot and Kilmarnock went close to extending the lead when Rory McKenzie's chip from the edge of the box sailed just over the top corner.
Magennis then had the ball in the net, finishing well at the far post, but the flag was up for offside.
However, the Northern Ireland forward would get his goal eventually, firing in a low shot that McGovern was unable to stop from squirming over the line.
