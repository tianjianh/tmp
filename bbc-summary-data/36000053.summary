"The accident meant the motorway was closed, making travel to Mourneview Park impossible for the team and fans travelling from Belfast," said the Irish Football Association.
A new date for the match has yet to be confirmed by Uefa.
Northern Ireland have three points from their first two Group Six qualifiers.
