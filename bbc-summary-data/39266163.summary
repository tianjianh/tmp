The National Records of Scotland had already revealed that Jack and Olivia were the top names for boys and girls.
The complete list shows that Arlo jumped 100 places to 94th on the boys' list and Arthur went up 65 places to 86th.
For girls, Lillie went up 70 places to 90th where it was equal with Florence, which rose 52 places.
The 68 babies called Arlo last year, up from 28 in 2015, share their name with an 11-year-old Apatosaurus in the film The Good Dinosaur, released at the end of 2015.
Other boys' names showing a rise in popularity include Finn (up to 34), Theo (up to 44), Jude (up to 46), Hamish (up to 58), Carter (up to 70) and Conor (up to 98).
For girls the biggest risers in the top 100 were Zara (up to 38), Emilia (up to 41), Phoebe (up to 71), Alexandra (up to 82) and Violet (up to 89).
Thousands of children were given names which they shared with no other babies last year.
Unique names include Bellatrixx, Cleopatra, Gift, Gypsy, Hermione, Journey, Jupiter, Ocean, Paloma and Persephone for girls.
Diamond, Harley-Davidson, Michelangelo, Nero, Odysseus and Rocky were all names given to one boy each.
Drake, one of the bestselling pop stars of 2016, had just one boy who shared his name in Scotland.
That was the same number as legendary rock 'n' roller Elvis. There was also one boy called Presley.
And in the year that pop chameleon David Bowie died, there was one boy named Bowie.
There were 56 girls called Summer, 22 called Autumn and one called Winter, although there were three with various spellings of Winter-Rose. There were no children named Spring.
Despite the electoral popularity of Scotland's first minister, only 10 girls were named Nicola last year.
However, this was much more popular than the prime minister's name and those of other prominent politicians.
There were two Theresas, five Ruths, one Keziah (none without the H), one Boris and not a single Nigel.
There were just seven boys named Donald in Scotland last year.
