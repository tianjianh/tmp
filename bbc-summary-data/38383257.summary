Huddersfield Town boss David Wagner has turned down an offer to manage Bundesliga side Wolfsburg.

BBC Radio Leeds reports the German club approached Wagner on Monday, but the former USA international rejected the offer on Tuesday.
The 45-year-old ex-Borussia Dortmund second-team coach took over at the Terriers in November 2015.
Town, who have won their last three games, are fourth in the Championship, 10 points behind leaders Newcastle.
"There have been a lot of rumours around my future in the media and although I don't believe I should be the story, I cannot stay silent on this matter," Wagner said.
"It is correct that there has been interest from a few Bundesliga clubs. They have obviously seen the way we are going at Huddersfield Town and the journey we have been on together over the last 12 months.
"It's important for me to clarify that my focus is on moving forward at Huddersfield Town."
Huddersfield led the table in October and have been one of the surprise packages of the campaign, having finished 19th last season.
Wolfsburg, who reached the Champions League quarter-finals last season, are 15th in Germany's top flight.
Wagner has previously been linked with managerial vacancies at Championship rivals Aston Villa and Bundesliga club Ingolstadt this season.
"Huddersfield Town may not be a Bundesliga club or one that plays in European competition, but make no mistake - we are a serious, proud, ambitious club with a rich history," chairman Dean Hoyle said.
"Perhaps this isn't clear to some of our colleagues in the media in Germany considering the tone of some articles that were published over the last 48 hours.
"We are not to be toyed with or dismissed out of hand. We have values and always conduct ourselves in the right manner; something that cannot be said for other clubs.
"I think David's ongoing commitment to Huddersfield Town is testament to this club and its standing. He's turned down several advances from Bundesliga clubs during his time here, the latest coming very, very recently."
The Terriers are next in action when they host Nottingham Forest on Boxing Day.
