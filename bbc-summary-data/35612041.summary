[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An internal investigation will be carried out at NHS Kernow - the organisation which commissions health services in Cornwall.
Joy Youart has been suspended from her post as managing director.
NHS Kernow did not confirm the identity of the suspended member of staff and said no wrongdoing was implied.
In December, NHS England ordered NHS Kernow to produce a recovery plan as it was heading for a year-end deficit of £14m.
NHS Kernow, which has a budget of £700m for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, buys health services on behalf of patients.
Dr Iain Chorlton, chairman of NHS Kernow, said: "We can confirm that a member of staff has been suspended while an internal investigation takes place.
"This is in line with standard procedure and does not imply any wrongdoing."
The reasons for the suspension are not clear.
The annual report of NHS Kernow for 2014-2015 shows Ms Youart's salary as £150-£155,000.
Dr Chorlton said the work of NHS Kernow would continue as normal and not affect patient care.
A spokeswoman for the legal firm Withers which is representing Ms Youart, said she had not had an opportunity to speak with NHS Kernow about the internal investigation and was "disappointed to be suspended from the valuable work that she does there".
The spokeswoman said Ms Youart said she was pleased NHS Kernow "has confirmed that the suspension does not imply any wrongdoing".
A spokesman for NHS England said it would "not be appropriate to comment" on an employment matter for NHS Kernow.
