More than 50,000 people are expected to flock to this year's Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open, which starts on Wednesday.
Council officials said the event would allow hundreds of millions of people to see Gullane from around the world.
There will be no public parking at the course. A free park and ride will get people to the event and a free bus from North Berwick Railway Station.
Jonathan Brown, East Lothian Council's tourism projects officer, said: "It's massive for us. We spend a lot of money and effort promoting East Lothian as a golf destination but when something of this size comes, its massively important for us.
"Not only are we looking at £1.8m spent by the visitors but also the fact that hundreds of millions of people across the world will see this on TV and especially in America where it will go out live on NBC.
"The four days are obviously massively important to us in bringing those 50,000 people to East Lothian but we look at it as a far longer term investment for us in that there is a massive legacy from an event like this."
Robert Dick, captain of Gullane Golf Club, said: "It's a fantastic opportunity to impress. We are delighted and thrilled to have the event coming here.
"We want to make this week the best possible week for everybody, for the players, spectators and the members."
