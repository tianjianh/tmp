Scotland loose-head prop Alasdair Dickinson has signed a three-year contract extension at Edinburgh, running until the summer of 2019.

The 32-year-old - who earned his 50th cap during the World Cup - returned to his first club in 2013 after spells with Gloucester and Sale.
Dundee-born Dickinson said it was "an easy decision", adding: "It was my first club, I feel at home here."
Lock Ben Toolis has signed a new two-year deal until the end of 2017-18.
The Australia-born 23-year-old joined the club with twin brother Alex in 2013 and earned a full pro contract in 2014.
Capped once from the bench for Scotland during this year's Six Nations, he missed out on selection for the World Cup, having been in the extended training squad.
Toolis picked up an elbow injury against Treviso in September and returns to the bench this weekend against Glasgow, while Dickinson misses out with a calf problem.
"I can't stop thinking about getting back out on the field," said Toolis.
"Having an injury second game into the season was frustrating. I've worked really hard to get back, especially to be back for these two derby games.
"I'm happy and proud to be back on the bench this week and hopefully get good game time and kick on from there."
