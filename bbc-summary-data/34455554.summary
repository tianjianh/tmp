New car sales in Scotland rose last month despite "challenging" market conditions, according to trade figures.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said new registrations rose 4% year-on-year, to more than 43,500.
Fife, Lothian, Strathclyde and Tayside all showed growth, while the biggest falls were seen in the Borders and Grampian areas.
For the UK as a whole, new sales reached their highest level for September on record.
Scottish Motor Trade Association chief executive Sandy Burgess said: "We are now seeing some movement in the business car registration numbers which will help to maintain the activity for the coming months as this has been quite quiet to date.
"Dealers have reported that the conditions in the month were 'challenging'.
"But the fact that such a level of growth has been recorded despite the controversy that was raised in the middle of the month with the VW emissions issue, it is obvious that the active marketing and strong incentives have maintained the momentum which should mean that 2015 will finish ahead of 2014."

Commenting on the figures, Euan Murray from Barclays Corporate Banking said: "September is always a crucial month for the motor industry, and following a difficult couple of weeks, this positive data will rightly be welcomed.
"However, we need to ensure that increasing registrations really do translate to good results in the showrooms and forecourts.
"Margin pressure is a growing concern for some dealers, and finding the right formula to ensure that the whole industry continues to succeed is going to be vital in the final part of 2015."
In a separate development, major car dealer Arnold Clark Automobiles reported a sharp rise in turnover and profits for 2014.
In accounts filed with Companies House, the Glasgow-based company posted an 11% rise in turnover, to Â£3.27bn, with pre-tax profits at almost Â£107.3m - up from Â£85.1m in 2013.
New car sales underperformed the UK market, rising by 3.1% to 91,477 units, while used vehicle sales rose by 10.8% to nearly 158,400.
The company said a record performance by its vehicle management and daily rental business "significantly contributed" to the group's results.
However, chairman Arnold Clark warned that the company anticipated that 2015 would be "a more challenging year" than 2014.
