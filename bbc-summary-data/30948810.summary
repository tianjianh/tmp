Twitter tells users to stop posting Instagram links

It's either a helpful tip for people with a big following or the latest blow in the battle between two social networks.

Twitter has sent some high profile users a message, suggesting they stop posting photos from Instagram.
As reported by Mashable, the alert suggested posting photos directly to Twitter would ensure "your fans always see them".
Instagram photos have not been viewable within tweets since 2012.
The in-app alert featured a fake "superstar" account showing a link from Instagram and a photo posted directly to Twitter, appearing within the tweet itself.
Instagram's move to stop allowing its posts to be seen within tweets in December 2012 was seen as an attempt to drive more traffic to its own app.
At around the same time, Twitter began offering filters and photo editing features of its own.
The latest move by Twitter could suggest an attempt to draw celebrities away from its Facebook-owned rival.
Instagram announced in December 2014 that it now has 300 million active monthly users compared to Twitter's most recent count of 284m.
It is also a reminder of Twitter's growth as a multimedia platform.
Multiple photos can be posted within tweets and YouTube links appear as embedded video.
Twitter is also planning to allow users to post video from within its app alongside its short-form video sharing app Vine.
With many celebrities attracting a big following across social media, Twitter is clearly attempting to position itself as the first choice for their photos.
