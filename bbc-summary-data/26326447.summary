[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work to build a cycle track in Derby cannot resume until a judicial review is carried out, a judge at the High Court in London has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derbyshire Wildlife Trust took legal action after Derby City Council approved the track, to be built on part of the Sanctuary nature reserve.
The trust said the development would damage the habitat of rare birds.
An interim order to stop work was issued last week and will remain in place until the judicial review.
Mrs Justice Lang said all equipment had to be moved from the site and the judicial review must take place within the next three months.
Tim Birch, conservation manager at the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, said: "We are relieved to have got through this latest step in our fight to save the Sanctuary Local Nature Reserve.
"We believe that the development of this local nature reserve sets a very dangerous precedent both locally and nationally which is why we are challenging the decision of Derby City Council to destroy it."
The judicial review will look into the legality of Derby City Council's decision to approve the cycle track.
No-one from the authority was available for comment.
The Sanctuary, which lies close to the Pride Park football stadium, was given the go-ahead by the council in 2003.
Threatened bird species including skylarks and lapwings are visitors to the site, according to conservation managers.
