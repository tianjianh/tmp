[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woman jailed for 'trying to boil' her Peterborough husband

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who tried to "boil her husband" by pouring scalding water over his head moments after they agreed to divorce has been jailed for four years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ken Gregory, 65, from Peterborough, suffered first and second degree burns to 14% of his body in April last year, leaving him scarred for life.
Former special constable Teresa Gilbertson, of Hayes, west London, was found guilty of grievous bodily harm.
The 60-year-old showed "no remorse", Peterborough Crown Court heard.
Mr Gregory met Gilbertson seven years ago after the death of his first wife of 30 years, Maureen.
On the day of the attack, Mr Gregory planned to visit his first wife's grave as it was her birthday, but instead he and Gilbertson argued and agreed to divorce.
She went to make a cup of tea but returned with a jug of boiling water which she poured over his head from behind.
Prosecutor Thomas Brown told the court the attack had been a "very deliberate attempt to boil her husband".
Her anger was sparked by underlying financial difficulties, the court heard.
Gilbertson had been demanding money for doing housework and to buy cars.
Mitigating, Roger Harrison said Gilbertson had been provoked by Mr Gregory suggesting they divorce.
She maintained the scalding water incident had been an accident.
During sentencing Judge Peter Murphy described it as a "very sad case" but said he saw "no trace of remorse" in her.
She was also handed a seven-year restraining order preventing her approaching Mr Gregory.
The couple are in the process of getting divorced.
Earlier this month, Mr Gregory spoke about the incident and agreed to show his scars to encourage other male victims of domestic violence to come forward.
