A 28-year-old man has been committed to a secure hospital after admitting killing a Danish tourist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewes Crown Court heard tattoo artist Jan Jensen's body was found in Kayden Smith's flat at Belmont Close, Hassocks on 9 August.
A post mortem examination showed the 52-year-old had suffered a single stab wound to his chest.
Smith had admitted manslaughter through diminished responsibility and was given an indeterminate hospital order.
He will be held in a secure unit under Section 41 of the Mental Health Act.
Smith and Mr Jensen had met a few days before the stabbing as voluntary patients at Langley Green Hospital, in Crawley.
It is believed the 52-year-old died shortly before police arrived. A knife was recovered at the scene.
Det Ch Insp Ian Pollard said it was a "tragic case" with both men suffering from mental health problems.
He said: "Clearly, Smith was suffering severe delusions and in the early afternoon of Thursday he stabbed Jensen who police officers found dead, sitting in a chair.
"The death has left Mr Jensen's family in Denmark deeply distressed.
"The exact motive for his travel to the UK, where he arrived at Gatwick and went to London before coming back to Gatwick a couple of days later, will never be clear.
"But the tragic outcome has robbed them of their loved one and our thoughts are with them at this time."
