Full-on training and speaking your mind is behind Leicester Riders' 14-game winning run, according to Taylor King.

The BBL leaders eased into the BBL Trophy final with a 175-135 aggregate win over Cheshire Phoenix.
King told BBC Radio Leicester: "We have a great attitude in training. We do a great job. It starts in training when we try to kill each other!
"We know what we have to do. They are intense and competitive and that is why we're playing so well."
Riders are four points clear of Newcastle Eagles in the BBL table, having won 20 of their 22 games so far.
Close-season signing King says BBL coach of the month for February Rob Paternostro continues to lead from the front.
"He's the best coach in the game and the league right now," the 28-year-old forward added.
"At the beginning of the season we had a lot of new faces and we went through a low where we lost a couple of games in a row [three out of four in November], but since then we have really come together as a team.
"We are on a little bit of a roll with 14 in a row. We are playing really good basketball, coming in each day and making sure we take care of business - on and off the floor.
"Our defence is what is winning games at the moment. Our captain Tyler Bernardini and Drew Sullivan demand a lot of our team-mates. If a guy is not doing his job, we make sure they know."
