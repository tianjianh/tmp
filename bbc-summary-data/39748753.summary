The Irish province ran in five tries, Darren Sweetnam crossing twice, and Simon Zebo, Alex Wootton and Jack O'Donoghue all scoring for Munster.
Tyler Bleyendaal added nine points, with three conversions and a penalty.
David Odiete and Jean-Francois Montauriol touched down for the Italians, who stay ahead of Zebre in the race for a Champions Cup place.
Munster will entertain Connacht in their final game of the regular season on 6 May, with Treviso travelling to play Zebre.
It was a scrappy opening quarter at the Stadio Monigo with neither side able to dominate proceedings from the off.
Fly-half Bleyendaal, captain for the day after Billy Holland injured himself in the warm-up, kept the Italian outfit pinned in their own half but the visitors regularly coughed up possession.
The breakthrough came after 20 minutes when hooker Rhys Marshall broke the line and chipped over the Treviso defence, the bouncing ball popped up kindly for the supporting Donnacha Ryan who was stopped short of the line.
A few phases later, Munster made the most of numbers out wide and winger Sweetnam dotted down in the corner to open the scoring.
Minutes later, Munster powered their way up to the Treviso 22 and, just when they were starting to be pushed back by the Italian side, Bleyendaal put Zebo through a gap and the Irish full-back raced away to score with the Kiwi fly-half adding the extras.
And on the stroke of half-time, Bleyendaal was again on hand to extend Munster's lead to 15 points after the men in red won a penalty at the line-out.
The hosts rallied shortly after the break but a smart line break was followed up by a superb covering tackle by Zebo to keep the Italians out.
But Treviso full-back Odiete found a way through the red wall to put the Italian side on the board - fly-half Ian McKinley adding the extras.
The game became tense and neither side dominated possession in the 15 minutes that followed until Bleyendaal found good field position and Munster went direct.
A series of pick and goes shattered the Treviso ruck defence and tied in the Italian defenders, Francis Saili found replacement Wootton who crossed the whitewash in the corner - Bleyendaal failed to convert from a tight angle.
And number eight O'Donoghue sealed the win as he scored Munster's fourth try to ensure the visitors would return to Limerick with all five points.
O'Donoghue showed his power by handing off a Treviso defender and breaking away for the score to put Munster out of sight, Bleyendaal's conversion putting the Irish outfit 27-7 ahead.
Sweetnam added his second in the last 10 minutes when he arrived first to dive over the line having chased down his own kick.
Treviso had the final say when replacement Montauriol burrowed over in the last play.
