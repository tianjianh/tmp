A man who "smashed" his way into the home of a bed-ridden pensioner in Denbighshire has been jailed for nine years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ynyr Ial Lewis, of St Asaph, admitted aggravated burglary in Rhyl and a separate burglary at a Kinmel Bay pub.
He implicated two other men in the case but they were later cleared.
Mold Crown Court heard the victim, a 72-year-old man with cancer, is now fearful of living in his home of 36 years.
One of the three men was said to have links to the victim and believed a large amount of money was in his home.
There was a struggle in the house and a neighbour who attempted to intervene was hit on the head, requiring 12 stitches.
The court heard the three men, who had been carrying poles and a knife, got away with Â£3,000 which had never been recovered.
Judge Niclas Parry told Lewis, 36, he had taken part in a burglary which had "every conceivable aggravating feature to it".
He said he accepted Lewis had mental health issues but added that much of his issues related to his drug taking.
Lewis was jailed for eight years for the aggravated burglary and 12 months for the pub burglary, to run consecutively.
DC Dave Smith, of North Wales Police, said: "Those who commit domestic burglaries must realise there is consequence to their actions and if found guilty can expect a significant period of imprisonment."
