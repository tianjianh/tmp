[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A murder victim, whose body was found in a County Tyrone garage last week, has been named as Gediminas Stauskas.

It is understood he may have been tortured before he was killed.
The 32-year-old, originally from Lithuania, was found dead at the property on the Moor Road, near Clonoe, shortly after 13:00 BST on Thursday.
Mr Stauskas had a violent past, having been jailed for five and a half years for the 2011 manslaughter of a fellow Lithuanian, Audrius Aukstuolis.
The two men had arranged to meet for what was effectively a duel in a busy car park in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and both were armed.
Mr Stauskas had a knife, while Mr Aukstuolis had a screwdriver, although he had apparently asked a workmate for a hammer just before the fight.
Only one blow was struck, by Mr Stauskas with the knife. It pierced Mr Aukstuolis' heart and killed him.
Mr Aukstuolis was a bodybuilder who had been charged with a very serious sexual assault and kidnapping.
The dispute between the two men began after Mr Stauskas' girlfriend was appointed as Mr Aukstuolis' interpreter as he faced those charges.
The bodybuilder allegedly became infatuated with the interpreter and continued to pursue the woman despite being rebuffed.
The 2012 manslaughter trial was told that Mr Aukstuolis wanted her boyfriend out of the way and made threats to kill Mr Stauskas.
The two men began sending each other abusive and threatening text messages, which escalated into a challenge to a fight with knives.
The murder of Mr Stauskas was not the only violent incident involving an eastern European in the County Tyrone area last week.
On Wednesday, a man in his 30s was beaten and shot not far from the shed where Mr Stauskas' body was found. His injuries are not understood to be life-threatening.
Police have said they are still working to establish definitively that there is a link between these two attacks.
