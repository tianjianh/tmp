Turkish pro-government press delight with EU migrant deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thursday's EU action plan with Turkey aimed at halting the flood of migrants is welcomed enthusiastically by Turkish pro-government newspapers, with commentators hailing what they see as concessions wrung from Brussels.

But opposition commentators voices scepticism at what they see as a dubious bargain, with one even describing it as "indecent".
Pro-government daily Aksam presents the action plan as a success, with the online headline "U-turn from Merkel, Turkey is getting what it wants".
The paper goes on to welcome the "critical decisions" made by EU leaders in Brussels
Another pro-Erdogan newspaper, Yeni Safak, quotes EU sources as describing Turkey's help in the refugee crisis as "vital for a long term solution to the crisis".
Writing in pro-government Sabah, Seref Oguz, agrees with this assessment.
"The EU, which is growing old and losing pace, is now ready to hear what we are saying," the commentator says.
"The refugee card is the biggest foreign policy tool for us and, with the conscious strategies that we will put behind it, could fundamentally wipe out all the sanctions that the EU is applying to us."
Murat Yetkin in centre-left Radikal voices cautious approval of emerging signs of co-operation.
"A consolidation of EU-Turkey relations is necessary, first of all, for the development of democracy in Turkey, and then for the sake of mending the economy," he argues.
But Mustafa Kartoglu in centre-right, pro-government Star feels Turkey should be wary of the conditions on offer.
"In a nutshell, the EU wants the refugees to stay in Turkey instead of coming to them," he says. "And for that it does not want to take any burden - or just a little bit."
He adds that Turkey too "wants the EU to take part of the burden, speed up membership talks and fulfil its promises".
Deniz Zeyrek, Ankara bureau chief of mass tabloid Hurriyet, says he is appalled by the arrangement.
Speaking on the TV channel CNNTurk, he said the EU-Turkish proposal treated the people trying to escape war as bargaining chips.
"Connecting the issue of refugees with Turkey's accession process is indecent," Mr Zeyrek says.
"Europeans are telling Turkey: 'We will give you $3bn and concessions as long as Syrians don't come here."
