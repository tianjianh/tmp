[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tenby's South Parade landmark trees to be felled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Pembrokeshire town is set to lose a line of landmark trees over safety concerns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The horse chestnut trees, which line Tenby's medieval town walls along South Parade, were investigated after one fell in strong winds this month.
They were all found to have fungal infections which could make them unstable.
Pembrokeshire council's environment cabinet member, Cris Tomos said the felling was "reluctant".
But he said the action was needed as "safety always comes first".
