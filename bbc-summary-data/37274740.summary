Rare Shakespeare folios on display in Leeds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four Shakespeare folios owned by the University of Leeds have gone on public display for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They include a copy of the First Folio, the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays which was printed seven years after his death in 1616.
The items were left to the university by wealthy industrialist Lord Brotherton of Wakefield in 1930.
They are on display in a new exhibition being held to coincide with the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death.

The university said Lord Brotherton was one of the country's leading private book collectors of the 1920s.
Acquiring all four of the 17th century Shakespeare folios meant he had achieved the "holy grail" of book collecting, it added.
Dr Stella Butler, university librarian and keeper of the Brotherton Collection, said: "By bringing together this material for public display we are sharing Shakespeare's legacy with Yorkshire."
For All Time: Shakespeare in Yorkshire runs at the Brotherton Gallery at the University of Leeds until January.
