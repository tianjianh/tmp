The 25-year-old joined the Trotters on a six-month loan deal last season, scoring four goals in 24 appearances.
"It feels great to be back. I'm very familiar with Bolton now," Ameobi told the club's website.
"The gaffer was massive for me last season. He helped me rebuild my confidence and I believe he gets the best out of me."
