The commission will award £30,000 to UNHCR, UNICEF and Save the Children to support humanitarian aid efforts in Syria and neighbouring countries.
The commission does not generally fund aid work within Europe.
The chief minister said the donation reflected the wish of the community to respond "with its head and its heart".
In a statement, the commission said "the continuing need for humanitarian aid in Syria and the neighbouring countries could be overlooked" with the "media spotlight" focused on refugees within Europe.
Deputy Jonathan Le Tocq, chief minister said: "The Guernsey community has made it clear that it wants to respond to the refugee crisis with its head and its heart.
"This welcome and thoughtful decision by the commission enables us to make a timely response in that way."
The commission has an annual budget of £200,000 towards disaster emergency relief aid.
Ministers have previously said the Channel Islands could take in refugees fleeing Syria.
