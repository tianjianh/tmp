[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham and Nottingham Forest battled to a goalless draw to move both clubs closer to Championship survival.

Millers centre-back Richard Wood missed a succession of headers, his closest hitting the crossbar from close range.
Ryan Mendes was the stand-out player for Forest, firing narrowly wide in the first half before twice forcing goalkeeper Lee Camp into good saves.
Both sides remain nine points clear of the relegation zone with four games left after MK Dons' draw at Preston.
The draw halts a run of four straight losses for the visitors, with Rotherham making it nine league games unbeaten.
However, Wood's failure to take one of five presentable headed opportunities will disappoint Neil Warnock as his side missed the opportunity to leapfrog their opposition.
Rotherham have now drawn seven successive games against Nottingham Forest at home in the league, with their last win coming way back in September 1956.
Rotherham manager Neil Warnock:
"It's a cracking point and both sides will argue that they should have won. A point probably suits both teams in the situation that we are both in.
"Tactically we were slightly amiss in the first half but we were more dominant in the second.
"You look at their squad on paper and why they're down there with us I will never know."
Nottingham Forest caretaker manager Paul Williams:
"I've been trying to focus on the performances and apart from the Brentford game we've been slowly building blocks.
"We played some really good stuff today and I've told the players we've got to keep going now.
"There was some good play from the players and Ryan (Mendes) had a few chances to get us the points but I think on the whole a draw might be fair."
