Q&A;: Baileys Prize-winner Ali Smith on How to be Both

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ali Smith has won the Â£30,000 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction for her novel How to be Both.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The book's dual narrative focuses on the lives of a grieving teenage girl in the present day and a 15th Century Renaissance artist.
It comes in two editions - one begins with the artist's story and the other with the girl's. Readers are free to choose which they want to read first.
Smith spoke to the BBC immediately after her win about the idea behind the book, the feedback from readers, and plans for her next novel.
It's unbelievable, it's glorious and it feels like an astonishing fluke. It was such a strong, versatile shortlist, and I can't believe this has happened.
It's lovely, but once you've finished your book it goes its own way and has its own life. The stuff that happens to the writer is outside of the book.
This stuff happens on the surface, and the surface isn't what it's about really - but how lovely the surface is tonight!
My editor already cuts me quite a lot of slack. I said I wanted to produce a book where you the reader won't know which half they are going to get first.
I got an email back after a couple of days saying 'we can do that' - technology makes it simple to switch the file halfway through the print run. So we did it.
When it went to the printers we had people who sorted the books as they came off the machine so each bookshop would get a random mix of books.
I get an incredible warmth that comes from people who speak to be about this book. It's partly to do with the book asking questions about time and structure.
We [appear to] live our lives in sequence, but we don't really - as human beings we have all our younger selves at all our ages.  There's something about that which speaks to people.
A fresco is a work built into a wall - so much so that if you take it off the wall you have taken a part of the wall off.
When the famous frescoes in Florence were damaged by flooding in the 1960s, the restorers found underneath the originals designs that were sometimes different.
It struck me as extraordinary that we can be looking at a surface and think we can see everything but actually there's something below it - and we can't see it.
It's a really primal, private thing. If I was to talk about it, it would probably not be there when I tried to write it. It's not fully formed yet.
The inspiration came about 20 years ago. It was in my mind when I began to be a writer.  It's part of a sequence of books I want to do over the next few years.
Ali Smith's How to be Both is out now in Penguin paperback
