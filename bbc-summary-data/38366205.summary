[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea's Singleton Hospital and community units at Glanrhyd, Gorseinon, Maesteg and Tonna will all benefit.
It is part of the Welsh Government's digital health and social care strategy for Wales.
ABMU's medical director Hamish Laing said when work is complete, all of its hospitals will have free public wi-fi.
He also said it was fundamental to a plan to "give clinicians information at their fingertips at the bedside and in the clinics".
