[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gateshead 0-1 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere extended their unbeaten run to nine National League matches with a gritty win at Gateshead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers took just three minutes to hit the front. Ben Tollitt ploughed from deep into the home side's area and, with too little attention from defenders, struck the ball sweetly past Dan Hanford.
The rest of the first half was somewhat devoid of chances, although Andy Cook nearly increased his side's advantage with a run and shot just wide.
Neil Aspin's men roused themselves after the interval. A Danny Johnson pile-driver forced a save from Scott Davies.
Tranmere were more than content to hang on at a difficult away ground, while Sam Jones came closest to a leveller with a shot just over.
