Disney's Beauty and the Beast trailer 'most watched'

A teaser for Disney's new live-action version of Beauty and the Beast became the most-viewed such clip of all time with 91.8 million hits in its first 24 hours, the Hollywood Reporter says.

The 90-second clip had nearly four million more views than the previous title holder Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it says.
The new film features Emma "Harry Potter" Watson as Belle and Dan "Downton Abbey" Stevens as the Beast.
The film is due out in March 2017.
Beauty and the Beast, directed by Bill Condon, retells Disney's classic 1991 animated film.
Perhaps what is most impressive about the numbers is that the trailer does not actually give much of a glimpse of the film at all.
It contains only a fleeting view of Watson and the Beast's trademark growl - and the unmistakable tones of Sir Ian McKellan, who plays Cogsworth in the film, and Ewan McGregor, who voices Lumiere.
