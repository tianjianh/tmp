Mr Comber, 39, was last seen in Londonderry on Sunday, 14 May, at a supermarket in the Quayside area. His bicycle was found later in the week in a lay-by in the Newbuildings area.
Mr Comber's family say they believe he was swimming in the water and got into difficulty.
His body was recovered on Saturday morning.
Mr Comber was originally from Leicestershire.
A Facebook page - Help find our Sam - had been set up after he went missing.
A post on Sunday read:  "This is a difficult time, but we would like to extend our gratitude for those that helped us this week."
It added: "The kindness of strangers was never as apparent as this week.
"Sam always spoke of how he loved the people of Derry. He knew there was a warmth and kindness in their hearts, just as he had. We saw the extent of that this week.
Thank you for bringing Sam home."
