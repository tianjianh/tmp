"You know it was a very scrappy game and Welling gave us a lot of problems in the first-half.
"I thought at half time we upped our levels and we caused them problems in the second half and I think we deserved to win the game.
"I've got confidence in the strikers and confidence in players who can score and it was a matter of time. Their keeper made some terrific saves, but you've got to keep believing like we've done this season."
