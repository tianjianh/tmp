Scottish Cup: Motherwell's Keith Lasley eyes win over Rangers

Motherwell need to beat the second best team in the country to progress in the Scottish Cup, says Keith Lasley.

The Steelmen face Premiership rivals Rangers at Ibrox on Saturday with a place in the fifth round at stake.
"I think they seem to have improved. They lost the Old Firm match, but even within that match they played well in large spells," said the Well captain.
"We know we are up against it. But we are capable of competing against anybody in this division on our day."
The Scottish Cup tie at Ibrox is the first of 14 on Saturday, and Lasley is under no illusions as to the challenge they face.
"They [Rangers] have brought in a couple of new faces," Lasley said of his opponents who sit second in the Premiership.
"I think they are starting to gel better than they had done in the early part of the season, and at home they will be a tough proposition.
Lasley feels Rangers are on their way to showing they are the second best side in Scotland this year.
"They are at the moment according to the league, and I believe at the moment they probably are," he said.
"I think recent results have proved that. I expect them to finish there [second] at the end of the season to be honest."
"Of course it is going to be tough. It is probably one of the toughest draws you can get at this stage of the cup - take away Celtic, it's probably the next toughest assignment at the moment."
However, Lasley is confident the Steelmen can hold their own at Ibrox.
"We feel capable on our day in a cup competition especially. Our recent performances against Rangers and against Celtic, against the better teams in this league, give us the belief and confidence that we can compete against anybody."
This will be Motherwell's second visit to Ibrox this season. Back in August they took the lead through Scott McDonald, before goals from Harry Forrester and a 90th-minute winner from Kenny Miller saw Rangers take all three points.
"I think anybody that saw the last meeting at Ibrox would concede that we were very unfortunate to take nothing from that game," said Lasley.
"In fact, at one point in the game well into the second-half we're thinking we would be disappointed not to win this match - never mind take nothing from it.
"We can't control Rangers tomorrow. What we can control is turning up and giving our best and being at our best. If we do then I think we have a good chance of progression."
