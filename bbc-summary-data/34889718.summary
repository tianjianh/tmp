Prosthetic limbs, a living room carpet and even a box of maggots are some of the things Jean Scott has witnessed people leaving behind on First Glasgow buses over the years.
The 59-year-old is shortlisted for an Unsung Hero title in the UK Bus Awards.
The event highlights the achievements of those working in the bus industry.
In total, 97 finalists have been selected from more than 250 entries across 19 categories and winners will be presented with their awards at a ceremony next week.
Ms Scott, who has worked for more than 37 years in the bus industry, said: "You wouldn't believe what I've seen over the years.
"I remember when I opened a fisherman's bag and discovered tubs of worms which I later released in the park. Once we even managed to return a lost suitcase to Australia.
"Being nominated for this award is very humbling, I just love doing my job and I get great satisfaction returning as many lost belongings to our customers as I possibly can."
Fiona Kerr, managing director for First Glasgow, said: "We're delighted that Jean has been shortlisted for this prestigious award. It's clear recognition of her hard work and dedication to reuniting our customers with their lost property items."
