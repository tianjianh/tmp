Following the sentence, Shaun Atkinson's son Joe paid tribute to his father.
"He was a kind-hearted, hard-working, lovely, charming person who would make time for anyone at any time," he said.
"He loved his family and friends more than anything else. He will be dearly missed by his family, friends and, in particular, his children."
North Yorkshire Police were called to Mr Atkinson's home at around 18:25 GMT on 27 December.
Rewcroft was arrested on suspicion of murder after handing himself in at Scarborough police station shortly afterwards.
