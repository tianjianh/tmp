[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Father-of-two PC Dave Phillips, 34, died after he was hit by a pick-up truck in Wallasey, Wirral, in October.
Clayton Williams, 19, denies murder and claims he did not intend to injure the Merseyside officer.
Mr Williams had been driving a stolen Mitsubishi which hit the officer during a police pursuit, the court has heard.

Jurors spent about an hour at the scene of the collision, on Wallasey Docks Link Road North.
PC Phillips and his colleague, PC Thomas Birkett, 23, had been responding to reports of a burglary before the collision.
They were attempting to stop the vehicle using a tyre-puncturing "stinger" device in Wallasey Docks Link Road North.
Court officials, barristers and the judge also attended and watched how a stinger device may have been deployed in the circumstances.
On Wednesday the court heard how the officer tried to run away moments before he was struck.
PC Birkett told the court he could see the truck "gathering speed" like "a train coming down a tunnel" before it mounted the central reservation.
The prosecution claims Mr Williams turned the vehicle to deliberately collide with PC Phillips, using the truck as "a murder weapon".
The teenager has admitted a charge of burglary during which the truck was stolen, and aggravated vehicle taking.
He denies murder, and also denies a second count of attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to PC Birkett.
The trial continues.
