The 27-year-old Brazilian will join the French champions on a five-year contract after the World Cup.
Despite recently failing Uefa's financial fair play (FFP) rules, PSG are reported to be paying £40m for Luiz - a transfer record for a defender.
"Right from the very first contact I had with Paris St-Germain, I was very happy," Luiz told the club's website.
"It's a big club with a great history. It's a new step in my life and I'm impatient to play for Paris and show what I can do."
Luiz joined the Blues from Benfica for £21.3m in January 2011 and made 143 appearances for the club.
He had three years left on the five-year contract he signed in September 2012.
Chelsea have already signed midfielder Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona and are close to completing the signing of Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa.
The Blues also spent £12m on St Etienne centre-back Kurt Zouma in January.
In Paris, Luiz will join up with his international team-mate Thiago Silva, who also set a transfer record for a defender when he joined PSG for £36m from AC Milan.
