The Scottish SPCA said six owls had been airlifted from installations recently.
It said it was unusual for so many to have been rescued in a short space of time, and that most of them had been "exhausted".
Five of the owls have now been released into the wild on the east coast, north of Dundee.
Colin Seddon, manager of the Scottish SPCA's rescue centre in Fishcross, said there had been previous instances of birds landing on North Sea platforms, but added: "To have this many owls in such a short space of time is unusual."
He said they had probably flown over from Scandinavia, Russia or Iceland to spend the winter in Scotland.
"Most were merely exhausted, which could be due to high winds and stormy conditions," he said.
"Some also had oil on them from the rigs which thankfully we were able to remove successfully."
He added that the remaining owl was currently being looked after in an aviary at the SSPCA's centre and would be returned to the wild shortly.
