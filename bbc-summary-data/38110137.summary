New takeaway leaflet food hygiene rating rules in force

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New rules requiring takeaway leaflets to promote food hygiene ratings come into force on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The regulations will not force takeaway firms to print their actual rating on their leaflets but they will need to print a bilingual statement pointing to a website where it can be found.
Outlets are rated according to how they prepare, cook and store food, the condition of their premises and food safety management.
The ratings are set by local councils.
The statement will also tell customers that they have a legal right to ask the food business for their hygiene rating when they order over the phone.
Takeaways can voluntarily display their valid rating on the leaflet.
But the Welsh Government has not sought to force takeaways to print the ratings in the same way they have to display them, so firms do not have to go to the expense of reprinting leaflets when their ratings change.
Wales became the first part of the UK in 2013 to force food businesses like restaurants and takeaways to display ratings on their premises.
