Bowes Museum hits £1m fundraising match target

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Durham museum has reached its £1m fundraising target.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bowes Museum was awarded a Catalyst Endowments programme grant four years' ago with the proviso it matched the money pound-for-pound.
With the deadline this month, there have been more than 800 individual donors from as far afield as Australia, as well as contributions from visitors.
The museum said it was extremely pleased to have raised the money within the allotted timeframe.
The £2m total will be spent on long-term curatorial, conservation and educational activities, as well as a programme of exhibitions.
The Catalyst Endowments programme is a joint enterprise between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Heritage Lottery Fund, and Arts Council England.
