Hearts have sought to address social media speculation over the future of attacking midfielder Jamie Walker.

Craig Levein, the club's director of football, said earlier this week that the 23-year-old wants to leave Hearts.
In a statement on Thursday, Hearts aimed to "correct some misinformation" surrounding Walker's contractual situation.
"It would seem that the player would prefer to see out the remaining year of his contract."
Walker came through Hearts' development system, has been a first-team regular at Tynecastle since 2012 and is under contract until 2018.
Levein said head coach Ian Cathro had "been through quite an extensive discussion with Jamie to try to get him to stay".
The director of football added: "Jamie said he has been here a long time and feels it is time to move on."
On Thursday, Hearts addressed "ill-informed and potentially damaging stories relating to Jamie Walker and his contractual position with the club".
"Naturally, the club wants him to stay and made earnest efforts to secure his long-term future here at Hearts," the statement added.
"Those efforts were reflected in the new three-year deal offered to the player in February 2017, one which would've made Jamie the highest paid player at the club.
"Despite Jamie initially agreeing to sign this contract, the club was then informed that he had changed his mind and would not be signing the new deal.
"Despite the club doing everything in its power to hold onto, and reward, one of its top youth products, it would seem that the player would prefer to see out the remaining year of his contract, leaving the club in a no-win situation.
"The club has no desire to lose a talent such as Jamie. He is a firm favourite both with the fans and indeed the management. Nor would it stand in the way of any player who does not want to sign a contract and play for Hearts.
"We must protect the interests of the fans and the business when faced with such a scenario.
"Hearts totally refute any suggestion that a member of the club board or senior executive would be less than honest with any information provided to the media or the fans and it was insulting to see such accusations and falsehoods spread across social media."
