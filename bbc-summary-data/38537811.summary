[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Roberts, from Hornchurch, was found guilty of stabbing Aiden O'Mahony in JJ Moon's pub in High Street, Hornchurch, on 10 January 2016.
The court heard how Mr O'Mahony was attacked after Roberts threatened the barmaid with "serious violence" when she asked him to leave.
The 31-year-old was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 23 years.
The Old Bailey heard how Mr O'Mahony, 61, had challenged Roberts when he was asked to leave by the barmaid.
Roberts had then asked him to go outside, to which Mr O'Mahony agreed. The 31-year-old then spun around and stabbed the grandfather in the chest.
After the attack several customers had to barricade the pub door shut, as Roberts tried to force his way back inside, police said.
Mr O'Mahony's family previously paid tribute to the 61-year-old, saying they were "devastated" by his death.
"Aiden was a very loved son, brother, partner and granddad," they said.
