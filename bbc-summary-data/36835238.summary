Two badgers have died after being mauled by dogs in Motherwell, according to the Scottish SPCA.

The animal welfare charity fears there is a "distinct possibility" someone may be targeting the animals.
The body of the first badger was found at the Ravenscraig Steelworks site in April.
A member of the public discovered the second animal four miles away in the Riccard Johnston woodland on Thursday 7 July.
A Scottish SPCA undercover inspector said a post-mortem examination "conclusively" proved that it had been killed by dogs.
He said: "We are beginning to suspect that there is a distinct possibility someone is actually targeting these animals.
"The previous incident is still under investigation and we are working with local wildlife crime police and Scottish Badgers.
"We are still looking into names that were highlighted as a result of our last appeal for information and we are very keen to speak to anyone with information about individuals who have potentially been involved in either of these cases."
