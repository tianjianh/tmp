The crash happened on the A1 between Dromore and Hillsborough at about 08:00 BST.
Three people who were on the coach were treated by paramedics.
The road was closed in both directions for several hours but has since been reopened.
Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the crash to contact them.
Insp Rosie Leach, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland's roads division, said it had been a "bad 24 hours" on the region's roads after Ms Wing became the second person to die in less than 10 hours.
A motorcyclist was killed in a crash in Newtownards in County Down on Thursday night.
"My appeal to motorists is pay attention to what you're doing - be aware of your surroundings and what other motorists are doing," added Insp Leach.
