'Monster tower block' plan for Swindon's Old Town shelved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a 13-storey building on a hilltop in Swindon have been shelved after more than 2,000 people signed a petition against it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Architects had put forward their ideas for the former Swindon Advertiser building in Victoria Road, Old Town.
They included 148 new flats, offices and a new community space.
Objectors called on Swindon Borough Council to reject the plans "to save the charm and character of Old Town from a monstrosity of a tower block".
The Quad Group has since withdrawn its plans and is preparing a new submission.
Campaigner Neil Robinson started the online petition because he was "absolutely mortified" by the plans.
"Even though the tower block has been scrapped I still don't think this is the end of it," he said.
"I still think the new plans they're going to come up with aren't going to be in keeping with the architecture of Old Town."
Mike Price, from Quad Group, said the company had listened to the community's concerns.
"We are sorry it caused so much bad feeling, this was never our intention and we will endeavour to get a better understanding of the needs and wants of the local community during the next stage," he added.
