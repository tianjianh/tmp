Twelve people under the age of 65 die from heart attacks each week in Wales, figures from British Heart Foundation Cymru have revealed.

They also show Welsh hospitals dealt with almost 9,600 heart attack cases in 2013/14, up from 8,000 the year before.
The charity said medical research, much of which it has funded, has helped to significantly improve survival rates.
But it says further research is urgently needed to save more lives with coronary heart disease the main cause.
About 135,000 people in Wales are living with coronary heart disease.
BHF said, despite improvements in treatment and diagnosis, about a third of heart attacks are fatal.
"Through medical research, we've made great progress in saving the lives of people suffering from heart attacks," said BHF medical director Prof Peter Weissberg.
"But we mustn't be lulled into thinking we've beaten the disease.
"Every year thousands of people are still dying from heart attacks and coronary heart disease remains the UK's single biggest killer.
"We urgently need to fund more research to find new ways to prevent and treat heart attacks, and ultimately, save more lives."
Prof Weissberg said that, despite knowing that risk factors such as smoking increase the risk of heart attack, we still have "no way" to stop the furring of the arteries in coronary heart disease that causes many.
"This is a challenge that only research can provide the answer to," he added.
