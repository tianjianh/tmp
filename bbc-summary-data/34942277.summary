Nick Selman: Glamorgan sign Australia-born batsman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan have signed opening batsman Nick Selman in a bid to create more competition for batting places at the County Championship Division Two side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brisbane-born Selman, 20, scored 62 and 78 in two games for the county's second XI in August.
He has represented Queensland at Under-19 level, but has dual Australian and United Kingdom citizenship.
Selman spent most of the 2015 season with Kent's second XI and also turned out once for Gloucestershire seconds.
He has been playing for Tunbridge Wells in the Kent Premier League for the past two seasons but does not have first-class experience.
Selman was also a talented Australian Rules footballer at state age-group level.
He could challenge Will Bragg and James Kettleborough for places alongside captain Jacques Rudolph in the top three of the Glamorgan batting order.
