Last year was the 14th edition of the event staged near Dundrennan in Dumfries and Galloway.
A statement said that festival, following the death of co-founder Jamie Gilroy, had been "hugely successful" but they were taking a year off.
"The event will go ahead in 2017 and plans are already taking shape," said director Jennie Camm.
"The organisers are grateful for the kind messages and loyal support from all Wicker fans and look forward to announcing further details about the 2017 festival shortly."
Anyone who has purchased an early bird ticket for 2016 will be automatically refunded.
Organisers said the Wickerman Festival website and social media would be "regularly updated" to outline plans for 2017.
