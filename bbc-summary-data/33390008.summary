Clifford Collinge widow Charlotte cleared after murder retrial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who was convicted of murdering her husband in 2011 has been acquitted following a retrial in Nottingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charlotte Collinge, 48, of Market Warsop had been accused of convincing two men to kill her husband Clifford at their home.
The jury at Nottingham Crown Court found her not guilty but convicted Stephen Shreeves, 43, and Kelvin Dale, 30, of murder.
Mr Collinge, 61, was beaten to death with a guitar and a metal object.
The two men were both jailed for 16 years.
Another man, who was with Mr Collinge at the time of the attack, was left with concussion and various cuts and bruises.
The case was brought to a retrial in June after fresh evidence from two Warsop women was uncovered.
The court heard that Shreeves, of Laurel Avenue, Church Warsop, and Dale, of Forest Road, Market Warsop, went to the Collinge home and carried out the murder after a night out at a local pub.
Mrs Collinge was jailed for 23 years and Shreeves and Dale were each jailed for 18 years after the original trial.
Det Supt Kate Meynell of Nottinghamshire Police said: "This has been a very complex case and my officers have been driven to deliver justice for Cliff's family.
"Our thoughts, as always, are with Cliff's family at this difficult time."
