Fantastic Four has topped the UK and Ireland box office chart in its first weekend, despite scathing reviews.

That was one place higher than the Marvel blockbuster managed in the US.
It earned £2.7m in the UK and Ireland, including previews. Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation was second with £2.4m.
But Fantastic Four's first weekend earnings were below those for other Marvel films released this year. Ant-Man opened with £4m, while Avengers: Age of Ultron raked in £18m.
The earnings were also below the opening weekend takings for the 2005 Fantastic Four movie, which made £3.5m.
The latest film, which was directed by Josh Trank, cost $120m (£77m) to make.
