Brown, 31, came out of a short international retirement to play in World Cup qualifying games against England and Slovenia.
The home date with England is 10 June, with Celtic starting their Champions League campaign a month later.
"If he wants to play, absolutely fine," Rodgers told Sky Sports. "We'll find a solution for that."
Celtic could wrap up the Scottish Premiership title this weekend and Rodgers is mindful of his players' workload.
But he is also conscious of his skipper's desire to keep playing under Scotland coach Gordon Strachan.
Asked if he would rather Brown sat out the match against Group F leaders England, Rodgers said: "No, because I think there's a genuine love for playing for Scotland for him.
"He obviously retired but his loyalty to Gordon and what Gordon has done for him over the years, bringing him here and the relationship that he has, it's totally natural - when he saw Gordon maybe not having a good time earlier on in the campaign - why he wanted to support him.
"It also typifies the guy he is. He has real old-school values and he wanted to help someone that he really respects.
"I think he's a really important player for the spirit of the Scotland squad. I obviously have to look at Celtic as well but we will find a solution that will do both, I'm sure."
Brown was one of six Celtic players in the starting line up for Scotland's win over Slovenia last weekend and Rodgers admits the international schedule will present a challenge.
"I need to manage it," said Rodgers. "I want to help the players. Their careers are short, so I want them to play for as long as they possibly can.
"Of course we have qualifiers that kick in very early for the Champions League and that's critical for us. So its a case of managing the time, the rest, the recovery.
"Successful players don't get a lot of rest. If you are playing right through to the end of the season, you have international games and the difference up here is that you are into qualification games a lot sooner.
"But that's the job of myself and my staff, to look at each individual's programme and look to give them the recovery where we can."
