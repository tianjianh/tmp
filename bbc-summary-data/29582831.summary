Having lost their opening Group D match 2-1 against Germany, the Scots dominated Georgia but had to settle for just one goal, which came from a Shaun Maloney drive.
But which of Gordon Strachan's Scots stood out?
BBC Scotland pundit and former Scotland striker Billy Dodds gives his marks out of 10.
The Cardiff goalkeeper hardly had anything to do in the game, which showed just how dominant Scotland were. Irakli Dzaria had Georgia's best chance but he failed to test the keeper, who would be delighted if every international was as quiet as this one.
Hutton kept getting forward from right back and looked dangerous when he did. Provided a few good crosses into the box and stuck at it all evening. He's looking sharp and seems to be benefiting from his regular appearances for Aston Villa.
Solid enough display from the centre back, who only really had counter-attacks to deal with. Had a few slight slip ups but that's what he does. I love his commitment and desire and his leadership was also first-class as he talked to young left-back Andy Robertson throughout.
He marshalled the back line very well and I feel safe when Martin is in there. The Georgia forwards ran at him a few times but he handled it efficiently and you can't ask any more from the defence than keeping a clean sheet.
The youngster got forward time and time again and his delivery was outstanding for the most part. He doesn't just bang the ball into the box, he wraps his foot around it. From playing with Queen's Park, to moving to Dundee United and now starring in the English Premier League with Hull City, he seems comfortable at any level. A very good display and I never expected anything else.
My man of the match. People always talk about his leadership, his desire and his bite, but the skipper can play as well. He was the driving force from midfield and a class apart for me. His performance was exactly the type you want from your captain.
A quieter game from Anya compared to his display in Germany but it was always likely to be this way against a team who sat in. He was a danger with his pace but found it difficult to find any space. I'm sure he'll be looking forward to facing Poland as they will throw more players forward and he can try to expose them on the break.
Did some good things and made some nice passes, kept it neat and tidy for most of the game. The West Brom man had a scary moment in the second half when he gave the ball away but made an excellent tackle to recover. Worked hard to see the result through.
Looked dangerous with some excellent crosses and his shot led to the crucial own goal. I love the fact he gives you lots going forward but also gets back and does a shift to help out the defence. That can make all the difference.
It wasn't Naismith's best performance in a Scotland jersey but there was still plenty to admire. He's a team player and although things weren't going for him, he never stopped running. He never hides and his work-rate makes him such a key player for Scotland. He will be vital away in Poland on Tuesday night.
Really looked the part and some of his creative work was superb. Brilliant game intelligence, with a great back heel to set up Naismith for a good chance. He is like a traditional old Scottish centre forward in the way he holds the ball up and he did everything he was asked to do.
The midfielder came on to help see the game out and did a solid job.
Got the last few moments and did his shift, holding the ball up and winning free-kicks to take the sting out the game.
