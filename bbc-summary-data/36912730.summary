The boy, who attends Mayfield School in Torquay, Devon, had travelled on a privately-operated minibus with his classmates.
But the non-verbal child did not leave the bus at the school site, as the Torquay Herald Express reported.
Torbay Council said it had launched an investigation as soon as it became aware of the "traumatic" incident.
After the morning school run the minibus returned to Paignton where it was parked until 14:30 BST.
When a bus driver got on to return for the afternoon school run, the boy was found to have been on it all day.
Torbay Council confirmed the incident had happened on 27 April.
A spokeswoman said: "As soon as we became aware of this very serious incident we started a full investigation with all concerned so we can fully understand how this happened.
"We supported the family at what must be a traumatic time for them and their son and have been keeping them informed throughout this investigation.
"We will ensure that we act on all the recommendations that come out of this investigation, which is still ongoing."
The BBC tried to contact the school but no-one was available to comment.
