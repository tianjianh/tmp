The hosts began day four still 38 runs behind on 148-5, and Azhar Mahmood (70) and Geraint Jones (79) top-scored in their eventual 312 all out.
Dean Cosker (4-106) was the pick of the Glamorgan bowlers as the visitors were left 127 to win.
And it took them only 20 overs to reach their victory target on 129-2, led by Alviro Petersen's 70 not out.
Director of cricket Paul Farbrace told BBC Radio Kent:
"We lost a couple of sloppy wickets early on and then we were battling again in the third innings.
"We're almost trying to stay in the third innings rather than push on.
"I think this game has summed up our season. We've played some pretty decent cricket but not good enough and we've come second.
"Our aim was to be challenging for promotion to the first division and we've fallen well short of that."
