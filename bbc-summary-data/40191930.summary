A fire at a museum dedicated to the Titanic is being treated as arson, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blaze broke out at Southampton's SeaCity Museum on Havelock Road at about 12:25 BST on Tuesday.
The fire service said a wooden model caught fire. Hampshire Constabulary said the till in the cafe was also broken into and cash stolen.
Visitors and staff were evacuated from the building but no-one was injured, the force added.
Officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
The £15m museum opened in April 2012 and is dedicated to Southampton's maritime heritage and the Titanic which made its ill-fated voyage from the city in 1912.
The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a £4.9m grant towards the cost of the museum - the rest of the money came from the city council.
