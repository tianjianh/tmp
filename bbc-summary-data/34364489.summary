Irish prime minister's department releases Nama correspondence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish prime minister's department has released correspondence with the Fortress Investment group regarding the Nama Northern Ireland deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It does not show that Fortress were concerned about the sales process, as some reports had alleged.
The opposition Fianna Fail party had said the correspondence could be "highly significant".
The email from Fortress is an inquiry asking how it can get involved in bidding for the NI portfolio.
In reply, Fortress is told that the query will be passed on to the relevant Nama officials.
The email was sent in February 2014 by Michael George, a managing director at Fortress, a New York investment fund.
It was received by Andrew McDowell, a senior advisor to the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister).
Mr George explains that he has heard that Nama is running a process for the Northern Ireland loans and Fortress is keen "to throw our hat in the ring".
The email was about a month after Nama had decided to appoint the Lazard investment bank to run a sales process.
Fortress ended up being one of the final two bidders from the portfolio which was bought by Cerberus.
