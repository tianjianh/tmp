A 27-year-old man was treated by the ambulance service for serious injuries and was taken to hospital where his condition is described as critical but stable, a statement said.

"We continue to make enquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding the shooting. We believe this was a targeted attack and are open-minded regarding motive," he said.
"We are appealing to anyone who was in the Vernon Road area and who may have seen anything suspicious to call me or one of my team."
