The 27-year-old Ireland tighthead won the Junior World Championship with New Zealand in 2008 and joined Connacht two years later.
Ah You qualified to play for Ireland in 2013 and made his Irish debut the following year in Argentina.
He said: "I'm really excited about the challenges that lie ahead with Ulster - they are a side with big ambitions."
Ah You progressed through the ranks at Canterbury and was capped at U19 and U20 levels by New Zealand.
"I feel that the environment at Ulster will allow me to reach my potential and help me to realise my ambitions in the game," he added.
"With so many players pushing one another for starting places, it will hopefully spur me on to a new level.
"I feel, at 27, that my best years are ahead of me and I want to push hard for more international recognition too."
Ulster director of rugby Les Kiss believes Ah You will be a valuable addition to the squad.
"We are delighted that Rodney has decided to commit to Ulster as he will add real strength to our front row department," he said.
"As a 27-year-old prop, there is still room for him to develop and as a coaching group we will endeavour to get the very best out of Rodney."
