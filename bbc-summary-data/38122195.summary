Police have stopped a driver after they spotted a sofa precariously hanging out of the back of a sports car travelling on a busy road.

The sofa was seen perched in the boot of the Toyota Celica on the A140 in Long Stratton, Norfolk, on Saturday by traffic officers, police said.
They found it was tied in by a loose, thin, suitcase-like strap, that was "only partially holding the sofa".
The driver was given a traffic offence report notice and may face more action.
An officer on a motorcycle saw the vehicle at about 15:10 GMT.
The Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing Unit tweeted about it and said it made them do a "double take".
"More suitable vehicle or straps would be a better bet," the unit added.
