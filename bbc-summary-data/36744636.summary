Soldiers loyal to Vice-President Riek Machar are said to have opened fire at a checkpoint manned by troops of President Salva Kiir.
Civil war broke out in South Sudan in 2013 after clashes between soldiers loyal to Mr Machar and President Kiir.
Mr Machar returned to Juba in April after the two men reached a peace deal.
These are believed to be the first serious clashes in Juba since then.

The shooting comes ahead of South Sudan's fifth independence day on Saturday.
Celebrations have been cancelled in order to save money.
Mr Machar's spokesman Nyarji Roman said the situation was now calm after the shooting on Thursday night.
"I want to tell the public that there should be no panic - the leadership ordered  the two forces to go back to their barracks," the Agence France-Presse news agency quotes him as saying.
