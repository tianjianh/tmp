Independent member of Essex Police Authority and legal support worker Linda Belgrove is standing as an independent candidate.
She is opposed to any further cutting of the police budget and wants neighbourhood policing to be at the heart of the force.
"Essex Police has some excellent officers who deliver a tremendous service to the public, but if things go wrong it is vital that lessons learned are acted upon swiftly and I would ensure this was the case in my potential police and crime commissioner role," she said.
