Twenty-four people are still missing and at least 27 people have been injured, eight seriously.
Officials have warned of further heavy rain and the risk of mudslides, as the extreme weather moves north.
The torrential rain comes in the wake of Typhoon Etau, which ploughed through Japan earlier this week.
The region affected is a vast area northeast of Tokyo, stretching from Ibaraki prefecture, a short distance from the capital, right up to Miyagi prefecture, around 350km (217 miles) away.

Sixty-two-year-old Hisako Sekimoto, who was rescued by military helicopter in the early morning, said she spent a sleepless night on the upper floor of her flooded house with her husband and three cats.
"There was no time to escape. All we could do was go upstairs. It was horrifying,'' she said. "I kept praying the water wouldn't come upstairs."
The chief forecaster at the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Takuya Deshimaru, has said the rainfall over the past few days was "unprecedented".
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed a co-ordinated and speedy emergency response
"Before anything else, we will continue to do our utmost to save lives and rescue victims, to secure the lives of people," he told reporters.
Japanese authorities have emphasised disaster prevention and response in recent years, stung by criticism at the time that their response to the 2011 tsunami and earthquake was sluggish.
