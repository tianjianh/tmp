McIlroy moved to Nike on a multi-million dollar deal in 2013 which included golf equipment and apparel.
The company announced last August that it would no longer produce clubs, balls and bags but instead concentrate on golf clothing and footwear.
"I'm really happy to continue this journey with Nike," said McIlroy, 27.
"I've loved this company since I was a kid."
In a further tweet, McIlroy said that he was "looking forward to the next 10 plus years as a Nike athlete".
McIlroy will aim to complete the career Grand Slam at this week's Masters in Augusta.
