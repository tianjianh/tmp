Martin Lynes, 48, is accused of attacking the woman, 51, at his home on the New South Wales Central Coast.
An apprehended violence order is in place after the Australian actor was arrested on Tuesday 1 March.
Mr Lynes told the Daily Telegraph he strenuously denied the allegations and would be fighting the charges.
Now working in real estate, Mr Lynes appeared on the popular Australian soap opera Home and Away as recently as 2014, playing criminal figure Adam Sharpe.
He also starred in the local medical drama All Saints as Luke Forlano.
He has been granted conditional bail and has been ordered to face Wyong Local Court again on 27 April.
