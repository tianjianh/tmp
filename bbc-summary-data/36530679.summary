[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2,000 Guineas winner Galileo Gold scored a thrilling triumph under Frankie Dettori in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.

Dettori guided the 6-1 shot, trained by Hugo Palmer, to victory from the odds-on favourite The Gurkha.
Earlier, Adam Kirby won the King's Stand Stakes on Profitable just hours after the jockey's girlfriend gave birth to a baby boy.
American mare Tepin won the opening Queen Anne Stakes from Belardo.
The 11-2 chance, ridden by Julien Leparoux for trainer Mark Casse, is the first American-trained runner to win the race.
Dettori sent his mount to the front with two furlongs to run and, while Irish Guineas victor Awtaad and French Guineas winner The Gurkha gave chase, it was all too late as Galileo Gold galloped on to score by a length and a quarter.
"Everything went to plan. Three Guineas winners, I managed to get first run on the other two," said Dettori, 45.
"He's a Guineas winner, a St James's Palace winner - he's a great horse to have."
Tepin was a game winner on rain-softened ground and held on by half a length from Belardo, with Lightning Spear in third.
Trainer Casse said: "I couldn't even dream this - at the most remarkable place I've been to."
It was quite a day for jockey Kirby - winning the King's Stand Stakes on Profitable just hours after partner Megan gave birth to son Charlie.
Kirby wiped away tears as he was interviewed after the race by Channel 4 Racing.
"I know my mum's watching and she'll be so proud. All Dad wanted to do was see me ride a Group 1 winner and he's missed them all," said Kirby, whose father Maurice died in 2012.
"I'd like to thank my girlfriend. It's a big day for her, she had a baby boy a couple of hours ago, so it's good all round."
Profitable, trained by Clive Cox, secured a third straight victory of the season as favourite Mecca's Angel never challenged.
Meanwhile Caravaggio, ridden by Ryan Moore, gave trainer Aidan O'Brien a record eighth win in the Coventry Stakes.
Jennies Jewel, trained by Jarlath Fahey, battled to a gutsy win for jockey Ronan Whelan in the Ascot Stakes from the fast-finishing Qewy.
Ardad gave trainer John Gosden a 40th Royal Ascot winner in the closing Windsor Castle Stakes as jockey Rab Havlin rode his first.
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
"It may have been the first race of 30 at Royal Ascot, but the success of Tepin is likely to prove the most significant of the week. For an established US star to travel to Britain and defy worryingly soft ground and an alien straight - rather than a one or two-turn mile - and succeed where others, notably champion Animal Kingdom, have failed is spectacular and should encourage other big names to follow suit. And what a win: talented Belardo dug as deep as he could but to absolutely no avail."
