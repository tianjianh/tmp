The Michael Keaton movie won the prize for excellence in contemporary film, while Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel won the period film category.
Both films are nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, although only Anderson's film is up for the best costume Oscar.
The musical Into the Woods won in the fantasy film category.
With costumes designed by multiple Oscar winner Colleen Atwood, it beat Guardians of the Galaxy, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 and Maleficent.
Double Oscar winner Albert Wolsky's costumes in Birdman triumphed over Boyhood, Gone Girl, Interstellar and Wild.
Collecting his award, he said of director Alejandro Inarritu: "I was thrilled when I finally had the chance to work with Alejandro.
"I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. It was a real labyrinth. It was endless. We only had six weeks to shoot. It was like being thrown out of a cannon."
Milena Canonero - yet another multiple Academy Award winner - beat The Imitation Game, Selma, The Theory of Everything and Inherent Vice with her costumes for The Grand Budapest Hotel.
Boyhood director Richard Linklater was honoured with the distinguished collaborator award.
"I'm here as a director to tell all costume designers: 'We're all pretty full of ourselves, we think we can do everything, but I don't know one director who thinks he can be a costume designer. We're in awe of your talents,'" he said on stage.
Harrison Ford presented the career achievement award to Aggie Guerard Rodgers, with whom he worked on a number of films including American Graffiti, Return of the Jedi and The Fugitive.
She was nominated for an Oscar for The Colour Purple and also worked on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Rainmaker and Beetlejuice.
"To all the actors who saw this crazy woman come into the trailer or fitting room but still put on what I asked to put on, you're amazing," she said as she collected her prize.
Achievements in television were also recognised at the ceremony, with True Detective winning the outstanding contemporary TV series award.
Game of Thrones won the period/fantasy series prize and American Horror Story: Freak Show won the mini-series award.
