Glenavon have completed the signing of former Derry City central defender David Elebert on an 18-month contract.

The 28-year-old has also played for Shamrock Rovers, Hamilton Academical, Scarborough and Preston North End.
"David has played over 100 games in the Scottish Premier League and wants to prove he still has a lot to offer," said Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton.
"Since he came back from full-time football he has been unlucky with a change of manager at Rovers and Derry."
"If you want to improve the team and keep moving forward this is the type of player we want to sign.
"If you look at the impact Marc Smyth has had at Cliftonville since he came back from playing in Scotland it shows what that kind of quality can do.
"David feels he needs four 90 minute games to get his fitness levels up so we don't expect him to make his first team debut for a few weeks, but we will see how things go."
Dublin born Elebert started his career at Preston before going on loan and playing 12 games at Scarborough.
He joined Hamilton in 2006 and played 135 games for the Accies followed by a short spell with Icelandic club Fylkir.
He returned to Dublin and joined Shamrock Rovers and then Derry City.
The Lurgan Blues lie sixth in the Irish Premiership table and will continue their defence of the Irish Cup when they travel to face Harland and Wolff Welders on 7 February.
Before that, they host Warrenpoint Town in a league match at Mourneview Park on Saturday.
Hamilton added ex-League of Ireland striker Declan O'Brien to his squad earlier this month and he made an immediate impact by scoring a hat-trick in a 4-2 win over Ballymena United.
Defender Simon Kelly has also been recruited during the transfer window.
