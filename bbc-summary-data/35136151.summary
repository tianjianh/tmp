Martyn Ashton, who was also a British and World Champion mountain bike trials rider, lost the use of his legs in an accident during a live show in 2013.
The 41-year-old from Margam, Neath Port Talbot, hoped to raise money for his ongoing care by selling his bike.
But supporters on Facebook said they would raise the money instead.
Mr Ashton was a well-respected professional stunt cyclist, with his videos Road Bike Party and Road Bike Party 2 gaining more than 28 million views between them on YouTube.
Since the accident at British Moto GP at Silverstone he has been having "incredible" treatment on the NHS, but he said he also wanted to buy additional equipment and adapt his house.
But when he tried to sell his bike on Facebook, he was inundated with offers of help to raise the money.
"The support has been amazing," said Mr Ashton, who lives with his wife and 15-year-old son.
"I think generally people are really nice. They probably don't want to spend thousands of pounds on a bike but want to help with my recovery.
"It's that great human spirit where people want to help.
"But I don't feel right taking people's money and also keeping the bike. So I'm considering what to do next - maybe I could have the appeal and then donate the bike to somebody."
He added that despite his paralysis, he felt lucky.
"I get a lot of positive energy from people on Facebook and this is another moment of that."
