The 34-year-old is set to qualify as a non-overseas player through his Irish ancestry, subject to approval from the England and Wales Cricket Board.
All-rounder Franklin has played 31 Tests for New Zealand, as well as appearing in 110 one-day internationals and 38 Twenty20 internationals.
His deal at Lord's has the option of being extended into a third year.
Left-armer Franklin, who has previously had spells with Gloucestershire, Glamorgan, Essex and Nottinghamshire, will continue to play for Wellington until the end of the 2014-15 New Zealand domestic season in April.
Franklin, who last played Test cricket in January 2013, is on the reserve list for New Zealand's World Cup squad.
"I've had a hugely enjoyable and memorable career in New Zealand," he said.
"It's been an absolute privilege to play for Wellington for over 15 years.
"Although this decision closes the chapter on playing for New Zealand again I know I've been incredibly fortunate to have spent over a decade playing international cricket.
"I'm really looking forward to being in a dressing room full of talented cricketers who will be wanting to help Middlesex win silverware and be a dominant force in county cricket."
Middlesex managing director of cricket Angus Fraser said Franklin would provide "quality, consistency and nous" to their squad.
"James has a lot to offer and continues to perform to a high level wherever he plays," he said.
"Despite James not having bowled with great frequency over the winter, due to a side strain, we are confident that come April his fitness levels will enable him to offer both experience and variety as a left arm-seamer."
