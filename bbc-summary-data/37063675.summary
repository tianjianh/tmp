The Grosvenor Estate, which represents the duke's business interests, said it was a "quiet, private funeral service" attended by close family members.
A spokesman said details of a memorial service to be held later this year "will be released in due course".
Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor died aged 64 on Tuesday. A coroner has confirmed he died following a heart attack.
The duke was said to be the third richest person in the UK with a fortune estimated at $10.8bn (£8.3bn).
According to Forbes magazine's estimate, he was the 68th richest person in the world.
Lancashire Police said the duke had been walking in the Trough of Bowland when he was taken ill and later airlifted to hospital, where he died.
The duke owned 190 acres in Belgravia, adjacent to Buckingham Palace and one of London's most expensive areas, as well as thousands of acres in Scotland and Spain.
He supported a number of charities and good causes, including making a £500,000 donation to farmers during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak.
His only son, Hugh Grosvenor, 25, is to inherit his title.
