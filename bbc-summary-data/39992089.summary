The World Player of the Year was shown a straight red card for elbowing Annie Heatherson in the 89th minute of City's 5-1 win, which moves them up to third.
Lloyd, 34, may now only be available for one more City game if she receives a three-match ban for violent conduct.
Fran Kirby and Erin Cuthbert scored twice as Chelsea beat Sunderland 7-0.
Despite Gemma Davison's early penalty miss, the Blues scored five times in the first half, with Karen Carney, Maren Mjelde and Ramona Bachmann all getting on the scoresheet.
Chelsea and Manchester City are now second and third respectively, both four points behind Liverpool and both with two games in hand on the Reds.
Heatherson's own goal and Jill Scott's chip had put City 2-0 inside 13 minutes against Yeovil.
Lucy Quinn then pulled one back for the visitors, but Jane Ross scored a brace and Kosovare Asllani made it 5-1 to complete a comfortable win.
Manchester City confirmed afterwards that, after reviewing the footage of Lloyd's red card, the coaching staff "accepted" the referee's decision.
Lloyd joined City, who have four games left in the Spring Series, on a deal that is due to end at the conclusion of the competition.
