Hay fever is an allergy - and people who have it are allergic to pollen.
Pollen is a type of fine powder which is released by lots of different plants and trees.
It has proteins in it which can cause your nose, eyes and throat to become swollen or irritated.
This means people can suffer from symptoms like itchy eyes or runny noses as your body tries to protect itself from the pollen by flushing it out.
