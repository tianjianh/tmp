Comments: Who's got the smelliest shoes in your house?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An American boy's smelly sneakers have earned him the title of "Smelliest Sole" at the 42nd National Rotten Sneaker Contest in New York, USA.

Connor Slocombe was awarded with the golden sneaker trophy as his toes poked through the front of his rotten trainers.
We've all got a pair of really bad-smelling trainers somewhere in the house.
So, Newsround asked you which member of your family would win the prize for stinkiest shoes!
