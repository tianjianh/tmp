Three people have been charged by police over a hate crime attack on a loyalist protest camp in north Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A number of flags and banners were damaged overnight at the camp at Twaddell Avenue.
The damage was reported at about 07:35 BST. Two men aged 21 and 22, and a 20-year-old woman were arrested shortly afterwards.
They have been charged with criminal damage and provocative conduct. The woman has also been charged with theft.
All three are due to appear before Belfast Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
Loyalists have been protesting at Twaddell Avenue since July, after a decision to restrict an Orange Order parade.
