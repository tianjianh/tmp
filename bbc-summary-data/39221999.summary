[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cowbridge in Vale of Glamorgan has been named as the "best place to live in Wales" in an annual guide by the Sunday Times.

The newspaper said it has drawn on a range of factors, including community spirit, exam results, broadband speed and the availability of local shops.
Abersoch in Gwynedd was the only place to be listed in north Wales.
It is the fifth year the guide has been produced.
Llandaff in Cardiff has been named among its "Top 20 perennials" for places to have appeared in almost every annual guide.
Sunday Times home editor Helen Davies said: "Numbers on a spreadsheet can only tell us so much, so we carefully balance statistics with our writers' decades of knowledge and expertise to create the definitive list of the best places to live in the UK."
Cowbridge is regarded as an affluent market town with a traditional high street full of independent shops and a popular secondary school.
Other Welsh towns in the guide are: Abergavenny, Bishopston and Gower, Cardigan, Carmarthen, Hay-on-Wye, Llandeilo, Llanidloes, Monmouth, Narberth and Penarth.
"Best places" to live in the north and north east, Midlands, Northern Ireland and south east will also be highlighted in the first part of the guide at the weekend.
