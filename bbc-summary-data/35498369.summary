[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Hoare, 21, of Chartham, Kent died in January 2006 while working for Watling Tyres in Canterbury.
The company has pleaded guilty at Canterbury Crown Court to health and safety breaches.
His mother Carolyn Hoare said: "I feel like my heart has been ripped out. There's not a moment I don't think about him."
Mr Hoare had been sent to fix a puncture on an earth mover in Sandwich when the tyre blew up.
In April 2013 an inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death.
In January 2015 it was announced Watling Tyres would face three charges of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act and Working Time Regulations.
Mrs Hoare said: "You live it every day - it doesn't go away. You go to bed thinking about it and you dream during the night.
"I'm living it every day - it's been hell."
Watling Tyres will be sentenced at a later date.
