[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flu outbreak in schools in south west England has prompted health chiefs to urge parents to keep children off school all week if they are ill.

The H1N1 virus - known as swine flu - is among strains doing the rounds in the region, Public Health England said.
While it caused the 2009-2010 pandemic, swine flu is now considered "normal seasonal flu", according to the NHS.
The warning was prompted by more calls from GPs reporting flu cases to the region's health protection teams.
A spokesman said it could be linked to pupils returning to school following the February half term.
Public Health England [PHE] wrote to all directors of public health in the South West, urging them to promote simple hygiene rules such as hand washing among pupils and ensure "good cleaning practice".
The letter said: "At present, PHE are receiving an increased number of calls from schools reporting outbreaks of respiratory, flu-like illness.... One of the circulating flue strains at present is H1N1, also known as swine flu. As this strain is not now a pandemic strain, it should be treated like any other circulating flu strain."
It also advises that children should return to school only when they are free of symptoms - usually after a week.
The latest flu statistics for England suggest the south west and south east regions have seen the highest number of flu outbreaks - 113 - since the start of "flu season" in October up to 6 March. By comparison, London has had only 22.
