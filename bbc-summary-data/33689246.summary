A key waiting times target for Scotland's accident and emergency (A&E) departments has been met for a second week.

Figures showed 95.2% of patients were seen and then admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.
The statistics for the week ending 19 July showed 10 of the 14 health boards met the target.
NHS Forth Valley was the poorest performing health board, with 83.9% of patients seen within the timeframe.
NHS Lanarkshire (94.1%), NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (94.7%) and NHS Shetland (94.6%) narrowly missed the target.
A total of 56 patients spent more than eight hours in A&E while six people spent more than 12 hours in the department over the week.
The controversial 95% target was introduced by the Scottish government as a stepping stone towards its full target of 98% of patients being dealt with in four hours or less.
When weekly reporting started in February, only 86.1% of A&E patients were treated within four hours.
A spokeswoman for NHS Forth Valley said: "This was a difficult week with a number of particularly challenging days and we are very sorry that some patients experienced longer waits.
"While we met the four-hour A&E target the previous week and our emergency department waiting times have significantly improved in recent days, we recognise that we must do more to improve the consistency of our performance and work is already under way to address this."
Health Secretary Shona Robison said the figures were "encouraging".
She said: "Three quarters of core emergency departments are seeing over 95% of patients within four hours and the number of long waits across Scotland remains very low.
"The statistics published today show how important it is that the whole hospital, and the whole NHS and social care system, works together for the benefit of patients."
"Week to week these figures will fluctuate but our focus now will be to maintain this improving trend in performance going forward - particularly as we head towards winter."
