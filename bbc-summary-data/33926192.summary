Manchester city centre homeless protesters moved on again

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Homelessness protesters who set up camp in Manchester to highlight a crisis in temporary housing have been moved on for a second time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Manchester City Council was granted an injunction to ban the protest camps on 30 July.
Eviction notices were served on protesters in St Ann's Square earlier with support from police.
The council said it was not an attempt to criminalise homeless people or a crackdown on lawful protests.
Many of the protesters had packed up their things and left on Thursday night.
Demonstrators first began protesting in St Peter's Square in April then split the camp between St Ann's Square and Castlefield Basin.
They moved to different city centre sites following a previous eviction.
The cost of the camp in terms of additional policing, security and legal costs exceeded Â£100,000, the local authority revealed earlier.
Protester Wesley Dove claimed the council objected to its homeless policy being highlighted in such a central area as "they don't want people to see".
"Why should they be hidden in doorways, why should they be hidden in car parks? They deserve looking after, they deserve a house.
"They shouldn't be left to rot away by the council. So I'm here to fight them, to try make a change."
Solicitor Ben Taylor who has represented two protesters throughout the legal process said the proposed penalty was unduly harsh.
"I think it is extremely difficult for Manchester City Council to enforce this injunction order and if anyone is accused of breaking the terms of this injunction order and they are found to have done it they could go to prison for two years.
"This is someone who is protesting by sleeping in a tent who could go to prison for two years."
Mr Dove criticised the eviction in the rainy conditions: "What do they expect people to do when the weather is really this bad?
"They're kicking homeless people out and they've got nowhere to go to get dry. All their stuff is going to get wet, especially now they've taken the tents away. It's not fair. It's inhumane."
