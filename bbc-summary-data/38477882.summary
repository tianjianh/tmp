Kevin Blackwell: Cardiff City assistant says it was right to call off Brighton game

Cardiff City assistant manager Kevin Blackwell says it was the right decision to call off their Championship game against Brighton on Friday.

The game against Chris Hughton's side was called off ahead of kick-off due to thick fog on the English south coast.
Many Bluebirds fans had made the 200-mile trip to Brighton but Blackwell said it was correct to call it off.
"There are no complaints from us whatsoever," Neil Warnock's assistant told BBC Radio Wales.
"Fans pay good money, but to only be able to see half a pitch isn't right. Without doubt it was the right decision.
"They gave it every chance. It was a 28,000 sell-out so they were desperate to get the fans here and wanted to get the game on and they gave it as long as they can.  It's just unfortunate."
The Bluebirds now play Aston Villa in their next fixture on Monday, 2 January.
Blackwell said the Brighton postponement gave Cardiff a bit more time to now focus on that Villa encounter.
Cardiff defender Lee Peltier has a thigh problem and midfielder, Peter Whittingham, has a calf strain which would have definitely ruled them out of the Brighton game but the pair could now be fit to face Villa.
"We have a few more days preparation for Villa now," Blackwell added.
"I don't think we're far away, I really don't, and we were looking forward to this game.
"What I'm pleased with since we've been here is that we're always in games, but we'd like to see us finish games off now and that's the next step to make sure we do that."
