David Goodwillie signs for Clyde until end of season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Scotland striker David Goodwillie has joined Clyde until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old agreed to leave Plymouth Argyle in January after being ruled a rapist by a civil court in Edinburgh.
Goodwillie last played on 14 January, scoring his only Plymouth goal as a late substitute.
He goes straight into the Clyde squad for Saturday's League Two visit to bottom side Cowdenbeath.
The visitors, who recently replaced manager Barry Ferguson with players Peter MacDonald and JP McGovern, are four points above the Central Park hosts.
Goodwillie, capped three times, started his career at Dundee United, moving to Blackburn Rovers for a Â£2m fee in 2011.
He also had a spell at Aberdeen, as well as loan periods at Crystal Palace, Blackpool and Ross County.
