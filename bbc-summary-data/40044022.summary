Det Con Elaine McIver, who was 43, worked for Cheshire Police.
The off-duty officer was among 22 people killed in the explosion at Manchester Arena on Monday.
Her family, who said her partner Paul was also injured in the blast, said "she will live in our hearts forever".
A further 64 people were injured and taken to hospital following the attack.
Ms McIver's family said in a statement: "Elaine was a much-loved daughter, sister, auntie, friend and colleague, the best we could ever have wished for."
"She was everyone's friend, thoughtful beyond belief, with an effervescent and outgoing personality."
Her family said she would have been "devastated" by her partner's injuries and they all wished him a speedy recovery.
The statement continued: "Elaine just loved life, and had a major love of music.
"Despite what has happened to her, she would want us all to carry on regardless and not be frightened by fear tactics: instead she regularly urged us all to rise up against it.
"Although we will all miss her beyond belief, we absolutely know she will live in our hearts forever."
Chief Constable Simon Byrne said: "It is with a heavy heart that I have to speak about the loss of a serving officer of ours in the Manchester Arena terrorist incident and all our thoughts are with her family at this time."
He said Det Con McIver joined the Cheshire Constabulary as a special 20 years ago and became a regular officer in 1998.
She then worked in Ellesmere Port, Warrington and in the economic crime unit at headquarters in Winsford before moving to the regional organised crime unit TITAN, the north west regional organised crime unit, in 2013.
Mr Byrne said: "Friends who knew her well have described her as big hearted, bubbly and a positive person."
He said the force was supporting her family and colleagues at "this very difficult time... as we come to terms with the loss of an officer in such tragic and heart-rending circumstances."
He added: "We will not let evil win."
Cheshire police and crime commissioner David Keane said there was "great sadness" felt by her friends and colleagues at Cheshire Constabulary and her current team at TITAN.
He said: "We will be doing everything we can to support Elaine's family and our officers and staff. It is at moments like this that we must remain unified and strong."
