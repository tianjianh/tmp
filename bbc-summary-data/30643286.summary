[SN]TITLE[SN]
Revised Guernsey motor width and CO2 emissions fees released

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Revised plans to introduce charges for Guernsey motorists based on the width and CO2 emissions of vehicles have been released.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Environment Department say the proposals could reduce fees for those buying a family or second-hand car.
The changes were made after a high-profile campaign from the Guernsey Motor Trades Association and a public protest involving 400 people.
The department had hoped to raise £4m but estimates that will fall by £1.6m.
Its report suggested the funding shortfall may "impact" on the overall transport strategy, which includes paid parking, an 18-month trial of a free bus service and a review of taxi services, with the money raised due to balance the investments made.
The department suggests that reducing funding towards a new bus depot or scaling back plans for pedestrian and cycling infrastructure improvements could offset the loss of income.
The registration charges are due to apply when vehicles are purchased or imported into the island with the main changes to the width and emission charges and a discount of up to 80% for second-hand cars imported into the island.
The proposals would see width duty being charged on vehicles wider than 1801mm, a rise from 1751mm; with staggered fees rising from £600 to £2,400 for those 1901mm and over.
The lowest band for CO2 emissions has been divided, with vehicles with engines rated with emissions between 121g/km and 130g/km carrying a £200 fee; rising to £3,200 for those rated 256g/km and bigger.
The plans for commercial vehicles remain unchanged, with only the emissions charge applying but with a £2,000 cap.
The proposals are due to be debated in January's States meeting and come into force from 1 March.
Correction 2 January 2015: This story has been amended to clarify the amount of money the department hoped to raise was £4m, not £2m as previous stated.
