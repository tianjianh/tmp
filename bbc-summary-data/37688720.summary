Wales pick injured Taulupe Faletau for autumn, Rhys Priestland left out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Number eight Taulupe Faletau has been included in Wales' squad for the autumn internationals despite a knee injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Faletau, 25, is one of three wildcard picks under the Welsh Rugby Union's senior player selection policy, along with George North and Jamie Roberts.
That means fly-half Rhys Priestland misses out, but there is a first call-up for Ospreys number 10 Sam Davies.
Full-back Leigh Halfpenny returns after a year out injured, while wing Alex Cuthbert is recalled.
There are also returns for props Rhys Gill and Scott Andrews with Scarlets loose-head Rob Evans out injured.
Ospreys lock Rory Thornton, 21, is the second uncapped player in the squad along with 23-year-old Davies.
Faletau is not expected back in training by club Bath until mid-November, but the back row is boosted by Dan Lydiate's return after the flanker missed the summer tour of New Zealand following shoulder surgery.
"Taulupe is still in his rehab process and has been working closely with Bath," Wales coach Rob Howley said.
"We hope he will be available in the later part of the campaign, but his experience will be vitally important to have around the squad."
Sam Warburton continues as captain despite having surgery on a cheek injury.
Wales open their autumn series against Australia on 5 November.
That game falls outside World Rugby's autumn Tests window and means Wales are without their England-based players for that match.
Howley also had to contend with the WRU's senior player selection policy, which means only three of Faletau, North, Roberts and Priestland could be picked as wildcards.
Japan-based lock Dominic Day, Gloucester prop Nicky Thomas and scrum-half Rhodri Williams are the others affected by the rule.
However, all other England and France-based players are freely available to Howley, who is deputising for 2017 British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland.
