Taylor Swift speaks for the first time about why she chose to remove all her music from music-streaming website Spotify.

Interviewed by Yahoo Music, the star said: "Music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment.
"And I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music."
But she added that she is still "open-minded about things".
She explained: "It didn't feel right to me. I felt like I was saying to my fans, if you create music someday, if you create a painting someday, someone can just walk into a museum, take it off the wall, rip off a corner off it, and it's theirs now and they don't have to pay for it."
Spotify released a statement last week saying the company hopes she changes her mind.
In July, Taylor wrote an article suggesting "music should not be free" and said she still believes there's a future for the album.
She was kind of proved right because her latest album, 1989, has topped the charts in America, selling over a million copies in just the first week.
We've contacted Swift's record label Universal Music to ask if she will ever get back together with Spotify. No response yet.
