Speaking to conservative activists, he said: "I'm leaving the campaign trail."
Dr Carson, a surgeon, had been an early front-runner but his campaign stalled in recent months after he performed badly on foreign affairs and questions about his background story.
He has not said which of the remaining four candidates he plans to endorse in the race for the Republican nomination.
