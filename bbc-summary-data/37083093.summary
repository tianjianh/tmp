More than 70 people had to be rescued by firefighters after a power surge brought Tyne & Wear's Metro system to a halt underground.

Passengers and a driver were stranded when the train stopped in a tunnel between the Central and Monument stations in Newcastle city centre.
Witnesses described seeing sparks and fire outside the carriage.
A total of seven trains came to a standstill between stations at about 13:00 BST, operator Nexus said.
One witness told the BBC: "The train just pulled up at Monument and about 20 minutes later it was like a firework display.
"It seemed like the cables had come down, all the tunnel just lit up, and then the lights just went out on the Metro. We were stuck down there for about 40 minutes."
Another added: "We just left Monument leaving towards Central Station and there were lots of sparks, and the train lit up really brightly, there was fire on the outside.
"All the power just went out, we were left in darkness."
Firefighters led those stuck on the train to safety. An investigation is under way to determine the cause of the power surge.
Trains have resumed across the system except for services between South Gosforth and Shiremoor in North Tyneside.
Nexus has advised passengers to use alternative methods of travel.
