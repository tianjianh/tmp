Gloucestershire Police said the A429 is likely to be shut between Cirencester and Northleach "until mid afternoon".
The force tweeted motorists should use alternative routes and not ignore the road closed signs. Motorists are being diverted via the A417, A436, and A40.
The crash happened near the village of Fossebridge in the early hours. Police are appealing for witnesses.
Melissa Bacon, who lives near the scene of the crash, said she heard "a loud bang like an explosion".
"I looked out of the window and couldn't believe what I saw. I saw a man on the floor who had come out of a car. He had flown quite a way out of the car.
"I went straight over to him and my partner went down the road to the other car that had fallen down a ditch."
Ms Bacon said a "heavy" car jack came through the window of her house when the crash happened at about 01:00 BST.
"The jack flew through the window and landed on the end of the sofa just past the dog bed, but luckily the dog was upstairs with us," she said.
