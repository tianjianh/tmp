Ms Brophy, who currently represents the Timperley ward, was chosen at a party meeting on Wednesday.
If elected next May, she said she would work "tirelessly" on issues such as public transport, housing and health.
Party leader Tim Farron said Ms Brophy offered an "exciting alternative to 'more of the same' in this election".
"Jane is an experienced and hard-working councillor who has won stunning victories against the odds," he said. "And this election is an opportunity for her to do it again."
Ms Brophy, who has been a councillor for 16 years and also works for the NHS, said she was "looking forward to... campaigning on issues that will make a big difference to our world-class city".
Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham was chosen in August to represent Labour in the election, while the Conservatives, UKIP and the Green Party have yet to select a candidate for next May's election.
