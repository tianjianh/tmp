The military-contracted civilian aircraft was ambushed after it went down in Faryab province, near the border with Turkmenistan, reports say.
Moldova said three of its nationals were on board. One is reported dead.
A spokesman for the US military mission in Afghanistan said they were not aware of any Americans on the aircraft.
A Taliban spokesman said 15 hostages in total had been taken.
"If the army doesn't stop [its rescue attempts] we will execute them," Damullah Wakil told AFP news agency.
Moldova's interior minister said two Moldovan pilots and a flight engineer were on the helicopter. One of them was killed along with two Afghan soldiers, reports say.
There has been heavy fighting in Faryab province in recent months, including an attack on the capital, Maimana, in October.
Elsewhere in Afghanistan on Tuesday, six civilians were killed in two explosions in the capital, Kabul, according an Interior Ministry spokesperson.
A senior tax office official was also killed by Taliban militants in Ghazni province, said local officials.
