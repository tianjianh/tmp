Forest Green were unable to fully capitalise on leaders Cheltenham's loss to Braintree as they drew at Tranmere.

A win would have taken Rovers top of the league, and Darren Carter's early left-footed goal was a great start.
But Tranmere roared back after half-time, with Jay Harris finishing after good work from Gary Taylor-Fletcher.
Forest Green's task was made difficult after Carter was sent off for a second bookable offence in the second half, but Tranmere could not capitalise.

Forest Green manager Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: "Under the circumstances, with Darren Carter getting sent off, it's a fantastic point for us.
"I think the two players just got their legs tangled but the referee was adamant that Carter tripped him - but either way, we showed a lot of character after going down to 10 men against a good side.
"We've got another big game to come against Aldershot at home, but it's been a great weekend."
