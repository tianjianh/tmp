Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has denied telling his players to refrain from having sex after midnight.

Midfielder Samir Nasri, who is out on loan at La Liga side Sevilla, claimed Guardiola imposed the rule so players get "a good night's sleep".
But the former Barcelona coach, 45, denied the claim and even encouraged his players to have more sex.
"It is impossible to play good football if you don't make sex with your partner," said Guardiola.
Frenchman Nasri had not been allowed to train with the main group of City players during pre-season because he had returned overweight.
He told French TV programme L'Equipe du Soir that Guardiola "wants his players to be slim and fit" and claimed Guardiola told Barcelona forward Lionel Messi he would avoid muscle injuries by not having sex after midnight.
But the ex-Bayern Munich coach said: "I never did that (ban it) and I would never ban that. If you are doing it... better players."
Guardiola is also reported to have banned wi-fi at the club's training ground in order to build better team cohesion, while defender Gael Clichy said the squad have been told to avoid pizza, some juice and certain "heavy food".
