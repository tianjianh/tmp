The Australian singer, 48, and English actor Joshua Sasse, 28, announced their engagement earlier this year.
The couple have been vocal supporters of the "Say I Do Down Under" marriage equality campaign.
The government has proposed holding a public vote on same-sex marriage in February 2017.
Mr Sasse, who helped launch the "yes" campaign at the weekend, said the pair would like a wedding in Melbourne, "but we will not get married until this law has passed in Australia".
"When I found out that gay marriage was illegal in Australia, I was astounded," he told Australia's Seven Network.
"I simply can't fathom on any level, whether it's moral or religious or anything, that I have the right to get married and to marry the person that I love and that somebody else doesn't because of their sexual orientation."
