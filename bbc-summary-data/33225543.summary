Welshpool residents offered 'flushing habits' advice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents in a "sewer blockage hotspot" in Powys are to be given advice on improving their flushing habits.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Waste water teams from Severn Trent Water will be visiting Welshpool to speak to people about what they should and should not flush down the toilet.
The company said since 2011 it had dealt with 143 blockages in the Oldford Rise, Oldford Close and Berriew Road areas.
A majority of the blockages were caused by sanitary products becoming stuck.
So-called "flushable" wipes were another major cause of blockages, the company said.
Jacqueline Whitehead, customer and community lead for Severn Trent said: "We know that there are certain areas in our region where sewer blockage numbers are much higher than anywhere else.
"Welshpool is one of those places.
"Sewer flooding is one of the most horrible things that can happen to our customers and we don't want people to suffer in this way - it's entirely preventable. "The education programme has been planned for Monday and Tuesday
