The launderette was, at one time, a common sight on Britain's high streets, with more than 12,000 in operation during the 1980s, though today that number is down to 3,000 or so.
To some, they are a place to catch up with local news and gossip, acting almost as a community centre. For others, they are a simply a place to complete a weekly chore.
Green's pictures, taken in East London, capture the diversity of those who use the service, from first-timers whose own washing machines have broken down, to others who rely on it for their washing.
"Mostly people were extremely friendly, one lady thought I was 'a bit strange' but, in general, I was surprised how open people were to having their photo taken," says Green. "Many of the women mentioned they'd come out without make-up and I even saw one man in his pyjamas there. It's not a place you would dress up for."
Alongside the images, Green commissioned London-based music producer Hugo Slime to create a soundtrack mixing the noise of the machines with pieces of conversation in the launderette.
"The sounds of the launderette are so rhythmic and the snippets of conversation that you hear between the noise of the machines seemed ripe for making into an audio track," says Green.
"I often work with oral history and have short interviews alongside work, but in this instance I wanted to take that further and make a soundtrack that you listen to and immerse yourself in whilst you're in the laundry.
"The soundtrack creates an atmosphere and I think, encourages visitors to listen and soak up the atmosphere as well as look."
