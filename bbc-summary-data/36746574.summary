Thomas's birthday cake design beat off fierce competition from more than 2,000 school children across south Wales.
The first strike of the medal will be presented to the Queen to wish her a happy birthday.
The pupil attended the Llantrisant-based mint in to see how and where his medal was made.
As part of his prize, his class will join a schools workshop at The Royal Mint Experience, the organisation's visitor attraction.
The Royal Mint Museum's education manager, Lucy-Ann Pickering, said: "We would like to thank the primary school children of south Wales for their overwhelming response to this competition."
In 1967, the Royal Mint moved to Llantrisant in Rhondda Cynon Taff from London's Tower Hill where it makes billions of coins a year.
