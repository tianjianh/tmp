[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bruce Dewey, 36, was spotted by Sussex Police as he drove his Honda Legend in Tarring Road in Chichester in February.
He was known to only have a provisional driving licence and so was followed. He was requested to stop but carried on for about 50 minutes.
During the chase he dialled 999 and asked police to stop following him. He was jailed for dangerous driving.
One police car was put out of action during the chase. Dewey was brought to a stop on the A27 in Sompting on 22 February damaging two more police cars.
PC Peter De Silvo said: "For nearly 50 minutes he refused to stop for police units, avoided stop sticks deployed to try and burst his tyres and at one point called 999 and asked us to stop following him."
Chichester Crown Court heard Dewey admit to dangerous driving, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence and driving without third-party insurance.
He was jailed on 8 August for 15 months and disqualified from driving for three years and will be required to take an extended retest.
