Norwich's Hewett, 18, led by a set and a break but eventually lost 4-6 6-4 6-2 to the Frenchman.
The result means Briton Gordon Reid must wait until Saturday to see if he will be the year-end world number one.
Reid, 25, will take on Houdet in the last four with the world number one spot at stake.
The Scot easily won his third round-robin match, defeating Dutchman Maikel Scheffers 6-1 6-2 to secure his place in the semi-finals.
British women's number two Lucy Shuker went out with a 6-2 7-5 defeat by world number one Jiske Griffioen of the Netherlands.
Hewett, who won both singles and doubles silver at the Paralympic Games in Rio, needed to beat Houdet both to reach the last four in his maiden Masters appearance and ensure Reid earned the world number one ranking.
But, although he looked to be in control, he let Houdet back in.
"I got off to such a great start and to lead in the second with a break and lose, it is tough," Hewett told BBC Sport.
"There are a lot of good things that could have come from that match - not just the prize money and the ranking points, but also the confidence, and it would have been such a great result.
"It hurts but it just makes me more motivated."
Reid, who is using a new wheelchair this week, believes the hard work he has put in since winning singles gold and doubles silver in Rio is paying dividends.
"I'm happy with the way I've been playing here and I still feel like I'm improving," he said.
"It will be a tough match against Stephane - on these courts you have to take the ball early and commit."
