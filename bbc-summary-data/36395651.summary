More than 80 firefighters have been tackling the fire at the Four Winds Industrial Estate in Haynes since 23:15 BST on Thursday.
Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue said it had been working in "extremely difficult" conditions.
The blaze resulted in part of the A6, a major route into Luton, being closed.

A fire service spokesman said that while the fire was now under control, it could burn for up to five days.
Initial reports showed several cylinders, including acetylene, were at the premises and crews had to prevent the fire spreading to them.
Firefighters are likely to remain at the site throughout the day and the A6 between the A507 at Clophill and the Haynes Church End turning will remain closed.
Deputy chief fire officer Glen Ranger said: "Many hazards have been encountered throughout the night.
"However the professionalism of our crews, our neighbouring firefighters and other emergency partners, has resulted in the saving of a number of properties."
An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.
