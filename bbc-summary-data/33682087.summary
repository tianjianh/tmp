Women's Ashes 2015: Charlotte Edwards says series 'wide open'

England captain Charlotte Edwards says the Women's Ashes is still "wide open" despite Australia claiming a 4-2 lead with a win in the third ODI.

Australia won by 89 runs at Worcester and victory in the Test match at Canterbury next month would put them on the brink of regaining the Ashes.
But Edwards said: "Test cricket is a format that suits our style, and we will be looking to come back strongly.
"This Ashes series is still wide open - there is a long way to go yet."
If all the remaining matches - comprising one Test and three Twenty20 internationals - are completed, England must win the Test and one T20, draw the Test and win two T20s, or win all three T20s to retain the Ashes.
Edwards admitted England were second best in the ODI series, which Australia won 2-1.
"Unfortunately we have been a bit inconsistent and ultimately outplayed during the last two matches," she said.
"Australia have shown why they are the current world champions in this format.
"We now have a few days off to recharge, before joining back up as a squad at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough to prepare for the Test match."
