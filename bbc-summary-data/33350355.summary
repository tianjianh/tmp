Wales could benefit from the expansion of Heathrow Airport if direct links can bring visitors in more quickly, the deputy tourism minister has said.

The Airports Commission has backed a third Heathrow runway, saying it will add Â£147bn in economic growth and 70,000 jobs by 2050.
Reacting to the news, Ken Skates said it was a better option than expanding Gatwick as it was nearer to Wales.
But he added that he was "very keen" that Cardiff Airport continued to grow.
"Air traffic is increasing," Mr Skates told the Jason Mohammad programme on BBC Radio Wales.
"If we are going to capture as many visitors, tourists and businesses as possible on this island then it's essential we are able to offer the access points in to the country.
"That's why I'm very keen Cardiff Airport continues to grow and get support and continues to enable people to come to Wales."
On the matter of Heathrow's likely expansion, he said: "It is essential we get smooth direct links from Heathrow to Wales - that could include swifter journey times as well from the airport direct to Wales."
In 2013 an appeal to expand Cardiff and other regional airports to ease the pressure on London was rejected by the Airports Commission, which said there was "little scope" to move the demand to other parts of the UK.
