Budget retailer Poundland plans to create hundreds of jobs in Wigan by building a distribution centre, the council has announced.

The site, at the South Lancs Industrial Estate in Ashton-in-Makerfield, would serve the company's network of shops across the north-west of England.
If approved, it would be the "single biggest jobs boost ever" for Wigan Borough, said a spokesman.
The new centre has the potential to create up to 800 new jobs, it said.
The development would be built on the former Georgia Pacific land on Lockett Road.
Wigan Council's Cabinet Member for Economy, Councillor David Molyneux, said: "This is fantastic news for Wigan Borough and shows why we are a major player in the creation of a Northern Powerhouse."
A wide range of skilled jobs both full-time and part-time as well as apprenticeships will be created, said the council.
Cllr Molyneux added: "This will be the largest single employment creating application that we have dealt with since the authority was formed in 1974 and in my view would rank alongside Heinz coming to Wigan in the 1950s."
