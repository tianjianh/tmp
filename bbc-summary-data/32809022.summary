Highland shed with 'house sheep' in TV contest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A wooden building in the Highlands with its own "house sheep" has been entered into Channel 4's Shed of the Year competition.

The property at Inshriach House, an Edwardian country house on an estate near Aviemore, will feature on the programme next month.
The winner is decided by a public vote.
Inshriach House's owner Walter Micklethwait hopes Dash, a lamb who shares a bed with a dog called Monty, will win them some extra support.
Mr Micklethwait, who built the shed with help from his girlfriend Lizzy Westman, has dubbed the lamb a "house sheep".
He said: "Dash was rejected by her mother so has been living in our house.
"She is 12 days old and thinks she is a dog."
