[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's that time of the year again - the grand final of Britain's Got Talent!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The acts have been battling it out this week in the semi-finals to grab a place in Saturday night's final.
But who will be crowned the winner of 2017? Will it be one of the youngest contestants eight-year-old Issy or nine-year-old Ned?
Or will it be pensioners Malcom and Henry who together form the Pensionalities?

Daliso Chaponda the comedian should win because he is unique and a comedian has never won before. I think he's hilarious!

I think DNA should win because they're amazing! And also Issy because she's great at magic.

My favourite this year is MerseyGirls, but I think that DNA will win!

I think who should win Britain's Got Talent is Matt Edwards because he's sooo funny and he's a magician as well which I think is amazing. I think Matt Edwards deserves to be crowned BGT 2017 winner.
Roma, 11, Torfaen
I think that Issy should win because her magic tricks are amazing!
Bethany, 8, Cambridgeshire
I think either Issy, Matt, or Ned should win.
