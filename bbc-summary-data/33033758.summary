[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland salvaged a draw against the Republic of Ireland to maintain a two-point lead over their opponents in Euro 2016 qualifying Group D.

Shaun Maloney's deflected shot off John O'Shea just after half-time clawed the Scots back into a match they had barely been part of in the opening period.
Jon Walters had given the Irish a deserved lead, tapping in from an offside position.
The result leaves Scotland third, on 11 points, and Ireland fourth on nine.
Poland lead the group on 14 points, with world champions Germany second, two points above the Scots, after thrashing Gibraltar 7-0.
The result in Dublin certainly favours the visitors, particularly after they were under the cosh for the first 45 minutes.
Republic boss Martin O'Neill had spoken all week about the need to begin the match on the front foot and from the outset the hosts looked sharper, stronger and hungrier for victory.
They snapped into challenges, pressurising the Scots who appeared nervous, none more so than defender Craig Forsyth, starting his first competitive international.
The Irish exploited that, with Seamus Coleman consistently finding space and time on the right, the only saving grace the full-back's poor delivery.
David Marshall had not had a save to make, however, until he tipped over a Daryl Murphy header.
From the resultant Robbie Brady corner, Murphy again forced a save from the keeper, but this time it fell beautifully for Walters to tap in, with the officials failing to notice he was in an offside position.
It was no more than the Republic deserved, but the match turned on the first moment of class from Scotland, seconds after the interval.
Maloney combined with Steven Naismith and the man whose goal beat the Irish in November curled the ball goalwards and into the back of the net via O'Shea's back.
That buoyed the Scots, though they could have fallen behind again minutes later, Marshall blocking Murphy's shot with his legs.
The tension was palpable as the match wore on, with the home side still dominating, though Given had to claw away a deflected Ikechi Anya cross that might have found a way into the net.
But to the anguish of the majority of the crowd inside the Aviva Stadium, there was to be no late goal as there had been here against Poland.
At the end of a pulsating battle, Scotland remain better positioned to challenge for an automatic top-two qualification spot for next summer's finals in France.
But the major winners of the day in Group D were leaders Poland, who are now three points above the Scots, after beating Georgia 4-0. Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in the final two minutes of the game.
