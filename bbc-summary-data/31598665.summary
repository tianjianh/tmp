The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) list, is based on physical sales, downloads and streaming stats - despite not having any music on Spotify.
One Direction, who topped the list in 2013, slipped to second in 2014.
The top three was completed by Ed Sheeran, who read this morning's weather forecast on the Radio 1 breakfast show.
The list is dominated by Brits with Coldplay (4th), Pink Floyd (7th) and Sam Smith (8th) also in the top 10.
One Direction, who have been the top UK act on the list for the last three years, were the only British act on the list last year.
In November, Swift, 25, removed her entire back catalogue from music-streaming service Spotify saying: "I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music."
The 25-year-old said that she was still "open-minded about things" but said having her music on the streaming site "didn't feel right".
Her fifth studio album 1989 went on to debut at number one in America's Billboard chart and became the singer's second UK number one.
The album, which the singer said was predicated to sell 650,000 in its opening week, sold 1.29m copies in its first seven days.
Those sales made her the only act to have three albums sell more than one million copies in their first week on sale.
Swift, who will play at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Norwich later this year, is one of eight new entries in the IFPI's top 10 compared to last year's list.
One Direction and Katy Perry, who has fallen four places from fifth to ninth, are the only artists to keep their place.
The other names on the list - Michael Jackson (sixth), Katy Perry (ninth) and Beyonce (10th) - are all American except for Australian rock group AC/DC - who came fourth.
The IFPI, which only includes musical acts on the list, said that the soundtrack to Disney's Frozen would have topped Swift.
