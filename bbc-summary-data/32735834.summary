The work - called Golden - is taller than the Angel of the North and stands on the former Goldendale ironworks site in the Chatterley Valley.
It is made of corten steel and glass prisms and has LED lights that will shine at night.
Paul Bailey, Stoke-on-Trent City Council's culture and events manager, said the sculpture "looked fantastic" and would put the area on the map.
The sculpture was designed by artist Wolfgang Buttress.
It is flame-shaped, to symbolise the amber glow from the ironworks, which the community called "the flame that never dies".
"The sculpture aims to recreate that sense of atmosphere," the council said.
"It is one of the tallest sculptures in the country."
It added the ??130,000 sculpture was one metre (three feet) taller than the Angel of the North, Antony Gormley's acclaimed work in Gateshead.
"This is a real red letter moment for Tunstall and Stoke-on-Trent," Mr Bailey said.
"The sculpture looks absolutely fantastic and is going to put the area on the map.
"A lot of people will still remember when the steelworks were here, know people who worked there and still picture how it was lit up at night because of the flames.
"We want it to provoke fond memories of the area but also act as a landmark for hope and a bright future across the city."
