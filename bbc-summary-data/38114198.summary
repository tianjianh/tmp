[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 1-0 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere climbed to the National League summit, but needed a last-gasp goal to beat strugglers York at Prenton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Norwood powered in a header at the back post deep into injury time to break the Minstermen's hearts.
The visitors threatened to turn up the books from the outset, Rhys Murphy warming the gloves of Scott Davies from distance.
Tranmere found it hard to assert themselves, though Kyle Letheren also had to be alert to turn aside a Norwood header.
York also threatened after the break when debutant Jon Parkin attempted to lob Davies, but the stopper back-pedalled excellently to tip over.
Despite York's positive efforts, they extended their dismal sequence to 18 matches without a win.
