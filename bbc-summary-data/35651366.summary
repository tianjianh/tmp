Brothers Arshid and Basharat Hussain were found guilty of multiple rapes and indecent assaults in the South Yorkshire town.
A third brother, Bannaras Hussain, 36, admitted 10 charges including rape and indecent assault prior to the trial.

Two women, Karen MacGregor, 58, and Shelley Davies, 40, were convicted of conspiracy to procure prostitutes and false imprisonment.
All six will be sentenced on Friday.

During the trial, jurors heard how 15 victims were "targeted, sexualised and in some instances subjected to acts of a degrading and violent nature" between 1987 and 2003.
Arshid Hussain was found guilty of 23 of the 28 charges he faced, while Basharat Hussain was convicted of all 15 charges.
Ali was found not guilty of charges of rape, indecent assault and procuring a girl under 21 to have unlawful sex with another.
Majid Bostan, 37 and Sajid Bostan, 38, who are also brothers, were cleared of all charges at Sheffield Crown Court.
Some of the women abused by the gang sat in the court as the verdicts were returned by the jury, some holding hands with each other.
Det Ch Insp Martin Tait said the verdicts were a "crucial milestone for those victims who have endured years of violence and horrific sexual abuse at the hands of these vile individuals".
He said: "I can't begin to put into word the trauma that these women experienced at such a young age.
"I'm pleased that their voices have finally been heard and believed and that those responsible have been publicly held to account for their crimes."
One victim, who is now 43, went to live with MacGregor after she was befriended by her and Davies in the late 1980s.
While she lived there, she told the court, Asian men were brought to the house and she was told to have sex with them in exchange for being looked after.
A second, now 36, was subjected to regular sex attacks by Arshid Hussain - also known as Mad Ash - who passed her round to other men when she was in the care of the local authority.
Peter Mann, from the Crown Prosecution Service said: "These defendants in their differing ways targeted these teenage girls because they were vulnerable and then facilitated their systematic sexual abuse.
"They were mocked and spat at, some of the violence was extreme and protracted.
Arshid Hussain in particular had "played a key role" in the abuse, Mr Mann added.
"He was domineering and in some instances brutal in his treatment of the girls.
"He used them for his own gratification then often prostituted them or passed them on to his brothers or associates."
A youth worker in the town, who wrote an unpublished report for the Home Office in 2002 on child sexual exploitation, said the men had considered themselves above the law.
Adele Gladman said: "They were being allowed to do it completely unchallenged and I think that did definitely give them a feeling of invincibility.
"I don't think I have ever encountered the levels of sadism and torture and sheer cruelty that we were encountering against children."
Ian Thomas, strategic director for Children and Young People's Services at Rotherham Council, paid tribute to the "tremendous bravery and fortitude" shown by the victims during the two-month long trial.
He said the verdicts had brought "some justice" but there was "more to be done" and urged other victims of abuse to come forward.
"If you have suffered abuse in the past or indeed are suffering from abuse or exploitation now, step forward. I urge you. I implore you to have confidence in a new Rotherham partnership today."
The scandal of the extent of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham emerged with the publication of a report by Professor Alexis Jay in August 2014.
She found at least 1,400 children had been raped, trafficked and groomed in the town over a 16-year period and that a number of perpetrators were adult men of a Pakistani heritage.
Council and police officials had failed to act, the report added.
The report prompted several resignations including South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commission, Shaun Wright, who had previously been a Rotherham councillor in charge of children's services between 2005 and 2010.
It also led to the government appointing commissioners to run Rotherham Council.
