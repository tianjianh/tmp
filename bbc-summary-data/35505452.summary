Saturday's fixture between Scotland and England will be beamed beyond the stratosphere and into the International Space Station, where British astronaut Tim Peake will tune into the action.
The BBC and European Space Agency will send live coverage 400km above the Earth's surface to provide Major Tim a view of the action from Murrayfield.
Peake, who blasted into space on 15 December and is the first Briton to complete a spacewalk, said: "I know that space is a hostile environment, but Murrayfield for the old Calcutta Cup - that's a whole different matter.
"And Scotland has a fire in their belly - you could hear their World Cup rage from up here in space. May the best team win. Come on England!"
The BBC's Six Nations coverage begins at 13:30 GMT on BBC One with France against Italy, followed by Scotland hosting England in the championship's oldest fixture.
