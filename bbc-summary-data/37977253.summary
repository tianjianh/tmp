The incidents, which occurred overnight between Sunday and Monday, took place in Granton, Boswall, Trinity and Hawthornvale.
The cars targeted all had their windows smashed or had attempts made to smash them.
About 25 incidents have been reported to police, however there may have been other vehicles damaged.
Due to the number of incidents and the scale of the damage, officers are treating the incidents as linked and are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
Insp Shane McKenna, of Drylaw Police Station, said: "This is an appalling number of vandalisms and the sheer scale of the damage caused is completely unacceptable.
"Not only has a lot of damage and inconvenience been caused to a large number of people, it has also caused a number of police resources in the north of Edinburgh to be diverted in order to investigate.
"We are eager to trace those responsible as soon as possible. We would ask that anyone who was in the north Edinburgh area on the evening of Sunday, November 13, and saw this damage take place, to get in touch with us at their earliest convenience."
