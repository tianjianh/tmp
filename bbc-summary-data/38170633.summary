The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has been informed.
Lynda McWilliams, the council's member for leisure health and wellbeing, said: "As soon as we were contacted by Public Health England, the showers used by the customer were closed down and test samples taken.
"All the necessary bodies were informed while we awaited the results of the tests which were carried out at an independent laboratory.
"The council's corporate health and safety advisor is currently working to find and eliminate the source of the bacteria."
This will involve dismantling and disinfecting the shower heads, flushing the system and taking more samples.
