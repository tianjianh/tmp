Friday's winning numbers were 01, 21, 26, 40 and 50 and the winning Lucky Star numbers were 02 and 04.
The winner matched all seven numbers to scoop £61,102,443 - the fourth, and biggest, jackpot win in the UK in 2016.
Euromillions began in 2004 and the biggest prize in UK history is the £161m won by North Ayrshire couple Chris and Colin Weir in 2011.
UK ticket-holders won jackpots of £24.6m and £24m in February this year, and £51.8m in April.
Tickets for Euromillions are sold in nine countries - the UK, Austria, Belgium, France, the Irish Republic,  Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland - with ticket-holders in all those countries trying to win a share of the same jackpot each week.
National Lottery operator Camelot runs Euromillions in the UK.
