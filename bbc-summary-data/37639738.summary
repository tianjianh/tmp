US Election 2016: #repealthe19th tweets urge US women to be denied vote

Calls for women to be denied their right to vote have trended on Twitter as polls suggested Donald Trump would win if only men could cast ballots in next month's White House election.

The Republican nominee's supporters were accused of tweeting #repealthe19th - a reference to the US constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage less than 100 years ago.
The hashtag went viral after polls suggested Mr Trump would win election if only men cast ballots.
Mr Trump has struggled to win over female voters, especially since a recent tape emerged of his sexually aggressive boasts.
The hashtag began trending after FiveThirtyEight, a political number-crunching blog, tweeted two polls which showed what the outcome of the presidential election would be if only women voted, and if only men voted.
He found that if the election only counted the female vote, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would win the presidency with 458 electoral votes and Mr Trump a meagre 80.
If only men voted in the presidential election, Mr Trump would win the election with 350 electoral votes and Mrs Clinton only 188.
A candidate must win 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.

Some of the tweets calling for a woman's right to vote to be repealed seemed in earnest.
The backlash was quick and unforgiving, with many blaming it on Trump supporters, labelling them ignorant and predictable.
But a few Trump supporters pointed out most of the tweets seemed to express outrage at, rather than support for, the hashtag.
Others, however, seemed to be in despair at what they see as the sorry state of America.
