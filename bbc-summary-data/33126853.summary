[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some 700 people have taken part in a "special pilgrimage" across part of Wiltshire to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Reverend Nicholas Holtam, announced in May that he would be staging the "fun family day out".
He had invited people from across the diocese and the region to join him.
The 4km (2.5 miles) walk followed the same route the document itself was taken on in the 13th Century.
The pilgrimage started at the old cathedral, Old Sarum, and continued to the current one, where walkers were treated to afternoon tea.
Salisbury Cathedral is home to one of the "finest preserved" of the four original copies of the historic charter, Bishop Holtam said.
The other surviving copies of Magna Carta are held by the British Library and Lincoln Cathedral.
Sealed by King John at Runnymede in 1215, it is seen as the foundation of constitutional law in England.
