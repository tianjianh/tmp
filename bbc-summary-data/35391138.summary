The two suspects, who had their faces covered, demanded cash at Lloyds Bank in Headington in a "frightening" crime, police said.
Thames Valley Police said the robbery took place at 10:30 GMT at the London Road branch.
One man was believed to have been carrying a firearm. They made off in a white BMW 1-Series.
The first suspect is described as white, 5ft 7in (1.7m) and of slim build.
The other is black and 6ft 2ins (1.8m).
Both men are thought to be in their 20s.
Det Sgt Parsons said: "This was a frightening crime which took place in broad daylight on a Saturday morning.
"Although no one was injured, staff and customers are obviously shocked by the experience."
