Burton Albion are hoping to re-sign teenage midfielder Hamza Choudhury from Leicester City, says boss Nigel Clough.

The 18-year-old helped Burton win automatic promotion to the Championship last season, playing 13 games during a three-month loan spell.
On his return from Leicester's training camp in Austria last week, Choudhury watched from the stands as Burton beat Stoke in a friendly match on Saturday.
"We'd love to get him back if we can, so that's ongoing," said Clough.
He told BBC Radio Derby: "We have asked about Hamza coming back, he had contractual issues to sort out, but now he has got back from Austria training with Premier League champions."
