The pair made the announcement through what can only be described as a gushy YouTube video.
Set to music during an ultrasound scan, you see the pair with delighted smiles, rubbing noses.
The baby is due in May this year. The couple shared the news in the video after rumours of the pregnancy surfaced on Friday in a gossip column.
"Today the media speculated about some big news in our life. So we decided to share it with you ourselves," the couple said in the video posted Saturday on the YouTube account of Macklemore's musical partner, Ryan Lewis.
Within hours of the video being posted fans of the Grammy-award winner, whose real name is Ben Haggerty, shared tributes and best wishes for the happy couple.
