Election 2015: Tories pressed on child benefit plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chancellor has come under growing pressure to reveal plans for child benefit as he attacked Labour over tax.

George Osborne repeated claims that working families would pay £3,000 more in tax under a Labour government.
Labour's Ed Miliband said the figures were "made up".
And Mr Osborne was pressed on whether his party planned to roll child benefit into Universal Credit - which Labour claimed would mean more than four million families losing £1,000 a year.
Throughout the day, senior Conservatives have been repeatedly asked to identify a specific cut from the £12bn they have committed to reducing from the welfare budget.
Asked a number of times at a press conference, Mr Osborne reiterated the Conservatives' stance that they have set out their principles on how to make further cuts.
"You can look at our track record, the £21bn we've saved in this parliament. You can look at the principles we'll apply to future such savings. It's perfectly achievable.
"Anyone who thinks the job of reforming welfare has somehow been completed, I think, is mistaken.
"We want to go on creating a welfare system that rewards those who work and the aspirations of families and protects the most vulnerable."
Mr Osborne also refused to rule out explicitly wrapping child benefit into Universal Credit.
This election issue includes access to benefits (apart from pensions), poverty and inequality.
"If we wanted to put child benefit into the Universal Credit, we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit," he told reporters.
"We've got a track record. We've got a plan based on clear principles. I've given you a very clear answer, and you have to be a contortionist to think I've not given you a pretty clear answer."
The Conservative exchequer secretary, Priti Patel, was also asked if this wrapping of child benefit would be used as part of savings to the welfare budget.
"We've made it clear and we've said that we need to find £12bn in welfare savings", she said, adding that such a wrapping was "not our policy... and there are other ways in which we can find those savings".
Universal Credit is the coalition government's welfare reform which aims to simplify the benefits system by rolling a string of benefits and tax credits into one payment.
It is being rolled out in stages after being hit by delays and IT problems but will eventually take in jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, income support, child tax credit, working tax credit and housing benefit.
During his press conference, Mr Osborne attacked Labour's economic plans, saying the party would create a "permanent, never-ending budget deficit".
Labour would spend more than they raised year after year which would lead to them borrowing £30bn a year to fund capital spending, he added.
He repeated the claim of a £3,000 tax hike for working families, a figure which had been dismissed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies as "unhelpful".
Speaking during a question-and-answer session at a science park in Bristol, Mr Miliband said of the tax figures: "They're wrong on every level… they're made up.
"All it shows is that they've got nothing to say about the future of our country.
"I think it is the most negative, poor and pathetic campaign being run by the Conservative Party,"
Mr Osborne also said earlier that Tony Blair was doing the Conservative Party a "very good service" by "advertising the Conservatives' promise of a referendum on European Union membership".
"Mr Blair will do the minimum asked of him during the election campaign to avoid being blamed for Labour's defeat 'when it comes'," Mr Osborne told reporters.
He also claimed Mr Blair's refusal to share a platform with Mr Miliband showed that Mr Blair thought he was "weak".
Mr Blair made his speech in his former constituency of Sedgefield in County Durham, while Mr Miliband was in the west of England.
Mr Blair "can speak for himself," Mr Miliband said. Mr Blair's intervention was "quite important" on its own terms, he added.
