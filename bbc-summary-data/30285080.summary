[SN]TITLE[SN]
Your pictures: What's inside your fridge?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As part of the BBC World Service's A Richer World season, we're exploring the impact the refrigerator has had on our daily lives and we want you to get involved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A fridge is one of the first things people buy as they step out of poverty. And as more people escape extreme poverty, we want to hear your stories of how a fridge has affected your life.
Do you remember your first fridge? How did you feel when you bought it? Has having a fridge made you eat more or less healthily?
Or maybe you don't have a fridge at all - and if so, what are the other ways you can keep food chilled? Maybe you share a fridge with neighbours or even your community.
But fridges are not just for food - medicine, bait, film negatives. What else do you use your fridge for?
Send us your stories, photos or videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or upload them directly from your computer using the link to the right and make sure you label them with the subject My fridge.
Upload your photos and video
Please remember to add your name and a caption: who, what, where and when should be enough, though the more details you give, the better your chance of being selected.
Pictures should be sent as Jpeg files. They shouldn't be larger than 5Mb and ideally much smaller: around 1Mb is fine or you can resize your pictures to 1,000 pixels across and then save as a Jpeg.
Please see our terms and conditions.
Finally, when taking photos, please do not endanger yourself or others, take unnecessary risks or infringe any laws.
