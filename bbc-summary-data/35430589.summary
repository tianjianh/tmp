[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A yellow warning for heavy rain is in place from 14:00 GMT on Thursday until 10:00 GMT on Friday.
A yellow warning means to be aware of possible disruption.
However, an amber warning for wind comes into force from 03:00 GMT on Friday until 10:00 GMT with gusts of up to 80 mph possible.
An area of low pressure is expected to move quickly east across the Atlantic, bringing spells of heavy rain to Northern Ireland during Thursday and Friday, particularly in the west.
Within the yellow warning area, 10-20mm of rain is likely to fall quite widely with up to 40mm over high ground.
A yellow warning for wind comes into force from 01:00 GMT on Friday until 18:00 GMT.
Winds are expected to gust up to 60 mph and possibly 70-80 mph in exposed locations and also locally inland as a squally cold front moves east during the morning.
The amber warning means to be prepared for disruption.
Winds are expected to gust at 60-70 mph, possibly up to 80 mph along exposed coasts and over hills.
A yellow warning for ice and snow comes into force from 21:00 GMT on Friday until 15:00 GMT on Saturday.
About 1-3 cm of snow is possible and primarily above 200 metres.
Road surface temperatures are expected to fall below freezing overnight into Saturday morning, leading to a risk of icy patches forming.

A number of roads in Northern Ireland have been affected by flooding, more information is available via TrafficwatchNI
