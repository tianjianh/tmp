Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo might have been "angry" with his recent form before his hat-trick in Saturday's 4-1 win at Alaves, says team-mate Marcelo.

Ronaldo had scored twice in his six La Liga matches before the Alaves game, in which he also missed a penalty.
"Cristiano is fine. Perhaps he was a bit angry before because forwards live to score goals," said left-back Marcelo, who was captain on Saturday.
"He's happy with the goals but more so with the three points."
Coach Zinedine Zidane said: "It's great that Cristiano Ronaldo scored, and that he did so three times is even better. We are happy with his performance.
"We are always going to ask that he scores goals but he was good in every aspect. Let's hope it stays that way. He has a lot of patience and showed today that with hard work anything is possible."
Real are top of La Liga, two points above Barcelona and another clear of Atletico Madrid and Sevilla.
