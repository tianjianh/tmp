The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the "incident of indiscipline" at HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey on Monday was quickly resolved.
All five officers were treated for minor injuries and six inmates have been moved out of the prison.
The category B prison houses around 1,100 prisoners, almost half of whom are serving life sentences.
"The prison is operating as normal and an investigation will now take place," the MoJ spokesman said.
