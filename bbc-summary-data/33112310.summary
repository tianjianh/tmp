The pair, who led the Dons to Scottish League Cup success in 2014, have signed deals until 2019.
"I don't want our tenure with Aberdeen to be remembered for having lifted one trophy," said former Scotland international McInnes, 43.
"While we've achieved some progress, we still have a long way to go."
McInnes, who took up the reins at Pittodrie in March 2013, will sign the contract once he returns from holiday next week.
He added: "Tony and I are totally committed to bringing as much success as we possibly can to this club and, while we've already achieved some progress, we still have a long way to go.
"This is a great club, with great fans and a fantastic squad of players and I'm looking forward to what promises to be an exciting season ahead."
Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne said the news was a welcome boost for the club's supporters.
"Derek and Tony have made tremendous progress in the two years they have been here and I'm absolutely delighted that they want to remain to see through the job that they've started," Milne added.
