They raised the alarm at 06:51 after finding the ground floor of their house in Creetown under three feet (90cm) of water.
A specialist water rescue team from Newton Stewart managed to get into the house through a first floor window.
The residents were taken to safety on an inflatable "rescue sled", according to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.
Firefighters also used specialist pumps to remove water from the house.
A spokesman for the fire service said the water ran into the building after large trees and debris blocked water running under a footbridge.
He said neighbouring properties and cars in Mill Street were also affected.
Dumfries and Galloway Council have now removed the debris from under the bridge, he added.
