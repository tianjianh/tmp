Rotherham United 3-2 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham survived a second-half comeback by Wigan to close the gap on their nearest rivals at the bottom of the Championship to five points.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took the lead when Aimen Belaid slammed home from close range.
Danny Ward's shot deflected off Richard Wood before going in and Dan Burn then turned the ball into his own net.
Yanic Wildschut pulled one back with a shot from the edge of the area before Jordi Gomez struck from 20 yards to make it 3-2, but the Millers held on.
The visitors produced a stirring performance after the break but three first-half goals were enough to leave them with a fifth consecutive defeat.
Belaid put the hosts in front early on, firing in from inside the box, and they were 2-0 up after 32 minutes when Ward's shot was diverted past Jussi Jaaskelainen by Wood.
Tom Adeyemi then hit the bar with a 25-yard effort, before the Millers claimed a third when Ward's shot was saved by Jaaskelainen before bouncing into the net off Latics defender Burn.
Wigan were a different side after the break but, despite Wildschut and Gomez reducing the deficit to a single goal, they were left empty handed after Will Grigg had a goal disallowed in added time for deliberate handball.
Rotherham caretaker manager Paul Warne: "I was a nervous wreck.
"When the first one went in I started to worry because momentum is a massive thing in sport. I thought, 'Here we go'.
"I felt a bit helpless. They kept coming at us, but I am proud of the lads, they give everything, they put their bodies on the line.
"I never expected it to be easy, no game is. Did I enjoy the second half? No. Am I happy with the win? Yes."
Wigan boss Warren Joyce: "To go 3-0 down you have got a mountain to climb, we have had a rally in the second half.
"You can't give any team a goal start, never mind a three-goal start. The second half was a lot better. But you can't give a team that lead.
"It's not like we have been carved apart in the first half, it was poor individual errors really. It was as simple as that."
