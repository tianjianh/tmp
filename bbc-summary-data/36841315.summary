County Championship: Sussex dig in against Kent to draw after following on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unbeaten Sussex held on for a comfortable draw against Kent in Division Two after being made to follow on at the start of day four.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sussex had conceded a 242-run deficit and survival was their only objective on the final day at Tunbridge Wells.
First-innings centurion Ross Taylor (68) and Harry Finch (66) helped them to 255-5 before a draw was agreed.
Sussex have drawn eight of their nine Championship games in 2016, while Kent have eight draws in 11 outings.
Taylor, who added another half-century to the 142 not out he made in the first innings, is departing Sussex to join up with New Zealand on their tours of Zimbabwe and South Africa.
