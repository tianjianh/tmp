The match at Centurion is the second in a three-match series, after England won Sunday's opener in Benoni.
"I'm not normally too nervous, but I think I'll be nervous for this one," Sussex's Taylor, 26, told BBC Sport.
"Katherine Brunt's got the potential to take her 100th wicket, so it could be a day of hundreds. It would be nice if someone scored a hundred as well."

The women's game has grown significantly since Taylor first came into international cricket as a 17-year-old, with England's elite players having become fully professional nearly two years ago.
In this series, rather than being out of the limelight at smaller venues such as Potchefstroom, England will play at some of South Africa's most iconic grounds - the Wanderers in Johannesburg, and Newlands in Cape Town - for the first time.
"You never think you're going to play at some of these grounds where you've watched Test matches on TV," said Taylor. "Centurion for my 100th game will be special. I'll probably brag about that for years."
Pace bowler Brunt, who has 99 wickets from 83 ODIs, was wicketless in Benoni but hopes to make it a double celebration in Centurion.
"Sometimes it can get frustrating, as a few catches went down in that game - it was just one of those days," she told BBC Sport.
"But I'd prefer to be somewhere nice like here to get it anyway. I've always wanted to play at the big venues in South Africa, it's a big deal for me."
Taylor's one-day international debut came nearly a decade ago, against India at Lord's in August 2006.
"It was a great day and it was at Lord's which was amazing," recalls Taylor, who was not required to bat as England made 253-3 on the way to a 100-run victory.
"Claire Taylor scored 156, so I got to enjoy watching that from the balcony. And I remember my first catch. Katherine bowled a bouncer, Sulakshana Naik skied it and everybody was celebrating while I was still juggling it."
She has played in four successful Women's Ashes sides and won both major ICC limited-overs tournaments in 2009.
She also made history by becoming the first woman  to play Australian first-grade cricket. So what does Taylor still hope to achieve?
"If my body withstands another 100 games, that would be great," she said. "I'd like to be more consistent. But I still want to win World Cups, Ashes and win every series we play."
The right-hander has also been impressed by England's play in Mark Robinson's first series as head coach.
"The way we've been approaching our cricket, we've not over-analysed anything, we're just in a good place at the moment," added Taylor.
"Coming away with the win in the first game, in the fashion we did, was good. The coach touched on a few areas in which we could improve. We looked a bit rusty, but he was quick to praise us individually.
"I'm really enjoying my cricket, The excitement of the Women's Big Bash League in Australia has carried on here and Mark's been brilliant."
