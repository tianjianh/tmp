Gary Anderson has one or two more world titles ahead of him, the Scot's manager, Tommy Gilmour, believes.

The 45-year-old won the PDC World Darts Championship for the second year running on Sunday, beating former champion Adrian Lewis in the final.
"I think there's no doubt there is at least one, maybe another couple, of world championships in him," Gilmour told BBC Scotland.
"The fearful thing is there are so many great players coming about."
One of them, 26-year-old Dutchman Michael van Gerwen, who won the world title in 2014, remains number one in the rankings.
"Gary is the double world champion, but the way the world rankings go, it is a wee bit like the golf," explained Gilmour.
"The achievement he has had over the last 18 months - he has won two world championships, he has won the Premier league, he has won the Players' Championship - that makes him as good as what is going about at the minute.
"I would say he is the number one player in the world, but he is still Â£100,000 in prize money behind Michael van Gerwen, but we'll get there in the next couple of months."
Anderson had played down his win over Lewis, mocking himself for playing average darts in a final, for miscounting at times in the heat of the battle and pointing out faltering eyesight that has led him to consider wearing glasses.
However, Gilmour said that was simply a reflection of his fellow Scot's modest character.
"The sweat was dripping off Adrian throughout the match, but you could see that Gary had it under control," said his manager.
"I just wish he had stuck in at his maths a wee bit more. He just had that miscalculation."
Gilmour ranks Anderson's achievement as his own career high as a manager along with the first of his seven boxing world champions - Pat Clinton.
"To be Scottish, be champion of the world and beat an Englishman, that was great," added Anderson's manager.
"There's so many magnificent players now and so many young strong boys coming through.
"To retain it - Gary is only the third person to have done that.
"To gain revenge over Adrian for the 2011 final and by the exact same score was brilliant."
