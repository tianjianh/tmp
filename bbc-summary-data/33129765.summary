[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Yorkshire Police said the body of a woman in her 20s was found in a house in Holker Street, Manningham.
Officers said she had suffered stab wounds and that they were looking for a man in connection with her death. It is being treated as a "domestic related incident", they added.
Reports suggest the woman was pregnant but police have not confirmed this.
Det Ch Insp Jim Dunkerley said: "The body of a woman was found by police and paramedics inside a property on Holker Street. She had suffered fatal stab wounds."
He said the death would "understandably cause a considerable amount of distress" in the community, adding: "To reassure local people we have increased patrols by neighbourhood officers in the area and I do not believe there is any wider danger to members of the public."
