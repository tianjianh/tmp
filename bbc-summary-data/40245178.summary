Gary Lindley,  41 and Billy White, 24, have been charged with his murder.
They have been remanded in custody to appear at Worcester Crown Court on Tuesday.
The jury at Rogers' trial was told how he was found at his mother's home in Bentfield Gardens, Stansted Mountfitchet, after the attacks, laughing and covered in blood.
Mrs Phillips had been stabbed at least 41 times in the head, neck and torso. Mr Oakes suffered 56 wounds to his head, face and neck and died of severe head injuries.
