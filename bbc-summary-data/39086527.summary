Newport County 0-4 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient dealt Newport County's survival hopes a potentially fatal blow with a 4-0 hammering at Rodney Parade.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Orient took the lead on eight minutes when Steven Alzate tapped home in his first start from Josh Koroma's cross and they never looked back after that.
Sam Dalby's pass then split Newport's defence as Koroma scored his maiden O's goal, before the same duo combined for the third just before the interval.
Koroma sealed the win, and his hat-trick, with a penalty on 64 minutes.
The Exiles remain bottom of League Two, now a daunting 11 points adrift of safety, while Orient are 21st, five points behind Notts County who slipped to 20th.
It was a day to forget for Newport boss Graham Westley on his 49th birthday, with the boss dealing with more boos and jeers from the home fans a week after he was abused by supporters at Mansfield.
However, goalkeeper Charlie Grainger will remember his day fondly as he made just a second appearance in the Football League.
The 20-year old denied Ryan Bird's header acrobatically with the score still level and also repelled an effort by Marlon Jackson by tipping over his curling shot.
Newport were defensively shambolic, with the high line they fielded in the first period being exposed time and again, with Day exposed and helpless to stop the Londoners as the broke at speed.
Teenagers Alzate and Koroma where a constant menace with their speed and three composed finishes before the break effectively won the contest, with Dalby also producing an eye-catching display in midfield, not letting the terrible playing surface dull his range of passing.
The Exiles barely registered an effort on target in the second period, with a stirring comeback never seeming a remote possibility, especially once Mark O'Brien dragged back Alzate and Orient fired home their fourth just after the hour.
Victory provides a huge fillip for Orient, in a week that saw them issued with a winding up petition.
For Newport, the season only looks likely to end in one way now.
Newport County manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It is a devastating defeat, not just the result, but we were low in a lot of commodities.
"We had a lot of the game and a lot of the play, but they were very clinical.
"There was always a lot of work to do. But we need to look at ourselves."
Leyton Orient manager Danny Webb told BBC Radio London: "We are happy, most importantly with an impressive performance.
"Obviously the result is massive. We were clinical on the counter attack and our teenagers played like it was a game in the park."
