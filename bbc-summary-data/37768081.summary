Daniel Bragg, 37, hit Julie Cook, 44, so hard he broke her left eye socket in the assault, police said.
Ms Cook fell and hit her head on the floor, causing a serious injury. She died in hospital two days later.
Bragg, who admitted manslaughter, was sentenced to five years and four months in prison.
He initially denied the killing, but changed his plea on the second day of his trial at Winchester Crown Court.
Bragg was overheard by friends four days before Ms Cook was killed saying "one of these days I'm going to kill her", Dorset Police said.
A Domestic Violence Protection Order had been made against Mr Bragg in April stopping him from contacting or going to Ms Cook's home, the force said.
However, the couple, from Bournemouth, remained in contact and on 28 April 2016 - just four days before the assault - a friend of the couple heard Mr Bragg say something to the effect of "if we carry on like this I will end up killing her".
The couple had been at Pokesdown Railway Station when they started arguing and Ms Cook walked away.
After punching her, Bragg initially walked away but returned to help Ms Cook, who was unconscious on the concrete platform, and took her back to her flat.
The couple had been together for about four years before the incident and their relationship was described as "volatile".
Det Insp Neil Phillips said: "There was no justification for such violence. Bragg and Julie clearly had a volatile relationship and efforts had been made to prevent further abuse.
"However, Julie and Bragg continued to maintain contact and she tragically died as a result of his violent behaviour."
