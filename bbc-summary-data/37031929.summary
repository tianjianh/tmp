Her three younger sisters, Lisa, Emily and Sophie, are supporting her from back home in the UK.
All three of them are interested in weightlifting too.
Lisa tells Newsround: "In our house it's really competitive - you can be having your breakfast and we're just trying to fit each other up!"
Rebekah finished 10th in the women's 69kg event on Wednesday.
