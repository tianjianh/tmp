Junior World Championship: Wales U20 12-71 New Zealand U20 (Mon)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Zealand Under-20 handed out an 11-try thrashing to Wales Under-20 in the fifth-place semi final at the Junior World Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wales never recovered after conceding a try within 40 seconds, and were trailing by 30 points at the interval.
It was in stark contrast to the pool match between the teams which the Baby Blacks won with a late penalty.
Wales will now play for seventh place with New Zealand facing either Australia or Scotland for fifth spot.
