DeGale fights Romanian-born Canadian Bute in what he says will be an "explosive" encounter in Quebec City.
"They think it's going to be a boxing match, but it will be a destruction," added the 29-year-old Briton.
"I feel like a beast. I'm going to start fast and throw loads of punches. Once he feels my power that will be it. Place your bets, trust me."
DeGale became the first British boxer to add a world professional title to an Olympic gold medal when he beat Andre Dirrell in Boston in May.
He has won 21 of his 22 fights since turning professional - his only defeat coming against bitter domestic rival George Groves in May 2011.
Bute held the IBF title for five years before losing to Carl Froch in May 2012 and has been victorious in 32 of his 34 bouts.
"It's a great opportunity to fight for my old belt in front of my hometown fans. I think they'll push me toward the victory," he said.
"I think he's the best super middleweight in the world right now, but I'm very confident in myself. I'm healthy, I feel great physically.
"I'm looking forward to becoming world champion again."
