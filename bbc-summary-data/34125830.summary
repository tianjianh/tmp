A man has completed a challenge to run barefooted from Land's End to John O' Groats for charity.

Aleks Kashefi, 37, from Buxton, Derbyshire, completed the journey on Thursday.
The science teacher was inspired to undertake the challenge following the death of his grandfather, who had several strokes.
Mr Kashefi said he did it barefoot to add a bit of interest and to make it more of a challenge.
He said: "The journey began in 50+mph gales and rain, which made it difficult to make progress, and on the second day I was blown into a rock stile on the path, damaging the top of my foot."
Due to the foot injury Mr Kashefi completed the next 40 miles using a walking stick picked up on a hilltop.
Towards the end of the trip - a total of 1,160-miles (1,866km) on the route he took - he also picked up a stomach bug.
Talking about his experience, he said: "I'm delighted to finish, and am looking forward to having a pizza.
"The whole of our country is incredible in terms of places to see and visit, and the people I have met along the way have been incredible.
"I honestly enjoyed every part of it, even when injured, tired and in pain.  I think we are truly lucky to live in such an amazing country."
The teacher, who was raising money for the Stroke Association, also carried two pebbles he collected in Land's End to the finish at John O' Groats.
He placed one at the foot of the sign marking the finish and plans to place the other on his grandfather's grave as a "little remembrance thing".
Mr Kashefi, who only took up running three years ago, said: "I thought if I'm going to do something a bit daft I might as well have a really good reason behind it."
