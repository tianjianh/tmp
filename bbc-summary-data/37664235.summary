Dagenham & Redbridge 1-1 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Macclesfield earned a last-minute point from a 1-1 draw at second-placed Dagenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Askey's men were second-best on the day, but rallied in the last minute and striker Chris Holroyd bundled in from close range to draw his side level.
The Daggers nosed in front in the first quarter when Corey Whitely squared for Fejiri Okenabirhie, and the onrushing midfielder dispatched firmly into the bottom corner.
John Still's men remained in relative control before the interval, but could not put the match beyond doubt. Whitely struck the top of Craig Ross's bar on the stroke of half-time.
They remained largely on top in the second half, but were to be undone by Holroyd's sucker punch.
