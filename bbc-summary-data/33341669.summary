[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-NoW deputy editor Neil Wallis cleared over hacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis has been cleared of conspiracy to hack voicemails.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He had accused the Metropolitan Police of being "extraordinarily vindictive" in their investigation, saying the case caused him "irreparable harm".
Mr Wallis, 64, from London, was not accused of hacking phones, but prosecutors alleged he "knew" it was happening and "agreed" to it.
An Old Bailey jury cleared him after four days of deliberations.
Mr Wallis broke down in tears as he was cleared of conspiring to illegally intercept voicemails between January 2003 and August 2006, the time he had been editor Andy Coulson's right-hand-man.
After the verdict, he tweeted: "Thanks so so much to all those who stood by me - so grateful #StillStanding."
Mr Wallis is the last of the journalists from the now-defunct Sunday tabloid to face legal action over the hacking it deployed in the hunt for exclusive stories.

The verdict in the Neil Wallis case marks the end of the last outstanding News of the World "phone-hacking" trial.
It's the best part of a decade since Â£100k-a-year phone-hacker Glenn Mulcaire and royal editor Clive Goodman were jailed. Since then we have seen senior journalists, editors and executives face justice and the secrets of celebrities, politicians and royalty re-examined, in excruciating detail, in open court.
We also learned about some of the secrets of the tabloid newsroom. The illicit, painful love affair between Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson was revealed. Emails sent by Mrs Brooks pointed to her close relationship with Tony Blair.
We saw how those in charge of a 168-year-old newspaper indulged in "dark arts" and illegal newsgathering on an "industrial scale" and how their disastrous conduct led to the Sunday tabloid's demise and lit the touch paper for a massive police investigation into illegal payments to public officials.
So, is this the end of the phone hacking saga? Maybe. Journalists at Mirror Group Newspapers also hacked phones to get the next scoop, but it remains to be seen if any of them will be charged. There is also the possibility of corporate charges against the News of the World's former owners.
NoW phone-hacking scandal
Nine former News of the World journalists have been convicted of phone-hacking since the scandal first came to light: Coulson, ex-royal editor Clive Goodman, ex-chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, ex-investigations editor Greg Miskiw, ex-features editor Jules Stenson, ex-news editor Ian Edmondson, ex-deputy news editor James Weatherup, ex-reporter Dan Evans and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator.
