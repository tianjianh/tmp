The Good Morning Britain host had scoffed at the decision to host a Ferris wheel in Dudley.
He told viewers even people in the town thought it had "a horrible view".
However, local businessman Dave Carter launched a campaign to get people riding the attraction wearing the masks to mark April Fools' Day.
About 40 people wearing the masks that were handed out in the town centre was granted a free ride before 10:00 BST.

Mr Carter said about 4,000 people have ridden the 115ft (35.05m) high attraction, which has been branded "the worst tourist attraction in the UK", adding the wheel had done the town "a really big favour".
"Most people have come along to see what all the fuss is about, and they're turning up to Dudley, doing a bit of shopping, going on the Eye and finding out that it's actually quite good," he said.
"It was all in good humour - you could see people's tongues in their cheeks through the masks."
Mr Morgan has been invited to Dudley to experience the ride, Mr Carter added, but he has not yet accepted the invitation.
