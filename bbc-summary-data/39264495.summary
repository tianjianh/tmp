[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock says he did not consider Wigan Athletic to be a "threat" once they appointed Warren Joyce as manager in November.

Former Manchester United Under-21 boss Joyce was sacked on Monday after only four months in charge of the Latics.
Warnock's side are currently 13th in the Championship but were a point above the drop zone, and Wigan, in 21st when Joyce took charge.
"No disrespect but when Wigan appointed him, I was delighted," Warnock said.
He added to BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I didn't think they were going to be a threat to us.
"I like Warren but you can't just put someone into the Championship who's never been there - it's nothing like youth football."
Warnock recently signed a contract extension to stay as Bluebirds' manager until the end of 2017-18, but is confident about his position because of a lack of managerial talent elsewhere.
"I'm in a unique situation for a manager because I'm not bothered if I get the sack - they can sack me tomorrow if they want," he said.
"If I want another job, I can get another job. That's not being conceited, I just don't see many good managers around.
"There used to be hundreds, you could name them all but the Championship is not like any other league."
