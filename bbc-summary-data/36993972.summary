Burton Albion 1-2 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tammy Abraham's 95th-minute goal earned Bristol City a dramatic victory at Burton Albion in the Championship.

The 18-year-old, on loan from Chelsea, tapped in Jonathan Kodjia's cross after substitute Tom Naylor looked like he had earned a point for the Brewers.
Naylor had netted two minutes from time, smashing Stuart Beavon's cross into an unguarded goal at the far post.
Earlier, Abraham, who has four goals in three games, put the Robins ahead just before half-time when he hooked in.
Bristol City have won their opening three matches for the first time since 2001, following league and EFL Cup victories over Wigan and Wycombe, and sit top of the early Championship table - albeit by alphabetical order.
There was an air of controversy over Abraham's first goal, with Brewers' players claiming the ball had hit Callum O'Dowda's hand in the build up.
But his second, with almost the last kick of the game, was down to the brilliance of Ivory Coast international Kodjia who robbed Jackson Irvine before bursting down the wing and finding Abraham to bundle home.
Burton made eight changes to the side which beat Bury in the EFL Cup on Wednesday for the first-ever meeting between the two clubs.
However, Nigel Clough's side looked short of quality in the final third as they fell to their second league defeat following the 4-3 loss at Nottingham Forest in the opening weekend.
Burton boss Nigel Clough:
"Both of the goals we conceded were scrappy and almost bundled in. That's the way it's going at the minute. Scrappy goals last week at Forest and the same again today.
"It's difficult to take but even at this stage of the season, if the performance levels stay like that then I am sure we will be okay.
"We have wasted chances and we just need to see the game out better. We need to learn and we need to learn quickly, otherwise we will keep losing games."
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson:
"I am delighted with that result. It was always going to be a tough game.
"It's a harsh league and they have obviously found that out today in the last minute but I think overall we just about shaded it.
"We are a new team and we showed a lot of resilience. That's the third time we've had to do that. It's a good trait to have.
"We are not playing outstanding stuff but nice and strong, nice and resilient and we managed to keep going to the end."
