Southampton 2-0 Crystal Palace

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southampton made light work of Crystal Palace in their all-Premier League tie, with a goal in either half sending Saints into the EFL Cup fourth round.

Charlie Austin put the home side ahead with a penalty after Shane Long was fouled by Martin Kelly's challenge.
Saints deservedly doubled their lead through midfielder Jake Hesketh's first goal for the club just after the hour.
Connor Wickham had Palace's best chance but failed to latch on to a loose back header from Jose Fonte inside the box.
Austin's fourth goal in the space of six days and three games gave Claude Puel's Southampton a deserved lead after half an hour.
Palace lost captain Scott Dann early on to a suspected hamstring injury and it was his replacement Kelly who was at fault in the build-up to the opening goal.
The central defender failed to control the ball with his chest and as it ran away from him Long gave chase and was tripped inside the box.
Long almost netted a goal of his own in the closing stages of the first half when he rounded Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, but his finish lacked power and allowed Damien Delaney to clear off the line.
Saints' continued pressure in the second half finally told as they doubled their lead through 20-year-old Hesketh.
Long drove into the box and when his shot was saved by Hennessey the rebound broke to Hesketh, who calmly swept a left-footed finish into the bottom corner.
Southampton midfielder Jake Hesketh told BBC Radio Solent:
"First and foremost we're through in the cup, but to score a (first senior) goal was perfect for me.
"It's a bit of a whirlwind really. It's come back to me nicely and then I've just run off.
"In my head I'm thinking, 'what am I doing here?' as I wasn't sure whether or not to celebrate with a knee-slide. But, it was brilliant.
"It's really nice and you feel really appreciated by the fans and to get a goal for them, I'm really happy.
"Training with the lads day-in, day-out is really beneficial. You try to take everything on board and take it into situations like tonight."
Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew:
"Shane Long is quick and has got a bit of history in those situations. He was definitely going over, I know that, but the video I saw was inconclusive.
"The players felt it (the penalty) was a bit harsh but it was difficult to see unless you see it clearly on television.
"The best team won for sure. They were very sharp. Their passing and movement caused us problems.
"It is always a risk when you make a lot of changes and we had one or two players that looked a bit rusty. We didn't have enough imagination to find a route to goal."
