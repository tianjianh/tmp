Girl pleas for Syria refugee grandfather to come to UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 10-year-old girl has written to the prime minister pleading for her refugee grandfather to be allowed to come to England for Christmas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Downing Street said it would consider the letter from Shakira Damous, from Devon, who said her grandfather was the only present she wanted for Christmas.
Disabled Abdulkarim Damous, 76, is living in a park in Turkey after fleeing the civil war in Syria.
The family home in Idlib was taken over by the so-called Islamic State.
Mr Damous's sons, Muayad and Ahmed, who run a garage in Exeter, have been British citizens for 10 years and have been refused a visa for their father three times.
Shakira said: "I feel sad and a bit guilty because we can't bring him here."
