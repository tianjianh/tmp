The body of Margaret Mayer, 85, was found at an address in Fairfax Road, Heath, in July.
She was found after Angus Mayer was hurt at Cardiff Central train station and taken to hospital earlier that day.
South Wales Police said on Tuesday an 86-year-old man had died and inquests would be held into both deaths.
At the time of the incident, a neighbour said the couple were "very much in love", adding Mrs Mayer had been treated for dementia.
