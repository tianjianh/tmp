[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 0-2 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County's four-game unbeaten run came to an end as Accrington Stanley secured a deserved victory at Meadow Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from John O'Sullivan and substitute Romuald Boco halted the Magpies' unbeaten run, which included one Checkatrade Trophy success.
The hosts had yet to score first in a League Two game this season and continued that run as they fell behind in the 17th minute to O'Sullivan's deflected strike.
Jonathan Forte did his best to level, but his shot towards the near post brought a fine save from visiting goalkeeper Aaron Chapman.
Notts were out of sorts, but having come from behind to snatch results in their last three league games, they came out with purpose and a much quicker tempo at the start of the second half, with Louis Laing volleying straight at Chapman from a Michael O'Connor free-kick.
But an inspired substitution from Accrington boss John Coleman helped his side deservedly extend their lead when Boco fired an effort past Adam Collin.
With Notts fans restless, John Sheridan's side did their best to launch a comeback but they were indebted to Collin for keeping the score down with an excellent save from Billy Kee.
