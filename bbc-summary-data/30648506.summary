Money raised from selling Swansea's civic centre will be used to fund "ambitious plans" to redevelop the city centre, the council leader has said.

The building, which opened in 1982, will be put up for sale in January.
Rob Stewart told BBC Wales the 14-acre site is "extremely valuable" and should be used for something other than council buildings.
Experts have been brought in to help shape the future of the city centre which is in need of redevelopment.
The council is expected to reveal further plans for the city's redevelopment soon.
But in the mean time Mr Stewart has decided to move the council's cabinet and senior management from there to the Guildhall while there are also plans to create space in the city centre for office staff.
"It's essential we get the core body of the workers we have in the city centre because that helps with the footfall and helps us with the business case for the redevelopment of the city itself," he said.
"We're keen to make sure the people of Swansea get the best value in terms of not only a cash receipt for the site but what actually goes there afterwards.
"I certainly want to make sure we get some iconic buildings on the seafront there.
"I've never believed that council buildings should be on the seafront on one of the most valuable bits of real estate."
Liberal Democrat councillor Christopher Holley, leader of the opposition on Swansea Council, has called the decision to sell the civic centre and relocate members of staff to the Guildhall "foolish".
He added: "Considering that there's reorganisation and the fact we don't know if we're going to be part of Neath Port Talbot all in all currently doing this is maybe the wrong thing to do."
