Several parts of Scotland have experienced April snow showers as an icy blast blew in from the north.
The Highlands, Aberdeenshire coast and Shetland were among areas where snow fell overnight and into Monday.
The Met Office later issued a yellow warning for between 22:00 on Monday and 09:00 on Tuesday.
It said wintry showers could hit almost anywhere in the UK as the Arctic air began to move further south.
Spokesman Grahame Madge said: "As we go over the next 36 hours, those wintry showers will become quite frequent.
"There's a possibility of wintry showers just about anywhere in the UK but more likely is that people anywhere, really, could see hail."
"In the south, it's possible that people could see sleety rain or hail for some time but we're not likely to see any accumulation or settling.
"The more at-risk areas for seeing snow are obviously the northern hills.
"But, generally, what we'll see in those very showery conditions is that when it starts to rain, it'll drop the temperature maybe enough to trigger the development of sleet or even the odd snow shower for a time."
Mr Madge said the colder weather will also bring plummeting temperatures at night.
The BBC Scotland Weather team said on Twitter: "Based on records from 1981 to 2010 the UK average is for 2.3 days of snow in April."
They added: "Snow is more likely at the beginning of April than the end, however, there have been a number of notable snow events this late on in the UK."
