[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester maintained their 100% record in the Challenge Cup with a 35-14 victory over French side La Rochelle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Gourdon went over early on to put the visitors ahead, but Mark Atkinson crossed to level the scores.
Atkinson then set up Josh Hohneck to go over, and Ollie Thorley's try extended the Cherry and Whites' lead.
David Raikuna touched down for La Rochelle, but Greig Laidlaw kicked two penalties and Matt Scott added a late try to seal it for the hosts.
The result means Gloucester are five points clear of La Rochelle at the top of Pool 1 after their opening three group games.
David Humphreys' side, who won the Challenge Cup in the 2014-15 season, have won five consecutive games at Kingsholm, with their last defeat a 6-15 loss to Bath in the Premiership on 1 October.
