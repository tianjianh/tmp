Six Nations: Scotland can cause Wales problems - Greig Laidlaw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Greig Laidlaw is sure Scotland can bounce back from an opening Six Nations loss and make life difficult for Wales in Cardiff on Saturday.

The Scots rarely threatened in a 15-9 home defeat to England, while Wales drew 16-16 in Ireland.
"Wales are a good team, very physical," said Laidlaw. "But we've got a couple of things up our sleeve which we think can cause them problems.
"We've got a good plan going into the game, now we need to execute it."
Scotland's defeat at Murrayfield was their eighth in a row in the Six Nations, their worst ever run in the championship.
"There were a few aspects of our performance where we probably feel we let ourselves down a little bit," said Gloucester scrum-half Laidlaw.
"It's a game we were in and we finished six points short of one of the top teams in the world.
"We conceded two soft tries. Our defence was solid apart from that. We coughed up a few balls in attack and we coughed up a few high balls.
"We need to tighten up little things, that goes a long way. But we need to progress quickly because this tournament is tough.
"We're not feeling sorry for ourselves. We've got to get out there and be better and not make the same mistakes again.
"The fifteen given the honour of starting in Cardiff will be giving it their all to get a positive result. This game is absolutely massive for us."

Wales are looking to make it nine victories in a row against Scotland, with the Scots last prevailing in Cardiff back in 2002.
"It's a great place to go and play, we need to go there and enjoy it but we're going to need to get stuck in," said Laidlaw of the visit to the Principality Stadium.
"I can see already you guys in the media are writing us off. We'll just keep that in house. We're one game into the tournament. We're not going to panic. We're going to stick together as players and coaches. We believe we'll be fine.
"It's a sore defeat to take but if we keep thinking about it when we go to Wales we're not going to win that game either.
"There is still confidence within the group. We believe we are so much better. Ultimately, we need to take that step and start winning games."
