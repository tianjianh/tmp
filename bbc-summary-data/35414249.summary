Having a shower on Earth is pretty straightforward, with gravity making sure that the water falls in a straight line.
But in space, that water would float all over the place. So astronauts have to adapt.
Tim and his fellow astronauts use wet towels to keep clean.
Tim posted the video, saying that he misses being able to take a shower.
He wrote: "I already miss my shower at home, but this gets the job done."
