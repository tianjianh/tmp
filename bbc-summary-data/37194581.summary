Huddersfield Royal Infirmary A&E; move survey results published

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public consultation into plans for a controversial shake-up of hospital services in Huddersfield and Halifax has revealed its results.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Out of 7,500 respondents, 60% said they would be negatively hit by the proposals, which include closing Huddersfield's A&E department.
The 40,000 comments received included concerns about the increased distance for travel and hospital waiting times.
A decision on the plan, which could save the NHS Â£31m, is due in October.
Demonstrations against the closure have been staged and a petition has been signed by more than 63,000 supporters.
Under the proposals, all emergency acute and high-risk planned care would be brought together at Calderdale Royal Hospital in neighbouring Halifax.
A new site in Acre Mills, Huddersfield, would be developed as a hospital for planned care, but with no A&E.
People in Huddersfield would have to be taken to Halifax, Wakefield or Barnsley for emergency treatment, or across the Peak District to Oldham or east Manchester.
The 14-week consultation was organised by the NHS Calderdale and Greater Huddersfield Clinical Commissioning Groups.
In Huddersfield, 80% of people feared they would be negatively affected, with 33% feeling the same in Calderdale.
