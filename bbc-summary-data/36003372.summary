Fleetwood had the better of the first-half chances, with Oldham keeper Joel Coleman forced into saves from Wes Burns and Antoni Sarcevic.
The Cod Army were rewarded for their pressure after the break when Stefan Scougall turned in Burns' cross.
Kelly had a header ruled out for offside, but he bundled in from close range shortly after to secure a point.
The result leaves the Latics three points clear of the relegation zone in 18th place, with Fleetwood one point behind in 19th.
Oldham Athletic manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"We deserved something out of the game. I thought we started sloppy in the first 10 minutes with some silly errors and that enables them to get a hold in the game.
"We finished the first half strongly and had a stonewall penalty. I can't believe how he's not given it, it's embarrassing. In the second half we were the better team.
"I get frustrated with people doing the wrong things. If we do the simple things, we wouldn't have conceded the first goal. We're 30 yards from goal and end making the wrong pass which leads to a goal.
"We've done well to come from behind and we were the team at the end trying to win the game."
