Wales' Bradley Dredge is pleased with his current form and hopes to build on his joint second placed finish at the Irish Open.

Dredge shared second place with Russell Knox, after finishing three shots behind winner Rory McIlroy.
The 42-year-old, who has won twice during his career on the European Tour, fired a superb final round of 66 at the K Club.
"I played well and hopefully I can kick on from here," Dredge said.
"We've got another good event next week and we'll see what happens there."
Dredge will next be in action at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, which begins on Thursday, 26 May.
He contemplated retirement after losing his European Tour card for the 2013 season and then health problems forced him to take an extended break.
Having regained his place on the European Tour, Dredge's performance at the Irish Open earned him the biggest payday of his career to date.
Dredge secured a cheque just short short of Â£270,000, eclipsing his prize for winning the European Masters in 2006.
"You try not to think too much about the money. You try and go out there and try and win the tournament," Dredge added.
"And if I play well I give myself a chance of doing that, like I did and you need things to happen then to actually win."
