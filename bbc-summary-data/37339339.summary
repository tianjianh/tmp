The new banknotes are slightly smaller than the existing paper £5 notes and have new security features to make them harder to copy.
The Bank of England, who make the bank notes, say they will be cleaner, more secure and longer lasting.
Paper £5 notes are still okay to use if you have them or are given them. The Bank of England plans to gradually withdraw them as they are paid into banks by people and businesses.
More than 30 countries around the world already use polymer banknotes, including Scotland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
New polymer £10 notes are planned for release in summer 2017, and polymer £20 notes will be available by 2020.
