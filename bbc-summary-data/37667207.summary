EFL 2016-17: Five things you may have missed from Saturday's action

We're over a quarter of the way into the English Football League season and the big coats are out for the upcoming winter slog.

This weekend saw only one team below the Premier League left unbeaten, two League One clubs joining forces to protest against their owners and another not quite hitting the spot on social media.
Here are five stories you may have missed from Saturday's EFL action.
It is very rare new managers are appointed mid-season because things are looking rosy.
A change of gaffer is a chance to provide fresh impetus, improve results and, hopefully, change the overall course of a season. Step forward Neil Warnock, Steve McClaren and Steve Bruce.
Warnock's Cardiff side had lost six of their past seven before Friday night's 2-1 victory over Bristol City, while McClaren's return to Derby County saw a 1-0 win over Leeds United.
In the West Midlands derby, former Birmingham City boss Bruce's Aston Villa could not make it a clean sweep as they drew 1-1 with Wolves.
Still, I'm sure all three chairmen will be happy - for now.
The game at Villa Park was arguably the biggest derby in the EFL this weekend - but there were also a couple you might be less familiar with.
In Greater Manchester, the 'M66 derby' is named after the stretch of motorway that separates Rochdale and Bury, and on Saturday Dale won a sixth game in a row as they came out on top 2-0 at home.
In League Two, two late goals in the so-called 'Dockyard derby' between Plymouth and Portsmouth saw it finish 2-2 at Home Park.
And, back to Friday, and Warnock's first game was also his first 'Severnside derby', which is what games between Cardiff City and Bristol City are called. So there you go, pub quiz fans.
We're now two months into the season and, with most clubs having played 13 league matches so far, only one EFL team remains unbeaten - League Two's Carlisle United.
Bradford City and the Cumbrians both went into the weekend as the only sides without a defeat, but the Bantams lost at Oxford United, leaving Keith Curle's side standing proud after they beat Hartlepool United 3-2.
Carlisle are third after their win, four points behind leaders Plymouth, with a record of six wins and seven draws.
The only time they have tasted defeat so far in the 2016-17 campaign was their EFL Cup second-round exit to Derby, when they lost 14-13 on penalties.
In a show of solidarity between two sets of fans unhappy with their clubs' ownership, Charlton Athletic and Coventry City supporters united on a protest march before their game at The Valley.
Addicks followers are unhappy with the way owner Roland Duchatelet and chief executive Katrien Meire are running their club, with Sky Blues fans taking issue with the way club owners Sisu are handling matters affecting their team.
After the march, the game was stopped for five minutes as plastic toy pigs had to be cleared from the pitch, having been thrown on by both sets of supporters.
Protests continued throughout the match, which Charlton won 3-0 to leave them 15th, with Coventry bottom of League One.
Social media can be a wonderful tool to connect with people all over the world.
Football clubs use it for behind-the-scenes footage, live coverage throughout games and also for team news as soon as it is announced.
However, Burton Albion's post revealing their substitutes' bench for their Championship game at Wigan Athletic was not the easiest to digest...
White font on yellow background - not the best choice?
The tweet was shared numerous times as Saturday progressed and the graphic got quite the treatment when it came to being reviewed.
