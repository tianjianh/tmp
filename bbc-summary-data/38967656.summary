[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is no evidence that a Londonderry man accused of terrorism in Syria is a fantasist, a court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prosecution lawyers have been delivering their closing submissions to the jury at Londonderry Crown Court in the trial of Eamon Bradley.
The 28-year-old Muslim convert, originally from Melmore Gardens in Creggan, denies six charges.
They include attending a rebel training camp in Syria and receiving training in guns and grenades.
Mr Bradley is alleged to have committed the offences between 31 March and 29 October 2014.
A prosecution barrister said the defendant told the truth about the events in question during police interviews.
"There's no evidence that he's a fantasist or that he makes things up," he added.
Mr Bradley was arrested and interviewed by police on his return to Derry in November 2014.
However,  Mr Bradley's defence told the jury of eight women and four men that there was not a single shred of evidence to show that Bradley was in Syria.
He described the case as a "threadbare piece of nonsense" which was "not worth wasting the public purse on".
Referring to a photograph of Eamon Bradley, which was shown to the jury during the trial, a defence barrister said that he was not Derry's answer to Lawrence of Arabia, but just "a guy on holiday, sitting on a donkey".
He added that the period since Mr Bradley's arrest in 2014 had been a very "worrying time" and "a nightmare" for the defendant and his family.
The jury is expected to be sent out to deliberate verdicts on Wednesday.
