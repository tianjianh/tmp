She had ignored barriers and warning signs of the oncoming train.
The train driver applied the emergency brakes when he saw the woman - she then stepped back, narrowly avoiding being hit.
Richard Schofield, who's in charge of the train line where this happened, said: "This is one of the closest incidents of near miss we've seen.
"The person using the crossing not only didn't hear the train but ignored the warning lights and barriers, putting her life, the lives of passengers and the train driver in danger."
Jay Thompson, Head of Safety at the train company Greater Anglia said: "It is really important that everyone follows the safety instructions at level crossings."
