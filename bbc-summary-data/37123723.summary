[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men, aged 30 and 32, were arrested on Wednesday night after police stopped a lorry on the Portadown Road.
A subsequent search of a property in Armagh led detectives to seize four "high-value watches" and other items.
A search of a property in the Sixmilecross area of County Tyrone is also taking place.
Police said the cash - some £215,000 in sterling and 225,000 euros (£194,000) - was uncovered in a holdall, a backpack and a plastic bag in the lorry's cab.
