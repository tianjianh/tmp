[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carys Phillips will continue as Wales captain for the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup in Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hooker Phillips, 24, assumed the role at the end of 2016 and led Wales in a disappointing 2017 Six Nations campaign that yielded one win from five games.
Wales will face New Zealand, Canada and Hong Kong in the group stages.
"There's a tremendous amount of excitement within the squad for those pool games," said head coach Rowland Phillips.
"There's a real enthusiasm amongst the team about facing two of the top nations in the game, because you play international rugby in order to compete against the best."
