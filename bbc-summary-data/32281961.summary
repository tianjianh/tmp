A bomb has exploded at the gates of the Moroccan embassy in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, security officials say, hours after two people were shot dead outside South Korea's embassy.

There was some damage to cars nearby, but no reports of injuries.  The embassy is not currently operational.
On Sunday, gunmen opened fire from a passing car on a security post at the South Korean embassy.
The militant group Islamic State said it carried out that attack.
The device at the Moroccan embassy in the Bin Ashour area of Tripoli was left in a bag at the gate.
The blast in the early hours on Monday morning was "very strong, and the house was shaking for few seconds," a witness told the AFP news agency.
It was unclear whether there was anyone in the embassy at the time and no one has yet said they carried out the attack.
Morocco has hosted UN-sponsored talks between rival Libyan government factions.
In Sunday's attack on the South Korean embassy, a Libyan security guard and a civilian were killed, with a second guard wounded.
Three South Korean nationals - two of them diplomats - were in the official residence at the time, which is in the same compound, the official added. They were unhurt.
The embassy itself has been closed for several months, but officials continue to use it.
Libya has been in turmoil since the Nato-backed removal of former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
IS has a presence in different parts of Libya, and says it is behind several attacks on foreign targets in Libya including embassies and oil fields.
