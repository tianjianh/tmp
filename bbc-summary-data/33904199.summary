Christina Sethi, 25, targeted three victims at a care home between January 2014 and May this year.
She filmed the assaults on her mobile phone before sharing them with her partner, Plymouth Crown Court heard.
Sethi, from Torquay in Devon, admitted three counts of sexual assault and two of assault by penetration last month.
Recorder Richard Stead told Sethi, of Woodville Road, that she had committed "horrific abuse of three vulnerable and elderly victims who were in a care home under your care".
He said she degraded and humiliated the victims who trusted her.
The abuse was discovered when a man who knew Sethi bought a computer and found footage of the attacks on deleted files.
Devon and Cornwall Police described Sethi's actions, against two female victims and one male, as "incomprehensible".
Det Insp Ed Wright said: "Sethi committed crimes that most ordinary people could never comprehend.
"This depraved individual carried out shocking acts of abuse and grossly abused her position at the care home."
A 32-year-old man from Torquay who was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit sexual assault has since been released without charge.
