The Italy, France and New Zealand boats all progressed from the semi-final in Rio, ahead of the Great Britain quartet who came home in 6:10.46 minutes.
Peter and his brother Richard were part of the lightweight four crew who won silver medals at the London 2012 Games.
Alan Campbell has booked his place in the semi-finals of the single sculls.
The London 2012 bronze medallist finished second in the last of the four quarter-finals in Rio on Tuesday in a time of 6:49.41 minutes.
Campbell was the fourth fastest of the qualifiers for Thursday's semi-finals.

The 33-year-old, who is the first Northern Ireland athlete to compete in four Olympic Games, had comfortably won his heat for Great Britain on Saturday.
"I'm very happy, I kept my powder dry, conserved my energy and didn't overdo it," said Campbell after his race.
"An Olympic semi-final is probably one of the biggest tests you can face before the race for the medals is decided. I won't be taking anything for granted and won't leave anything out there in that one.
"The conditions are tricky and challenging but I don't let it phase me too much. It's the same for everyone."
But while Campbell kept his Olympic hopes alive, Peter Chambers was philosophical after he and his British team-mates bowed out of the lightweight fours.
"It's tough to come fourth in an Olympic semi-final. It's hard to take but we gave it everything we could," said Chambers.
"From what we saw out there today, we wouldn't have won a medal in the final anyhow.
"I'll take time to consider my future but I'll probably compete in another Olympics."
Richard Chambers, the elder of the two brothers, has secured his passage to Wednesday's semi-finals of the lightweight double sculls, along with British team-mate Will Fletcher.
