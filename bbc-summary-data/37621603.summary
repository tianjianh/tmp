[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major redevelopment is being proposed for Fishguard town centre in Pembrokeshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The master plan includes a new link road, retail units and the demolition of buildings, including the derelict Fishguard Junior School, on 1.5 hectares (four acres) of land.
Councillors hope it could encourage further investment into the town.
An outline planning application will be submitted on behalf of Pembrokeshire council in November.
The plans also include 142 car parking spaces, new bus shelters and taxi ranks, public spaces, footpaths and alterations to the existing Co-operative supermarket.
Fishguard councillor Pat Davies said the development "has been a long time progressing".
"A lot of negotiations have taken place with various bodies but at last we can now look forward to its implementation. It will hopefully give confidence for further investment into our town," she said.
Goodwick councillor Gwilym Price said: "It's a great step forward for Fishguard and very important to get things moving."
