Nine men have been barred from the landlord register in Glasgow after being found unfit to rent out property.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decisions by Glasgow City Council's licensing and regulatory committee affects six landlords in the Govanhill area and three others around the city.
It means they could face criminal prosecution and fines of up to Â£50,000 if they attempt to let their property.
They landlords all failed to meet legal obligations and one was also convicted of assault with intent to rape.
Five of the landlords who were barred own properties within the Govanhill Enhanced Enforcement Area, which has allowed council officers to impose higher standards of regulation on all landlords.
The landlords who failed to meet the standards are: Hamid Akram, Tauheed Hussain, Mohammed Adnan Hussain, Shakeel Shahid and Simon Tsang.
Between them, they own seven properties across addresses in Westmoreland Street.
Tauheed Hussain also owns a property in Langside Road as well as other parts of the south side of Glasgow.
In all five cases, the landlords failed to provide a range of certification that includes an enhanced criminal record check, buildings insurances, energy performance, gas safety and confirmation that tenants received tenant information packs.
Johan Mirza, who was convicted of assault with intent to rape, and operating flats below the tolerable housing standard, owns properties in Allison Street, Boyd Street and Jamieson St as well as another on Bath St in Glasgow city centre.
Glasgow City Council leader Frank McAveety said enforcement action was seeing failing landlords "being stopped in their tracks".
"There have been too many landlords in Govanhill who have refused to take their responsibilities seriously and have brought the area down," he said.
"Thanks to the powers the council secured through the creation of the Enhanced Enforcement Area, we are making serious inroads against those landlords who have undermined the Govanhill community.
"Let's be clear, the Enhanced Enforcement Area allows the council to demand high standards of those who rent out property within the four blocks. Where landlords fail to meet the high standards of the enforcement area they will be brought to book."
Three other landlords with properties in other parts of Glasgow were also barred from the register on the basis of their criminal convictions.
These landlords were Francis Green, Jamil Ahmed and Graham Mills.
