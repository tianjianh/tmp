Wales' record try-scorer and former World Player of the Year, who is 40-years old, came on after ten minutes in Amman's National Bowl semi-final against Cardigan, which they won 29-3.
Amman go to the final in Cardiff on 23 April where they will play Caerphilly.
"It would be brilliant for the club and the village to reach the Principality Stadium," said Williams.
He continued: "I'd love to help in any way I can.
"I always said I would try and play a couple of games with my brother for Amman before I hang up my boots for good and they asked me if I wanted to be considered for the semi-final.
"I think I just managed to scrape a seat on the bench. I've had to move another commitment to be able to play and I just hope I get called on."
Williams made his first senior rugby appearance as a scrum-half for Amman United in 1997.
He went on to play for Neath, and Ospreys and won 87 caps for Wales as well as touring with the British & Irish Lions in 2005, 2009 and 2013.
He scored a record 58 Test tries for Wales and two for the Lions and was named World Player of the Year in 2008, the year he won his second Grand Slam.
The last time Williams ran out at the Principality Stadium was in the black and white hoops of the Barbarians against Wales in 2011.
After that he went on to finish the 2011-12 season with Ospreys and after initially retiring from the game, was persuaded to go to Japan to play in their second tier for Mitsubishi Dynaboars.
While there, he received a surprise Lions call-up at the age of 36 to play in a midweek game on their 2013 tour to Australia.
Williams became Dynaboars player-coach in 2014 before ending his professional playing days with them
Having knocked out holders Burry Port in the previous round, the leaders of Division 3B West will face either Cilfynydd or Caerphilly in the final.
