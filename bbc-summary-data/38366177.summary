[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The history and culture of Edinburgh is to become the centre of a new tourism campaign in China.

A series of social media posts and adverts will aim to encourage more Chinese visitors to come to Scotland, as figures show tourism from China exceeded Â£43m over three years.
The Edinburgh Tourism Action Group posts, written in mandarin, will highlight key points of interests.
History, architecture, film locations and shopping are featured.
Edinburgh Castle had more than 160,000 Chinese visitors in 2015 and the city is said to be the second most popular UK destination among the Chinese, after London.
Robin Worsnop, Edinburgh Tourism Action Group chairman, said: "The growth of the Chinese visitor market to Edinburgh presents a great opportunity for the city's tourism sector.
"We know Chinese visitors love our historic, walkable city, our top attractions, our architecture and our unique links to major films like Harry Potter.
"Working together as a group of businesses, and supported by Scottish Enterprise and the VisitScotland Growth Fund, we're confident that these brand new official Edinburgh channels on Chinese social media platforms will help Scotland's capital become a 'must see, must visit' destination for Chinese visitors."
Manuela Calchini, regional director at VisitScotland, said: "China has huge growth potential for tourism in Scotland and we're delighted to support the Edinburgh Chinese social media campaign, through the VisitScotland growth fund.
"The campaign will give a platform to promote the very best of what Edinburgh has to offer, from its stunning architecture, fascinating history and world-renowned festivals to its delicious food and drink. And with the Scottish capital receiving 87% of Chinese visitors to Scotland, the success of this campaign will no doubt be felt far beyond the city walls.
"With Edinburgh playing a prominent role in the Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology, it is the perfect opportunity to encourage Chinese visitors to come face-to-face with history and explore our rich cultural heritage."
