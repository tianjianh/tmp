There were victims from 18 countries on board, although most were Spanish or German. Here are some of their stories.
A group of 16 students, 14 girls and two boys, and two of their teachers, from Joseph-Koenig school in Haltern, western Germany, were travelling back from a Spanish exchange programme on the Germanwings flight.
As many as 40 pupils had wanted to go on the trip and the school decided to hold a lottery to identify the 16 who would eventually go, local German media reported. Their Spanish counterparts had visited last year.
A girl in the group nearly missed her flight after she forgot to bring her passport. She rang her host family who rushed 50km (30 miles) to the airport, delivering it just in time to allow the students to board the plane, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais.
Carol Friday, 68, was a nurse and her 29-year-old son Greig, an engineer. They were on holiday in Europe before Greig was due to start a teaching job.
Their names were released by the foreign ministry in Australia, along with a statement from the family asking for privacy, according to ABC News.
"Carol was a loving mother of two, a devoted wife to her husband, Dave, and a sister to three brothers," the statement said.
Greig was to have turned 30 on 23 April.
"He was a loving son to Carol and Dave and an exceptional brother to his sister, Alex. He was adored by all his family and friends."
