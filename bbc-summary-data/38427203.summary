[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are hunting a robber who tried to hold up a petrol station in East Renfrewshire, armed with what appeared to be a gun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened at about 06:10 on Friday at the BP station in Eastwoodmains Road, Clarkston.
He demanded that a member of staff hand over money from the till.
The assistant refused and the suspect then fled the scene, heading in the direction of Clarkston Toll.
The 57-year-old staff member was uninjured and no-one else was inside the store at the time of the incident.
The suspect is described as being about 6ft tall with a skinny build. He was dressed entirely in dark clothing and wearing a balaclava.
Det Con David Henry said: "Our inquiries are under way to trace this man and hold him to account for his actions.
"No-one should be placed in a state of fear or alarm as they go about their daily lives."
Officers have been conducting door-to-door inquiries and continue to assess CCTV.
They would like to speak to a man in a silver BMW car who entered the petrol station shortly after the incident.
Officers said it was possible he may have information which could help with their inquiries.
