The wildfires, which began late last week, were still being fought on Monday.
Blazes have ruined homes, shut down power, charred buildings and spurred many to evacuate.
In Washington state, the fires have charred 155 square miles (401 square km) and caused 1,500 to flee their homes.
Crews used air tankers, helicopters and bulldozers to attack the fires, which are made worse by high temperatures, reaching record levels this season and making fires harder to maintain.
More than 50 structures were destroyed in Washington. That the number is likely to increase.
Thirty homes and 75 other buildings were consumed in a blaze in Idaho, already struggling with major drought.
Firefighters are still battling the flames that began in the last few days.
A 70-year-old woman, Cheryl Lee Wissler, died in Idaho during the blazes. She was on her way out of her house when she fell, later dying of a head injury, local authorities said.
Sunbathers in Chelan, a Washington beach town, saw helicopters dipping into Lake Chelan to get water for fighting blazes north of the lake.
Air tankers made lines to keep the flames from reaching downtown Chelan.
In Oregon, wildfires have destroyed six homes and caused hundreds of residents living along the Warm Springs Indian Reservation to flee.
In southern California, a wildfire ruined two and a half square miles (6.5 sq km) of forest near Los Angeles. No one was hurt.
A wildfire 100 miles (160 km) from San Francisco in northern California caused evacuations and sent haze from smoke down to the Bay Area.
Another blaze in the area destroyed 43 homes days earlier.
In Montana, the biggest fire burned 21 square miles (54 sq km), with flames blaming in Glacier National Park and on the Flathead Indian Reservation.
Lighting storms ignited several fires in Colorado, but no injuries and only one home evacuation were reported.
