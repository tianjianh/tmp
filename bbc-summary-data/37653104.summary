In the BBC interview, the first lady suggested that the Nigerian government had been hijacked, adding that it was time for Mr Buhari to shake things up.
Her comments, which have shocked the nation, were met with overwhelming support on Twitter.
Some praised Mrs Buhari for encouraging free speech in the country:
Others, however, accused Mrs Buhari's supporters of hypocrisy after she was criticised last year for appearing in public sporting expensive accessories:
President Buhari, who is currently visiting Germany, was quick to respond to his wife's criticism.
At a joint news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel, he said: "I don't know which party my wife belongs to, but she belongs to my kitchen and my living room and the other room."
His remarks have prompted sharp criticism on Twitter, with many also saying they are puzzled what "the other room" was.
In a series of tweets, President Buhari's spokesman Mallam Garba Shehu later tried to downplay the row, saying his boss "was obviously throwing a banter".
