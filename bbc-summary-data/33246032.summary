[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tyrone man Sean Hackett 'felt need to kill a parent'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Tyrone GAA player who shot dead his father had been harbouring a secret need to kill either of his parents, the Court of Appeal has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sean Hackett shot his father Aloysius in the head in the driveway of their Augher home on 4 January 2013.
He was convicted of manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.
A consultant psychiatrist who assessed Hackett told judges he suffers from one of the purest forms of delusional disorder she has ever encountered.
Describing the case as unlike any other in Northern Ireland, Dr Carine Minne claimed the 20-year-old's mental illness now requires expert medical attention.
She said: "He's not just a homicide risk while he remains untreated, but also a suicide risk."
Hackett is challenging a minimum 10 year prison term imposed for killing his father.
At his trial it was set out how he had suffered depression in the preceding months, triggered by a split from his girlfriend.
Defence lawyers are now appealing the sentence by arguing that a hospital order should be considered as an alternative.
Hackett's mother Eilish, who he tried to strangle just months before shooting his father, sat in the public gallery during Tuesday's hearing.
His barrister argued that his client was mentally ill at the time of the shooting and remains so now.
Up to five psychiatrists back the view that Hackett was in a delusional state of mind when he carried out the killing.
One of those experts called to give fresh evidence was Dr Minne, who is based at the high security Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire.
She identified a series of factors contributing to Hackett's mental health deteriorating in the months leading up to the shooting.
As well as breaking up with a girlfriend, the psychiatrist pointed to the death of a grandparent and the blow to his self-esteem when he failed to be picked for a football team.
By autumn 2012, he had developed a belief that killing either of his parents would solve his problems, she claimed.
"He kept that secret to himself, and this delusion kept recurring over the coming weeks," Dr Minne told the court.
Hackett first lured his mother into the family garage in a bid to strangle her, only to come to his senses and stop when she struggled and screamed.
Dr Minne said: "To quote him, he said 'I just knew I had to do it'."
He was taken to see his GP after that episode but was said to have insisted nothing was wrong as part of a "minimisation" of his illness.
Following the attempted strangulation Hackett's thinking was said to have remained the same.
"The idea of needing to kill one of his parents persisted in his mind, but unbeknown to his family," Dr Minne told the court.
Hours before the shooting he nearly killed his mother before stopping at the last minute, it was claimed.
After firing the first shot Hackett, in his delusional state, felt he had to shoot again to ensure his father was dead, the court heard.
Dr Minne said Hackett stood over his father in a calm state of disbelief immediately after pulling the trigger.
"He felt as if he could be dreaming and wasn't sure if he was really there or not really there," she continued.
"He decided to walk around the house to see if the scene would still be there.
"At that moment he was in a disassociated state, where you're not really fully aware of being present in reality, and you feel as if you're in a dream and you're going to snap out of it. Except he did not snap out of it."
She said that Hackett has still not fully understood that he killed his father.
"This case, of all the cases I have seen in Broadmoor in the last 25 years, is one of the purest forms of delusional disorder I have come across," she told the judges.
According to her assessment any treatment in a psychiatric regime could take between five and 10 years.
She added: "I'm so sorry Mr Hackett is not currently getting the treatment he needs."
Under cross-examination a Crown barrister said that Hackett had been capable of making decisions and exercising self-control in preparing and planning the shooting.
Dr Minne responded that by that stage there was no longer a sane part of his mind.
However, Mr Murphy insisted Hackett's mental functioning enabled him to fire the gun, hide the weapon in a car boot and claim at first that a burglar may have carried out the shooting.
"It wasn't dream-like when doing all these acts. They were well-directed," the barrister contended.
Following submissions the three judges, reserved judgment in the appeal.
