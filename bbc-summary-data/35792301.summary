Connor Jennings hit the Chester bar in the first half, while Rhys Taylor denied Danny O'Brien at the other end.
Wrexham were awarded a penalty when Kayden Jackson was fouled by Ryan Astles, who was sent off before Jennings converted.
Jackson's clinical finish doubled the lead and Robbie Evans sealed the win.
Wrexham are now seventh in the National League, three points outside the play-offs, while Chester are 16th and six points clear of the relegation zone.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "I think Chester away was our worst performance of the year and today was our best.
"As a team, we were excellent and could have scored more goals.
"This was a performance for 93 minutes and I thought it was incredible. We are bang in there."
