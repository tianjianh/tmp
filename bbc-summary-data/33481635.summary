[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plant taxonomist Dr Tim Rich is taking enthusiasts on a hunt through the Brecon Beacons on Saturday.
Dr Rich Joe Daggett, Graham Motley and Paul Smith found Hieracium Attenboroughianum in 2004. It was only confirmed as a new species in February.
It is only found on rocky ledges on Cribyn, one of the peaks in the area.
The Attenborough Hawkweed is one of a group of closely related plants which belong to the daisy family and has probably evolved in the Brecon Beacons since the last ice age.
