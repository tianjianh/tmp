Around 20 police officers and a sniffer dog search a field off Ashby Road, in Belton, Leicestershire, and a plot of land has been cordoned off.
Kayleigh Haywood, from Measham, Leicestershire, was last seen when she was dropped off outside her former school at about 18:00 GMT on Friday.
Two men, aged 27 and 28, arrested on Monday remain in police custody.
More updates on this and other stories from Leicestershire.
Officers have also been searching close to bales of hay and a line of trees, some using rakes, on the agricultural land as part of the large-scale operation near Belton.
Meanwhile, further searches have been continuing in and outside Sence Valley Forest Park, in Ibstock, where a mobile phone thought to belong to Kayleigh was found.
Police believe she may have been there on Saturday afternoon.
Kayleigh is a student at Ashby School but previously attended Ibstock Community College, where she was dropped off on Friday.
Appealing directly to Kayleigh, her parents Stephanie Haywood and Martin Whitby said: "We just want our KJ home."
Residents have tied a purple ribbon, the teenager's favourite colour, in support of a campaign to find her.
