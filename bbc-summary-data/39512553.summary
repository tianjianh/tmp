Police said Samantha Baldwin, 40, and her children were found at "secluded accommodation" near Ollerton in Nottinghamshire.
Their disappearance on 27 March sparked a Europe-wide police hunt involving more than 100 officers.
Nottinghamshire Police said the arrest was the result of information received through its nationwide appeal.
In a statement, the force said:  "[It was] now working to establish the full facts of the disappearance and is putting in place additional support measures for all parties involved."

Police said the boys were found at a cabin at a small holiday business after a tip-off and had not been physically harmed.
They are now being looked after by childcare professionals.
Though the information was provided independently of the business, the owners were assisting officers with their inquiries, the force added.
Two women, aged 62 and 36, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender have been released on police bail.
