Sean Moynihan, 31, said Tobin had been annoying him for months "with his attitude towards his offences".
He admitted striking the 69-year-old on the head and body with a razor blade, and will be sentenced next month.
Tobin is serving life sentences for murdering Polish student Angelika Kluk, Scots schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton and Essex teenager Dinah McNicol.
Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Moynihan attacked Tobin on 1 July when the pair were both incarcerated at Saughton Prison.
The 31-year-old, now an inmate at Glenochil, admitted to prison officers that he "slashed Tobin across the throat and face".
When interviewed later, he said: "Tobin has been annoying me for months with his attitude towards his offences and his refusal to tell anyone where the rest of his victims' bodies are."
Tobin was treated at St John's Hospital in Livingstone, where he was found to have a 20cm (7.8in) laceration running down the right side of his face and onto his throat.
Sheriff Nigel Ross was told the killer would be permanently scarred.
Tobin was convicted of murdering 23-year-old Angelika Kluk at a church in Glasgow in 2006.
The following year, the bodies of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol, from Essex, and Vicky Hamilton, 15, from Redding in Falkirk, were found in the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent.
In 2006, Strathclyde Police set up Operation Anagram to establish whether Tobin could be linked to or ruled out of other crimes.
