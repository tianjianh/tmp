The 81-year-old told police the haul was taken from his house at Blofield near Norwich between Wednesday evening and Friday morning.
The thefts included his 1964 FA Cup medal, 1965 European Cup Winners Cup medal from his West Ham days, and his 1985 League Cup medal when he managed Norwich.
"My wife and I feel violated," he said.
Norfolk Police said a set of Winston Churchill gold medals, cash and jewellery were also stolen.
"I had such a great time with both Norwich City and West Ham United and feel a huge amount of pride when I look back at my medals and to think that someone has entered my home and taken them hurts me a lot," said Mr Brown.
"I have grandchildren who play football and I love being able to show them the medals when they visit.
"They won't like to see their granddad upset but unfortunately that's how I feel at the moment."
He continued: "My wife and I feel violated that someone could take items of such personal significance and I can only hope those responsible for doing this can see how pointless it is to take something that has no value to them and such great value to us."
A Norwich City Football Club spokesman said: "Norwich City Football Club is shocked and saddened by the theft.
"Hopefully the publicity surrounding the case will tweak someone's conscience and lead to the recovery of the items."
