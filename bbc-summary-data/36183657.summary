'Leicester party on hold but now we find out if Spurs can respond' - Shearer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester's title celebrations are on hold but Sunday's draw with Manchester United is still an excellent result.

The point the Foxes earned at Old Trafford means Tottenham now have to win all three of their remaining games to have a chance of finishing as champions, starting at Stamford Bridge on Monday.
Chelsea have nothing to play for in terms of league position but, as some of their players have already said, they do not want Spurs to go there and win, and would love it if their London rivals miss out on the title.
So it will be a very tough game for Mauricio Pochettino's side. Leicester have done their bit, now it is over to Tottenham and we will find out if they can respond.
There is no way United took it easy on Sunday because they are still going for a top-four spot themselves.
It was not like they were on holiday or anything like that, because they have still got a lot to play for.
A draw was probably a fair result in a game with a few contentious decisions for both sides, and Leicester had to put in another decent performance to get it.
They certainly did not look edgy at all but they have not done all season, so I would not expect nerves to affect them now.
Claudio Ranieri's side had to do it a bit differently, because they did not have the pace of Jamie Vardy up front, but they showed they could dig deep again - coming from a goal behind and playing out the last few minutes with 10 men.
They had Kasper Schmeichel to thank for a magnificent save from Jesse Lingard when United were 1-0 up, because if that had gone in it was probably game over.
Instead, Leicester stayed in the game and three minutes later they were level.
Schmeichel has played a huge part in their achievements this season and that was another big moment for him.
It just absolutely underlined that when you win the title, it is a team effort and everyone does their bit.

Foxes forward Riyad Mahrez got the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award last week, but three or four of his team-mates could easily have got that prize.
Leicester have had some of this season's best individual players, but they have had their success together as a team.
Ranieri has been playing on the counter-attack all season but, with Vardy suspended, that was not an option for them at Old Trafford.
They did not miss him last week because they were at home and were gifted a goal early on against a Swansea side who played poorly.
But it was a lot harder for them against United, who put them under a lot of pressure in the first half, when every Leicester player had to do a shift defensively.
In that scenario, under the cosh and away from home, their first thought when they won the ball back would normally have been to get it forward quickly to Vardy.
But Leonardo Ulloa is not quick enough to offer them that out ball, which meant they found it difficult to clear their lines.
Leicester showed more attacking intent in the second half but they still missed that killer instinct that Vardy gives them when the ball is in open play in and around the box.
Throughout the game, however, they looked very dangerous at set-pieces. They looked as if they were going to score from every free-kick and corner.
Vardy will be back for Leicester's next game, at home to Everton on Saturday, but they will be without Danny Drinkwater after his red card on Sunday.
They will miss Drinkwater, of course, but it is not as big a blow as being without Vardy because they can revert to the style of play that has taken them to the brink of the title.
It will not matter at all if Tottenham slip up on Monday, though. The title race could well be all over by next weekend.
