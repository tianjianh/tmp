Two cars and a Team GB 2012 holdall and watch were among items taken from the athlete's house in the Halton area of Leeds on Wednesday.
Police said sports equipment in the boot of the car had been taken and a second car is still missing.
Miss Adams, 32,  withdrew from this weekend's England Boxing Elite National Championships following the theft.
The grey Hyundai Veloster Turbo was found at about 08:20 BST in Sandringham Way, Alwoodley, after a member of the public reported it to the police.
Police are still searching for a silver Ford Focus TDCi.
The items taken from the car include three pairs of boxing boots, one of which was the pair Miss Adams wore in the Commonwealth Games, three pairs of boxing gloves and shorts and a vest she was due to wear at the championship bout this weekend.
The watch was a gift to mark her victory at the 2012 Olympics.
Det Con Will Tsang, of West Yorkshire Police, said: "Nicola is understandably distraught at the loss of these items that have such significant sentimental value to her.
"Much of the boxing equipment is very distinctive and we are appealing for anyone who may have been offered these items for sale or found them abandoned to contact us immediately."
