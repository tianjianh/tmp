Sorrell Leczkowski, from Adel in Leeds, was one of 22 people killed in the bombing on 22 May. Her grandmother and mother were also injured.
A private ceremony took place at the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church in Otley Old Road, Leeds on Monday.
Her grandfather, Michael Healey, said she was a "talented" girl who dreamed of becoming an architect.

In a statement Sorrell's family said: "Sorrell was only 14, but she was our rock, she kept us all grounded.
"She was such a clever, talented, creative girl, there was nothing she couldn't do."
"She was going to be an architect and wanted to go to Columbia University in New York to study so that she could build hotels with slides coming out of the rooms and so that she could build her mum a house."
Sorrell, a Year Nine pupil at Allerton High School, her mother and grandmother were not at the Ariana Grande concert but had gone to collect her sister who was not injured.
Attacker 22-year-old Salman Abedi detonated a home-made bomb in the arena's foyer as crowds were leaving a performance by the US singer just after 22:30 BST on 22 May.
Twenty-two arrests were made shortly after the attack - all those arrested were released without charge.
About Â£28,000 has been raised in two online fundraising campaigns set up for Sorrell's mother and grandmother.
