Other items include the Jules Rimet Trophy and Pele's training kit.
Dr Kevin Moore, from the museum, said England's victory was about "far more than simply football".
Curator Andy Pearce said: "We have really uncovered some fascinating stories."
Shirts worn by Roger Hunt and hat-trick hero Geoff Hurst are being displayed along with boots worn by Hurst, skipper Bobby Moore and West Germany's Franz Beckenbauer and Uwe Seeler from the final, in which England beat the Germans 4-2.
Photographs, memories and memorabilia from people including a ball boy to a photographer have also been documented and collected.
The museum has also unveiled its new Walk of Fame of 25 of the game's best players according to a online poll, including England's World Cup winning eleven.
The exhibition runs until April and will be partly displayed at Wembley next month.
