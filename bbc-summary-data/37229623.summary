Pro12: Ulster v Dragons (Fri)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ruan Pienaar will start Ulster's Pro12 opener against the Dragons on Friday with Charles Piutau and Brett Herron handed debuts for the Irish province.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pienaar's selection comes a day after the announcement that he would be leaving Ulster after this season.
Props Sam Hobbs and Craig Mitchell join backs Nick Macleod and Pat Howard in competitive Dragons debuts.
Ex-Wales hooker Rhys Thomas captains the visitors while Wales centre Tyler Morgan is on the bench.
England Under-18 international Herron will partner Pienaar at half-back with All Blacks star Piutau at full-back.
Prop Ross Kane will join Herron and Piutau in making his competitive debut after also playing in pre-season games.
With summer signing Rodney Ah You joining injured props Wiehahn Herbst, Ricky Lutton and Jonny Simpson as an absentee after being concussed in last weekend's warm-up win over Northampton, academy player Kane is handed his opportunity.
Andrew Trimble, along with other Ireland players Rory Best and Iain Henderson, is unavailable following his summer tour exertions with the national squad so hooker Rob Herring will captain the side.
Trimble and Herring are sharing the Ulster captaincy this season after national skipper Best stepped down from the role.
With Chris Henry also not available because of injury, Sean Reidy, Clive Ross and Roger Wilson are named in the back row.
Ulster's backline includes Ireland internationals Stuart McCloskey, Stuart Olding and Craig Gilroy with Louis Ludik not being risked because of a thumb injury and Darren Cave missing for personal reasons.
Piutau and Gilroy are joined in the back three by Ireland Under-20 player Jacob Stockdale.
Dragons' regional captain Lewis Evans is back-row cover on the bench.
