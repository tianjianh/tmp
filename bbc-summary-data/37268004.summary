Of the 863 men who died, an estimated 120, known as "the Jersey Pals", were killed during the Battle of the Somme.
Made from Jersey granite, the memorial stone was officially unveiled by Bailiff William Bailhache in the French village of Guillemont.
The delegation from the island also included the Lieutenant Governor, Chief Minister and the Dean of Jersey.
Ian Ronanye, an author and historian, said the memorial would be a permanent reminder of the role Jersey played in the great war, although part of it would return to the island.
"A core has been removed from the middle of the stone - about the height of a person's heart - and that is being brought back to Jersey to become part of a monument in Royal Square," he told BBC News.
In July, hundreds of people attended a ceremony to reveal the memorial stone.
