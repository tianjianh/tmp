Staff at Morton Hall, in Swinderby, Lincolnshire, had to find a "place of safety" when about 30 men reportedly refused to go into their rooms.
The disorder was eventually brought under control on Saturday evening.
A Home Office spokesman said there were no reported injuries to staff or detainees.
Earlier, officers in riot gear were seen going into the site and there were reports alarms were sounding inside the complex.
Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said an investigation was taking place following the man's death.
What is an immigration removal centre?
He said: "Our thoughts are with the family at this very sad time. Deaths in removal centres are rare but tragic events.
"We take our responsibilities towards detainees' health and welfare extremely seriously."
The man's death is the second at a UK immigration centre this year, after Christine Case died at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire in March.
Last year a report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons criticised staff for the inappropriate use of batons and handcuffs but said, overall,  Morton Hall was a "safe establishment" for detainees and security staff.
It is run by the Prison Service on behalf of the UK Border Agency.
