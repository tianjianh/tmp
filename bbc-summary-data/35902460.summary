Miller clipped the ball over keeper Graham Stack and soon added another from the penalty spot after he was brought down by the Bees' goalkeeper.
Alex Kenyon sneaked in unmarked to head a third before Barnet hit back through substitute Michael Gash's low strike.
Cole Stockton's fine finish made it 4-1 before Gash added a stoppage-time consolation, his ninth of the season.
Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC Radio London:

"Within five minutes we could have been 2-0 down, which is a real surprise after the whole squad had done us proud over the Easter period with four points away at Exeter and at home to Luton.
"We looked too open and to be fair to them, they played well.
"When we stepped up in the second half, we probably had four good chances where we could have got back in the game.
"It didn't really work for us today."
