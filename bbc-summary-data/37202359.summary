[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 1-1 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joe Martin's second-half strike secured a point for Millwall as Bradford missed the chance to go top of League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Byron Webster's own goal from close range gave the visitors the lead just before the break.
The Lions equalised soon after half-time when Martin fired in with a fierce strike from the edge of the box.
Bradford went close to claiming all three points deep into injury time when Nicky Law's shot was turned onto the post by Jordan Archer.
The result leaves Bradford in second place, two points behind leaders Bolton, who were held at home by Southend, while Millwall are fourth.
The Lions made a bright start before Law's header was saved by Lions goalkeeper Archer.
City went ahead when Mark Marshall's cross-shot was turned away by Archer before hitting Webster's shin and bouncing into the net.
It did not take long after the restart for Millwall to equalise, as Martin fired past Doyle.
Archer then produced another fine save to deny Law at the death to ensure the Lions remain in touch with the top three.
