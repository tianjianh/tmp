Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has undergone a series of routine heart tests and all results were normal, doctors in Ramallah say.

The 81-year-old was taken to a hospital in the West Bank city after feeling exhausted and experiencing chest pains.
Doctors performed a cardiac catheterisation procedure, in which a thin plastic tube is inserted into a blood vessel to check for blockages.
Everything appeared normal and Mr Abbas was due to be discharged shortly.
"His arteries look great, and there is no need for him to stay in the hospital," heart specialist Dr Mohammed al-Batrawi told reporters.
The Palestinian leader underwent another heart procedure known as an angioplasty to open clogged arteries in 2005.
He was elected president earlier that year after the death of Yasser Arafat, with whom he co-founded the Fatah movement and helped establish the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
