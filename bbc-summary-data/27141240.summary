Last month, all four police forces caught drivers and passengers, including children, not belting up.
Dyfed-Powys Police recorded the most with 1,027 adults and 12 children.
Gwent Police caught 80 not wearing belts, while South Wales Police found 264 on its patch and North Wales Police stopped 141 adults not wearing their belts.
Supt Paul Evans, from Gwent Police, said: "The action of putting on a seatbelt takes seconds, and its effectiveness should not be underestimated.
"Even on a short trip and at low speed a seatbelt reduces the likelihood of being seriously injured or even killed on the road - it should be part of every person's routine before the ignition is turned on."
