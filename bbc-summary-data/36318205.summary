[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire held off Somerset to claim a nervy draw in Taunton after suffering yet another batting collapse.

The visitors were bowled out for 311 as Jamie Overton bowled Steven Patterson as Somerset enforced the follow-on.
Despite numerous rain interruptions, the hosts took regular wickets with Overton (3-26) bowling both Yorkshire openers Adam Lyth and Alex Lees.
Reduced to 99-6, Jack Leaning (29no) and Liam Plunkett (20no) resisted as Yorkshire survived the last 10.4 overs.
Victory against Surrey aside, the reigning County Champions have struggled to find form this season with top-order batting collapses becoming a regular occurrence.
Patterson and Jack Brooks' 74-run last-wicket partnership was the second largest in Yorkshire's first innings to help them to a respectable score, despite still trailing Somerset by 251 runs.
The home side had 75 overs to claim victory and had the White Rose county 51-3 as Will Rhodes sent Joe Leach to short leg in between Lyth and Lees falling cheaply.
Somerset's bowlers continued to looking dangerous and Adil Rashid became the sixth Yorkshire scalp to fall as he edged Tim Groenewald to first slip for a 30-ball duck.
However, the unbeaten 42-run seventh-wicket partnership between Leaning and Plunkett denied the hosts a first victory of the season.
Yorkshire remain second in Division One having won one and drawn four of their opening five matches, whilst Somerset's five draws leave them in seventh.
