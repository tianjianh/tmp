Sam Alger, 25, originally from Norfolk, was last seen outside the Elrow club just outside Barcelona on Sunday night.
A Facebook appeal set up by friends said Mr Alger had run to nearby fields when rioting broke out outside the club at about 22:00 BST.
The BBC has been told that his body was found at midday on Tuesday.
A spokesman for police in Barcelona said Mr Alger's body was found on agricultural land.
Officers are awaiting autopsy results which they said could "take a few days", but the spokesman said the body showed "no signs" of violence.
Tom Clarke, who taught Mr Alger at Easton and Otley College in Suffolk for two years,  paid tribute to him as "one of the kindest lads you ever met".
"He (Mr Alger) would always stay behind and help those who were struggling. He made a lasting impression on those who taught at Easton college," said Mr Clarke.
"It is really sad news. News you never want to hear as a teacher."
Friends have spoken on Facebook of their "devastation" at hearing of his death.
In announcing his body had been found, they said: "Sam was one of the kindest, most genuine and loving people anyone could wish to know and to have him taken from us is truly heart breaking."
Among the hundreds of tributes paid to the keen sportsman, Amy Head wrote: "Such horrible and sad news, words cannot even describe how devastated I am for family and friends. Such a genuine chap with a loving, kind and caring heart."
Lynne Gardner added: "Can't believe this devastating news, truly a beautiful young man inside and out."
Jackie Cuff said: "Such a beautiful young man and such a waste of a beautiful life. There really are no words that can possibly heal the heartbreak."
Hull City Football Club, where Mr Alger worked as an intern, tweeted: "We were saddened to hear of the passing of former intern Sam Alger. Our thoughts go out to Sam's friends and family at this time. RIP Sam."
A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "We are working with local authorities following the death of a British national in Spain."
Mr Alger is understood to have worked for the Qatar Stars League football association in Qatar.
The nightclub is near the Autovia de Castelldefels highway and the city's airport.
