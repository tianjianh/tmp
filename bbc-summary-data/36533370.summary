The 26-year-old, who spent the final two months of the 2015-16 season on loan at Plymouth, will join Gary Bowyer's men later this month.
Jamaican-born Matt scored seven goals in 14 games for Argyle as they reached the League Two play-off final.
"Jamille fits the profile for the type of striker I wanted to bring to the club," Bowyer told the club website.
"He's strong, powerful, determined and, most importantly, knows where the goal is," Bowyer added.
Matt is Bowyer's first signing since he became Blackpool boss on 1 June.
