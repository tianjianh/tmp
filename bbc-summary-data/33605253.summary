[SN]TITLE[SN]
Will Indians have to pay for WhatsApp?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
India's Department of Telecommunications (DoT) formed a panel in January 2015 to look into net neutrality in the country.

Net neutrality means service providers should treat all traffic equally. Users should be able to access all websites at the same speed and cost.
A battle to decide the future of the internet in India is being fought online, between telecom users and operators.
The panel has now released its report to the public and invited comments. Pranesh Prakash from the Centre for Internet Studies decodes the report and what it means for Indians.
"Zero-rating" is a policy whereby telecoms providers agree not to pass on the costs of handling the data traffic so that consumers can receive services for free.
On the one hand, this could decrease the cost of access to WhatsApp and Viber. But that might not be allowed because free services could harm competition and distort markets.
Whether this will lead to consumers paying for WhatsApp and similar services depends on what kinds of regulations are placed on them, and if any costs are imposed on them.
The report is clear that it strongly endorses the "core principles of net neutrality".
On the issue of "zero-rating" the panel proposes some sound measures, saying that there should be a two-part mechanism for ensuring that "harmful" zero-rating doesn't go through.
First, telecom services need to submit "zero-rating" tariff proposals to an expert body constituted by telecoms department.
Second, consumers will be able to complain about the harmful usage of "zero-rating" by any service provider, which may result in a fine.
