Florence and Hounslow, both 34, were unable to improve on their second-place finish at London 2012.
They clocked a time of 102.01 seconds, +0.43 behind Slovakia gold medallists Ladislav Skantar and Peter Skantar.
The British pair could not match team-mate Joe Clarke, who won gold in the kayak K1 on Wednesday.
Florence put the disappointment of finishing 10th in the C1 single behind him, winning the third Olympic medal of his career alongside Hounslow.
The duo, who were third-fastest qualifiers for the final, faced an anxious wait to see if they would match their achievement four years ago with world champions Franz Anton and Jan Benzien going last.
But the Germans faltered in the final stages, clocking 103.58 to finish fourth.
French pair Gauthier Klauss and Matthieu Peche (103.24) won bronze.
"I was a bit disappointed from the C1," said Scot Florence, who also won C1 silver at Beijing 2008.
"I really wanted to go out there and enjoy it. We talked about doing every gate we could to the best of our ability and leaving everything else to one side.
"Rich is so solid on race days. You know nothing is going to faze him. It helped having him there, it picked me up a bit."
Hounslow, from London, added: "It is easy having David in the front. He is a workhorse.
"It has been a hard eight years, we've worked really hard and to come out with a medal at the Olympics is fantastic.
"It is maybe a little bit bittersweet, coming so close to gold, but we're happy."
Fiona Pennie could not add Britain's third slalom medal at the Olympic Whitewater Stadium, the 33-year-old Scot finishing sixth in the women's kayak single final later on Thursday.
Helen Reeves, Olympic bronze medallist and BBC Sport analyst:
"It was a wonderful performance from David and Richard and they knew they could be proud of it.
"They had to sit and wait but it stood the time. What a fantastic performance."
