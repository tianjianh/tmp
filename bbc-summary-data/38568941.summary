[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Discount supermarket chain Aldi is planning to open six new stores in Scotland this year.

The new stores scheduled to open over the next 12 months are Auldhouse Retail Park, Glasgow (April), Dumfries (June), Montrose (July), Drumchapel, Glasgow (August), Oxgangs, Edinburgh (October).
Planning permission is being sought for a sixth store.
This will bring the number of Aldi stores in Scotland to 78 by the end of the year, employing 2,600 people.
The company's Scottish headquarters in Bathgate is also undergoing a multi-million pound extension and it plans to extend its regional distribution centre in Bathgate over the next two years.
This will result in the total number of jobs being created in Scotland this year to about 300.
Aldi said it will continue to grow its range of 360 Scottish-sourced products.
In the past year, the company has announced significant supplier deals with local companies.
Aldi Scotland managing director Richard Holloway said: "We want to build on the success of 2016 by opening additional stores in new locations in Scotland and work with even more of the best Scottish producers.
"We continue to deliver the highest quality and value, and I am confident that we will strike deals with more Scottish suppliers in the coming year.
"Our growth plans for 2017 underpin Aldi's ongoing commitment to Scotland which saw eight new stores open in 2016 and the launch of Aldi's first Scottish Sport Fund, support which shall be renewed in the course of the year."
