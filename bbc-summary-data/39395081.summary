Scottish League Two: Arbroath fail to pounce on Forfar defeat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arbroath squandered the chance to go top of Scottish League Two, after league leaders Forfar Athletic were beaten by 3-2 Berwick Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The second-placed Red Lichties failed to capitalise, going down 1-0 at home to Montrose.
Annan Athletic climbed to third, beating bottom side Cowdenbeath.
Clyde twice surrendered the lead as they lost 3-2 to Stirling Albion and Edinburgh City earned a surprise 3-0 win over Elgin City at Meadowbank.
Pat Scullion put Berwick ahead early on at Station Park, only for Danny Denholm to restore parity on the stroke of half-time.
Quick-fire goals from Denholm and Greg Rutherford put the Wee Rangers in control and, despite a late penalty from David Cox, they hung on to dent the hosts' promotion aspirations.
Forfar have now failed to win in seven successive matches, but Arbroath missed the opportunity to take advantage of their rivals' poor form.
Gary Fraser claimed Montrose's winner - and the only goal of the game - five minutes from time at Gayfield Park to leave the hosts a point off the top.
Annan moved into third after their 1-0 success at home to Cowdenbeath, Aidan Smith's superb strike 14 minutes from time proving the difference between the sides.
Second-bottom Clyde missed the chance to move further above Cowdenbeath after a frustrating home defeat by Stirling.
The Cumbernauld side were ahead twice, but Darren Smith scored the visitors' winner after he and Ross Kavanagh had cancelled out Peter MacDonald's opener and David Gormley's penalty.
In the day's other game, Dougie Gair's brace and a late goal from Jordan Caddow helped Edinburgh defeat Elgin, who drop to fourth.
It means Edinburgh move three points clear of Clyde.
