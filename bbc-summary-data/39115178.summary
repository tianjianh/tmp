The company said it was investing more than Â£1m in the move, following a "robust" financial year which saw turnover rise from Â£11.2m to Â£12m.
The new office will accommodate the 40 staff and partners who are already based in the city.
Campbell Dallas said it planned to increase staffing in Perth to about 50 over the next two years.
Overall staff numbers have risen to more than 200.
The firm cited a programme of continued investment as key to a successful year.
Chairman Ian Williams said: "2016 was a solid year for us and we are continuing to win increasing amounts of work across the business this year, with healthcare, rural and family business sectors performing particularly well."
Major transactions during the year included advising brewer Innis & Gunn on its acquisition of Inveralmond Distillery and providing acquisition support to building services firm Morris and Spottiswood in the purchase of Lled Construction.
It also acquired established Kilmarnock-based accountancy firm W White & Co, in order to further develop business in the Ayrshire market.
Mr Williams added that the firm would continue its strategy of investing for the future.
