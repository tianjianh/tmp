The meeting in Aberystwyth was organised by campaign group Traws Link Cymru which revealed its hopes for a 90 minute service between the two towns.
The line closed in 1965 and at that time the journey took almost three hours, stopping at over 20 stations.
But reinstating the 56-mile line could cost around Â£650m. The group is trying to get funding for a feasibility study.
The meeting heard that around 3% of the track bed has been built on but Traws Link Cymru said that was no obstacle to reopening the line.
Ceredigion AM Elin Jones was at the meeting and said she would arrange for members of the group to meet with Economy, Science and Transport Minister Edwina Hart during the next few months.
