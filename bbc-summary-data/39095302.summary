The removal of thousands of tonnes of gravel dredged from a flooded river more than a year ago is set to begin.

Glenridding Beck, in the Lake District, burst its banks three times during storms in December 2015.
More than 14,000 tonnes of gravel was removed from the river in a bid to reduce the risk of further flooding.
The material has been stored on Jenkin's Field, next to Ullswater, and the Environment Agency will start taking it away Monday.
Andy Brown, from the agency, said: "We would like to apologise to the community and visitors to Glenridding for the noise and increased traffic which will be caused by the work to remove the gravel from Jenkin's Field.
"We are doing everything possible to minimise the disruption and complete the clearance as prompt and efficiently as possible to minimise the impact."
