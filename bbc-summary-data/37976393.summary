NHS Wales: Vaughan Gething faces questions on winter readiness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Not enough staff or hospital beds to meet demand and rising delays in discharging patients are just some of the concerns being put to the health secretary later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vaughan Gething is expected to face tough questions about NHS Wales' readiness for winter pressures.
More than a quarter of people turning up to A&E do not need to be there, it will be claimed by a committee of AMs.
The Welsh Government insists the NHS will be "robust and resilient".
Mr Gething will be questioned by the assembly's health committee, which has been gathering evidence from a variety of organisations representing NHS staff as part of an inquiry into winter planning.
The demand on the NHS is substantial throughout the year but services can face significant extra pressure in winter, often due to surges in demand from very sick patients.
There are a variety of reasons for this, including:
The Welsh Government point to figures that show A&E attendances were 23% higher in January 2016 compared to January the year before.
Mr Gething accepts it will be challenging but said the NHS and councils in Wales have developed integrated winter plans earlier this year "building upon the plans and experiences of last year to prepare for this winter".
Each health board has its own initiatives aimed at improving the flow of patients and freeing up beds.
The Welsh Ambulance Service will also set up "pop up" mobile wards, as a last resort, outside emergency units to avoid queues of ambulances waiting to transfer patients.
WILL NHS WALES CATCH A COLD THIS WINTER?
Analysis from BBC Wales health correspondent Owain Clarke
Many I talk to within NHS Wales claim last winter was one of the the worst, in terms of pressures, they can remember.
The main reason: an ageing population, more susceptible to the health problems winter brings.
They are also likely to need support when they leave hospital. This means delays,  especially if the NHS and the social care sector aren't working well together.
There are also less beds than a decade ago.  The question is whether services available in the community developed quickly enough in response.
How is your health board gearing up for winter?
One frontline doctor I talked to this week suggested the symptoms of winter - patients waiting on trolleys, packed A&E departments - have been just as evident throughout the summer.
Another ominous sign is that the statistics suggest that in terms of A&E delays the NHS is approaching this winter in a slightly worse position than it was in October last year.
Some suspect difficult winters for the NHS is something we all have to learn to live with.
In addition the Welsh Government says the following initiatives will be in place across Wales:
The Welsh Government recently also allocated Â£50m extra to the NHS this year to help it address winter pressures. In recent years the peak has been in March.
According to the chief executive of NHS Wales Dr Andrew Goodall, the money is targeted at trying to make sure that improvements in waiting times for scheduled operations or hospital tests are not undermined during the winter months.
"We had for the first time over this last year more than one million patients attending our A&E departments - a 3% increase on the previous year," he said.
"But we need to recognise pressures will increase over the winter for various reasons - cold weather can cause difficulties for patients whether through falls or respiratory problems.
"With an older population, there will be times when the service is under pressure.  The importance of winter planning is to provide a professional response to those areas based on clinical experiences and what patients need."
