The 47-year-old, who previously worked in the club's academy system, will oversee all aspects of the professional game at Hove.
"We believe Keith's extensive experience will drive improvements," said chief executive Zac Toumazi.
"His commitment and calm approach makes him the perfect candidate for this role, which will focus on the implementation of the Sussex strategy."
Greenfield, who played 78 first-class and 160 List A matches for Sussex between 1987 and 1999, will be responsible for reviewing the quality of coaching at the club as well as reaching objectives in participation and community cricket.
On-field performances will remain the responsibility of head coach Mark Davis, who will report to Greenfield.
Carl Hopkinson, who has been a coach at the club since retiring in 2009, will now assume the role of academy director while continuing to work with the first team as a specialist fielding coach.
"We are also thrilled to see Carl taking over from Keith to build on the excellent work he has done with the academy," added Toumazi.
"He can now bring his own style and expertise to help develop the next generation of Sussex's players."
