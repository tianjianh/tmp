Jason Lee Gibbs, 44, was on his way home from work on his mountain bike on Friday when he collided with a vehicle.
He got up, rode home and went to bed after the crash, which happened between 13:10 and 13:50 BST in Manchester.
Mr Gibbs later suffered a cardiac arrest and was taken to hospital. He died early on Sunday.
Officers are investigating the crash, which happened as Mr Gibbs rode home to Moss Side from Gorton.
PC Neil Pennington said: "Unfortunately, we don't have full details of where the collision happened or what vehicle was involved, but I am urging anyone who saw the collision or was involved to come forward.
"It may not have appeared serious at the time, but a man has died, and any information you have, no matter how small, could help us piece together what happened."
Police do not know if the vehicle was moving or stationary.
