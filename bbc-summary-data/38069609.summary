SNP MSP speaks about death of baby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An SNP MSP has spoken about the loss of his child as he urged Scotland's health secretary to widen a review into baby deaths at a Kilmarnock hospital.

Kenneth Gibson and his wife Patricia - the MP for North Ayrshire and Arran - lost their baby towards the end of her pregnancy in 2009.
Staff at the Southern General hospital in Glasgow had failed to spot that Mrs Gibson had pre-eclampsia.
A review of baby deaths at Crosshouse Hospital was announced on Tuesday.
It came after a BBC Scotland investigation revealed that there had been six so-called "unnecessary" deaths of babies at the hospital since 2008.
"Unnecessary" or "avoidable" deaths are referred to as those where harm was caused to a healthy baby during childbirth - usually resulting in them being deprived of oxygen.
Reports into some of the deaths referred to failings in monitoring of the child's heartbeat during childbirth.
Speaking in the Holyrood chamber, Mr Gibson urged Health Secretary Shona Robison to make the review "wider and deeper" so it could look at similar cases in other hospitals across the country.
His wife has previously opened up in the House of Commons about the "devastating" effect of losing her baby.
Mr Gibson said: "On her due date in 2009, my wife Patricia, having been sent home and been physically sick, was finally admitted to the Southern General maternity unit despite their protests.
"A consultant junior doctor and two midwives examined her that day. Despite being 41, a first-time mother and in extreme pain from head to toe, no-one picked up her pre-eclampsia. She was given morphine and put to bed.
"Overnight our baby died and had to be delivered by caesarean. Patricia's liver ruptured and she spent 19 days in intensive care and high dependence."
Mr Gibson said the couple had spent 20 months asking NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to explain how they would prevent such a failure of care reoccurring and impacting other lives.
He added: "They blanked us and when we were thereby forced to take legal action, hired a QC, wasting thousands in taxpayers' money to defend the indefensible.
"It took five years before they eventually conceded this year. What will the Cabinet secretary do to ensure other people in Ayrshire, Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland are not treated as badly when they experience such a tragedy?"
Ms Robison said she sympathised with the Gibsons' "appalling" experience, adding: "We would expect all health professionals to treat anyone who has suffered any bereavement with care, dignity and respect.
"Clearly that didn't happen in that case and we should learn the lessons from that case."
Labour MSP Anas Sarwar raised figures from the BBC investigation, which showed that Scotland's maternity hospitals had recorded more than 25,000 adverse incidents since 2011.
The figures, released under freedom of information legislation, showed the most serious incidents included the deaths of 26 newborns and three mothers, as well as 79 stillbirths.
Mr Sarwar called for the review to be extended to look at staffing across all maternity units in Scotland, highlighting 500 incidents relating to staff shortages.
The health secretary responded by saying NHS Scotland met the Royal College Of Midwives' recommended midwife-to-birth ratio, and patient safety programmes had resulted in the lowest levels of stillbirth and neonatal deaths on record as well as a decrease in maternal deaths.
She added: "In those really, really significant adverse events, the worst kind, we have seen huge progress being made through that patient safety programme so that it is fair to say that our maternity and neonatal units are safer now than they were four or five years ago."
