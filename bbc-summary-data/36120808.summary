The UK could take up to 10 years to negotiate trade deals with the US if it leaves the EU, Barack Obama has said.

In a BBC interview, the US president said: "It could be five years from now, 10 years from now before we were able to actually get something done."
Britain would also have less influence globally if it left, he added.
His warning over trade has angered UK campaigners for leaving the EU - with UKIP leader Nigel Farage dismissing Mr Obama's comments as "utter tosh".
He told the BBC other countries including Oman and Australia had been able to negotiate trade deals with the US and the president had been "parroting" Downing Street.
"To hear an American president coming to London to threaten us, I don't think goes down very well," he said.
Labour MP Gisela Stuart, who co-chairs Vote Leave, said it was "extraordinary" the US should urge Britain to remain part of a "dysfunctional organisation".
But Home Secretary Theresa May told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it was "perfectly reasonable" for the US president to give his views on trade relations between his country, the UK and the EU.
Voters will take his views "on board" and make their own judgements, she said.
Labour MP Chuka Umunna told Sky Mr Obama's comments "weren't about instructing us... but, as a close ally and friend of the UK, giving a view".
On Friday, Mr Obama said the UK would be at the "back of the queue" for trade deals with the US, if it left the EU.
Asked about the comments, he told the BBC: "The UK would not be able to negotiate something with the United States faster than the EU.
"We wouldn't abandon our efforts to negotiate a trade deal with our largest trading partner, the European market."
During the wide-ranging BBC interview, Mr Obama said:
Mr Obama left the UK on Sunday morning for Germany, where he will hold talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The BBC's correspondent in Berlin said the main aim of the visit was to win public support in Germany for the planned US-EU free trade deal.
The US president's fresh intervention in the EU debate comes as Democratic US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton also made it clear she thought Britain should remain in the bloc.
Her senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan said: "Hillary Clinton believes that transatlantic co-operation is essential, and that co-operation is strongest when Europe is united."
The Vote Leave campaign said Mrs Clinton's comments were "hollow", but a Downing Street source said "we should listen to our closest friends and allies".
The UK's referendum on whether the country should stay in the EU or leave will take place on 23 June.
In the BBC interview, referring to the UK's place in the EU, Mr Obama said the US wanted the UK to be "at the table" influencing countries that might not see things from a US view.
Despite criticism from pro-Brexit campaigners, he said he thought "ordinary British voters" would be interested in his thoughts on the UK and the EU.
The US president warned the UK would have "less influence in Europe and as a consequence, less influence globally", if it left the EU.
Ms Stuart said: "We should shape the future by leaving an organisation that is neither capable of reforming nor changing."
Mr Obama was also asked about his priorities for the final nine months of his presidency.
He mentioned implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change, prosecuting the campaign against so-called Islamic State, and concluding a trade agreement with the EU.
Mr Obama is pushing hard for a proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal, to cut tariffs and regulatory barriers between the US and EU countries.
The president also praised the First Lady, his wife, Michelle.
"I cannot separate anything that I've achieved from the partnership that I've had with that remarkable woman," he told the BBC.
"First and foremost, she's the best mother I know, and my daughters are amazing because of her parenting.
"I am labour, she's management, you know, so I can take very little credit beyond executing some of the plans that she has."
