Emergency services were sent to Aldersmead Road, West Heath, at about 20:10 GMT on Sunday.
A 27-year-old man and a man in his 30s were later arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion likely to endanger life, police said.
Emergency gas engineers were sent to the scene, but the cause of the blast is still being investigated.
One line of inquiry is that the blast could be linked to the production of illegal drugs, police said.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said the man in his 30s was treated for burns to his arm, head and back.
The younger man was treated for burns to his back, neck, hands and arms.
A spokesman for the service said: "Both patients were given pain relief on scene before being transferred to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham."
The pair remain in hospital where their injuries are described as not life threatening.
"They will be spoken to by detectives when they have recovered," a police spokesman said.
West Midlands Fire Service said search and rescue dogs had been brought in to go through the remains of the property.
Ch Insp Sean Russell, from West Midlands Police, said: "We want to make it clear that there is no ongoing threat to people living in the local community.
"This was an isolated explosion and work is continuing to identify what caused it. One line of inquiry is that it may have been linked to the production of illegal drugs.
"I would like to thank everyone for their support and patience during the emergency response last night."
Pauline Worrall, who lives opposite the scene, told the BBC bits of window and wood hit her house "like missiles".
"It was like a bomb had gone off. I know it sounds daft but I thought I was under attack. It was like a war zone," she said.
Aldersmead Road will remain closed while investigations continue.
