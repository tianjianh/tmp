A digital 3D model of a warship torpedoed off the coast of Yorkshire has been created to mark the 100th anniversary of its sinking.

HMS Falmouth sank in Bridlington Bay with the loss of 12 men on 20 August 1916 after a German U-boat attack.
The model was created by combining a seabed survey of the wreck with records held by the Imperial War Museum.
HMS Falmouth fought in the biggest naval engagement of World War One, the Battle of Jutland.
It is the only substantial wreck of a Royal Navy warship that fought in the Battle of Jutland lying in English waters.
Wayne Cocroft, senior investigator at Historic England, said: "Throughout the First World War the sea off our coast was an intensely-fought battlefield with many casualties lost within sight of the shore.
"Aside from war memorials to those lost at sea, the traces of maritime battles are invisible to all but a few.
"Modern technology is now being used to make our underwater heritage accessible to all.
"Digital 3D modelling and computer visualisation can recreate the appearance of lost vessels aiding our understanding and remembrance of this largely forgotten conflict."
