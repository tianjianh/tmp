A second boy suffered burns and a suspected broken arm after being injured at a railway depot in the West Midlands.

The incident happened at 11:45 BST on Thursday. Both injured boys were taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital, one by air ambulance.
British Transport Police said it is understood one boy was on the site when electricity arced from an overhead line and struck one side of his body.
They said the second injured boy was with him at the time.
Insp Jacqui Wilson said: "We are doing all we can to understand exactly what led to them becoming injured at the depot but what we do know is that they were inside the boundary of the site - an area out of bounds to the public - when it happened."
London Midland said it happened near the railway between Bescot Stadium in Walsall and Tame Bridge Parkway.
