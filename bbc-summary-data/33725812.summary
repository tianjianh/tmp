Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa: Funeral re-enactment in Dublin to mark centenary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A re-enactment of the funeral of the Irish republican leader Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa is due to take place in Dublin on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
O'Donovan Rossa was a renowned leader of the Fenian movement in the 19th Century seeking independence from Britain.
His burial in Dublin's Glasnevin Cemetery on 1 August, 1915, was one of the largest political funerals in Irish history.
1916 Easter Rising leader Padraig Pearse delivered the funeral oration.
The event is seen as a pivotal moment in Irish history, as several of those who attended went on to take part in the Rising.
O'Donovan Rossa 's remains had been brought to Ireland by the American liner St Paul from New York to Liverpool.
They were then transferred to the steamer Carlow, which carried them to Dublin.
In the 1850s, O'Donovan Rossa  was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) known colloquially as the Fenians, a reference to Na Fianna a band of warriors who defended Ireland from invaders in Irish mythology.
The IRB was a small, secret, revolutionary body committed to the use of force to establish an independent Irish republic.
O'Donovan Rossa  was imprisoned in various jails in England for his activities and later moved to New York following his release, continuing his efforts to oppose British rule in Ireland.
The funeral cortege on Saturday is expected to feature marching bands, uniformed Irish Volunteer cavalry and a horse drawn hearse as well as a 40-strong uniformed guard of honour.
Some mourners are expected to attend in period dress.
