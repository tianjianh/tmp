The blaze broke out at St Dominic's, in Petersburn Road, Airdrie, shortly after lessons ended on Thursday. No pupils were in the school at the time.
North Lanarkshire Council said what was left of the structure would be demolished and alternative arrangements put in place for pupils.
But it confirmed that there would be no classes for pupils next week.
In a statement the council said: "Work has begun today to demolish the building and we are currently assessing the education options available when schools resume after the Easter Holidays.
"Parents will be contacted directly early next week to advise them of arrangements."
All those inside the building were evacuated before fire crews arrived and there were no reports of any injuries.
At its height, 35 firefighters tackled the blaze.
A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the fire affected the entire building and residents in nearby homes were evacuated by police as a precautionary measure because of smoke.
St Dominic's Primary was opened in August 1971 and catered for children from nursery to primary seven.
