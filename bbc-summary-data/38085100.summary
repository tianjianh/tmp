Anderson and former Trotters striker Dean Holdsworth led a consortium which took control of the club in March.
The club had amassed debts of over £170m before the £7.5m deal.
"The club has not previously or is currently holding any discussions with a Saudi-based group or their legal representatives regarding a potential takeover," the statement said.
Bolton are third in League One, having been relegated from the Championship last season.
In September, Anderson told the BBC he was meeting businesspeople from the Far East in a bid to attract more investment to the club.
Bolton are still under a transfer embargo that was placed upon the club in December last year for failing to comply with Financial Fair Play obligations.
It means the club are unable to pay any fees for players and the Football League keeps a close eye on Bolton's dealings.
