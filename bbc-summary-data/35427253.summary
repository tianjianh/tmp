[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cyclist felt 'deliberately targeted' by Gloucestershire motorist Dean Goble

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cyclist who was driven at head-on by a motorist subsequently jailed for dangerous driving said he felt "deliberately targeted".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Goble of Siddington in Gloucestershire was found guilty of two counts of dangerous driving and sentenced to two-and-a-half-years.
In 2014, Goble deliberately swerved his Peugeot 306 at cyclist David Jones in Ashton Keynes, Wiltshire.
A camera mounted on Mr Jones's helmet recorded the incident.
Goble had claimed he was avoiding potholes, but when the footage was shown in court he was unable to point any road damage out to the jury.
Mr Jones said he "froze on his bike", and if the car had hit him it would have been "pretty devastating".
He said: "It's difficult to believe that someone would do that. It was only half an hour later when I got home and looked at the video I realised how lucky I was."
Mr Jones added that despite being a keen cyclist the incident had put him off going out on his bike.
