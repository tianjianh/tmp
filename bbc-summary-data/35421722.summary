Bronington firm fined 'derisory' £7,500 after worker killed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Wrexham company has been fined £7,500 after an employee died after being hit by a car while helping a lorry to reverse in the dark.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Ledward, 62, of Whitchurch, Shropshire, was killed in November 2011 while working for Arkenfield Stable Hire Ltd.
On Tuesday, the Bronington company pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules at Mold Crown Court.
Judge Niclas Parry said the "derisory" fine reflected the firm's means.
He described the heavy goods vehicle mechanic as a well-liked, highly regarded and respectable employee, father and husband and said the penalty was not intended to reflect the loss of life.
He added if the company had significant resources the financial penalty would have been £50,000.
The company must also pay costs of £5,000.
