HBO is to "carefully consider" how it schedules its documentary Bright Lights, about the mother-daughter relationship between Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.

The documentary premiered in May at the Cannes Film Festival and had been scheduled for broadcast in early 2017.
Reynolds' death was announced on 29 December and her daughter died two days earlier.
Bright Lights' producers are "reeling from shock", Variety reported.
Sheila Nevins, HBO Documentary Films president, said a premiere date has not yet been set.
Bright Lights was billed as "an exploration of a mother-daughter relationship in the public gaze" when it screened at Cannes.
Shot in 2014 and 2015, the film was co-directed by Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens and also features Carrie's brother and Reynolds' son Todd, who has also worked in the film industry.
Screen Daily described the documentary as a "compulsively watchable" film that was "more than just a glitzy curio".
The Hollywood Reporter called it "a tender tribute to two iconic women", while IndieWire said it was "strikingly open".
Part of Bright Lights deals with the lifetime achievement award Reynolds received from the Screen Actors Guild in 2015.
