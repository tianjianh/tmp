[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives have pledged to take Wales on a "new path", as they launched their assembly election campaign.

Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said Wales needed "real change" after "17 years of Labour failure".
The Tories have already promised not to cut NHS spending, to cap the cost of elderly care and to increase the amount of free childcare for working parents.
Currently the largest opposition party in Cardiff Bay, the Conservatives have 14 of the 60 seats in the Senedd.
At the 2015 general election, the party took seats such as Gower and the Vale of Clwyd from Labour and Brecon and Radnorshire from the Liberal Democrats.
"From protecting the NHS budget, to creating more jobs by backing small businesses and improving infrastructure and delivering excellence in education, we stand ready to take Wales on a new path," Mr Davies said.
"Our pledges to put a weekly cap on costs and protect Â£100,000 of assets for those in residential care and our commitment to treble free childcare further demonstrate how Welsh Conservatives are ready to secure real change and deliver opportunities for all people in Wales.
"Welsh voters have a clear choice between the same old ideas that simply aren't working with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour or changing to a better future with the Welsh Conservatives."
With Labour holding exactly half the seats in the Senedd, only one seat needs to change hands at May's election for the balance of power to shift to the other parties, Mr Davies added.
