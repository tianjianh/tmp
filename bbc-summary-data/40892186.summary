Officers believed Jennifer Blackwell's death on 28 April to be "non-suspicious" and she was buried in June.
Her body was exhumed from Carlton Cemetery, Nottinghamshire, in the early hours of Thursday after Nottinghamshire Police received new information.
A 38-year-old man, who was "known to her", was arrested shortly afterwards.
Det Supt Rob Griffin said: "Jennifer's family have been, and will be kept updated and supported throughout this extremely distressing time and have requested privacy as I'm sure you can understand.
"They are very supportive of the work we are doing and we are accommodating their wishes as part of the very sensitive task at hand."
