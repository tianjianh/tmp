Kayleigh Haywood, from Measham in Leicestershire, was last seen when she was dropped off outside her former school at about 18:00 GMT on Friday.
Appealing directly to her, parents Stephanie Haywood and Martin Whitby said: "We just want our KJ home."
Two men, aged 27 and 28, arrested on Monday remain in police custody.
Kayleigh's parents described her as a bubbly, loving, and caring girl.
"We all miss you so much especially Mertle, your little sister. Please come home, you're not in any trouble, we just want you back safe and sound," they said.
Kayleigh is a student at Ashby School but previously attended Ibstock Community College, where she was dropped off outside on Friday.
A mobile phone believed to be Kayleigh's was found by a member of the public in the Sence Valley Forest Park area of Ibstock, and police believe she may have been there on Saturday afternoon.
Residents are being encouraged to search their back gardens and outbuildings, leaving specially trained officers to undertake the coordinated searches.
Cadets and volunteers distributed leaflets across Ibstock on Tuesday evening in the hope it will prompt new information.
Kayleigh's parents added: "If anyone knows anything or has any information please contact the police. We just want our KJ home."
Detectives have trawled CCTV to try to find her, carried out house to house enquiries and spoken to her friends, family and school.
Det Ch Supt David Sandall said: "The longer Kayleigh is missing, the more concerned we are becoming for her safety."
