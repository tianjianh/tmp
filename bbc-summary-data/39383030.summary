Josh spoke to Newsround about what OCD is and how it has affected him since he was 11.
It started with Josh worrying about bad things happening, and washing his hands was the only thing that made him feel better.
But he didn't understand why he was feeling that way. He didn't tell anyone about it for a while, which made life difficult.
When Josh opened up and told his dad about how he was feeling, everything started to get better.
