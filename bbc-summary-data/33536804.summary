Healthcare Inspectorate Wales has just published its findings after inspecting the Heddfan Unit in April.
They said there was significant scope for improvement.
Bosses at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said they have already addressed a number of the recommendations.
The publication of the report comes after allegations were made about two mental health wards run by the health board, including the Gwanwyn ward, which is part of the Heddfan Unit.
Inspectors noted good team working on the Heddfan Unit's wards, with strong leadership and supportive management and that patients were generally complimentary about the staff.
But the report also noted some dirty utility rooms which were being used to store sterile equipment, and that some health and safety checks were not being carried out correctly.
It also said bed occupancy levels required effective monitoring to ensure patient numbers did not exceed the number of beds.
Prof Mathew Makin, health board executive medical director, said: "The majority of actions have now been completed to address the issues raised."
