QPR director of football Les Ferdinand has been been charged by the Football Association after allegedly abusing a match official following his side's 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham.

The FA said it is alleged Ferdinand "used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a match official in or around the tunnel area."
QPR had two strong penalty claims turned down by referee Craig Pawson.
The ex-Hoops striker has until 18:00 GMT on 13 March to respond.

QPR remain without a win at home under head coach Chris Ramsey, who was appointed to replace Harry Redknapp on 13 February.
The QPR boss was said he was "very disappointed" with the defeat by Spurs which kept his side three points adrift of safety.
After the game Ramsey complained about two penalty appeals - one of which was when Mauricio Isla went down under a challenge from Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, and in a separate incident Spurs midfielder Nabil Bentaleb appeared to block Charlie Austin's shot on goal with his hands.
Ramsey told BBC's Match of the Day: "We thought we deserved at least a point from the game, [there were] two controversial incidents that we need clarification on.
"We're going to need to take a look at those and we hope they don't cost us at the end of the season. We realise the referees have a difficult job and sometimes they go against you."
