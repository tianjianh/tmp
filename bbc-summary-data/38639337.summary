[SN]TITLE[SN]
Somerset man, 31, abused victims when he was child

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been jailed for 25 years for the sexual abuse of three children which started when he was a child.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Margetts, 31, from Somerset, started abusing the children when he was eight, Taunton Crown Court heard.
The 23 convictions relate to crimes he committed from the age of 10, because he was below the age of criminal responsibility when the abuse started.
Judge David Ticehurst said he was a "depraved young man, living a life of depravity, with perverted lust".
"There can be no excuse for your wickedness when you put those witnesses through the ordeal of a trial that compounds the harm you did to them," said Judge Ticehurst.
He said Margetts, of Bridgwater, had "destroyed their childhood" and he "undoubtedly knew what he was doing was seriously wrong".
The trial heard he tied up some of his victims, at times threatening them with a knife if they told anyone.
The most recent offence was in 2005, when he was 20 years old and the victim was aged under 12.
The prosecution said the charges made against him were specimen offences, meaning that in reality he abused the children hundreds of times over the years.
He was convicted guilty of 10 counts of indecent assault, three counts of false imprisonment, seven counts of rape, two of indecency with a child, one count of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity.
Margetts will not be considered for release for 12 and a half years.
