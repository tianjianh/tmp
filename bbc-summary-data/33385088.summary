Kyrgios, 20, won 5-7 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 to secure a place in round four - the stage at which he beat Rafael Nadal in 2014.
The 26th seed hit 34 aces and 61 winners as he gained revenge for last year's quarter-final defeat by Raonic.
"I don't fear anyone," said Kyrgios, who will play 21st seed Richard Gasquet in the last 16.
"Whoever I play I will just play aggressively and just keep that mind set."
The Australian hit a blizzard of winners and just 13 unforced errors as he thrilled the court two crowd over two hours and 43 minutes.
Kyrgios had clashed with officials in his previous two matches and there was a code violation this time for bouncing his racquet in anger, but for the most part his on-court antics were limited to conversations with the crowd and himself.
At one point, he put on an official Wimbledon headband only to be told it was too colourful for the tournament's all-white clothing policy, so he duly turned it inside out.
Raonic, 24, had won both their previous matches and had the upper hand once again when Kyrgios double-faulted three times to drop the first set in a woeful game.
With serve dominating, Kyrgios was in deep trouble facing a break point midway through the second set but he saved it and began to dominate.
A looping forehand winner finally earned him a break at 5-5 and he served out the set with three aces as court two came alive to the Australian's surge of energy.
The third set was a serving deadlock and once again it was Kyrgios who found the inspiration when required, reeling off six points in a row in the tie-break before hitting a second serve ace on set point.
Raonic looked to be suffering physically in the fourth as his serve speed dipped and one break was all Kyrgios required to earn another landmark win at the All England Club.
Kyrgios explained that the continual chatter and interaction with spectators and officials during matches actually helps him concentrate.
"I think when I'm in that state of mind, when I feel relaxed and I'm playing around, I think that's when I play my best tennis," said the world number 29 from Canberra.
"I'm focusing, but at the same time I'm having fun. When I find that balance, I play some really good tennis. I thought I was doing that today in the second, third and fourth.
"I was chanting to the crowd every now and then, playing with the ball boys. That's a good place to be out there."
John Newcombe, three-time Wimbledon champion: "Nick is an exceptional talent and he doesn't beat to the same drum as everyone else - he's a real  individual. Some media people will take the little negative things and build them into big issues, rather than looking at more positive things, which far outweigh the negative things."
Todd Woodbridge, nine-time Wimbledon doubles champion: "How you are going to be remembered at 19 or 20 is irrelevant. He is going to mature and he is going to grow and realise some of the things he's done and said were not the right thing. There is so much focus on him at 20 and he has to learn to cope with that. He has people round him who can help him deal with it."
Tim Henman, four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist: "Kyrgios is a performer, an entertainer and will go out and play the tennis he is capable of. He can beat anyone because he is seriously talented. He is a bit different and speaks his mind but the most important thing is that he doesn't get distracted from what's happening on the court."
