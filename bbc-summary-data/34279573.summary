A kitten has been rescued after scaling a 40ft (12m) tree and becoming stuck.

Oreo, a white male, spent about 24 hours clinging to the spindly branches at the very top of the tree in St Margaret's Avenue in Luton.
RSPCA officer Kate Wright said he had probably become too frightened to climb down. She was also concerned the flimsy branches could break in the high wind.
The fire service used an aerial platform to rescue Oreo before returning him safely to his owners.
"Poor Oreo had been trapped up this super-high tree for more than 24 hours and was clearly very scared," Ms Wright said.
"I am not sure for sure how high this tree was, but I think it must have been at least 40ft (12m) as it was about four times the height of the bungalow next to it."
She said seven-month-old Oreo could be heard "crying out loudly" from the ground below.
Bedfordshire firefighters came to the rescue and retrieved the kitten.
