England Under-21s defender Calum Chambers says "there has been no better time" to be an English player as they aim to become the fourth England youth side to reach a final in two months.

England won the U20 World Cup and the Toulon Tournament in June, after the U17s lost the Euro 2017 final in May.
The U21s face Germany in the Euro 2017 semi-finals on Tuesday in Poland.
"There is a great future. They're winning things; we'd love to do the same," Chambers told BBC Radio 5 live.
"There is the senior first team as well. They have lots of good young players already."
England beat Poland 3-0 on Thursday to qualify for the last four as Group A winners.
It is the first time they have reached the semi-finals since 2009, when Stuart Pearce's side beat Sweden on penalties before losing the final 4-0 to a Germany team that featured Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels and Mesut Ozil.
"The competition here between the teams is very high, but we've dealt with the pressure well," added 22-year-old Chambers, who spent last season on loan from Arsenal at Middlesbrough.
"That's due to the experience we have from playing at tournaments together in the past - like when we won at Toulon last summer. That has helped us get the results we needed.
"There is a good vibe; the boys are confident. Everyone is happy we've made it through the group stages and we are looking forward to the match.
"We've practised penalties, too, so if it comes to that, we'll be ready."
