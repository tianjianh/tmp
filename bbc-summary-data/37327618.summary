Twaddell: Hopes of deal increase after Ballysillan members resign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hopes of a deal to end the north Belfast parade dispute have increased after a number of members of an Orange Order lodge who opposed a proposed agreement indicated they plan to resign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two north Belfast lodges involved in the dispute backed an agreement in June, but Ballysillan lodge refused to endorse it.
Ballysillan members who opposed the deal are due to resign which would leave supporters of the proposed agreement with a majority in the lodge.
However, this does not mean the dispute is over.
The lodges still have to re-enter talks with a nationalist residents group in the Ardoyne area, the Crumlin Ardoyne Residents Association (CARA).
The proposed deal would result in the completion of the return leg of the Orange Order parade prevented from passing the Ardoyne shop fronts in July 2013, and the protest camp at Twaddell Avenue being dismantled.
In August, the Ballysillan lodge suspended its protest.
In a statement, it said it would continue to apply for an evening parade past the Ardoyne shops.
Two other north Belfast lodges, Ligoniel and the Earl of Erne, who had backed the proposed deal to end the Ardoyne parade dispute in June have continued their protest.
The long-running parading dispute has been ongoing since July 2013.
It began after a Parades Commission determination not to allow a return leg of an Orange parade to pass a section of the Crumlin Road.
