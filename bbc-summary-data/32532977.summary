Wilton Lodge Park stretches across 107 acres on the western edge of Hawick and is currently undergoing a Â£3.64m facelift.
It is also home to the historic museum and, as part of the regeneration, the Park Gallery has been created in the building.
The new space will now house the permanent exhibition about the park.
It traces how the grounds of Wilton Lodge moved from private to public hands, becoming the well-used park it is today.
The display also recalls historic events which have taken place in the park, it looks at local wildlife and at how people have enjoyed the space in the past.
The Park Gallery will be formally opened by councillor Vicky Davidson on Sunday. It follows the official unveiling of a new park bandstand last month.
Ms Davidson said:  "There is a great deal of local pride invested in Wilton Lodge Park and the new gallery is designed to reflect this and encourage this same pride in future generations.
"The Park Gallery is the second element in the Wilton Lodge Park regeneration project to be completed, following the opening of the new bandstand.
"It is designed to strengthen the connection between the museum and park and encourage visitors to extend their stay and explore the park."
