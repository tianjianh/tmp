Riders needed one win from five remaining games and, having been level after two quarters, pulled clear of play-off chasing Plymouth to win 99-69.
Head coach Rob Paternostro guided them to 26 wins from 29 games, adding the trophy to their BBL Cup win in March.
"We pulled out some close games this year - that's been important," he said.
Speaking after the third championship win in Riders' history, he added: "It feels great. We went in at half-time, we thought we had to get some stops, we came out third quarter and played good defence. Another great team effort.
"It has been a difficult week. Everyone had us pencilled in as champions but I wanted to get the job done tonight."
With the scores tied 44-44 at halfway, Riders scored 24 points to the visitors' seven in a key third quarter.
Paternostro's side overcame Plymouth to land the BBL Trophy in March - a result which sealed back-to-back successes in the knockout competition.
They will now look to win the BBL play-offs for a third time, having last won the end-of-season knockout in 2013.
Plymouth are still well placed to finish in the top eight and secure a play-off spot as they sit seventh.
