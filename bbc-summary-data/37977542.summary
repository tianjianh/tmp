[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man charged with 1968 murder of Teesside toddler

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 70-year-old man has appeared in court charged with murdering an 18-month-old boy on Teesside almost 50 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Dearlove, 70, from Great Yarmouth, is charged with murdering toddler Paul Booth, from Haverton Hill, Stockton, in October 1968.
No plea was entered during the short hearing at Teesside Magistrates' Court, but Mr Dearlove's solicitor indicated he would deny the charge.
He was remanded in custody until a crown court hearing on 16 November.
Adam Hodge, defending, said: "I can say that the matters are denied. There will be a trial."
Mr Hodge said an application for bail would be made at a later date.
Mr Dearlove also faces a charge of neglect between January and October 1968.
Magistrates had applied a restriction on reporting the dead child's identity, but this was lifted following a challenge by the media.
