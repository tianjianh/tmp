Rui Li, 44, who worked at Poole Hospital, was last seen by her daughter on the evening of 23 May. She was reported missing on Tuesday morning.
The body, believed to be that of Ms Li, was discovered in a car in Verwood Crescent, near Hengistbury Head, on Friday evening.
A father and son, aged 26 and 60, who were arrested on suspicion of murder, remain in custody.
Both were known to Ms Li, police said.
No formal identification of the body has taken place but officers said Ms Li's next of kin had been informed.
The area around the car, a silver Fiat Punto, remained sealed off throughout Saturday following the discovery at about 22:30 BST on Friday.
Forensic experts are examining the car and the surrounding area.
Det Insp Marcus Hester, of Dorset Police, said: "We now wish to speak with anyone who has any information about the silver Fiat Punto, W887 PDL.
"This car may have been seen in the area of Cromer Motors on St Clements Road and on or around Knyveton Road in Boscombe between Sunday 25 May and Wednesday 28 May.
"We also believe that this vehicle travelled between Verwood and Hengistbury Head on Wednesday 28 May."
Officers are also appealing for information about the movement of a large white Ford Transit van, registration Y491 GFT, thought to have been in the area around Cromers Motors and Burnham Drive between Saturday 24 May and Tuesday.
On Friday, Ms Li's daughter, Lu Yao, issued a statement through police in which she said she had last seen her mother, happy and smiling, on Friday night when she returned home from work.
Ms Li was recorded by CCTV cameras leaving Poole Hospital on Friday evening in her Porsche Boxster, which has a personalised number plate.
The car was recovered from an address on Wolverton Road in Boscombe.
The coroner has been made aware of the discovery of the body.
