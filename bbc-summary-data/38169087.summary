[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman accused of disguising herself as a man to kill her half-sister said a figure seen at the victim's flat was "definitely" male, a court has heard.

Yvonne Caylor, 53, denies murdering Nikki Collingbourne, 26, who was found dead at home in Letchworth in May.
Luton Crown Court heard Ms Caylor told police the figure seen on CCTV was not her, as her "boobs would stick out".
She is alleged to have donned a wig and fake beard and to have used a casserole dish to beat her sister to death.
Ms Collingbourne is said to have been attacked by Ms Caylor, of Grove Road, Hitchin, with a chicken-shaped casserole dish on 23 May, after the defendant had been charged with burgling Ms Collingbourne's flat in Ivel Court.
The prosecution alleges the motive for the murder goes back to October 2015 when Ms Collingbourne evicted Ms Caylor from the flat.
Ms Caylor claimed Ms Collingbourne had assaulted her and, while the younger woman was in the custody of Hertfordshire Police, it is alleged Ms Caylor burgled the flat.
The case was in a "warned list" at Cambridge Crown Court starting on 23 May, the day of the alleged murder.
After her arrest, Ms Caylor was played CCTV which showed a figure forcing entry to the flat.
In a police interview, read and in parts shown to the jury, the defendant, whose alleged disguise had also included heavy-rimmed glasses and a hi-vis jacket, said she would not have been strong enough to force her way into Ms Collingbourne's home.
She told police she did not recognise the person, saying the intruder looked like a man, and she also denied owning a fake beard and wig or having a fluorescent jacket.
Asked by a police officer if it was her, she said: "Of course it ain't me. It is definitely a man. My boobs would stick out."
When the officer said "we suspect that person murdered your sister", she replied "it ain't me. It is surreal".
The trial continues.
