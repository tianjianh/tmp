The teenager was with a 17-year-old male when she was assaulted on the 12th floor stairwell of the car park in Oswald Street at about 11:00 on 29 July.
Police said a dark-haired woman carrying books entered the landing just before the attack and a man in a dark suit passed by shortly after.
Officers want to speak to both people.
Det Insp Craig Willison, of Police Scotland, said: "We are keen to trace these two witnesses, who potentially could provide us with information which may help with our inquiry.
"I'd like to reassure the public that we are following a positive line of inquiry in this case, and I would like to reiterate that Police Scotland takes any report of any sexual assault very seriously."
