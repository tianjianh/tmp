Liverpool 2-1 West Bromwich Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool secured a deserved victory over West Brom but conceded a late goal to miss out on going top of the Premier League.

Jurgen Klopp's team dominated at Anfield and took the lead as Sadio Mane steered in Roberto Firmino's dinked cross.
Philippe Coutinho added a second when he picked up the ball from Mane, cut inside Baggies defender Gareth McAuley and shot into the bottom corner.
A two-goal victory would have taken Liverpool top, but McAuley denied them first place when he smashed in a late goal after the hosts failed to clear a corner.
Nevertheless, the victory extended their unbeaten run to nine games in all competitions to leave them second in the Premier League table, behind leaders Arsenal on goal difference.
Liverpool have scored 20 times in the Premier League this season - more than anyone else - despite England international Daniel Sturridge failing to score in his seven league outings.
He did not feature as he was dropped to the substitutes' bench at Anfield, but was not missed as his side dominated, having 21 shots on goal and 68% of possession.
Liverpool had further chances but Adam Lallana, recalled in place of Sturridge, curled over the bar and James Milner also headed off target.
The Baggies had goalkeeper Ben Foster to thank for keeping them in the game in the second half as he acrobatically pushed away Dejan Lovren's header and also did well to save a Roberto Firmino effort.
But Liverpool failed to kill off the game and West Brom looked for an improbable equaliser despite previously having little of the ball and creating few chances.
Tony Pulis's side had to wait until the 70th minute to have a shot when Nacer Chadli curled an effort over the top and McAuley's late goal came from their only attempt on target.
Substitute Hal Robson-Kanu had a late opportunity, but his shot was blocked by Dejan Lovren. Anything other than a Liverpool victory would have been a injustice.
West Brom have only scored 10 goals in nine Premier League matches, with Saido Berahino a constant issue for Pulis.
The 23-year-old striker, who got 20 goals in all competitions back in 2014-15, has only netted one Premier League goal in 2016 and been placed on a fitness programme after being "eight pounds over his ideal weight".
Yet again, he was not included in West Brom's 18-man squad, but they need their striker back fit with the right attitude quickly. Salomon Rondon struggled to get in the game and Robson-Kanu is yet to score since joining the Baggies in September.
Jurgen Klopp has been in charge of Liverpool for just over a year and created an attacking side that is pleasing on the eye and a squad that could challenge for the Premier League title.
They only finished eighth last season, but do not have the distraction of European football this year and have made a fantastic start, despite a tough run of games.
In their nine league matches in 2016-17, they have played four of the current top seven - Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United - as well as defending champions Leicester.
They now have what appears to be, on paper at least, a favourable run of fixtures, with their next seven matches against sides all outside of the top seven.
One major concern for Klopp would be their inability to kill off this game, and the late goal they conceded means they have have kept just one clean sheet in their last 11 Premier League games.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: "I am happy with the performance of my team. It is difficult against West Brom, so many balls in the air and they are so dangerous from set pieces.
"It would have been a joke if we had drawn today, it was unbelievable how we played. It was a good performance against a team like this. They were here to get something, but we never let them back into the game.
"Their corners kicks are so good, I had a feeling that 15 players in white kit were in the box. It was a big, big challenge to stay cool, stay concentrated. It is a really nice team I am really happy to have these boys around."

West Brom boss Tony Pulis: "In the first half we were OK, just two poor mistakes. It is quality at times when we get the ball, to get in their final third.
"In the second half we had a go, it opened up at our end and Ben made some wonderful saves. We made changes, freshened it up and caused them problems.
"You know if you get a goal it puts them on the back foot and it is a shame it didn't come earlier.
"We lack certain qualities we are looking for. The squad has improved, they have faults and we accept that but they worked hard today."

Former England and Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day: "Coutinho is the jewel in the crown for Liverpool. He is special in so many ways, now he is adding that end product.
"He has scored four (league) goals this season, he only scored eight last season. He's playing with confidence and his decision making is much better than it was before.
"He's dictating games, he's frightening the opposition. His performance was absolutely magnificent. Long may it continue."
Former Middlesbrough and Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on Match of the Day: "Liverpool's defending from set pieces is one of their Achilles' heels. They are playing with a zonal marking system and as a player I hated it.
"They do not have players on the posts at corners and it just makes it more difficult. As a goalkeeper, you feel more exposed."
Liverpool are back in action on Tuesday when they entertain Tottenham in the fourth round of the EFL Cup, before they play away at Crystal Palace in the Premier League next Saturday.
For West Brom, they have a week without a match before taking on Manchester City at home in the Premier League on Saturday, 29 October.
