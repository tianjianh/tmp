The All England Club doesn't just host the Wimbledon Championships, it's a working tennis club all year round, and week-in week-out they're busy taking the sport into local schools all across south-west London.
Coach Dan Bloxham is the driving force behind their outreach programme - the Wimbledon Junior Tennis Initiative - that has been getting young people involved in the sport, and finding potential talent like Elizabeth, for 14 years.
