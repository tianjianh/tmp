Ross Hannah: Chester re-sign striker on two-year deal following Barrow release

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester have re-signed striker Ross Hannah on a two-year contract following his release by Barrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hannah, 31, scored just five goals in 32 appearances for the Cumbrian club last season in the National League.
But the former Bradford City and Grimsby Town forward now rejoins the club where he was top scorer with 22 goals in 42 league games in 2015-16.
He becomes Jon McCarthy's fourth summer signing after co-strikers Harry White, Nyal Bell - and defender Andy Halls.
Hannah scored one of his five goals last term against Chester in an early-season 3-2 win at Holker Street.
