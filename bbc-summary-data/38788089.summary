Northampton Town's League One 3-0 home win over Coventry City was disrupted several times by fans on Saturday.
Northamptonshire Police said six arrests were made when spectators from the away stand invaded the pitch and a further three when flares were let-off.
Coventry City said the disruption was "unacceptable". Northampton declined to comment. Those arrested were bailed.
Northampton Town said it would not comment until a decision was made by the Football Association or English Football League on an investigation.
"The repeated disruptions to yesterday's match at Northampton Town were unacceptable," a Coventry City spokesman said.
"Coventry City FC will support all subsequent investigations by the police and football authorities."
Match reports said the fans were protesting against the Coventry club's owners.
Supt Chris Hillery said: "During the fixture we were made aware that some of the spectators in the away South Stand had planned a mass pitch incursion at a designated time.
"As a result, match officials turned off the scoreboard time display and officers were placed in front of the West Stand and in the players' tunnel to prevent people intent on disorder entering these areas en masse."
There was no serious disorder, violence or injury, police said.
