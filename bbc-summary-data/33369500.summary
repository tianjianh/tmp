It issued yellow "be aware" rain warnings for much of Wales, saying isolated thunderstorms may develop in the evening.
The Met Office said storms could be severe with torrential downpours and hail a possibility.
But it said there was "large uncertainty" over the areas at risk and many will remain dry.
The forecaster said there will be a "fresher start than recently" on Friday morning, with plenty of sunshine across Wales.
It will turn cloudier later in the day and become increasingly warm and humid, with maximum temperatures up to 26C (79F).
Thundery rain will then move north overnight, the Met Office said.
Conditions could cause "very localised significant disruption", added forecasters.
