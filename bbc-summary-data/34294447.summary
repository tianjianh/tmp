[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Anthony Greco, 31, from Christchurch, pleaded guilty to child sex offences and breaching his sexual offenders prevention order.
Police said they had "extensively" investigated his "sickening offences".
Appearing at Dorchester Crown Court, he was jailed for three years and three months, with a further three years and nine months on licence.
Greco admitted possessing indecent images of children, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and breaching his sexual offenders prevention order in December last year.
Det Cons Paul Chessell of Dorset Police said: "Greco posed a threat to members of the public and it is right that he received this sentence.
"These are sickening offences which we investigated extensively to bring him to justice.
"This jail term is a warning to anyone involved in downloading indecent images of children."
