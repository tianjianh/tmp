[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Cairns, 18, was murdered in Ballykelly on his way home from a night out. His body was found in a forest the day after he was attacked.
A police officer met his parents, Hazel and Raymond, in their Ballykelly home.
He told the family that they have new information since the Justice for Jonathan Cairns Facebook page was set up.
Jonathan's body was found in a forest the day after he was attacked and murdered while on his way home from a night out.
No-one has ever been convicted of his killing.
Raymond Cairns said: "I was nervous when they came in the door. I didn't know what to say.
"Jonathan's room sits the same way as it did the night he left. All we want is justice."
He said detectives now had "information that they never heard before".
"It's all because of this Facebook page.
"He said he couldn't tell us much more than that at this stage but I'm just grateful that there is some positivity surrounding this case.
"Today is a good day. But we still want full justice. We see his face every single day.
"We hope more and more people come forward."
PSNI Det Ch Insp John McVea said new lines of inquiry would be pursued in the coming weeks.
"The meeting was to give the family a progress report on our enquiries," he said.
"We understand their desire to see justice for Jonathan, and we are committed to doing all in our power to apprehend those involved in this brutal incident.
"We are aware of the Justice for Jonathan Facebook campaign and that a number of people have posted comments.
"I would encourage anyone who has seen the site and feels they have information to contact the inquiry team at Seapark police station directly on the 101 non-emergency number."
