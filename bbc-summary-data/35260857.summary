[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elsie Frost, 14, was found dead on a towpath, in Wakefield, in 1965. She had been stabbed in the back and head.
Since launching their re-investigation West Yorkshire Police has received 40 calls, including a report of a man in a duffel coat near the murder scene at about the time Elsie's body was found.
Det Ch Insp Elizabeth Belton said the response had been "highly encouraging".
Elsie was attacked on 9 October 1965 as she walked through a railway tunnel, which now leads onto Monckton Road, just off the Calder and Hebble Canal towpath.
Her body was found near a flight of stairs known locally as the ABC steps.
According to a new witness, the man in the duffel was seen near the steps at about 16:15 BST and in the surrounding area later that afternoon.
Mrs Belton said: "A common description of a person of interest which has come from some of the calls has been of a man wearing a brown, potentially duffel, type coat with dark hair who was seen on the canal towpath.
"He was of medium to thin build and in his early 20's. He was described as carrying a bag by some witnesses, and was possibly of what was described as a scruffy or 'student type' appearance.
"Witnesses describe seeing potential suspects in the area of the canal at around the time of the murder and then in the Denby Dale road area after 4.45pm, and then into the evening."
Anyone with information is asked to contact the Major Investigation Review Team on 101.
