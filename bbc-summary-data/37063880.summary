Two people had to be hospitalised in July after being infected with the bacteria which was linked to a cheese manufacturer in South Lanarkshire.
Health Protection Scotland said all 19 victims were recovering at home.
The first cases were detected between 2 and 15 July and were linked to Dunsyre blue cheese, which is made with unpasteurised milk.
Manufacturer Errington Cheese, based in Carnwath, recalled about 180kg of the cheese as a precaution.
Founder Humphrey Errington said: "As a responsible company, we took the voluntary decision to recall the two batches of cheese which they were concerned about."
The E. coli bug is found in the stomachs of farm animals including cows and can find its way into food and drink as a contaminant.
Symptoms of infection include stomach cramps, diarrhoea, vomiting and occasionally fever. It can prove fatal in the infirm and young.
