Freestyle hope work on Parc Kronberg in Aberystwyth, which already has planning consent, will finish by summer 2017.
The firm said the community park is unique in that it will include pathways forming an entrance to the town.
It follows a seven-year consultation with more than 2,000 people.
About £400,000 has been confirmed in big lottery funding, with Aberystwyth Town Council providing a further £100,000.
Chris Taylor from Freestyle said: "We are all just incredibly excited - it's a UK first because it's not just a skate park, it's a community park.
"We have designed it in such a way that skaters, riders and the community can mix as much as they want.
"The skaters wanted to be interacting, and the public wanted to be closer to the youths using it too."
The project includes a play area, climbing wall, riverside viewing, cycle and footpaths and community seating areas as well as spaces for skating.
