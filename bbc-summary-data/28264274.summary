Suffolk Police: Inquiry call over officer and staff misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twenty three Suffolk police officers and civilian staff were sacked or quit over misconduct in the past two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A document released under the Freedom of Information Act shows officers left after being accused of sexual assault, domestic violence and benefit fraud.
The force has also launched a drive to tackle a 46% rise in the number of complaints since April 2013.
Tim Passmore, Suffolk's Police and Crime Commissioner, said he would ask the chief constable to investigate.
Mr Passmore said: "Officers who don't behave with the highest levels of integrity are letting themselves and the people of Suffolk down.
"The vast majority of officers are hard-working individuals who give fantastic service, but sadly a minority don't behave as you would expect and I will be asking the chief constable to look at these figures and will work with him to see what else we can do to reduce them.
"These people are letting down their colleagues who do their job properly, because this tarnishes the majority."
The force recorded a 46% rise in complaints, from 259 in 2012-13 to 379 in 2013-14.
One woman complained officers had forced their way into her property while she was on holiday, causing damage, and it turned out they had gone to the wrong address.
Another had a complaint upheld after they alleged they were unlawfully strip-searched.

Other upheld complaints related to the address of a witness being released prior to a court case "putting the victim and witness in fear".
A Complaint Reduction Strategy was introduced involving a number of training initiatives such as a podcast on integrity.
Suffolk Police said the force was still below the national average for complaints and the rise needed to be viewed "in context".
A Suffolk Police spokeswoman said: "We take all complaints extremely seriously and conduct thorough investigations while weighing up the nature of the alleged offence and the needs of the victim or complainant.
"It is now far easier for members of the public to engage with the complaints process in person, by phone, email or in writing.
"The increase in complaints and allegations may indicate greater public confidence in making complaints."
