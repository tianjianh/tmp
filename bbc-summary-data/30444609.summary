The New South Wales player, 22, took six wickets for just 14 runs as his state team beat Queensland.
NSW coach Trevor Bayliss praised Abbott's "character" and said the team were "over the moon" for the player.
The match took place at Sydney Cricket Ground, the venue where Abbott bowled the ball that led to the death of Hughes, 25, last month.
Abbott, who has played three ODIs and one T20 for Australia, was on a hat-trick at one point and finished with 8-67 in the match.
He received a standing ovation as he left the pitch.
"To do what he did really showed the character that he has," said New South Wales coach Trevor Bayliss.
"He was probably one of the guys who handled the situation better than some of the other guys.
"To do what he did today showed the character that he has got as well.
"Everyone was just so happy for him, after what happened two weeks ago, so hopefully that puts him back on the road to more success.
"It was a hostile spell. He bowled fast on a flat fourth-day wicket, and short when he had to, pitching it up hitting the stumps. It was a fantastic fourth-day performance.
"On this performance, he'll play more for Australia, I'm sure."
Abbott has been receiving counselling, and the support of the cricketing world, after he bowled the bouncer that killed Hughes.
He attended his funeral and was consoled by Hughes's family and other cricketers, who urged him to resume playing.
After taking two wickets in Queensland's first innings, on Friday Abbott showed why he is regarded as one of Australia's rising talents.
With the match seemingly heading for a draw, Abbott produced an extraordinary seven-over spell and at one stage took five wickets for five runs as NSW took control.
Former Australia Test bowler Shane Warne said: "Good to see him back enjoying his cricket and taking wickets."
Australia are also playing their first match since Hughes's death, the delayed opening Test against India at Adelaide.
David Warner scored his second century of the match for Australia on Friday and then posted a message on his Instagram account praising his New South Wales team-mate.
He wrote: "Credit to my good mate @sean_abbott bowling NSW to victory against QLD today. Been a tough week for everyone but this bloke has a genuine heart of gold and has fought hard this week to come back and bowl again. Well done mate proud of you."
