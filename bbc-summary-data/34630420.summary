An Audi A4 hit the area outside Streets nightclub, in John Street, Porthcawl, Bridgend county, at about 01:00.
The injured were aged between 17 and 43, with nine taken to hospital in Bridgend and four to Swansea - most with leg injuries.

An 18-year-old woman is helping South Wales Police with their inquiries. Both have been taken to Bridgend police station.
It is understood that seven men and six women in total were injured.
The Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said three of those injured and taken to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend have been treated and discharged.
The remaining six people have sustained serious injuries but are in a stable condition.
Those taken to Morriston Hospital in Swansea include two 18-year-old men, a 21-year-old woman, and another woman who is 38.
