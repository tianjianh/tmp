They chatted backstage at the Women in the World conference where they each gave separate live interviews.
The two women do not agree on everything, with Mrs Clinton publicly opposing the release of the Lockerbie bomber and Scottish independence.
But the first minister told the conference that female leaders like her owed Mrs Clinton "a debt of gratitude".
Ms Sturgeon said Mrs Clinton had blazed a trail and made it easier for others to follow.
Both politicians spoke out against misogyny when they appeared on stage.
They met behind the scenes for a brief chat and posed for pictures which have since appeared online.
During her interview at the Women in the World summit, Ms Sturgeon criticised a recent tabloid front page that reduced talks between her and UK Prime Minister Theresa May to a contest between their legs.
The Daily Mail faced a backlash last week for comparing Mrs May and Ms Sturgeon's legs when they met amid disagreements over Brexit and the first minister's push for a second Scottish referendum on independence.
"I tried not to overreact," Ms Sturgeon said about the headline "Never mind Brexit, who won Legs-it!"
"No matter how much progress women have made and are making, it's a vivid illustration of how much more we still have to achieve," she said.
She referenced an image taken last year from a meeting with May in Edinburgh that was cut off at the knees looking at their shoes.
"This tendency to reduce women to body parts or to what they wear or what their hair looks like is not innocent and it's not something we should just laugh off," she said.
Sturgeon said she was inspired by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and praised her for standing up to Donald Trump immediately after his electoral victory last year.
"I've never been comfortable with the idea that when fundamental principles and values are at stake that politicians should just retain a diplomatic silence," she said.
"I think we've all got a duty on some occasions to speak up and Angela Merkel did that," Ms Sturgeon added.
Ms Sturgeon also spoke out against what she called an "air of misogyny" about Hillary Clinton's treatment during the election.
"The way that Hillary was talked about, the treatment that Hillary suffered at times, just seemed to me to have an air of misogyny about it, that I wanted to believe that we had moved on from," she said.
"She has made it easier for women like me in politics and I think for that I and women across the world really owe Hillary Clinton a debt of gratitude," she said.
