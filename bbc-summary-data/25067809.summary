The 55-year-old left Stoke City during the summer and succeeds Ian Holloway, who exited Selhurst Park on 23 October.
Caretaker manager Keith Millen remained in charge for Saturday's 1-0 victory at Hull, with Pulis's first game coming against Norwich next weekend.
Crystal Palace sit six points from safety and have been relegated in all four seasons they have played in the Premier League
Pulis has never been relegated in 21 years as a manager but Palace sit in the Premier League's bottom three.
The Eagles were promoted to the top flight via the Championship play-offs in May, but have never survived a season in the Premier League.
They have only beaten Sunderland and Hull City this season, but the win at the KC Stadium secured a second clean sheet in as many matches after a goalless draw with Everton two weeks ago.
During Holloway's final news conference as manager, Palace co-chairman Steve Parish said the club hoped to talk to Pulis, but it is understood the former Plymouth Argyle boss was initially cautious about taking the job.
It is understood he wants to bolster the squad during the January transfer window to aid Palace's fight for survival.

There were rumours Wales manager Chris Coleman could be appointed before he committed his future to his country, with Iain Dowie and new Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka also linked with the role.
Parish had also explored the possibility of appointing former Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu, who is now manager of Dinamo Moscow.
However, Petrescu said: "I have not been in talks with any club being under contract with another outfit. And I'm not set to do it in the future."
Welshman Pulis was appointed Stoke boss for a second time in 2006 and two years later led them into the top flight after a 23-year absence.
Despite not finishing lower than 14th in five seasons in the Premier League and guiding the Potters to an FA Cup final, he left the Britannia Stadium by mutual consent in the summer after being told the board wanted to take the club in a "different direction".
Palace, who secured four points from 12 under Millen's temporary charge, are three points from safety.
