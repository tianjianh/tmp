Peterborough United 2-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dominic Ball struck the winner as Peterborough scored twice in the final 20 minutes to beat 10-man Shrewsbury Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The on-loan defender, signed in January from Rotherham, headed his first goal for the club to complete a rapid second-half turnaround which brought the visitors' six-match unbeaten run to an end.
In-form Shrewsbury had looked on course to climb further clear of the League One relegation zone when striker Stephen Humphrys marked his first start for the club with his first goal.
The on-loan Fulham frontman converted a 31st-minute penalty after Shaun Whalley's cross was handled by Michael Smith.
But Humphrys' dismissal 10 minutes into the second half, a second caution for failing to retreat at a free-kick, proved to be the turning point.
Posh soon made the most of their numerical advantage, levelling seven minutes later when Ryan Tafazolli headed home from Paul Taylor's corner.
Ball was then picked out by a 78th-minute cross from substitute Taylor as Posh claimed a first home win of 2017 to boost their play-off hopes.
Humphrys' red card, on his first Shrewsbury start, was the ninth received by a Town player this season - the highest number in English football's top four divisions.
