Northbay Pelagic said its main processing and packing lines had been lost along with an office and administration block.
The blaze broke out on Saturday afternoon and burned for more than 10 hours.
The company, one of the town's biggest employers, said it would continue to meet customer needs.
An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.
A statement on Northbay Pelagic's website said: "Key strategic areas of our facility remain fully operational and we continue to service our business and customer needs.
"We are currently looking at all of our options going forward and we will hopefully announce our plan of action soon.
"In the meantime, we are sourcing temporary accommodation for our administration and management staff and re-establishing daily communications with all of our customers and suppliers."
The fire was brought under control overnight into Sunday.
Nearby flats were evacuated but no-one was believed to have been in the factory at the time.
A rest centre was set up at Peterhead Academy for people evacuated from their homes in Errol Street and road closures were expected to remain in place for some time.
Northbay Pelagic is reported to employ about 300 people in Peterhead, one of Europe's busiest fish landing ports.
