[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 2-2 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham missed out on the chance to move into the Championship play-off places as Lucas Joao's late goal earned relegation-threatened Blackburn a draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joao converted Derrick Williams' cross as Rovers remained unbeaten since Tony Mowbray took over as head coach.
Sone Aluko swept Fulham ahead just before the break, but Craig Conway levelled from the spot after Tomas Kalas brought down Marvin Emnes.
Gohi Cyriac restored Fulham's lead, but Joao struck to deny them the win.
The result left Slavisa Jokanovic's side still seventh in the table, one point behind Sheffield Wednesday, while Blackburn climbed above Bristol City and out of the bottom three.
Fulham dominated possession the first half and after Aluko had been foiled by keeper Jason Steele in a one-on-one, he finally clipped home a left-wing cross to give them the lead.
The introduction of Joao as a substitute injected life into the Rovers attack, and Conway hammered the equaliser down the middle after Kalas was penalised.
Ryan Fredericks cut the ball back for Cyriac to superbly net his first goal since joining Fulham from Belgian football, but a late rally saw Connor Mahoney and Joao threaten the Fulham goal before the latter bundled the ball past David Button for his third goal in two games.
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic:
"It's frustrating but it's a part of the competition, we have scored many times in the last moments of games.
"In the first half we dominated and scored the goal. Second half we didn't dominate the game, we didn't control them and at the end we made some mistakes.
"We didn't have enough experience to kill the game when we scored the second goal, we gave them the chance to come back.
"We're going to fight to be in this top six at the beginning of May. We have to keep going and push hard."
Blackburn head coach Tony Mowbray told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"I think for the group, it's important to try and keep the run going.
"They showed great effort and had that desire not to lose the match against a really good football team, who can press you back with their passing.
"They have to keep doing it, they have to keep producing it week in week out."
