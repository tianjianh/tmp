The lots included a Rolls-Royce Phantom owned by Sir Elton John, which went for £123,750.
A Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible, previously owned by the Qatari royal family, was snapped up for £135,000.
But a number of cars in the collection failed to achieve their reserve prices, including a 2012 Bentley Mulsanne owned by the Queen.
A 1994 Audi Cabriolet, previously owned by Princess Diana, was sold for £54,000.
Diana travelled about 4,000 miles in the car.
Other highlights during the auction included the sale of a 1972 Fiat 500L, which was bought by former Prime Minister David Cameron as a birthday present to his wife Samantha, and fetched £20,813.
A 1976 Bentley owned by Michael Winner and a 1980 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith II, formerly owned by Princess Margaret, also failed to meet their reserves.
The Jewels In The Crown Collection went under the hammer at the NEC Classic Motor Show on Saturday and Sunday.
