But on Sunday, Harry Potter star Emma Watson spoke for 15 minutes without notes at the UN about gender equality.
She is launching a campaign called HeForShe, which aims to get more men and boys fighting for equal rights.
"I was appointed six months ago and the more I have spoken about feminism the more I have realised that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating," she said.
"If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop."
Watson's first appearance as Hermione Granger was in 2001's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as an 11-year-old.
She told UN delegates in New York that she started thinking about gender inequality as a child three years before hitting the big time.
She said: "I started questioning gender-based assumptions when at eight I was confused at being called bossy because I wanted to direct the plays we would put on for our parents but the boys were not.
"When at 14 I started being sexualised by certain elements of the press.
"When at 15 my girlfriends started dropping out of their sports teams because they didn't want to appear muscley.
"When at 18 my male friends were unable to express their feelings.
"I decided I was a feminist and this seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word."
The 24-year-old told delegates at the UN that she wants women making big decisions, and being respected for the work that they do.
"I am from Britain and I think it is right that I am paid the same as my male counterparts," she said.
"I think it is right that I should be able to make decisions about my own body.
"I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and the decisions that affect my life.
"I think it is right that socially, I am afforded the same respect as men.
"You might think, 'Who is this Harry Potter girl? What is she doing at the UN?' And it's a really good question.
"I've been asking myself at the same thing. All I know is that I care about this problem and I want to make it better."
Watson announced her role as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations in July.
According to UN Women, the aim of the HeForShe campaign is get each of the first 100,000 supporters to bring at least 100 other men and boys into the campaign.
UN Women is the abbreviated name of The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.
Supporters of the HeForShe campaign include actors Matt Damon, Patrick Stewart, Antonio Banderas, Kiefer Sutherland and The Riot Club actor Douglas Booth.
