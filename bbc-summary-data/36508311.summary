Hal Robson-Kanu's late winner saw Wales win their first major tournament match in 58 years 2-1 and earn their first victory in the European Championship.
"Our fans are the best in the world. It was like a home game - they fully got behind us and we gave them something to celebrate," said Gareth Bale.
"It was a historic moment for our country, a massive moment."
Real Madrid forward Bale gave Wales the lead with a free-kick on 10 minutes and says the victory "ranks right up there" in his career highlights.
He added: "We are taking it one game as it comes. Now it is on to England. We keep fighting on."
Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen agreed that the fans had helped to inspire Chris Coleman's men.
"The fans made all the difference," Allen told BBC Sport. "This was the type of performance our fans have come to expect from us.
"They were incredible - they carried us through so much, especially at the end.
"Our fans stayed with us and it helped us find that extra five or 10% that makes all the difference."
But Allen, who made his Wales debut in 2009, warns nothing has been achieved yet.
"Our focus is on making sure complacency doesn't creep in before our next game," he said.
Match-winner Robson-Kanu insists the players are not looking beyond the next game.
"We are focusing on ourselves. It is about what we can do. England is next and we are fully focused on that."
