Surrey have signed Warwickshire all-rounder Rikki Clarke on a two-year deal, to begin in 2018.

Clarke started his career with Surrey, but left to join Derbyshire in 2007, before moving to Edgbaston in 2008.
The 35-year-old, who played 20 one-dayers and two Tests for England, has scored over 16,000 runs and taken 629 wickets in all forms of the game.
"As a product of the club's academy, he's one of our own," said director of cricket Alec Stewart.
"I was disappointed when he left the club back in 2007, but it's great to see him come back to The Oval."
"It's going home for him," Warwickshire sport director Ashley Giles told BBC WM. "He's been a great pro for us and I'm sure there'll now be a bit more on it when he comes up against us next season in a Surrey shirt.
"But we need to be looking forward to the next generation. It provides a fantastic opportunity for our talented, young players to step up to the senior ranks and cement a place in the team."
