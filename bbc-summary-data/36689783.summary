The Russian world champion suffered a cut on his head and spent most of the bout on the back foot against Kazakhstan's Vassiliy Levit.
The judges scored all three rounds in his favour and the crowd continued to boo when he received his gold medal, while cheering Levit on the podium.
Uzbekistan's Rustam Tulaganov and Cuba's Erislandy Savon each won bronze.
Russia's boxing coach Eduard Kravtsov appeared to suggest Tishchenko should not have been given the decision in an interview with Kazakh website vesti.kz.
He said: "What can I say, we all saw who won the fight. I am always for fair judging and I want the work of coaches and boxers to be assessed fairly... such situations in the boxing ring do not present our sport in a good light.
"Unfortunately, this is not the only such fight in the Olympics, it has rather become a tendency. Our boxer came out to fight and wanted to win, and it is not his fault that his arm was raised. But, unfortunately for boxing fans, we got what we got."
Tishchenko said: "I feel sad that I've been booed. If I was given the victory, it means I deserved it.
"There can't be any complaints as to how I was judged, I'm excited about my win. But if Vassily Levit was treated unfairly, I feel sorry that this happened."
