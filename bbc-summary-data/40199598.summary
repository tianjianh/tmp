It runs until Sunday on the Crichton Campus with more than 70 different acts expected to perform.
Local headliners are Zoe Bestel and Claire Hastings while musicians from around the world are also involved in the festival.
Organisers said ticket sales already achieved would guarantee even bigger audiences than at last year's inaugural event.
Festival director Linda Butterworth said: "We are proud to show that Dumfries can represent Scotland with this top quality international event.
"News of our success has spread around the world.
"We put the success down to lots of factors - brilliant venue, great programme, amazing volunteers, meticulous organisation and carefully selected international, national and local acts of the highest quality."
She said they hoped they had created "something special" this year.
"You don't have to play the ukulele to enjoy the festival but if you do come be prepared to be won over by the fantastic atmosphere and leave clutching a brand-new ukulele and a list of new friends," she added.
