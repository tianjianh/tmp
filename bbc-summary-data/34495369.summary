Police have urged fans of the last flying Vulcan bomber aircraft to avoid watching it at an airport in Doncaster.

The plane, based at Robin Hood Airport, is due to be grounded this month after engineering backers, including Rolls-Royce, withdrew support.
The bomber made a flypast over northern areas of the UK on Saturday and will visit southern areas on Sunday.
South Yorkshire Police said the airport could not "accommodate a large influx of people hoping to see the Vulcan".
The force said: "We must warn you that the chances of seeing XH558 take-off and land are slim. There are no plans for any displays or repeated circuits over the airfield and the aircraft will come straight-in to land on her return.
"There is great risk of severe restrictions being imposed on flight operations if matters persist. We do need to minimise the risk of enforced flight cancellations on the grounds of public safety."
Local authorities and emergency services were starting to become "overwhelmed" by crowds who were flocking to the airport to see the famous Cold War nuclear warplane, police said.
Following the flypast tours, the XH558 bomber will make one final flight towards the end of October, details of which have yet to be confirmed.
