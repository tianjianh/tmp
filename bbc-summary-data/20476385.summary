Eurocom, in Mackworth, has designed a series of games including ones featuring James Bond, Harry Potter and the Olympic Games.
A spokesman said a number of projects had fallen through forcing it to make the redundancies.
The firm said it hoped to retain 50 employees and restructure the business.
A statement from the firm said it regretted having to lay off "very experienced, talented and highly skilled employees".
Founded in 1988, the company has developed dozens of computer and video games for most major platforms, including games based on Pirates of the Caribbean and Batman Begins.
The firm said it would now concentrate on developing games for mobile phones.
