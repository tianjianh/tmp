Surfers in California have broken the world record for the most people riding a wave on a surfboard at the same time.

Sixty-six people rode a 42ft (12.8m) surfboard for more than 10 seconds to break the record at Huntington Beach south of Los Angeles.
Around 5,000 people watched from the coast, the Orange County Register reported.
The record was previously held by a group of 47 surfers in the Australian state of Queensland.
