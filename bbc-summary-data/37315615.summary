County ins & outs - signings, departures and rumours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With the 2017 season here, stay up to date with the latest player signings, moves and speculation from all the counties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Counties are allowed to field two overseas players in Twenty20 games, with up to four registered for that competition, although only two can be registered at any one time, and registrations must be for a minimum of 10 days.
Only one overseas player is permitted in the County Championship and One-Day Cup competitions.
Kolpak contracts are signed by foreign players, using a European Court ruling to avoid counting against the quota of one overseas player per club.
Players who moved counties or retired during the 2016 season are included on the 2016 list. Have we missed anyone? Please let us know.
