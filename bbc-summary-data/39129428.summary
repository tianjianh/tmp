The Malaysian businessman says he would listen to offers for the Welsh club however, which he took over in 2010.
The report claimed the Bluebirds were among the teams he was going to sell.
"For the record, I have no plans to sell any of the clubs but if I am offered the right price, I will certainly consider," he said.
He continued, "I have always publicly said that except for my family, all my businesses are for sale at the right price. I do not fall in love with my businesses."
In addition to Cardiff City, Tan has interests in Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC, Bosnia's FC Sarajevo and Belgium's Kortrijk Voetbalt CVBA.
His tenure at Cardiff has been in turns controversial, successful and difficult.
The decision to get the club to play in red led to a fans revolt but he financed the club's drive to promotion in the Premier League in 2013 - however they were relegated after only one season in the top flight.
Tan's statement confirmed he has already turned down offers for Cardiff.
"I have been approached on numerous occasions by parties wanting to buy CCFC but the prices offered have not been right," he said.
"CCFC is turning around now in the good hands of Neil Warnock, who I think is a great manager, and I believe it stands a good chance of being promoted again to the Premier League in the next season.
"I am in no rush to sell CCFC, but if I am offered the right price by the right person who I believe will be able to take the club to a higher level, I will certainly consider selling.
"I have said before that if I leave CCFC, I want to leave it in good hands."
Tan added that he saw his involvement in Los Angeles FC as a long-term investment and that his interests in the Bosnian and Belgian clubs were "not substantial in comparison to CCFC and LAFC, and there is no reason to sell unless I am made an attractive offer."
