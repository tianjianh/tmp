Groove CairnGorm, is being held on 11 and 12 March in conjunction with the CairnGorm Mountain ski centre.
The music event will be based at Badaguish Outdoor Centre, near Aviemore, but will also see performances at the ski resort.
The Scottish Freestyle Championships are due to take place on the same weekend at CairnGorm Mountain.
Lined up for Groove CairnGorm are Niteworks, a band from Skye, and hip hop acts DJ Grandmaster Flash and Spring Break.
Also due to perform are The Cuban Brothers, Prides, DJ Monki and The Elephant Sessions.
The organisers of the new music festival hope to make it a regular event along the lines of continental Europe's snowsports music festivals Snowbombing and Snowboxx.
