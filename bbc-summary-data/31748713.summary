Some are ancient ones made out of stone, hundreds of years old, while others are famous for their huge size and design.
The oldest bridge is the Tarr Steps, over the River Barle in Exmoor National Park.
The most recently completed is the Peace Bridge, across the River Foyle in Northern Ireland, finished in 2011.
Royal Mail, who make the stamps, say The Menai Suspension Bridge, which links the island of Anglesey to the mainland in North Wales, is one of the most breathtaking ever built in Britain.
Andrew Hammond, head of stamps and collectibles at Royal Mail, said: "These new stamps celebrate 10 beautiful and ground-breaking landmarks that span centuries of our history".
