Dapo Kayode has joined fellow right-back Luke Hendrie and midfielder Charlee Adams in signing for Kilmarnock on a busy day for the Premiership club.

Kayode, 23, who had most recently been on loan to Bercini in the Romanian Liga II from Dinamo Bucuresti, has signed a one-year contract at Rugby Park.
Adams has signed on loan from Birmingham City until January.
Another 21-year-old and a third Englishman, Hendrie, is also on a six-month deal from Burnley.
International clearance is still being awaited for Kayode, who was born in London but also qualifies for Nigeria and was with Fulham as a youth.
But Adams and Hendrie could make their debuts against Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday.
Londoner Adams, who has had previous loan spells with Lincoln City, played twice for Birmingham under Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark's successor there, Gary Rowett, in the Championship last season and his availability alerted rival suitors.
Clark said: "I know Charlee very well. I gave him his debut with Birmingham City and he went on to play more games under Gary.
"I know they think very highly of him there and we fought off some late competition from League One down south last night to get him.
"We are very happy with that. He is a very dynamic, aggressive midfield player or centre-half and, when I got the nod yesterday that he was available, which I was quite surprised about, we moved very quickly on it and thankfully we did because we nearly got intercepted late last night by a couple of clubs."
Leeds-born Hendrie has played for England at youth level but has previously been called up to the Scotland Under-20 squad, qualifying thanks to his father - former Bradford City and Middlesbrough forward John.
Although Hendrie has played in midfield, Clark views the 21-year-old, who ended last season on loan to Jackie McNamara's York City and had a previous spell with Hartlepool United, as a specialist at right-back, where midfielder Greg Taylor has been operating so far this season.
"We felt that, with Greg Taylor being a young player, it would be hard enough coming into the first team without having to play a different position that he does normally," said Clark.
"He's done a sterling job, but we felt we needed a specialist in there.
"Luke comes from good stock. I know his father very well."
Hendrie, who made 18 appearances as York were relegated from League Two, is the second player to arrive from Burnley in a week following last week's loan signing of midfielder George Green.
Adams' addition would bring the total of summer arrivals to 14 at Rugby Park, eight of them loans, but Clark still has plans to bring in at least one more new face.
The latest signings were made possible by the sale of Josh Magennis to Charlton Athletic, but the Kilmarnock manager intends to send some of his own fringe players out on loan.
"We need to trim the size of the squad back, but sending them out on loan means these players will be playing competitive football and ready to come back in January," he added.
