[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's has recalled tubs of one of its best-selling products over concern they may contain small pieces of metal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some consumers who bought 500ml cartons of Cookie Dough are being told not to eat it and instead throw it away.
The company has issued an alert over four batches of the ice cream which it says could be affected.
Tubs affected have codes L62110L011, L62111L011, L62112L011 and L62113L011 printed on the bottom of the pots.
The company issued an "important safety notice" after internal quality assurance checks showed that a limited number of products could be affected.
Ben & Jerry's said: "The company has identified a specific production period during which Ben & Jerry's Cookie Dough 500ml may have been affected and, as safety remains a top priority, Ben & Jerry's is voluntarily recalling four batch codes of Cookie Dough 500ml from sale.
"As a precaution, everyone with a 500ml tub of Ben & Jerry's Cookie Dough in their freezers at home should check the batch number on the bottom of their tub to make sure it's not affected.
"And, if it matches the batch numbers listed above, they should not eat the product and, instead, we ask them to discard the product in the usual household bin."
It is unclear how many pots of ice cream could be affected.
The company said that consumers who have to throw away a tub of the ice cream can call 0800 146 252 to find out how to receive a voucher for a free pot.
