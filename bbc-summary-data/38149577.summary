UK tops list of most traffic-congested EU cities

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British roads are the most congested in Europe, a study of traffic in more than 100 EU cities suggests.

Data company Inrix monitored traffic on every road in 123 cities, including London, Cardiff, Paris and Hamburg.
It found more than 20,300 so-called "traffic hotspots" in UK cities - well over double the number in Germany and twice that of France.
The government recently pledged to spend an extra £1.3bn on targeting congestion on roads.
In Inrix's analysis, a road becomes a "traffic hotspot" once congestion forces drivers to drop their speed by 65% for at least two minutes.
Inrix collected traffic information from car sat-navs, mobile phones and road sensors throughout September 2016.
It covered individual cities with populations of 250,000 or more, rather than whole countries, but found pinch points in:
Researchers suggested that the worst stretch of road overall is Junction 29 of Hamburg's A7 motorway in Germany.
In the UK, drivers on the M25 or the A720 Edinburgh bypass are those most likely to reach gridlock.
"It's the unfortunate reality of a densely populated and global city," said Graham Cookson, Inrix's chief economist, author of the research.
"A quarter of a million of us drive on the M25 every day."

But there is hope for drivers dreading the commute from hell, Mr Cookson adds.
An extra £1.3bn will be spent on improving Britain's roads, the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced in the Autumn Statement on 23 November.
The roads investment will include £220m to tackle "pinch-points" on Highways England roads.
"Money is coming in for the first time in a while, hopefully this will be used to alleviate the worst areas," Mr Cookson said.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government was investing "record amounts" into improving roads.
"This investment is over and above the £23bn we are spending to get motorists to their destinations quickly, more easily and safely," he said.
He said the government schemes that have been announced were "focused on relieving congestion and providing important upgrades to ensure our roads are fit for the future".
