The ferry operator revealed the attacks took place on consecutive days at Wemyss Bay on the Clyde coast.
The bridge crews of the MV Argyle and MV Bute were subjected to an intense green light at about dusk on 31 March and 1 April.
CalMac said the attacks on the crews were "utterly irresponsible".
Both ferries had been operating the service from Rothesay.
The use of lasers on ferry crews would be an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and Police Scotland have confirmed officers have started an investigation.
CalMac service director Robbie Drummond said: "I cannot emphasise enough how dangerous such utterly irresponsible behaviour is.
"As well as posing an issue of immediate harm to our crews, these actions are illegal and an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act. They also have the potential to jeopardise the safety of passengers on board and, ultimately, the vessels.
"That may be blunt, but it is absolutely a fact and we condemn the actions of this reckless person or persons in the strongest terms."
A spokeswoman for Police Scotland added: "We can confirm that Police Scotland is investigating these incidents, which are utterly reckless. Thankfully, no-one was injured during these incidents.
"Those who carry out this type of act should be aware of the danger that they pose."
