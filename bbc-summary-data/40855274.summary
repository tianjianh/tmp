James Carson claimed four goals, with James Kyriakides (2), Owain Dolan-Gray, Rupert Shipperley and Luke Hawker also scoring.
On Sunday, Wales opened their account with a 2-1 win against Czech Republic and next face Russia on Wednesday looking to seal a semi-final spot.
The winners of the event will be promoted to Championship I.
Wales captain Hawker was delighted with the result: "We couldn't be happier, the mood within the camp is really good as you'd expect coming off the back of a 9-0 performance.
"It's something we've been working towards for the last couple of years really... it's great sat here having played two and won two."
The women's team are also in EuroHockey competition and began on Sunday with a 6-1 win over Austria in their B Division tournament in Cardiff.
