Sofiane Feghouli: West Ham midfielder's red card rescinded

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham's Sofiane Feghouli has had the red card shown to him during Monday's defeat by Manchester United rescinded by the Football Association.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder was sent off by referee Mike Dean for a challenge on Red Devils defender Phil Jones 15 minutes into a match the Hammers lost 2-0.
West Ham boss Slaven Bilic said Jones "made a meal" of the tackle from the Algeria international.
He will now be available for Friday's FA Cup tie against Manchester City.
