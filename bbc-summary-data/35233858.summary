The 20-year-old spent the first half of the season at Northampton, where he played against the U's in one of his 10 League Two appearances.
His arrival coincided with the departure of loan pair Mickey Demetriou and Terry Kennedy, who have returned to Shrewsbury and Sheffield United.
"Darnell has proven he can play at this level," said U's boss Shaun Derry.
Meanwhile, striker Rory Gaffney is back with Cambridge following a loan spell at Bristol Rovers.
