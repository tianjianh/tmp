Lemmy Milne, Alexander Middleton and Grant Fender admitted facing off with Aberdeen fans before the Dundee United against Aberdeen match on 13 December.
Dundee Sheriff Court was told a "ruckus" had broken out at the Snug Bar, and police dogs were deployed.
Milne, 17, Middleton, 41, and Fender, 29, will be sentenced later this month.
Fiscal depute Alex Piper told the court that a "large group" of Aberdeen fans had arrived at the Snug, where Dundee United supporters were drinking, prior to the match at nearby Tannadice Stadium.
She said: "A ruckus happened inside where there was a confrontation that spilled out into the street.
"Police arrived almost immediately. There were people lunging at each other, threats of violence and aggressive behaviour on both sides in the street.
"Police kept them apart but a number of civilians were trapped. Police dogs had to be brought in to keep the peace."
The three men, all of Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges under the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act of "engaging in behaviour that is likely or would be likely to incite public disorder by forming part of a disorderly crowd and repeatedly attempting to engage in violence with rival fans".
Sheriff George Way deferred sentence until later in the month for background reports.
