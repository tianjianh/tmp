Tax breaks bring 'new era' for the UK gaming industry

Video game makers in the UK are predicting a "new era" for the industry, as tax breaks come into effect.

The scheme, given the go-ahead by the European Commission, allows companies to claim back up to 25% of a game's production costs.
Games will have to meet certain criteria in a new cultural test to qualify, which some fear may harm creativity.
Reaction has been largely positive though, with industry body Tiga predicting a Â£188m boost over five years.
"I think it's the start of a fantastic new era for game development in the UK," she said.
"People, we hope, will see this as an incentive to come and make games and set up shop in the UK.
"Lots of people think it's too good to be true, that's because it is a world-class scheme.
"This scheme is based on cultural grounds which is why we have the cultural test."
"It means we're on an equal footing with TV and movies where we get tax breaks for doing things which are culturally relevant or made in the UK," he said.
"It means we can make games and it doesn't cost us quite as much money. I employ myself and make the entire game myself.
"Occasionally you get big massive breakout hits and that's fantastic for the people involved but there are a lot of us who are just literally living hand to mouth and surviving."
"It's a step forward," he said. "It's a start for us on a road that can lead to greater investment in the industry.
"It takes risk out of the production process because it puts money back into the business that wasn't there before.
"It means you can take one or two choices that you may not have had the nerve to take before.
"It gives you the ability to recruit with a good deal more confidence than you could before."
"My only worry is that it constrains the creative process for people and that people actively change their games to fit that criteria," he said.
"I don't think it's going to massively affect games but for me the creative process is something which should be very pure.
"My worry is that by having that in the back of your mind it may act as a slight barrier.
"But I hope it acts as a catalyst for the games industry finding a sense of identity."
