[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pianist James Rhodes wins child abuse memoir case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A concert pianist has won a legal battle to publish a book giving details of sexual abuse he experienced as a child.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Rhodes persuaded Supreme Court justices to lift an injunction that had barred publication.
The Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction in October, blocking publication of parts of the book.
This was after Mr Rhodes's ex-wife raised fears it would cause their 12-year-old son "serious harm".
Justices had ruled that Mr Rhodes could not be identified, either in media reports or on social media.
Following the injunction, Mr Rhodes asked the Supreme Court for a ruling.
Five Supreme Court justices have now ruled in his favour on Wednesday after examining the case at a January hearing.
Some reporting restrictions have subsequently been lifted.
