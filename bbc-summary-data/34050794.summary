Chris May, 28, was last seen at his home in Kelvedon, Essex, on 25 May.
His Volkswagen Golf was found abandoned in the village of Fairstead, according to Essex Police.
Police received a letter in June, sent in the post, saying Mr May was dead. Charity Missing People is now advertising Mr May's case nationally.
Det Ch Insp Marina Ericson said: "I am really grateful for all the assistance Missing People have given to us and this national advertising will mean we can reach a wider audience with the appeal for information about Chris's whereabouts.
"Since Chris went missing in May, I have been appealing for anyone with information to come forward.
"There will be someone out there who knows something but, for whatever reason, has not come forward so far.
"I made an appeal in June for the author of a letter, delivered by Royal Mail to Witham police station on 1 June, to contact me.
"To date that person has not made contact. I would like to appeal to them to make contact with me directly."
