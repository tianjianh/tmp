The 20-year-old from Kettering shot a five under par 67 on Thursday to join So Yeon Ryu in second, with China's Shanshan Feng leading on six under.
Hull is still seeking her first LPGA Tour title, but finished second in the ANA Inspiration in April.
"I felt like I've had a good year. I just want to get a win in," Hull told the LPGA Tour's official website.
Hull enjoyed a run of four straight birdies from the sixth hole.
"I'm happy with it," she added. "Obviously left a few out there. I think I can go get them tomorrow."
Scotland's Catriona Matthew is a further four shots back after an opening 71.
