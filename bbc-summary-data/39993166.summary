Jack Cannon's strike midway through the first half put Saints ahead.
Joe Kilshaw tapped in after Michael Weir beat the offside trap, before Weir himself sealed the win late on.
Rovers were playing in their first Upton after clinching their first-ever Priaulx title on the final day.
St Paul's joint-manager Jordan Docherty told BBC Radio Jersey:
"It probably wasn't our greatest performance, but it was a hot day against tough opponents so I'm just glad to come out with the win, to be honest.
"It's always the biggest one to win, after you've won the league it's the one you next look forward to.
"To go through the whole [league] season unbeaten was a great achievement but to win this is the icing on the cake."
Rovers coach Jez Robin told BBC Radio Guernsey:
"We knew it was going to be tough on this surface where the ball moves quickly and they like to keep possession.
"We had to change things when we were chasing the game a bit later on and conceded the two goals but that was always going to be the risk.
"You're never going to be pleased when you lose the game but it's the next step in our progression and hopefully we can try again and be here next season with a bit of luck."
