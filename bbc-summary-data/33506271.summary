Bangor cancer drug patient's England move 'worked'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Gwynedd cancer patient who moved to England to get the treatment he could not receive under the Welsh NHS says his decision could mean he will soon be in remission.

Irfon Williams, 45, from Bangor, has bowel cancer which spread to his liver.
He opted to live with relatives in north west England after a bid to get treatment funded in Wales using the drug Cetuximab was rejected.
The tumours been have shrunk and will be removed in September.
He no longer has symptoms from them.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said on Monday he would meet Mr Williams to "hear what he has to say to me".
Mr Williams told BBC Wales: "I've demonstrated that this has worked for me."
"I'm having surgery in September which could lead to remission.
"I'm not out of the water yet - there's still a long way to go - but I'm in a much better position now than I would've been had I not received this treatment."
In 2014, Mr Williams was told he probably only had two-and-a-half years to live but this appears to have changed following the treatment at Manchester's The Christie, one of Europe's leading cancer hospitals.
It was recommended by three clinical experts treating him, and is paid for through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which does not exist in Wales.
It led to Mr Williams launching his own campaign to highlight the issue in Wales, with questions put to Carwyn Jones in the Senedd earlier this year.
The Welsh government has ruled out its own Cancer Drugs Fund saying the one in England has spent millions of pounds on non-approved drugs that deliver little or no benefit for patients while its own system ensures all patients get access to proven and effective treatments.
Speaking at his monthly news conference on Monday, the first minister said  he would meet Mr Williams, adding: "I want to hear what he has to say to me.
"He and his wife have been perfectly reasonable in terms of what they've been saying. I want to listen first of all and I'm not going to go into the meeting with any pre-conceived ideas of what the outcome will be."
Mr Jones added: "Most of the drugs that are funded by the Cancer Drugs Fund in England tend to be drugs that extend people's lives sometimes. We know they are not in the main life-saving drugs.
"Some people have a very good outcome or very good reaction and from what Mr Williams has been saying, he's doing well and good luck to him."
