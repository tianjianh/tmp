[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool failed to give Steven Gerrard a victorious farewell to Anfield as Crystal Palace emerged worthy winners on an emotion-charged occasion.

Gerrard was making his final appearance at Anfield before making his move to Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy - and Liverpool supporters gathered at the stadium hours before kick-off to pay tribute to their iconic captain.
Palace, however, were in no mood to indulge the celebrations and after Adam Lallana put Liverpool ahead, Jason Puncheon equalised on the stroke of half-time before substitutes Wilfried Zaha and Glenn Murray wrapped up the win.
The game itself was almost reduced to a footnote as far as Liverpool were concerned - but in a strangely low-key 90 minutes, this performance graphically illustrated the work that needs to be done by manager Brendan Rodgers once Gerrard has departed after next weekend's final game of the season at Stoke City.
After the formalities of the final whistle were completed, Gerrard went down the tunnel before re-emerging to a prolonged, deserved ovation where he was greeted by former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier, the man who made him Liverpool captain, before receiving a presentation from the club.
Gerrard then addressed Liverpool's fans before joining his team-mates on a lap of honour and then leaving the Anfield turf for the final time after a 17-year career that has brought the Champions League victory against AC Milan that he inspired in Istanbul in 2005, as well as the Uefa Cup, two FA Cups and three League Cup triumphs.

The Premier League title may have eluded him but as he walked around Anfield it was only the good times Liverpool fans remembered - and he has given them plenty of those with his 185 goals stretched out across a glittering career.
Now Rodgers faces the Herculean task of replacing the 34-year-old, who has been a symbol of the club since he made his debut in 1998.
The game itself almost assumed the status of a sideshow as the shadow of Gerrard's farewell understandably loomed over the entire occasion.
Anfield's DJ set the tone with a pre-match playlist that was a musical tribute to Gerrard, from David Bowie's "Heroes" to the REM tune "The End Of The World As We Know It".
And The Kop was decorated with banners recalling Gerrard's greatest moments including one reading "The Best There Is. The Best There Was And The Best There Will Ever Be".
Gerrard came out to warm up ahead of his team-mates, who allowed him to take the acclaim of The Kop - and in the moments before kick-off Anfield was united in tribute to the man many regard as Liverpool's finest.
He emerged with his daughters Lourdes, Lexie and Lilly-Ella through a guard of honour formed by both sides as thunderous roars swept around Anfield.
The kick-off actually dampened the atmosphere, Liverpool taking an undeserved lead after 26 minutes when Lallana was the beneficiary of Martin Kelly's poor ball, running on and beating Wayne Hennessey with an accomplished finish.
Palace, however, continued to be the better side and were full value for the equaliser that came two minutes before half-time, Puncheon sending a 20-yard free-kick beyond Simon Mignolet after Emre Can fouled the dangerous Yannick Bolasie.

Pardew decided to introduce Zaha to add to Palace's attacking threat - and it was a move that paid dividends as he slid in Bolasie's cross with his first touch after just 23 seconds on the pitch.
As Liverpool's defence rocked, the outstanding Bolasie almost extended their advantage when he cut inside the struggling Martin Skrtel, but struck his shot against the bar.
There was to be no final rescue act from Gerrard and substitute Murray secured Palace's win by putting in the rebound from his own penalty, which was initially saved by Mignolet.
The spot kick was awarded after Lucas fouled Zaha - although it looked as though the first contact was outside the box.
It was then time for Gerrard to take his leave - and for Liverpool to ponder how they can possibly fill the gap he leaves behind.
