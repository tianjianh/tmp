A new roof at Manchester's Victoria Station that had a panel cave in, injuring two people, is being inspected as an investigation gets under way.

The panel tore above Platforms 1 and 2 on Tuesday afternoon amid heavy rain.
Witnesses said "gallons of water" fell on people standing on a platform. Two people suffered minor head injuries.
The station remains open with services running normally and a full roof inspection is under way, Northern Rail said on Wednesday.
Contractors for Northern Rail have secured the roof panels that were damaged but the area below remains cordoned off.
The main concourse, which was sealed off over fears other parts of the roof could collapse, has now reopened a spokesperson for Northern said.
The station underwent a Â£44m upgrade last year, which included the new roof.
