[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Gladwin's first-half hat-trick helped Swindon beat Rochdale and secure at least a play-off spot in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gladwin's left-footed strike opened the scoring, before Michael Smith fired home to double the Robins' advantage.
Gladwin turned in Jonathan Obika's flick on, and then powered in his third from the penalty spot shortly after.
Ian Henderson's penalty reduced the deficit after Andy Cannon was fouled, but Nathan Thompson's late own-goal was no more than a consolation for Dale.
Rochdale are now seven points behind Chesterfield in the final play-off spot, with only four games left to play.
Gladwin's hat-trick was completed after he fired home from the penalty spot in emphatic fashion after he was brought down by Rhys Bennett inside the box.
Sam Ricketts's foul on Cannon looked to have given Rochdale a route back into the game when the subsequent penalty was converted by Henderson, but Swindon's defence held firm after the break until Thompson turned into his own net deep into stoppage time.
