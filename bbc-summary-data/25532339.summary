Bury 1-1 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second-half Josh Ruffels header against a resurgent Bury kept promotion-chasing Oxford's unbeaten league run this season going.

Craig Jones pounced on Ryan Clarke's fumble after the break to give Bury the lead.
Ruffels levelled with his first U's goal less than two minutes later, nodding home a Danny Rose corner.
Clarke protected the point, denying both Daniel Nardiello and Andrew Tutte.
Seven minutes of stoppage time was added at the end of the game after Shakers goalkeeper Brian Jensen and U's striker David Connolly received treatment after clashing heads.
Oxford remain unbeaten in three games under caretaker manager Mickey Lewis following Chris Wilder's exit last week.
