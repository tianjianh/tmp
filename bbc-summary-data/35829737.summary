Jason Strange's side face Italy in their final game of the Six Nations in Colwyn Bay on Friday on the back of four successive wins.
Wales Under-20s have never previously won the Six Nations and Gatland has been impressed with the youngsters.
"It's absolutely brilliant for the Under-20s," Gatland said
Wing Joe Thomas is the only change to the team that won 42-16 in England last Friday, replacing the injured George Gasson.
Wales kicked off the campaign with a 34-25 win in over Ireland before back-to-back home wins over Scotland and France at Eirias Park.
"Their performance against England was outstanding," Gatland added.
"We watched the game and in the first five to 10 minutes you could see the intent from the team and what it meant.
"They had a couple of tough games against Scotland and France, where they had to dig really deep after a good start against Ireland.
"Well done to them and hopefully they can finish off with a good performance on Friday night against Italy."
