Tributes to director Tony Scott

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The film world has been paying tribute to British director Tony Scott, whose most famous movies included Top Gun, True Romance and Enemy of the State.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He died on Sunday aged 68, after jumping from a bridge in Los Angeles, authorities have said.
The brother of Alien director Ridley, he shot to fame in the 1980s with a string of action films.
Those who worked with him, knew him or just enjoyed his films have been remembering him as "a master of his craft".
On Twitter: No more Tony Scott movies. Tragic day.
He was a terrific action director, Top Gun has become a classic. It's a real shock I think for everyone in the film industry and the outpouring of goodwill shows how much he was respected and what a great contribution he made to cinema.
He wasn't someone that thought about awards so much as making great movies. There's an art in making a great commercial film and Tony really understood that art. Top Gun is a film that inspired many, many people in terms of its editing, its cinematography, in terms of its pace. Making an action picture isn't quite as easy as people might think it is and he was really at the top of his game, a master of his craft.
He's always been known as a great commercials director as well as a great filmmaker but recently television has been something that inspired him. He's reached out to a lot of people. You see his name as someone who gets special thanks on films like Donnie Darko, he was a great inspiration for young filmmakers. I think it's a very, very sad day.
Working with Tony Scott was like a glorious road trip to Vegas on desert back roads, a wild man behind the wheel, grinning. I felt safe. Tony Scott was the best mentor - when he saw something punk rock that he could slip through the system ... he pounced.
On Twitter: Just heard about Tony Scott news. Horrible... Tony was a truly lovely man who took me under his wing & ignited my passion to make films.
Awww Tony. Wish you had felt there was a way to keep going. What a sad waste. My thoughts go out to his wife and beautiful children.
On Twitter: Tony Scott. Damn. Great knowing you, buddy. Thanks for the inspiration, advice, encouragement, and the decades of great entertainment.
On his blog: Tony Scott was one of the, if not the, warmest and most generous directors for whom I've ever worked. I was constantly astounded by his ability to balance the massive weight of his movies with unsparing respect and love for his actors and crew all the way down the line. That he managed to juggle such in the context of his considerably large and "mainstream" vehicles was always a source of wonder for me and inspiration to aspire to such gentlemanly conduct.
I hope to uncover some of the several little notes he'd leave me (a tradition, signing off with a cartoon self-portrait with cigar) among my archives to upload at some point.
I'll miss you man,  Ad.
We are deeply saddened to learn of the tragic news that Tony Scott has died. He was not only an incredibly gifted filmmaker and ambassador for the UK film industry, he was a significant part of the history of Shepperton Studios.
He directed some of the most successful films of all times and at Shepperton these included The Hunger (1981), Spy Game (2001) and Tony most recently produced Prometheus (2012) directed by his brother Ridley. He will be sadly missed and our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time.
He was a true pioneer. A great film-maker and a wonderful human being. He will be sorely missed by people all over the world.
History will probably always link him with his brother which considering their lifelong partnership is right ... but Tony had his own style and will stand tall in the history of British film-makers.
On Twitter: My heart stopped when I heard of the tragic death of 1 of [our] most inspiring directors, Tony Scott. Rest In Peace Tony. [You] will be missed so.
Tomorrow will be TonyScott memorial marathon day. Gonna watch Top Gun, Unstoppable, Man On Fire, & the cult classic The Hunger. #Verysadfan
I am so sad. A wonderful creative light went out today.

On Twitter: I just woke up to hear about Tony Scott. Can't believe it. As I hope was evident in my work, I was big fan of his. Rest In Peace, sir.
'The Last Boy Scout', 'True Romance', 'Crimson Tide', 'Man On Fire' and yes, 'Domino' too. Tony Scott was a rambunctious cinematic spirit.
I shall miss you Mr Scott.
When we edited 'Hot Fuzz' we used the 'Man On Fire' soundtrack as a temp score. So I know that film and Tony's work on it off by heart.
It's bittersweet to see the overwhelming praise for Tony Scott's work today. It's very much deserved, but sad he didn't hear it for himself.
On Twitter: Shocking and devastating news. He was the best and will be greatly missed.
Love ya Tony, always have, always will.

On Twitter: RIP Tony. You were the kindest film director I ever worked for. You will be missed
I feel blessed to have known and worked with Tony.
He was way beyond a mentor to me.
He was by far the most gracious, talented and hard-working man I have ever met.
He was a kind leader.  A powerful force with the softest heart.  A true magician.
On Twitter: So sad to hear about Tony Scott. A master of grand action, nail biting pace and atmosphere. A real loss to film making.
On Twitter: True Romance. The scene with Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper in a Detroit railyard is a classic. RIP Tony Scott.
True Romance (written by Tarantino) did not receive the recognition it so rightly deserved (one of the decade's best films).
On Twitter: Awful news about Tony Scott. rest in peace.
