Kaitlyn Regehr, 30, was travelling home on the 207 bus towards Acton on 6 October when a man grabbed her.
Ms Regehr wrote on Instagram: "Last week I made a post in order to find a stranger who stood up for me on a bus.
"Last night, I got to meet and thank this Good Samaritan and all-round awesome dude."
On 9 October, she took to social media to try to find the stranger who - when she was "grabbed" by a man - insisted it was "not acceptable".
She wrote: "You said, 'She could be your sister. She is someone's sister', and in doing so you made me a person. You made us a community."
In her latest post, she said: "The experience surrounding last week's post has been a surprising and powerful one.
"I am grateful to all who helped make this meeting happen; as well as to the Metropolitan Police, who have been really supportive. Most of all, I am grateful to the many who shared their own stories."
