[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol teacher banned after kissing pupil

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher has been banned from teaching after sending sexually motivated texts and social media messages to female pupils.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A professional conduct panel found Robert Chandler, 35, kissed one pupil and communicated inappropriately with three other pupils and ex-pupils.
The drama teacher began teaching at Fairfield High School, Bristol in 2003.
The report found some of the the Facebook, MSN and text communications were sexually motivated.
The National College for Teaching and Leadership report also found he carried on communicating with pupils even after the head teacher had told him to stop.
The Secretary of State for Education has issued a prohibition order, meaning Mr Chandler is banned from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England indefinitely.
The report said his behaviour amounted to "unacceptable professional conduct and conduct that may bring the [teaching] profession into disrepute".
