What should Labourâ€™s #pinkbus look like?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Is it a van? A bus? Its bright colour has also been preoccupying Twitter.

Many have criticised the vehicle the Labour party has wheeled out to attract female voters (Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman said she "signed-off" on the "eye-catching" colour scheme for the minibus which will tour the UK, driven by one male and two female drivers.)  We asked women who drive vans what they thought and what they would recommend.
"Not a fan of branding things with pink.
"It's a bit patronising and seems like a bit of a cop out. They obviously haven't spent much time on it.
"Women in the UK are pretty bold. Something decorative and detailed would work. You could go floral with it. Make it look art deco or art nouveau. But they do want it to look like Labour. The minute you start going more refined you're a bit more middle class and Conservative.
"Women want to see bold, colourful, bright patterns. Something that shows the diversity of women in this country.
"We push pink on our kids too much."
"I support the idea of them going out and trying to get women voters, that's important.
"Pink is a bit obvious. But at the same time you can take it a bit too seriously. It is a gimmick!
"Quite a lot of the imagery we've used on our vans is Land Girls imagery. Strong female iconography like Rosie the Riveter.
I think they should use big, bold colours. Something that shows strength. I might have gone burgundy so it looked at bit like the Labour red colour.
"I can see what they're trying to do, but I don't know how a group around table managed to end up at pink.
"We're trying to get away from gender stereotyping - that idea that girls are pretty in pink whilst boys are strong in blue.
"White is synonymous with men and bad driving. So they would definitely need a vibrant colours.
"Why have they got a man driving this bus? If they really want to get women's votes why not have a woman driving it?
"Why don't they drive a blue van around? That might get some men to vote as well. Although I'm sure some would find that offensive."
