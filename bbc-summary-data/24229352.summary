Peckham Vision, which represents businesses, churches and community groups, said local people are being forced out due to rising costs.
Co-ordinator Eileen Conn, who's lived in the area for 40 years, said the pace of change could have a negative effect: "If there is suddenly a rush of money from elsewhere that's got nothing to do with local developments.. that's not going to be good for Peckham," she said.
Savills UK has published a map showing the gentrification of London between 2001 and 2011 and it profiles areas which have changed due to a number of factors, including an ever-expanding population.
BBC London's Warren Nettleford spoke to Professor Chris Hamnett, from Kings College London, Luke Wooster, from Wooster & Stock Estate Agents, and Eileen Conn, from Peckham Vision.
