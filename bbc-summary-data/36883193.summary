In his first news conference since taking charge of the national side, Allardyce said "man management" was his "biggest asset".
Allardyce, who helped save Sunderland from Premier League relegation last season, succeeds Roy Hodgson after a disappointing Euro 2016 campaign.
Sammy Lee, Allardyce's assistant at Bolton, joins the England staff.
"This will be the greatest challenge for me in my long career and hopefully I will be as successful as I have in the rest of my career," Allardyce said.
Allardyce also said he would not make a decision on Wayne Rooney's captaincy until he has met the players and staff.
The former Newcastle, Blackburn and West Ham boss also spoke about:
"I have managed some world class players. Fernando Hierro, Youri Djorkaeff, Jay Jay Okocha, Gary Speed, Nicolas Anelka and Michael Owen. I have managed some talented players; the good thing about that is they make your life easier, they know what you want.
"Working with the England elite players will be very exciting for me because they will take on board ideas very quickly.
"In terms of winning no trophies or cups, unfortunately, as an English manager I never got to go right to the top of the Premier League.
"I saved clubs and never got relegated, and they are not the same as winning the FA Cup or League Cup, but they are big achievements."

"No midseason break. I have been an advocate of that for 10 years or more. The demand on players is enormous.
"The Premier League is the best league in world so demand has to be on the players. It would help the Premier League and us at international level if we could try and achieve it.
"In my time when we finish at Christmas, in January and February it is always the most difficult time to get players through."
"I think choosing styles of systems depends on the players available and who we are playing. My coaching technique is to try to give players the opportunity to win football matches, home or away, and make them aware of the opposition.
"I think the bonding of the team is exceptionally important and trying to create that team spirit and have some fun. I have enjoyed my life in the game, this job is the pinnacle and I want to enjoy this the most.
"My style of play has always been a tag for me that I can't shake off but I played with Jermain Defoe down the middle on his own last year so it cannot be really associated with me after that.
"Working on people's strengths is the main factor. People said Defoe cannot play up front on his own but that is what he did all last season and scored 18 goals."

"It is not potential anymore, it has to be reality and they have to stand up and be counted. The young players have a lot of experience now and some has been bitter. They don't want to feel like that again.
"Potential is not a word I want to use, you want the quality player to produce his best performances immediately. This squad of players is very experienced and going forward hopefully will produce better."
