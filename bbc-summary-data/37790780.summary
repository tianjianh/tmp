Michael Dale Vance Jr has been wanted since Sunday in connection to the murders and a string of shootings.
Police said they believe Mr Vance filmed two Facebook Live videos during his run from authorities.
Mr Vance appeared to be seeking revenge for child sexual abuse allegations against him, police added.
The 38-year-old from has been charged with sexual abuse of a 15-year-old girl in Lincoln County, court records showed.
"Obviously, as long as he isn't apprehended, we're extremely concerned about those he may have indicated that he wishes harm to," Oklahoma County Sheriff John Whetsel told The Oklahoman newspaper. "Most of those are outside Oklahoma City."
Authorities believe Mr Vance has a hit list with as many as eight more people on it.
Police said he was last seen early on Monday about 30 miles from the Texas border in western Oklahoma.
The violent rampage began when two officers were shot and wounded while responding to a call in Wellston, about 35 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. One person was arrested while Mr Vance fled in a patrol car.
He is also suspected of shooting a woman and stealing her vehicle before driving to his aunt and uncle's home, where police say he murdered them.
Mr Vance allegedly filmed two Facebook Live videos during his flee from the scene.
In one of the videos, he turned the camera to a long gun placed in the passenger seat and said: "If you want to know what's up next, stay tuned to your local news."
Mr Vance's uncle, 55-year-old Ronald Everett Wilson, was shot and had stab wounds "consistent with an attempt to sever his head", Oklahoma County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Belanger wrote in an arrest affidavit.
His wife, Valerie Kay Wilkson, 54, had similar neck wounds.
Authorities found a large, bloodied knife, a blood-stained shirt and two shell casings appearing to be from an AK-47-style assault rifle.
