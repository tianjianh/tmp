Sutton Bank, which looks out over the Vale of Mowbray, topped the poll carried out by the Dalesman magazine.
More than 1,100 votes were cast by readers and the results endorsed by regional celebrities, Michael Parkinson, Alan Titchmarsh and Dame Judi Dench.
West and East Yorkshire also feature in the top 50 scenic landmarks list.
Magazine editor Adrian Braddy said: "When I first launched the hunt for Yorkshire's best view, the most common remark I heard was 'how could I possibly choose just one?'
"It is a fair point, but fortunately hundreds of people were able to pin down their favourite.
"The views chosen as the fifty best demonstrate the extraordinary diversity of landscapes - both natural and man-made - that make up England's biggest county."
Some of North Yorkshire's most famous sights made the top ten, including the Ribblehead Viaduct, Whitby Abbey and Buttertub's Pass.
In West Yorkshire, the view from Ilkley Moor, Howarth High Street, the view towards Castle Hill and the Cow and Calf Rocks all featured.
Of the latter, Mr Parkinson said: "I can think of no more beautiful sight in the world, never mind Yorkshire."
Flamborough Head and Bempton Cliffs, both in East Yorkshire, ranked 21 and 47 respectively.
