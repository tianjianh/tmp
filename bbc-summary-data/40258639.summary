The mayor of Bristol has vowed to improve traffic flow in the city with a new congestion task group.

Bus company directors, cycling representatives and business leaders are among those taking part.
The group will create a "city centre movement strategy" and set new targets on predicted journey times.
"Nothing is off the table" said mayor Marvin Rees. "A quick fix is not the answer...I want a transport solution and so do the people of Bristol."
The first meeting of the task group will take place on Tuesday.
Traffic jams have long been a problem in Bristol and various schemes have tried to fix the problem over the years.
In 2003, a planned tram system was shelved amid disagreements between two councils, Bristol and South Gloucestershire.
A railway loop connecting Filton with Avonmouth was also dropped in 2015 in favour of a railway spur line instead.
Work is continuing on a bus rapid transport system, called Metrobus, with services starting in Autumn 2017.
The next major roadwork scheme - to remove the gyratory system at Temple Gate, next to Temple Meads railway station - begins shortly.
On BBC Points West's Facebook page, a variety of suggestions to improve traffic flow have been put forward.
Liz Read suggested a congestion charge similar to London, while Dan White wrote "build a time machine, go back to 2001 and make sure that the trams were built."
