The Pilgrims, second in League Two, will return to England on Thursday.
"We're going there to train for three days in preparation for the remaining games of the season," Argyle manager Derek Adams told BBC Radio Devon.
"I've done it before as a manager. It's about getting us focused with 18 games to go, and allowing us to train in hot weather and a very good area."
Adams added to his squad during the January transfer window, and believes the trip will help integrate his new players.
Jakub Sokolik, Nathan Blissett, Antoni Sarcevic, Ryan Taylor and Matthew Kennedy were brought in as Argyle look to strengthen their promotion challenge.
"It's been in the planning for a while and we've been able to factor it in," said Adams.
"We've got new players in and it's about trying to get them to know what the other players are about, and also to get my ideas across to them."
Sarcevic, signed from Shrewsbury during the final days of the window, added: "It's nice to get away from everything and get a good few days in Spain. But it will be hard work."
