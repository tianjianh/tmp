Other initiatives and travel help have also been set up as students start the new college year.
Last September, there were a number of sex attacks which prompted police and students' leaders to take action.
Cardiff University said it had been working with its Students' Union and South Wales Police to improve safety.
Cardiff Bus has said it is running some additional services through the night to get students back to their accommodation.
Cardiff council said 10 taxi drivers have been suspended since last September for refusing short fare journeys, prompting would-be customers to make alternative plans.
It is advising people to report drivers if they are refused a fare.
Prof Amanda Coffey, Cardiff University's pro vice-chancellor for student experience and academic standards, said: "Cardiff University and the Students' Union have taken a number of steps to help to create a safer environment for our students, including our Safe Taxi Scheme and the Student Safety Bus driven by police student volunteers."
She said other safety initiatives will see people help "students who are vulnerable as a result of drinking too much" to prevent them from "potentially becoming victims of crime".
The Drinkaware Crew has been launched by South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael, alcohol education charity Drinkaware along with student unions' across south Wales.
NUS Wales told BBC Wales last week that it was planning to hold "bystander workshops" in every student union in Wales as part of the initiative to cut down on sexual harassment.
Mr Michael said: "This new scheme, borne out of the South Wales Violence Reduction Initiative, brings together organisations to address the safety of our student population and enable people to enjoy a night out without being at risk of harm."
Prof Coffey said volunteers working on the Student Safety Walk Scheme will be around the Students' Union to offer a "walking service" to students on selected evenings, provide security and other travel.
