[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt Tubbs had a couple of half chances for the hosts in a quiet first period at Silverlake Stadium.
The game sprung to life after the break, with Eastleigh hitting a post within a minute of the restart through James Constable.
Gus Mafuta then gave Gateshead the lead in the 57th minute with his first goal of the season from the edge of the box.
The Heed's lead lasted for just two minutes, though, as Ayo Obileye scored from close range for Eastleigh.
Both sides went in search of a winner late on but it was in vain as Gateshead extended their unbeaten league run to 10 games.
