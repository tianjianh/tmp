The 2014 Commonwealth champion won bronze at the Mexico World Masters on Sunday to seal her place in Rio this summer.
Powell, 25, has collected more ranking points than British rival Gemma Gibbons and is set to be confirmed as Team GB's -78kg choice.
"I'm in the best place that I've ever been," Powell told BBC Wales Sport.
"I'm the strongest, the fittest and my judo's in the best place."
Powell is set to finish eighth in the world, with Gibbons 12th and both will meet the qualifying requirement of being ranked in the top 14 in the world.
But each nation can only select one judoka for each weight category for this summer's Games in Brazil.
"I don't think it's quite sunk in yet," Powell added.
"The official selections haven't happened yet so I need to wait to officially know but I've met all the criteria."
Powell beat China's Zhehui Zhang in a -78kg bronze medal contest at the Mexico World Masters in Guadalajara.
She is set to become the first Welsh woman to compete in judo at the Olympics and is looking forward to the experience.
"Everyone at the Games is going to be a challenge," Powell said.
"I'm really confident that If I bring my A game against any one of them, I'll be able to beat them on the day.
"I'm going to really concentrate on everybody now over the next 10 weeks and me and my coach will work on getting strategies together to beat them all in Rio."
