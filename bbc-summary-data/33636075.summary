[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer has successfully proposed to his girlfriend using weedkiller to spell out a message in crops.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rick Davies, 32, told the Milton Keynes Citizen he sprayed pesticide from the back of a quad bike he drove through his wheat field at Newton Lodge farm in north Buckinghamshire to spell out the message "Di will you marry me?"
The gesture destroyed about an acre of wheat worth approximately Â£600.
His fiancÃ©e Diana Cull, who said yes, said she was "totally overwhelmed".
Mr Davies, showed Ms Cull, 33, the message by flying her over the 20-acre field in a flight he won at a charity auction for Â£50.
He said he was "definitely pleased" with the result.
"All I wanted was a yes," he said.
Mr Davies farms the land in partnership with his father, who was on holiday at the time and knew nothing of his plans. He was said to be "delighted" although "would have been a bit annoyed if she had said no".
Ms Cull, from Northampton, said she was "absolutely blown away".
"I was totally overwhelmed, I started crying, it was like something you see in films," she said.
"We kept circling over it to look again and he leaned over to me and said 'so what do you say?'
"It was a massive yes, there was no hesitation."
The couple have been together for just over two years and said they plan to marry in July next year.
