Firefighters were called to Botany Way, Purfleet, just before 22:00 BST on Wednesday, where they found the tankers were already "well alight".
One of the lorries was empty but the other four had a combined load of 45,000 litres of diesel and kerosene.
The blaze was possibly caused by an electrical fault, Essex Fire Service said. There were no reported injuries.

At the time, residents were told to keep their windows shut and the blaze also caused disruption for passengers on the C2C train line.
