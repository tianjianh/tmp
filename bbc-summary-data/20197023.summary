[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ministry of Defence confirmed a 19-year-old soldier from 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, had died. His family has been informed.
Police said three British tourists had been arrested following a reported altercation with four off-duty soldiers in the early hours.
The MoD has banned soldiers from Ayia Napa's centre after past trouble.
The town is a popular destination for thousands of young holidaymakers.
The two British military bases in the former colony, which gained independence in 1960, are home to more than 3,000 personnel.
The dead soldier is reported to have been stationed at the base in Dhekelia, about 12 miles (20km) west of Ayia Napa.
Police spokesman George Economou said the soldier was pronounced dead on arrival at Famagusta General Hospital in Paralimni.  A knife has been recovered and is undergoing forensic tests.
The three arrested Britons are expected to appear in court on Monday.
The Foreign Office said it was aware of the arrest of three British nationals in Ayia Napa and was providing consular assistance.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: "It is with great sadness that the MoD must confirm that a soldier... has died in an incident in Cyprus.
"An investigation is being conducted by Cyprus police and it would be inappropriate to comment any further. The family has been informed and our thoughts are with them."
