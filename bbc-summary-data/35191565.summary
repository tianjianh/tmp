The Prince of Wales has donated £2,000 to a Catholic church in Belfast that has been at the centre of disputes over loyalist band parades.

The Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall toured St Patrick's Church during a visit in May as part of its 200th anniversary celebrations.
The Donegall Street church has seen a number of flashpoint incidents outside its doors in recent years.
In 2012, a band played a song perceived to be sectarian outside the church.
Thirteen members of the band were convicted of playing the Famine Song, which is played to the same tune as the Beach Boys' Sloop John B but with anti-Catholic lyrics.
Their convictions were subsequently overturned on appeal.
Restrictions have since been placed on parades passing the church, with residents from nearby nationalist neighbourhoods staging protests against the marches.
The money donated by Prince Charles is to be used for renovation work at the church.
Fr Michael Sheehan, the church's administrator, said: "One of the challenges which the parish faces is raising much needed funds to restore the church's disintegrating stonework.
"The present church is an imposing edifice, rendered in sandstone and in the Romanesque style.
"Regrettably, its future is in jeopardy as its facade is worn and crumbling and in need of major repair.
"The first phase of works is estimated to cost in the region of £1.5m, with total works likely to exceed a colossal £5m."
Fr Sheehan said the church had been "encouraged in their fundraising efforts by incredibly generous benefactions".
He added that St Patrick wanted to "recapture the energy, enthusiasm and dedication" of those who built the church and secure the building's future.
St Patrick's Church expects renovation work to commence on its spire in next month.
