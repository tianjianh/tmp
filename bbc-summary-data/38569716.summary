Alongside co-driver Daniel Barritt, Evans will contest the entire WRC season as part of DMACK World Rally, but will drive the M-Sport Ford Fiesta.
His team-mates include the newly-crowned world champion, Sebastien Ogier and Estonian Ott Tanak.
The 28-year-old drove for M-Sport in the top class in 2014 and 2015, but was demoted to the WRC2 class in 2016.
"I am really excited, that was the goal last year to make it back in the top class," Evans told BBC Wales Sport.
"Last season in WRC2 made me more determined to make it back in to WRC.
"It is an open book this season with the brand new cars and new regulations, but I am aiming for the top positions. We want to get podiums and wins too."
