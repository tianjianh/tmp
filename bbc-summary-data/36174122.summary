The Gobbins: Dramatic Islandmagee coastal path reopens after storms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Antrim tourist attraction, which was closed after storms caused landslides in January, has reopened to the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gobbins - a dramatic cliff face walk in Islandmagee - was damaged by storms Abigail and Frank.
The path was only opened to the public for the first time in over 50 years last year.
A total of Â£7.5m was spent restoring it to the standard required for public use.
The Gobbins was the brainchild of Irish railway engineer Berkeley Deane Wise.
It first opened in 1902 and quickly became famous as a white knuckle walk.
Carved into black basalt cliffs, it was an engineering triumph, connected by a network of walkways and bridges, the most iconic of which was the tubular bridge.
