[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A grieving uncle died in a road accident hours after laying flowers at the spot where his four-year-old nephew drowned in the sea, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Thurlow, 42, was hit by a lorry on the M5 in Somerset, shortly after a memorial to mark what would have been the sixth birthday of Dylan Cecil.
Dylan drowned after he was swept off a jetty in Burnham-on-Sea during a family holiday in August 2012.
A conclusion of accidental death was reached by the coroner.
At West Somerset Coroner's Court, deputy coroner Tim Hayden said Mr Thurlow, of Kettering, Northamptonshire, had visited Burnham with friends "for what was in itself a very sad event".
Mr Hayden said: "He had drank throughout the day but it was steadily and he was not in a state of complete intoxication."
Mr Thurlow, a mechanic, had made the 170-mile journey from his home with his partner and Dylan's parents, on 29 April.
The inquest was told he was hit by a lorry while hitch-hiking on the M5 between Burnham and Weston-super-Mare in an attempt to return home to his ill father, who was due to undergo an operation.
Mr Hayden said the driver of the lorry would have had just over a second to react and added there was "no evidence" to suggest she was "anything other than driving extremely attentively at that time".
Last year an inquest absolved Dylan's parents Rachel McCollum and Darren Cecil of any blame for their son's death, recording a verdict of accidental death caused by drowning.
The inquest heard they had jumped in after their son but could not rescue him and his body was recovered four days later.
