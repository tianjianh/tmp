Drivers will also be issued with a Â£70 fixed penalty charge and sent photographs of their traffic violation.
The notice will contain a link to a website where a video clip of the offence can be viewed.
The council said the changes will help tackle congestion and recovered money will be spent on traffic measures.
Cabinet member for transport Ramesh Patel said: "Enforcement will be taking place on the main routes and only during morning and evening rush hours, in order to improve traffic flows, minimise delays and give an encouragement to public transport.
"This is therefore not about income generation, but rather about tackling bad driving habits at specific times and locations in the network which end up causing delays for everyone."
