A drone which has been used to scour the Devon coast has not been deployed due to "poor weather", police said.
The 25-year-old junior doctor's car was found on Friday at Ansteys Cove near Torquay, the town where she worked.
A police statement confirmed the search was continuing but said: "The drone has not been deployed because of poor weather."
Police divers have been redeployed to look for a missing man from Weymouth in an unconnected incident, Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed.

The statement added: "Enquiries and localised searches are continuing this morning. Officers from the specially trained Force Support Group continue to scour the coast.
"Rose's parents are being supported by Devon and Cornwall Police."
The BBC understands that a note was found in Dr Polge's car.
It is believed its contents were mainly related to personal issues, but there was a passing reference to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
On Thursday, Mr Hunt confirmed the government would impose a new contract on junior doctors in England.
It is understood Dr Polge had been an active campaigner against plans to change working hours and conditions for junior doctors, and in January posted a new Facebook profile picture, featuring the hashtag #NotFairNotSafe.
Police said her disappearance was "totally out of character" and concerns for her welfare were rising.

Saturday 13 February - The family and boyfriend of Dr Polge join more than 100 people searching the area around Ansteys Cove
Sunday 14 February - Torbay Hospital confirmed that Rose Polge works there as a junior doctor. "We will do whatever we can to support the authorities," a statement said.
Monday 15 February - Colin Smith, from Royston Hockey Club where Dr Polge used to play, said: "We just don't know what we can do."
Tuesday 16 February - Dr Polge's family release a statement saying they are "overwhelmed" by the support from her friends and colleagues
More than 100 people have been involved in the search operation, including Dr Polge's boyfriend and her family.
A district councillor for the village of Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, where Dr Polge's parents live, said he has no doubt the community will "rally round".
Cllr Jose Hales said: "My heart goes out to the family at this terrible time. The pain and worry they must be feeling is unimaginable. Melbourn has a strong community and will no doubt rally round."
Police are appealing for the public to contact them with any information or sightings of Dr Polge.
