[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was photographed on a collision course with Red Jet 4 as it passed Fawley oil refinery, near Southampton, at lunchtime.
Coastguards described the crash as a "glancing blow" and said the man - who was uninjured - was picked up by a companion on another machine.
The catamaran, the 12:15 GMT from Southampton to Cowes, was undamaged.
The overturned water craft was also recovered by a passing vessel.
The incident was captured on camera by Richard Bache, from Sandown, who was on board a Red Funnel car ferry to the Isle of Wight.
Coastguards said, after the collision, the Red Funnel vessel turned around to ensure the man had been rescued before continuing its journey.
A report is being prepared for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.
