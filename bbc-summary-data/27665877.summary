The 29-year-old was reported by umpires Ian Gould and Marais Erasmus after his side's win over England in their fourth one-day international on Saturday.
Senanayake can play in the deciding ODI at Edgbaston on Tuesday but has to undergo an ICC test within 21 days.
There were "concerns over a number of deliveries", said the ICC.
"Senanayake's bowling action will now be scrutinised further under the ICC process relating to bowlers reported in Tests, ODIs and T20s," read an ICC statement.
"The off-spinner is required to undergo testing within 21 days, and, during this period, he is permitted to continue bowling in international cricket until the results of the testing are known."
The ODI series stands at 2-2 and Senanayake has taken eight wickets in the four games so far this summer.
