[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An arrest warrant had been issued for Trevor Devamanikkam, from Witney, after he failed to appear at Bradford Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.
Mr Devamanikkam was accused of six sexual offences allegedly committed while he was a vicar in Bradford.
His body was found by police just after 16:00 BST on Tuesday, at an address at Otters Court, Priory Mill Lane.
Thames Valley Police officers attended the scene after concerns for Mr Devamanikkam's welfare were raised.
A spokesman said: "Officers entered the property and found a man in his 70s deceased.
"He was declared dead at the scene.  At this stage the death is not believed to be suspicious.
"A file is being prepared for the coroner."
The six offences Mr Devamanikkam was accused of are alleged to have taken place against a 16-year-old boy, between March 1984 and April 1985.
