Spanish side Villarreal have signed former Chelsea loanee Alexandre Pato from Corinthians.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Brazil forward, 26, scored once in just two appearances after joining the Premier League club in January.
Pato's parent club Corinthians said they sold their stake in the former AC Milan player to enable the move.
The Brazilian outfit added that the two clubs have decided not to release "economic figures involved in the deal".
