[SN]TITLE[SN]
Carlisle United 1-0 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bermuda international winger Reggie Lambe scored the only goal of the game as Carlisle condemned Plymouth to a third straight defeat this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Pilgrims staged a late rally in vain after Carlisle had dominated for the first hour, with a man of the match display from Lambe as the home side held out well in injury time against the side that did the league double against them last season.
Carlisle's brisk opening had Plymouth on the back foot and Danny Grainger, finding space to come forward on the left, fizzed one 30-yard shot narrowly wide of Luke McCormick's left-hand post.
The defender was in action again when crossing accurately for Michael Raynes to direct a header just over from six yards.
Carlisle went ahead in the 37th minute when Plymouth's defence failed to clear another dangerous Grainger centre and Lambe drilled home a low right-footed shot from 15 yards for his second league goal of the season.
A pacey run and cross by Lambe almost set up Shaun Miller as Carlisle attempted to consolidate their superiority after the break.
Plymouth came more into the game in the later stages and ex-Carlisle loanee Jake Jervis, on as a substitute, might have done better with a 75th-minute header which flashed over the bar.
Grainger then came to the home side's rescue with a goalline clearance when Gary Miller looked sure to equalise for Pilgrims.
