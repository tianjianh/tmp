Kortney Hause & Jordan Graham: Wolves pair punished for breach of club discipline

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kortney Hause was not considered for selection in Wolves' 2-1 Championship defeat by Birmingham because of an unspecified breach of club discipline.

Head coach Paul Lambert confirmed that defender Hause and winger Jordan Graham, both 21, had been punished.
Graham has not played a first-team game for 13 months because of a knee injury but is back in full training.
"They have let themselves, the fans and their team-mates down, but that is the end of it now," said Lambert.
Friday's loss to Blues was Wolves' fourth league defeat in a row and left them 20th in the table, five points above the relegation zone.
