County Championship: Gubbins & Eskinazi lead Lord's recovery against Lancashire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevie Eskinazi made a maiden first-class hundred in only his third County Championship innings, while Nick Gubbins achieved a first double century as Middlesex rallied well at Lord's.

Responding to Lancashire's 513 all out, Gubbins ended the day on 201 as Middlesex reached 419-5 to trail by 94.
After resuming on 146-1, the pair stretched their stand to 208 before Eskinazi (109) edged to second slip.
James Franklin then hit 41 from 51 balls to secure maximum batting points.
In a stand of 95 with Gubbins, who has so far batted almost seven and a half hours, Middlesex reached that target with more than three overs to spare.
Gubbins, who made his maiden first-class hundred in Middlesex's previous Championship fixture at Lord's against Somerset in late May, reached his double by hitting what proved to be the last three balls of the day for four, two and four off Kyle Jarvis.
Eskinazi had earlier reached his own landmark in style, slog-sweeping leg spinner Matt Parkinson for six into the Grand Stand.
The 22-year-old South African, who has an English-born mother and spent 10 years in England in his youth, has been with Middlesex for the last four years - including the first two on a scholarship.
Educated latterly in Western Australia, he holds a UK passport and is now more than halfway to completing the seven-year residency he needs to qualify to play for England.
Nick Gubbins told BBC Radio London:
"It's been an unforgettable day all round. Stevie and I are very good friends. For me, it was incredible to be at the other end when he got his hundred. And to get it with a six.
"He's worked so hard on his game and it's been great to see him take his opportunity in this match.
"Actually, batting out there together and putting on 200 is the most time I've spent with him since he got a girlfriend!"
Stevie Eskinazi told BBC Radio London:
"Nick has played a wonderful innings. As a batsman, he's going from strength to strength.
"For me to get my maiden hundred at Lord's, while batting with one of my best mates, is an incredible feeling. It's a day I won't forget.
"I don't remember too much about the six to get to a hundred. I'd been joking with my brother at lunchtime and saying should I get it by slog-sweeping the leg spinner for six but it certainly wasn't pre-meditated."
Lancashire fast bowler Neil Wagner told BBC Radio Manchester:
"It was perfect batting conditions and they made the most of it, but I don't think we will take it too hard.
"We fought hard and showed good character on an unresponsive wicket."
