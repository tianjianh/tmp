The airport said no new communities will be flown over, with the exception of those affected by a potential new departure route to the west of the airport.
A 12-week consultation on the changes will finish on 15 August.
Gatwick has submitted plans for a second runway to the Airports Commission.
Tom Denton, head of corporate responsibility at Gatwick said: "We want to minimise noise for as many people as we possibly can - and where that's not possible - offer respite options as a mitigating measure.
"We urge all local communities to have their say in this second phase so we can benefit as many people as possible."
