[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Jeroen Ensink, 41, was found in a street in Islington with stab wounds on Monday.
The lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was pronounced dead at the scene in Hilldrop Crescent at about 13:50 GMT.
A 22-year-old has been charged with Dr Ensink's murder.
As Dr Ensink was named as the victim, colleagues paid tribute to the "popular" public health lecturer, saying he will be "greatly missed".
Prof Peter Piot said: "We are deeply shocked and saddened.
"Jeroen was passionately committed to a simple cause - improving access to water and sanitation in countries where children continue to die needlessly due to the lack of these basic services."
Dr Ensink joined the school almost a decade ago. At the time of his death he was leading a study in the Democratic Republic of Congo to understand how improvements in water supply could control and prevent cholera outbreaks.
Prof Piot, director of the school, added: "He was a natural educator and immensely popular with students in whom he invested much time and energy.
"Jeroen will be greatly missed by all the staff and students who had the opportunity to know and work with him, and the legacy of his work will continue in Asia and Africa.
"Our deepest condolences go to his family and friends."
Timchang Nandap, 22, of Pett Street, Woolwich, south-east London, has been charged with Dr Ensink's murder.
He appeared at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Thursday and was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Monday, Scotland Yard said.
