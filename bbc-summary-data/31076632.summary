At least 13 people have died and dozens have been injured in a fire at a plastics factory in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, officials say.

The cause of the blaze in the multi-storey Nasim Plastic building is still unclear, but it may have triggered by a faulty gas cylinder or boiler.
The fire was later brought under control. Fire-fighters are now searching through the rubble.
Factory fires are common in Bangladesh, where safety conditions are often poor.
In 2012, 112 workers died in a fire in the factory just outside the capital.
The country suffered an even greater tragedy in 2013 when the Rana Plaza garment factory complex collapsed on the outskirts of Dhaka, killing 1,135 people.
