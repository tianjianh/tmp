Western Isles Council - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar - began looking into Lewis-based Hebridean Sea Salt earlier this year.
FSS said it has been discovered that most of the salt found in the product did not originate from the isles.
The watchdog said it "was imported table salt".
The BBC sought to contact the firm's owner Natalie Crayton for comment.
FSS said it had decided to reveal some details about the investigation because of media interest in the case.
In a statement, a spokesperson said: "Western Isles Council is the lead in the Hebridean Sea Salt investigation and Food Standards Scotland has a supporting role.
"We would not normally disclose the details of an active and ongoing investigation.
"However, given the coverage of this case, we believe it is now in the public interest to disclose the issues that are under investigation.
"This is not simply a case of mis-labelling. Investigations discovered that over 80% of the salt found in Hebridean Sea Salt did not originate in the Hebrides, but was imported table salt.
"It is Food Standards Scotland's view that, whilst this is not a food safety issue, deception of consumers on this scale is not acceptable and could damage Scotland's well-deserved reputation for high quality, authentic food and drink products."
