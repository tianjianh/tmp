Tyler Walker, an 18-year-old striker who made his debut last season, has played eight times this term, scoring once to double his overall goal tally.
That is one more than Des Walker, who won 59 England caps from 1988-93, managed in a 858-game career.
"He is a more talented player than I was. I only had to kick people," Walker senior told BBC East Midlands Today.
"I was not bad at kicking people and he is a creative player and they are the talented ones. If I start telling him how to score goals he will start laughing."
Walker junior has only started five games, from a total of 15 appearances.
But he has impressed his manager Dougie Freedman and his father's popularity at the City Ground has meant the home fans are already singing his name.
"When I hear Forest fans singing 'He is one of our own', that always hits me hard because he is one of their own," Des, 49, said.
"I was born in London, but he is born here, lives here and loves the club. They appreciate that, so for them to give that back is amazing."
As well as his father having played for Forest, Tyler Walker's mother, grandmother, auntie and brother have all worked for the club.
Walker senior, who played 408 matches for Forest during two spells at the club totalling nearly 12 years, says it was not his own playing career that inspired his son to become a professional.
"It was David Beckham and Michael Owen who did that," the former Forest, Sampdoria and Sheffield Wednesday defender revealed.
"I wanted [my children] to be doctors or lawyers but that was never going to happen. He spent seven or eight hours a day smashing up my house playing football and that's why he has got where he has today. He has carved out his own niche."
