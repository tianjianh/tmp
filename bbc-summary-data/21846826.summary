Plans to build a supermarket on a Staffordshire park have been put on hold, a council has said.

Stafford Borough Council said more than 1,000 people had objected to the plans for Westbridge Park in Stone during consultation.
The majority of people were worried about the loss of open green space, the authority said.
It had planned to sell part of the park to a supermarket to fund a redevelopment of its leisure centre.
Council leader Mike Heenan: "It is obvious from the feedback that people would rather not have another food store in Stone but they do support better leisure facilities.
"We expect to get an application for an out of town supermarket shortly but unfortunately it will not provide the money required to deliver state of the art facilities we wanted for Stone."
The council said it would look at the plans and finances again and would set up a liaison group to talk to "key organisations in the town".
It said it was also investigating putting Westbridge Park into a trust "to allay residents' fears of large amounts of green space being built on".
