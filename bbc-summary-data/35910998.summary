The collision happened at about 23:35 BST on Sunday between J23 for South Mimms and J22 for London Colney.
A BMW car left the carriageway and overturned, killing a man in his 40s who was the only occupant of the vehicle, police said.
The driver of a Peugeot 206, in her 30s, and the driver of an MG TF, in her 40s, both suffered slight injuries.
The road was closed for forensic examination of the crash site, emergency repairs and removal of the vehicles, police said.
PC Bruce Lister said: "Our thoughts are with the man's family at this extremely difficult time and a family liaison officer is currently supporting them.
"We would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision or the events leading up to it, or who saw the vehicles prior to the incident.
"A number of people also now have dash-cams installed in their vehicles and if anyone caught any part of the incident on film I would ask them to contact me as soon as possible."
