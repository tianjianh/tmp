A spate of assaults in the Scotch Street area of the city are thought to be linked.
The first, on 19 February, involved a 65-year-old woman who was slapped on her head after sneezing. On 17 March an 82-year-old woman was also attacked.
Cumbria Police described the incidents as "unique" and want to speak to a man captured on camera.
A force spokesman added: "The offender is assaulting innocent members of the public and that sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.
"We would like to speak to the person pictured in the CCTV image in connection with these offences and we appeal to anyone who recognises him to make contact."
