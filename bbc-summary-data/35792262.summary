Cheltenham stay top of the table by a point ahead of Forest Green, but never got into their stride at Cressing Road.
The Robins survived a goalmouth scramble and a half-volley from Cheek before the break.
Chez Isaac crossed for Cheek to head home the winner after the interval and Braintree held on for a deserved win as Asa Hall struck the home side's post.

Cheltenham Town manager Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: "It's always disappointing when you lose a game - we knew what to expect from them but we couldn't handle it.
"They've done very well and we weren't good enough to break them down and when we were, it was given offside.
"Some of the boys didn't perform today, they showed energy and work rate but maybe their mindset has gone a bit and they're not believing that they're top of the league."
