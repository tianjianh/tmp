[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Torres struck with a first-half header, scoring for the fifth game in succession as Atletico registered a fourth straight league win.
The victory kept the visitors level on points with Barca, who thrashed Deportivo La Coruna 8-0.
Atletico lost Diego Godin after 11 minutes with a hamstring injury.
He is now a doubt for his side's next league game against Malaga this weekend and their Champions League semi-final first leg against Bayern Munich on 27 April.
