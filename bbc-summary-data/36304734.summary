[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Watson, who joined from Wigan in January 2015, had been halfway through a two-year deal at Vicarage Road.
The 30-year-old midfielder has featured heavily for Watford in their first season back in the Premier League, making a total of 41 appearances.
Watford finished the season eight points clear of relegation, and have all-but secured a 13th-place finish.
They will only slip to 14th if Bournemouth win their rearranged game at Manchester United on Tuesday by a 10-goal margin or better.
