Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Turnbull said Mr Abbott had not yet indicated his plans.
Mr Turnbull on Monday successfully challenged Mr Abbott for the country's top job.
The new prime minister would not comment on the cabinet's make-up.
Earlier, Treasurer Joe Hockey refused to comment on speculation he would be dumped from the portfolio.
Political pundits have tipped Social Services Minister Scott Morrison to take over the Treasury portfolio.
Mr Abbott was absent from question time in parliament on Tuesday when Mr Turnbull debuted as prime minister.
"I have had a discussion with Tony Abbott but he hasn't given me an indication [about his future]," Mr Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.
US President Barack Obama on Wednesday phoned Mr Abbott to commend his leadership in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, local media reported.
Asked if he would include more women in the cabinet, Mr Turnbull would say only "there is no greater enthusiast than me for seeing women in positions of power and influence in parliament, in ministries right across the country".
He was speaking at a press conference with state premiers from New South Wales and Victoria about rolling out the next stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which is worth A$22bn ($15.7bn; Â£10.2bn) a year.
The scheme, which coordinates funding of and access to services for people with serious and permanent disabilities, is funded by federal and state governments.
