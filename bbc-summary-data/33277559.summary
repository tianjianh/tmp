Amy Smith, 17, and her six-month-old daughter Ruby-Grace Gaunt died, along with Ed Green, also 17, in Langley Mill, Derbyshire, on Sunday.
Peter Eyre, 43, Anthony Eyre, 21, both of Sandiacre, and Simon Eyre, 24, from Long Eaton, are due before magistrates in Chesterfield on Friday.
A 17-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail.
The three victims all died from the effects of smoke inhalation, police said.
Two men, aged 18 and 17, who were also inside the premises, were rescued by neighbours and treated for smoke inhalation.
They used ladders to help rescue residents inside the house before emergency services arrived.
Resident Sean Needham said he passed his six-year-old disabled son out of a window into his neighbour's arms.
Several neighbouring properties were evacuated due to a gas leak caused by the blaze.
Tributes were paid online to the three victims.
Katie Gough said: "Knowing the baby was only six months old is so heartbreaking, and 17 years of age is too young to die."
Jodie Mee wrote: "Rest in peace girls and Ed, Heaven has gained two beautiful girls and a strong boy. Thoughts go out to their family and all the people who knew them."
On Twitter, Immy wrote: "I feel so proud to have known someone who has been so brave and selfless, RIP Ed Green you won't be forgotten."
