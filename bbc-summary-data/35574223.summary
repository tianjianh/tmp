Gresley player-manager Gary Ricketts was sent off at Leek Town on Saturday after jumping into the crowd.

It is alleged Ricketts confronted a fan who he believed had yelled an obscenity in the Northern Premier League First Division South game as Leek won 3-0.
Witnesses said a brief verbal exchange took place before stewards intervened and the spectator was ejected with Ricketts, 40, shown a red card.
The club has said that Ricketts reacted to what he believed were racist words.
It is understood police have been notified.
The Football Association will wait for the referee's report before deciding what action to take.
"Gary reacted to a comment made by someone on the terraces," said NPL chairman Mark Harris.
"Other than the loss of control going into the crowd, there is no question any act of violence took place."
In 2011, a friendly between Ilkeston and Mansfield was abandoned after Ricketts sent three Stags players to hospital in separate challenges.
