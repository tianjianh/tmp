Jordan Sigismeau went over early on for Catalans, before Ian Henderson, Krisnan Inu and Elliott Whitehead made it 20-0.
Lineham and Jordan Abdull put the hosts back in contention, while Lineham and Curtis Naughton touched down to cut the lead to four points after the break.
Thomas Bosc added the Dragons' fifth try to secure victory, before Lineham scored twice more late on.
The result meant Catalans finished seventh in Super League, one place and four points above the Black and Whites.
Catalans dominated an error-strewn first-half, with the French side finally going ahead as Sigismeau touched down in the corner.
Henderson sold the Hull defence a smart dummy to dive over, before poor tackling from the hosts allowed Inu to extend the lead.
Lineham gifted possession to the Dragons shortly after to allow Whitehead to charge over, but the Warrington-bound winger atoned for his mistake by putting the finishing touches to a swift passing move.
Three more unanswered tries from Lineham, Abdull and Naughton brought Hull back to within one score of the visitors, but Bosc was gifted possession to run in unchallenged from deep inside his own half.
Lineham's two late tries failed to bring his side level as the hosts missed the target from all six of their conversion attempts.

Hull FC head coach Lee Radford told BBC Radio Humberside:
"It was a pretty chaotic game and one that almost came to a standstill in the last 20 minutes.
"The players going down and the stoppages in play really took the sting out of the game.
"Ultimately that probably hurt us a little bit because we were chasing the game."
