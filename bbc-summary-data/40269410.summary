The Blue singer was treated in hospital for a condition called quinsy over the weekend, but was released on Tuesday.
However, the Press Association says Ryan, 33, has since been readmitted after developing further problems.
Ryan first appeared in EastEnders - as Woody Woodward, who took over the running of the Queen Vic - in April.
The Press Association reported a source saying: "He continues to be under good care and all of the Blue boys have been in to see him.
"He's likely to be in for another couple of days."
His recent stint in hospital comes less than two years after doctors found a cyst in his throat, which was removed over fears it was cancerous.
Ryan rose to fame in the early 2000s as one of the founding members of boy band Blue.
