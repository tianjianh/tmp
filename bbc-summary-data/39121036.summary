Wakefield Trinity earned their first win in 12 games as a late, disputed penalty try gave them victory over St Helens in sapping conditions.

Saints led 12-10 when the video referee adjudged Jacob Miller was held back in tracking a Sam Williams kick, awarding a try that Williams converted.
Trinity led 10-4 at the break through Mason Caton-Brown's spectacular finish and three Williams goals.
Mark Percival scored twice to add to Ryan Morgan's first-half score.
However, Chris Chester's side showed mettle and composure to fight back and end a nine-game losing run against Saints going back to 2012.
Wakefield had come close in their opening two fixtures, losing to Hull FC and Huddersfield, and had the fortune in this game to snatch the victory late on.
They adapted best to the conditions early on in taking the opportunity to accrue points through Williams' boot and Caton-Brown, who scored a remarkable, airborne diving try in the corner after slick hands.
The only sour note for Chester was the loss of captain Danny Kirmond with a concussion concern late on.
Saints, who had won one and lost one of their opening games, fought back after half-time and targeted Wakefield's right edge to score twice through the impressive Percival, whose boot failed to match Williams' accuracy.
Those missed goal attempts proved key in the end as they outscored the visitors in tries but still came away empty-handed.
St Helens coach Keiron Cunningham:  "I thought the ruling of a penalty try was that it has to be guaranteed that the player is going to score a try. That was my understanding. Can we guarantee he is going to score it?
"I've not spoken to the ref about it, but having said that we should have closed the game out when we were in front.
"I'm disappointed with the start. We were shocking last week and we started slow again.
"We lacked a sense of intensity as we couldn't build momentum and it's something we have to address."
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester told BBC Radio Leeds: "It's really pleasing. We were in total control in the first 40 minutes, we've scored some points, come from behind and come away with some points. We'll enjoy the rest of the weekend.
"I only saw what everyone else saw on the big screen. It's a penalty, he's tackled him without the ball but you don't see many penalty tries given.
"I'm just glad that we got the call and it's not the other way round because I probably wouldn't be too happy."
