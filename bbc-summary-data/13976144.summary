However, BBC Scotland has learned no bid has yet been made for the 22-year-old striker.
Damari made his first-team debut in 2006 and has scored twice in two appearances for his country.
Meanwhile, Victor Wanyama has agreed to join Celtic subject to a work permit and medical after a fee was agreed with Belgian club Germinal Beerschot.
Wanyama, 20, first moved to Europe from his native Kenya when he joined Swedish club Helsingborg in 2007.
The defensive midfielder moved on to Beerschot the following year and has been capped 11 times.
Celtic manager Neil Lennon has been trying to sign a goalkeeper but last week had a bid of Â£1.5m for Fraser Forster rejected, the Newcastle stopper having spent last season on loan in Glasgow.
Lennon has also been linked with moves for Kaizer Chiefs forward Knowledge Musona and Central Coast Mariners midfielder Mustafa Amini, who will play against Celtic in a friendly in Australia this weekend.
