Veteran BBC political producer Paul Lambert has joined the UK Independence Party as their communications director.

Mr Lambert, nicknamed "Gobby", is well known in Westminster for shouting questions to ministers on their way in and out of 10 Downing St.
He said he was "delighted" to add his experience to the UKIP team.
Welcoming him to UKIP on Sunday, party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Lambert was always effective at getting his message across and would fit in well.
Mr Farage said: "He will fit UKIP like a glove. Drive, passion, hard work, honesty and immense good humour are the hallmarks of Paul. It'll be fun working with him".
Long-serving producer Mr Lambert's voice is often heard in the background to TV news packages.
Last week he shouted: "Have you fixed the deficit yet, chancellor?" as George Osborne prepared to deliver the Autumn Statement.
There was a brief social media campaign, joined by some MPs, for him to have his Commons pass reinstated in 2011.
It was removed because he had filmed the aftermath of the foam attack on Rupert Murdoch, in contravention of strict rules on what can be filmed inside Parliament.
BBC colleagues paid tribute to him on Twitter. BBC Newsnight political editor Allegra Stratton wrote: "Shock departure of @westminstergoby to UKIP doesn't trigger byelection at the BBC... But it leaves a big hole. Very good hire for Farage."
