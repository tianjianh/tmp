[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Islamist militants have pleaded guilty to breaching elements of the Terrorism Act after leaving the UK illegally.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trevor Brooks and Simon Keeler, both of east London, were deported from Hungary after being found on a train headed for Bucharest, Romania, on 14 November.
At Westminster Magistrates' Court, both men admitted failing to inform the police of their intention to leave the UK.
They will be sentenced at a later date.
The court heard Keeler, 44, of Shadwell, and Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen, 40, of Clapton, left the UK around the 9 November.
A European arrest warrant was issued for the men after their names could not be found on any port or airport manifest.
At a Budapest court, Keeler said he had been trying to reach his wife and children in Turkey, while Brooks said he wanted to be sent back to Britain.
The court chose to deport them.
In 2008, both men were jailed for four-and-a-half years after being convicted of urging worshippers, at Regent's Park mosque, to fight Britons and Americans in Iran.
Keeler became the first white British Muslim to be convicted of terrorism offences.
