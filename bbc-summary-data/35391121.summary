Christie, 25, won the 500m, 1,000m and 1,500m races in Sochi, the scene of Winter Olympics disappointment in 2014.
Fellow Briton Charlotte Gilmartin was second overall after making the 1,000m final and winning the 1,500m B final.
And the men's relay team edged out Russia to claim bronze in the 5,000m race.
Christie's pre-season had been hampered by injury and she was unsure of her form heading into the Euros, with the Scot's main aim to peak for the World Championships in Seoul in March.
