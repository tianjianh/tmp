Wade Nicholson-Doyle took his boyfriend, Chris, to the Melbourne show as a 40th birthday present.
When the singer selected the pair from the crowd, Mr Nicholson-Doyle dropped to one knee and proposed. A loud cheer went up around the stadium.
"Did you say yes?" Adele joked, before embracing the couple.
"I actually had no idea that was going to happen. Congratulations."
Mr Nicholson-Doyle said he was momentarily unaware of the screaming crowd.
"It just kind of blacked out and all I could see was Chris and Adele standing there," he told the BBC.
"To share the stage with her, if only for five minutes, is really incredible. We're very much in her debt."
Same-sex marriage is not legal in Australia. A proposal for a vote on the issue was blocked in parliament last year.
However, Mr Nicholson-Doyle said they would hold a celebration with friends and family in Australia.
"We've made no plans yet," he said.
"I think Chris's head is still spinning at the moment."
