The Confederation Cup holders took the lead after 19 minutes when a Hamza Lahmar free-kick found a way through the Mazembe wall.
Last year's African Champions League winners Mazembe scored an important away goal six minutes after half-time through Ivorian Roger Assale.
The other semi-final first leg is on Sunday as Algeria's Mouloudia Bejaia host FUS Rabat of Morocco.
Etoile and Mazembe have won nine African titles each, FUS Rabat won the tournament in 2010 leaving Bejaia chasing a first ever continental title.
A strong defence faced a formidable attack when first-time semi-finalists Mouloudia Bejaia hosted FUS Rabat on Sunday - and honours ended even at 0-0.
The home side, coached by former Algeria defender Nacer Sandjak, have conceded only three goals, all away from home, in eight matches en route to the penultimate stage.
And they were able to shut out their opponents, who have struck 23 goals in 12 games, despite having Adel Lakhdari sent off on 78 minutes for his second bookable offence.
The second legs will be played on Sunday 25 September.
