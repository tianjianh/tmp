James Moore, who lives in Nanpantan Road, Loughborough, says more than 100 drivers a week use the pavement to go round vehicles waiting to turn right.
His front door, along with others, opens directly onto the street.
Leicestershire County Council said it had installed bollards on the kerb and would be speaking to residents and police in the coming weeks.
Mr Moore has filmed and photographed vehicles on the road in a bid to make County Hall tackle the danger.
"I've been verbally abused by drivers when I've refused to get out of the way. I had one vehicle... drive at me," he said.
"We have some that are quite a few feet over. They are just a few inches from my front door....it makes me fearful for the residents here.
"If somebody was visually impaired would they be able to jump out of the way of a vehicle going up on the pavement?"
Leicestershire County Council said it has installed two bollards on the kerb and moved the central white line away from the pavement.
Assistant director for Transport Pete Price said: "It is totally unacceptable what drivers are doing. It is a criminal offence.
"This is a very busy junction and it is largely people trying to bypass the A512, Ashby Road.
"It's a fixed amount of space we have got and we are looking at short term solutions so people can't mount the kerb."
