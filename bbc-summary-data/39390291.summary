[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tranmere had earlier reached the summit with a 1-0 victory at Wrexham, but Lincoln matched their promotion rivals' result to reclaim first place.
The home side had a golden opportunity to open the scoring in the first half when Lee Angol was fouled in the area, but  Alan Power's penalty was brilliantly saved by Ross Flitney.
Bromley continued to frustrate Lincoln until Knott came off the bench to drill in a shot with his first touch of the ball on 65 minutes to earn his side three crucial points.
