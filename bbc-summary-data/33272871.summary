[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trevor Gibbon, 48, from Harrow, north-west London, stabbed Alison Morrison 33 times on 18 December, before fleeing the scene, the Old Bailey heard. As she lay dying, she named her attacker.
The day before the murder Gibbon pleaded guilty to harassing the family and was given a restraining order.
He will be sentenced on Tuesday.
The court heard that as she lay dying in the street near her home, 45-year-old Mrs Morrison told residents who went to help her: "Trevor Gibbon did this to me."
Afterwards, the killer fled in his Mercedes but was picked up the same morning 100 miles away in Lincolnshire, saying he was "heading for the coast".
Still with dried blood on his hands, he told officers: "It was over a neighbour dispute."
The Old Bailey heard the trouble dated back to 2011 when Mrs Morrison, her husband Cedric and their teenage son moved next door to Gibbon and his partner.
Gibbon, originally from Birmingham, initially complained about the noise from her son's skateboard and then embarked upon a long campaign of harassment.
Mrs Morrison reported the harassment to the council and police and, in the days before she was killed, described in a written statement shown to the jury how "it got so bad" that she could not sleep properly and "felt it would never end."
In the statement she said Gibbon threatened her by trapping her in her car, banging dustbin lids loudly at 6am below her window, and repeatedly flashing his car lights.
He was charged with harassing the family between 1 August 2012 and 31 October 2014 and admitted the offence at magistrates' court the day before he killed her.
Gibbon denied murder and claimed he was suffering a mental abnormality when he stabbed Mrs Morrison.
Members of Mrs Morrison's family wept as the jury found him guilty after deliberating for two days.
Her husband Cedric told the court: "Alison was my best friend, my soulmate, the soul of our home and the breadwinner to the household."
He said he found her death incomprehensible and added: "A bright light has been extinguished forever."
Mrs Morrison had supported him through ill health following a kidney transplant and also volunteered with the local police.
At her funeral officers lined up to salute her coffin.
Her son Kori told the court in his victim impact statement that Gibbon had effectively given him a life sentence by taking his mother away from him.
"I fail to see how any prospect of release could ever be given to him," Kori added.
