Harvey the Dalmatian was found weak and cold at a bus stop in Shedfield, Hampshire, more than 240km from the vets where he was registered in Ynysybwl, Rhondda Cynon Taff.
He is microchipped but the numbers registered to it do not work. Harvey is now being cared for by the RSPCA.
Inspector Tina Ward said: "We are desperate to know how he came to be in this state and where his owners are."
