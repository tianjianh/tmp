Ed Greaves gave Scotland an early lead, but Benjamin Carless levelled for Wales from a penalty corner.
Alan Forsyth was clinical from a penalty corner to restore the Blue Sticks's lead as they dominated.
Wales equalised through Gareth Furlong with seven minutes to go and went on to secure victory in the shootout.
Scotland's next match in World League 2 Pool B is against Poland on Tuesday morning. They lost 3-1 to France in their opening game.
Men's head coach Derek Forsyth said: "It's disappointing to lose the match in a shootout.
"The match was ours to win. In the first half especially, we created plenty of chances to score more goals.
"In the second half, we allowed Wales too much time on the ball. We weren't as aggressive as we were in the first half and let them back in.
"Today's performance was better than the previous game's performance and it gives us something to build on for the match against Poland."
