It opened its gates on 30 September 1936 to provide Britain with a film studio to compete with Hollywood.
Since then, the site in Buckinghamshire has produced blockbusters such as the James Bond franchise and Star Wars films.
Former Bond star Sir Roger Moore, who made all but one of his Bond films at the Iver Heath studios, described Pinewood as a "second home".
Studio historian Gareth Owen said the site had been responsible for "really landscape-changing films".
The location has more than a dozen main stages - including the 007 stage - and covers tens of thousands of square feet.
Over the years, dozens of blockbusters and much-loved classics have been filmed at the site - from Oliver Twist and the Carry On series, to thriller Alien and several of the Marvel movies.
It has also been home to television shows, adverts and pop promos.
The studios were developed when British film mogul J Arthur Rank decided he wanted his own studio to compete with the technology and facilities of studios is the United States.
Together with builder Charles Boot he bought Heatherden Hall and the studios grew around it.
Mr Owen said film production is one of the UK's indigenous industries and Pinewood was "at the forefront" of its success.
"It has the best stages, the best technicians and really the best reputation," he said.
Sir Roger -  who first worked there in 1946 and has had an office onsite for decades - said in addition to the Bond films, he has made half a dozen other movies at Pinewood, including The Persuaders.
"I like to think I know Pinewood quite well. [It] not only has the very best facilities, it also has a charm and warmth unlike any other studio."
