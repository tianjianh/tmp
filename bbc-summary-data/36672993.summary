Crewe Alexandra: Fitness league table will build competition says boss Steve Davis

Crewe Alexandra manager Steve Davis says the introduction of a league table to chart his players' performances will make pre-season more "competitive".

The Alex are preparing for life back in League Two following relegation from League One last season.
"We'll see where the players are fitness-wise and all the results will be put together in a league table," Davis, 50, told BBC Radio Stoke.
"The ones at the bottom will have to get themselves to the top."
After a wretched 2015-16 season, when Crewe finished 16 points adrift of safety at the bottom of League One, Davis is working hard to get the most out of his squad for a tilt at promotion now that they have reported back ahead of the new campaign.
And he says pitting the players against each other should do wonders for their motivation.
"People will be able to see who's performing and at what level and if they're a bit behind it's up to them to get up with the ones that have looked after themselves over the close season," Davis said.
"When you put an emphasis on a league table and you get the top one who's the best and the bottom one who's the worst, it makes people push themselves as hard as they possibly can - we don't want to just go through the motions.
"We want pre-season to be competitive individually - if you're struggling near the bottom but trying your best to improve, that builds character."
Davis has brought in experienced striker Ryan Lowe and seen defender Zoumana Bakayoko sign a new deal, but is looking to add to his squad after seeing joint top-scorer from last season Brad Inman leave for Peterborough United.
