Hosking positioned herself well going into the last 100 metres of the narrow rising finish to edge ahead of Barnes and Dutch rider Ellen van Dijk.
Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma did enough to retain her overall lead.
Barnes is joint third alongside sister Hannah Barnes, one minute and 46 seconds off the pace.
Alice, 21, is relishing the chance to race alongside her older sister.
"There is not really any sibling rivalry between us," she said. "Everybody thinks there should be, but we just race the events and try and get the best results we can."
Marianne Vos, winner of the inaugural Women's Tour in 2014, is tied in third overall with the British sisters but was unable to contest the finish on Friday after crashing in the final 500 metres of the 151km stage that began in Atherstone.
Saturday's stage is a 123.1km circular route starting and finishing in Chesterfield, and the race concludes with a stage in London on Sunday.
