[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS boss is being investigated over an "irregular" redundancy deal for a midwife involved in baby death scandals.

Jeanette Parkinson was overpaid when she left Morecambe Bay Hospitals Trust in 2012, an internal review found.
Ms Parkinson and other midwives were accused of colluding over evidence given to an inquiry into baby deaths.
Now former HR manager Roger Wilson, who signed off the deal, is being probed by the Care Quality Commission.
A spokeswoman for the trust said he was being investigated under the fit and proper person test.
This regulation, introduced in 2014, means that all people with director-level responsibility for the quality and safety of care, can be deemed unfit if they have been involved in "serious misconduct or mismanagement".
Ms Parkinson, a maternity risk manager, was one of the midwives caring for newborn Joshua Titcombe, who died at Barrow's Furness General hospital in Cumbria in November 2008.
He was one of 11 babies and one mother to die after being treated at the trust's hospitals over a nine-year period.
A later inquiry led by Dr Bill Kirkup found that a "lethal mix" of failures at the trust led to their "unnecessary" deaths between 2004 and 2013.
Last month it emerged that in 2012, Mr Wilson signed an exit deal for Ms Parkinson which allowed her to leave without an investigation into her performance.
At the time Mr Wilson, who now works at Warrington and Halton Hospitals Foundation Trust, told the Health Service Journal: "I would like to record that I strongly refute any allegation of impropriety on my part while employed at UHMB or at any other role that I have held in either public or private sectors."
