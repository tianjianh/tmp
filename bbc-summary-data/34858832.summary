The Frenchman, 23, who is the son of Catalan Dragons' chief executive Christophe Jouffret, scored twice and kicked 28 goals for Whitehaven in 2015.
"Louis is an exciting signing," Haven boss James Coyle told the club website.
"Last season he made a massive impact on the team when he arrived and after he left we struggled to replace him."
