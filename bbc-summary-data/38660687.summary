The "pram-pushing hitman" who shot a man outside a Glasgow primary school is pictured on the front page of The Scottish Sun. The photograph was taken by a parent who thought he looked suspicious, as he appeared to be pushing an empty buggy and was wrapped in a woolly scarf and bobble hat.

Like many papers, The Herald leads with the fall out from Theresa May's landmark speech on Brexit. It reports that a "crisis looms" over the union, after Nicola Sturgeon described the plan to leave the single market as "economically catastrophic".
It means the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum was "more likely", according to The Scotsman.
The National says a second referendum is "our only hope", branding the prime minister's hard Brexit plans "terrifying".
The Scottish Daily Mail describes the situation as a "showdown over Brexit", after Nicola Sturgeon said an independence referendum was virtually "inevitable".
There is a similar theme on the front page of the I newspaper, while the Scottish Daily Express reports that Theresa May "called Nicola Sturgeon's bluff".
The prime minister warned Brussels that any attempt to punish Britain for leaving the European Union would be an act of "calamitous self-harm", according to the Scotland edition of The Times.
Meanwhile, the Daily Record leads with the story of a man who admitted poisoning his wife with laxatives over three years. David Thomas Smith pretended to have cancer after he was caught, according to the paper.
Under the headline "No Minister", The Press and Journal reports the concerns of north-east firms over plans for "massive rates increases".
The civil court ruling that two ex-Dundee United players raped a woman is the top story in The Courier.
And the Daily Star reports that George Michael's family believe the singer died from a drugs overdose.
