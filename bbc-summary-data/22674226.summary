Ethiopia's Lelisa Desisa said he believed sport should be a pleasure - never a battlefield.
He made the announcement after meeting US Secretary of State John Kerry in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.
Three people died and 264 were injured in the 15 April blasts. Two brothers are thought to be responsible.
One was killed in a shootout with police and the other was captured.
On Saturday thousands of runners completed the final mile of the Boston Marathon - five weeks after they were forced to abandon the race.
The event was billed as "OneRun", with the slogan: "We'll get our finish."
Three American flags and one Chinese were carried in remembrance of three people who died by the finishing line, and the policeman killed days later by the brothers in the shootout.
Last week, US media reported that the surviving suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, had written a message in a boat where he was found which said the attack was retribution for the US-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The victims, he added, were "collateral damage".
Mr Tsarnaev is facing federal charges of using a weapon of mass destruction, as well as malicious destruction of property resulting in death.
He could face the death penalty if convicted.
