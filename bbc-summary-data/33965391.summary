More than 120 people were injured in the blast, close to the Erawan Shrine in the country's capital, Bangkok.
BBC NI employee Mairead Campbell, from Belfast, visited the religious shrine on Saturday.
She said she and her friends had decided to stay in their hotel on Monday rather than go outside.
She said her hotel was "very close to where the bomb went off".
"We heard a bang and went down to reception, where we were told not to leave," Ms Campbell added.
"We followed that advice - but an hour or two later we nipped outside.
"The scene was cordoned off and emergency people were still there.
"I'd describe the scene as chaotic.
"Up until now I've felt very safe.
"We were only supposed to be staying in Bangkok for two days but extended our stay because we loved it so much."
No-one has yet said they carried out the attack.
The shrine is a major tourist attraction and the Thai government said the attack was aimed at foreigners.
Local media reported that tourists, including Chinese, are among the casualties.

The Nation TV channel quoted Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha as saying the government would set up a "war room" to coordinate its response.
National police chief Somyot Poompummuang said that 10 Thais had been confirmed dead, along with one Chinese and one Filipino.
The Bangkok Post quoted police as saying that 3kg of TNT had been stuffed in a pipe inside the shrine and that an electronic circuit suspected to have been used in the attack was found 30 metres from the scene.
Police checked the area for other devices but no further bombs have been found, the paper said.
The explosion occurred at about 19:00 local time (12:00 GMT).
Eyewitness accounts
The shrine is to the Hindu god Brahma, but is also visited by thousands of Buddhists each day. There are also three major shopping centres nearby.
