Bournemouth midfielder Andrew Surman could miss the remainder of the season with a medial knee ligament injury.

Surman, 30, was forced off at half-time during their goalless draw against Southampton on Saturday after colliding with Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster.
"They can be quite nasty injuries, depending on the area and how big the damage to the ligament is," manager Eddie Howe told BBC Radio Solent.
"Whether it's a season-ending injury, we're not quite sure at this moment."
Bournemouth, unbeaten in their past four Premier League games, have eight games left and travel to Liverpool on Wednesday.
Howe admitted Surman's absence will be "a miss", but is confident other midfield options in his squad can fill the gap.
"I think every player's different and they bring their own influences to the team. They all have their different strengths," he said.
"Andrew for me is a very, very good controlling midfielder for us in terms of possession, does a lot of work that's unseen, is good defensively for us as well."
