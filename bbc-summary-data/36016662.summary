County Championship: Notts dominate as Surrey forced to follow on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottinghamshire dominated day two against Surrey, bowling the visitors out before enforcing the follow-on.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 7-0 in reply to Notts' first innings total of 446, Surrey were reduced to 85-4 before lunch.
Only Jason Roy (28), Ben Foakes (38) and Tom Curran (35) offered convincing resistance as Notts picked up maximum bowling points in dismissing Surrey for 225, with Jackson Bird taking 4-56.
Surrey reached stumps on 14 without loss but are 207 runs behind the hosts.
Rory Burns departed in the second over of the day, caught behind off the bowling of Bird, before Arun Harinath became the Australian debutant's second victim six overs later when he was caught by Riki Wessels.
Harry Gurney then picked up the wicket of Steven Davis and the visitors were in trouble when Kumar Sangakkara (32) was dismissed by Brett Hutton.
Once England international Roy and wicketkeeper Foakes had departed Surrey then lost Sam Curran (20) shortly afterwards to slump to 174-7.
Tom Curran rallied in a stand of 47 with Gareth Batty, but the Surrey captain was removed by Samit Patel before Bird returned to finish the Surrey innings, trapping Ravi Rampaul and Curran.
Newly-promoted Surrey, who took the option to bowl first without a toss on day one, will need improved returns from their batsmen to work their way back into the match on day three.
Notts fast bowler Jackson Bird told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"I felt I bowled inconsistently in the middle session. I leaked more runs than I would have liked, but I'll take four wickets.
"Last season was disappointing on a personal level not quite being 100 per cent fit. I've come off a good season in Australia and the body is feeling pretty good. I feel like I'm bowling as well as I have in the last few years.
"I've not seen much of Jake Ball, but he gets good pace and bounce. It's good to have someone at the other end who can build pressure. It helps to have partnerships.
"Surrey showed there was enough in the wicket if you got the ball in the right area, but they didn't do that for long enough. The scoreboard backs that up.
Surrey batsman Ben Foakes told BBC Radio London:
"Notts bowled really well. They just hammered away at a length and, with the overheads, it was swinging all day and nipping around, so that made it difficult for us.
"A lot of the guys applied themselves pretty well at the start, but then maybe a few things - the quality of the bowling or maybe a lapse in concentration - meant it didn't equate to a big score.
"You've got to value your wicket more (in Division One), but there were a lot of good balls knocking around and you've got to admit we were generally outplayed."
