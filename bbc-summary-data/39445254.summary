[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dora Strickland, 90, jumped from a window at Red Lodge, New Earswick near York, in 2011 and died in hospital.
The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust was convicted on Thursday of failing to have a proper risk assessment in place in relation to the home's windows.
In addition to the fine the trust was also ordered to pay £28,000 in costs.

The trust was cleared by a jury of a second charge of failing to protect the safety of residents.
It emerged during the trial at York Crown Court, that Mrs Strickland had informed staff she was depressed and wanted to take her own life just weeks before she jumped from the second floor window.
The trust said since 2011 it had implemented a "robust" risk assessment relating to windows in the care homes it managed and had fitted restrictors, which prevent windows from being opened fully.
