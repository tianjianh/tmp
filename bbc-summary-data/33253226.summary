Police said she died in a "tragic accident" on Llantwit Major beach, Vale of Glamorgan, on Thursday.
Her boyfriend Paul Biggs, 24, called her a "happy person" who "loved life".
He said Ms Le Fjord - who grew up in Salisbury, Wiltshire, but had been living in the area - was with her friend Martha Ormerod, 25, when the rock fell.
The pair had been celebrating Ms Le Fjord finishing her A-level maths exam by having a picnic.
She had been 18ft (5m) away from the cliffs when the rock hit her, Mr Biggs said.
He said: "She'd been having a lovely day.
"We've been there many times and never thought being there would be dangerous."
He said Ms Ormerod "did everything she could", including performing first aid, before the paramedics arrived.
She wrote him a letter to explain what had happened, Mr Biggs said.
South Wales Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.
