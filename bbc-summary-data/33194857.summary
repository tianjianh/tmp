[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Seven eurosceptic MPs from three parties have formed a group to act as a precursor to the Out campaign in the referendum on leaving the EU.

The "Exploratory committee for the EU referendum" includes former Tory cabinet minister Owen Paterson and UKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell.
The MPs say the group aims to "provide resources for crucial thinking".
David Cameron has said he wants a "better deal" for the UK in Europe ahead of an in/out referendum.
The exploratory committee for the EU referendum also includes Tories Steve Baker and Bernard Jenkin, as well as Labour's Kate Hoey, Kelvin Hopkins and Graham Stringer.
The committee also says it is "urgently" seeking to "promote co-operation amongst those who might contribute to an Out campaign".
According to the BBC's Robin Brant, sources say donors and professional campaigners are being approached.
David Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means:

What Britain wants from Europe
Timeline: EU referendum debate
David Cameron has said his negotiations to reform the UK's relationship with the EU are getting "a good response".
He has been holding bilateral talks with Irish PM Edna Kenny and European President Martin Schulz this week as he continues to press for changes in the EU, having previously held discussions with other European leaders.
The MPs' statement claims: "The prime minister... described the renegotiation in his Commons statement of 23 March as 'an opportunity to reform the EU and fundamentally change Britain's relationship with it'.
"However, there is little if any indication that the government is even asking for significant reform or fundamental change."
The statement also says legal issues arising from the Referendum Bill and "how an Out campaign might best be formed and run to inform the public about the issues" also require "urgent attention".
MPs recently overwhelmingly backed plans for a referendum, allowing the legislation to move to the next stage of its progress through Parliament. It still has several more stages to pass through, however.
