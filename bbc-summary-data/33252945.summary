The number of Chinese visitors to Oxfordshire has almost doubled in the last ten years, figures have shown.

Last year, there were about 14,000 visits, compared to 8,000 in 2005, when the county became an approved destination for Chinese citizens.
Their spending, including at Bicester Village outlet, has also increased from almost Â£8m to more than Â£20m, according to Visit Britain.
A further rise has been predicted for the next ten years.
Martin Walker, from not-for-profit group Experience Oxfordshire, said Chinese tourists were "increasingly important" to the county's economy.
However, he said, the UK was currently "underperforming" with about 290,000 visitors a year, compared to countries such as France, which gets 350,000.
A number of attractions and travel organisations in Oxfordshire had signed up to the Great China Welcome initiative in a bid to encourage more visitors, he said.
In 2013, consultancy company Spectrum Insights found Chinese tourists spend 90% of their budget on shopping during UK visits.
It said Bicester Village was the most popular shopping destination in the UK, with 27% of Chinese visitors naming it as their favourite.
Keith Slater, a former director of several UK retailers, said bosses had "deliberately set out to market to the Chinese and to promote it as a must-go place."
"It's actually marketed as Bicester Village London, so is seen as part of the capital," he said.
"It's the designer brands, like Burberry, which really attract the Chinese and they prefer to buy a UK brand in the UK."
