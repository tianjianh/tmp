It was a dog day afternoon at this year's Vauxhall Art Car Boot Fair in London, with canines at the centre of attention.

The event saw dozens of artists, including Tracey Emin, Gavin Turk and Bob and Roberta Smith (below with his son) turn up to sell their artwork at prices more commonly found at a car boot sale rather than a gallery.
Sir Peter Blake also pitched up a stall to sell his bargain-priced art and meet his fans.
This year's theme was "Year of the Dog", with artists creating doggy-inspired pieces. Duo Keeler Tornero painted dog portraits on old vinyl records.
Pop artist Marty Thornton created "doggy bags" - re-appropriating fake Louis Vuitton branded material into original artwork.
Many artists brought their dogs along to the event, including Paige Perkins whose dog Ismael approved of her work.
Artists also created artwork during the sale, including urban artist Pure Evil who customised models of his signature Pure Evil Bunny.
Ray Richardson (below left) and Simon Stephenson (below right) also created dog-inspired pieces for Art On a Postcard, with proceeds going to The Hepatitis C Trust.
Laura Cronin brought her needle felted miniature faux taxidermy to the fair. As well as dogs she brought a whole menagerie of other animals.
The Art Car Boot Fair will hold a second fair this summer at Turner Contemporary in Margate, on 30 August.
