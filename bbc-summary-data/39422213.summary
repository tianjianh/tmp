RSPCA reports rise in animal cruelty claims but fall in convictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RSPCA investigated more than 400 allegations of animal cruelty per day last year - a rise of nearly 5% compared to the previous 12 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The charity looked into 149,604 complaints compared to 143,004 in 2015, but the number of successful prosecutions fell more than 6% to 744.
It said the surge in complaints may be due to increased use of social media.
Prosecutions included snakes decapitated with scissors and a golden eagle kept in a cramped kitchen.
Hotspots for complaints in 2016 were London, with 11,812, and West Yorkshire, with 7,920.
The regions subject to the most successful prosecutions were West Yorkshire, with 94, followed by North Yorkshire with 50.
Dermot Murphy, of the RSPCA, said: "I believe the figures show that we're not becoming crueller, but that people are simply less willing to stand by and do nothing if they think an animal is suffering.
"People are increasingly likely to share images or footage on social media of animals they believe are not being cared for properly."
