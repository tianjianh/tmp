Shannon Foudy made it across the line on 24 April in her first marathon but officials needed two weeks to check all 38,000 runners' results.
The 39-year-old from Hemel Hempstead said: "I knew about the #oneinamillion campaign and it's unbelievable.
"It is the most worthwhile thing I have ever done."
In January 2010, Shannon gave birth at just 26 weeks and Catrin, who weighed only 2lb 5oz, battled through organ failure and a brain haemorrhage at the Luton & Dunstable Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

Shannon's daughter, now a thriving six year old, and her partner Jamie were in London watching and cheering along with members of her family.
"I ran to say thank you to the Luton & Dunstable NICU," said Shannon.
"Catrin, Jamie and my mum and dad were at the 14-mile mark so I stopped there for a few cuddles.
"Being surrounded by so many people running for great causes was amazing."
Shannon completed the 35th London Marathon in five hours 45 minutes and 18 seconds.
For finishing in the millionth place she receives a unique #oneinamillion t-shirt and a guaranteed place for the 2017 event.
A record number of 253,930 UK applicants have registered for a ballot place in the 2017 London Marathon, more than 6,000 up from the previous record in 2016.
