Dudley, 25, is the club's longest-serving player, while former Wales under-20 international Hardy, 21, joined the Championship club in 2016.
Centre George Eastwell, 23, lock Dave McKern, 27, and back row Max Argyle, 24, have also signed new deals.
"I think each of them has the potential to develop further," head coach Harvey Biljon told the club's website.
"We are developing the core of a strong squad, with more re-signings and some new faces to be added to the mix soon."
Jersey, who were an amateur side playing in the seventh tier 12 years ago, are fifth in the Championship, just one place outside the play-off positions.
On Saturday, they inflicted a first defeat of the season on top-of-the-table London Irish, winning 15-11 in front of a record crowd of 3,317 at St Peter for a second-tier game.
However, BBC Sport understands that Jersey would not seek promotion to the Premiership if they were to win the end of season play-offs.
Lock James Voss, 22, Tonga international forward Uili Kolo'ofa'i, 34, and 27-year-old former Rotherham and Sale Sharks centre Jordan Davies are already under contract for next season.
Also committed for 2017-18 are fly-half Brendan Cope, 23, prop Jake Woolmore, 26, and 21-year-old flanker Ayron Schramm.
