The elections watchdog has officially named Yes Scotland and Better Together the two main campaign groups ahead of the Scottish independence referendum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They will each be subject to a Â£1.5m spending limit and other rules in the run up to the vote, the Electoral Commission said.
They were designated as "lead campaigners" following an application process.
Voters in Scotland go to the polls in the referendum on 18 September.
They will be asked the Yes/No question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?"
Yes Scotland, the campaign group for independence, and Better Together, which backs the Union, will also have access to specific benefits during the regulated referendum period which runs from 30 May to 18 September.
These include a free delivery of campaign material to voters, referendum broadcasts and the use of public rooms.
Scottish Electoral Commissioner John McCormick, said: "Following careful consideration of their applications, the Electoral Commission has designated Yes Scotland and Better Together as lead campaigners for each side at the Scottish referendum.
"Both campaigners set out clearly how they will ensure their campaigns will reach voters across Scotland and we are grateful for the constructive way that they each engaged with the commission during the designation process."
Anyone intending to spend more than Â£10,000 during the referendum period is required to register with the Electoral Commission.
