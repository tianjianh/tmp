Pat Hickey: Former OCI president 'on way back to Republic of Ireland'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pat Hickey is reported to be on his way back to the Republic of Ireland after four months in Brazil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Monday, a judge gave the former Olympic Council of Ireland official the go ahead to leave the country.
Justice Marcello Rubioli ordered that Mr Hickey's passport be returned to him after it was confirmed that 1.5m Brazilian real (about Â£350,000) was lodged with the court.
Mr Hickey has stood aside as president of the Olympic Council of Ireland.
It follows an investigation into alleged mis-selling of tickets for the 2016 Games in Rio. Mr Hickey has denied all allegations made against him.
He was arrested in August and spent two weeks in Bangu Prison in Rio.
In September, Judge Juliana Leal de Melo from the Special Court for Supporters and Large Events, accepted charges against Mr Hickey and another Irishman, Kevin Mallon, that were forwarded by public prosecutor Marcus Kac.
They are among ten defendants charged with criminal organisation, ticket touting, ambush marketing, larceny, money laundering, and tax evasion.
Also charged with Mr Hickey and Mr Mallon are co-defendants Marcus Paul Evans, Michael Glynn, Ken Murray, Eamonn Collins, Maarten Van Os, David Patrick Gilmore, Martin Studd, and Barbara Zancope Carnieri.
The Olympic Council of Ireland will elect a new president to succeed Pat Hickey at an extraordinary general meeting on 9 February.
