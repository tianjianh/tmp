Retired probation officer David Ross has been told he has months to live as a result of lung cancer.
Unable to go to concerts, a friend of Mr Ross alerted Colchester's Roman River Music festival to his situation.
Organisers arranged for professional musicians to visit his home in the village of Great Bentley and play a number of pieces for Mr Ross, his family and friends.
He described the experience as "utterly wonderful".
