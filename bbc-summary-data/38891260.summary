The force said 300 officers carried out 14 simultaneous warrants in Newport at 05:00 GMT on Tuesday, after three hours of briefings.
Four people have been charged with the supply of class A drugs, with 25 arrested in total.
It followed information from the community about the supply of drugs.
Ch Insp Matthew Williams said the force had noticed a rise in Newport the last year or so.

"[The operation] involved specialist method of entry officers utilising chainsaws and drills to ensure rapid entry."
