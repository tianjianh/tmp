[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Newsweek reported earlier this week that Mr Trump's company secretly conducted business with the island nation, breaching decades of US policy.
Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts allegedly spent at least $68,000 (Â£52,300) in Cuba in 1998, violating the embargo.
Mr Trump criticised the journalist, saying: "No I never did anything in Cuba. I never did a deal in Cuba."
Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had said on Thursday that Mr Trump appeared to have violated US laws, saying he had put "his personal and business interests ahead of the laws and values and the policies of the United States of America".
Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator from Florida who has endorsed Mr Trump, had also said the Trump campaign should respond the Newsweek allegation, saying he was "deeply concerned" about the accusation.

Who won the debate?
Newsweek's front-page - citing company records, interviews with former Trump executives and court filings - alleges that Mr Trump's company, then called Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, sent a consulting firm to Havana on its behalf in search of business opportunities.
Newsweek says Mr Trump's senior officers disguised the cash by making it appear that the trip was connected to a Catholic charity.
If the consulting firm spent US money during the visit, without permission from the US government, it would have directly violated the Cuban embargo, which remains in place to this day despite a warming in US-Cuba ties.
Speaking on ABC earlier on Thursday, Ms Conway said an initial payment was made: "As I understand from the story, they paid money in 1998." Later in the same interview, she said no further deal was pursued: "Did his hotel invest in 1998 in Cuba? No."
On Thursday night, Mr Trump responded to the allegations to the NH1.com website, and criticised the Newsweek journalist, Kurt Eichenwald.
"No. I never did business in Cuba," he said before a rally in New Hampshire on Thursday. "There's this guy who has very bad reputation as a reporter. You see what his record is. He wrote something about me in Cuba. No I never did anything in Cuba. I never did a deal in Cuba. I heard about it last night for the first time."
In a 1999 column in The Miami Herald, Mr Trump wrote that he had snubbed chances to do business in Cuba. "It would place me directly at odds with the longstanding US policy of isolating Fidel Castro. I had a choice to make: huge profits or human rights. For me, it was a no-brainer."
