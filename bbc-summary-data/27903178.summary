A £20,000 reward is being offered by festival organisers to help catch the man responsible for the death of Robert Hart at Manchester's Parklife Festival.

Mr Hart, 26, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, was attacked when an argument escalated after he was hit with an inflatable doll at the event in Heaton Park on 7 June.
He died four days later in hospital.
Parklife organisers said they were offering the reward to catch who was responsible for "a cowardly act".
"From the start we believed that, out of the 70,000 people at the festival, there must have been one person who knows who was responsible," they said.
Police said the reward was offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the man responsible.
Det Insp Richard Eales said they were "carrying out a thorough and significant investigation".
He said: "It is very unlikely that this man went to a festival on his own.
"Someone out there was with this man when the attack happened, or knows something that will help us identify him.
"Please do not shield this man with your silence, he does not deserve the protection."
Greater Manchester Police have issued an e-fit of a man they want to speak to.
He is described as of mixed-race, with a muscular build, in his late 20s, 6ft (1.8m) tall, with short, curly, black hair.
He was wearing shorts and a blue, bomber-style jacket with a white letter A on the front.
