Casper won the US Open in 1959 and 1966 and the Masters in 1970, and claimed 51 PGA Tour titles between 1956 and 1975.
The PGA Tour said Casper suffered a heart attack and died at his home in Springview, Utah, on Saturday.
Jack Nicklaus was among those to pay tribute and said of the "underrated" Casper: "Those who did compete against him knew how special he was."
Nicklaus, 75, who won a record 18 major titles in his career, added: "When I looked up at a leaderboard, I wasn't just looking to see where a Palmer or a Player or a Trevino was. I was also checking to see where Billy Casper was."
Gary Player also paid tribute to his former rival, saying: "I played a lot with Billy, and I always thought Billy had a wonderful short game.
"He was always a thorough gentleman."
Casper was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1978 and sits seventh on the PGA Tour's all-time victories list.
