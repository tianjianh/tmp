The RSPCA is working with their owners to help bring six further horses safely from the flooded farm.
A group of volunteers has brought hay and fresh water for the horses and provided blankets to keep them warm.
The area's known for flooding and the RSPCA has told the horses' owners to think twice before letting the animals onto the land again.
Lee Hopgood, chief inspector with the RSPCA, said: "They moved in three weeks before the floods started.
"I don't think they were particularly well briefed by the people who rented the land to them but I have said to them they should have done the research before moving 60 horses on to this farm."
