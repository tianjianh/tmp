Back-row Sam, 22, played with fly-half Joe, 20, for the first time in the Premiership in Exeter's victory at Leicester on 3 March.
"It's good to have your brother there beside you, to tell you what you need to do," Sam told BBC Spotlight.
"Lining up before we run out, we give each other a little look and just say 'look what we're doing, it's proud'."
Sam Simmonds, who has spent time on loan with Championship side Cornish Pirates, added: "It's not so much a rivalry - there's a bit of banter here and there but we're just pushing each other really."
The siblings both start for Exeter on Sunday in their Anglo-Welsh Cup semi-final against Harlequins at Sandy Park.
Joe only made his first Premiership start on 25 February, kicking 11 points in the Devon side's win over Newcastle.
"It was brilliant," he said. "I was looking at the teamsheet when it came out - I kept checking it to make sure it was my name."
Both brothers played football until their teenage years, with Sam the first to join Exeter.
"When he got signed up here it just drove me even more, because I didn't want to be left behind," Joe added.
"It's been massive playing together - after the game, especially with our family, it's a great achievement for us both.
"I would say I'm the better footballer - I've got the kicking skills and he's like my dad, he's a back row, so I think I'm more skilful than him at the moment."
