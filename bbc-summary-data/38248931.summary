[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-football coach Jim McCafferty in court on child sex charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Celtic FC youth coach has appeared in a court in Belfast charged with sexual activity with a child.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jim McCafferty, 70, from Raby Street, south Belfast, is accused of offences alleged to have taken place between 2011 and 2014, when the alleged victim was between 13 and 16 years old.
Mr McCafferty is originally from Scotland.
A defence solicitor said he would not apply for bail because of concerns over the defendant's safety.
The judge remanded Mr McCafferty back into custody. He will appear in court again in January.
The defendant worked for several football clubs during the 1980s and 90s as a scout, kitman and youth coach.
The clubs included Celtic, Hibernian and Falkirk.
Mr McCafferty moved to Northern Ireland seven years ago.
