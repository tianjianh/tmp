Left-back Garmston, 23, is on his third injury lay-off of the season and has not played for almost four weeks.
"His parents know somebody over there and they want him to have some tests with the best in the world," Gills boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Kent.
"His parents are paying for it. We all want to do everything we can because he's a talented boy."
Garmston has been restricted to just 285 minutes of action this season and only made his first League One start of the campaign last month, before his latest injury.
Now the former West Bromwich Albion trainee, and Republic of Ireland Under-21 international, has sought out expert advice to get him back on the pitch.
Pennock added: "His dad's a physio and he spoke to our physio here and asked the question - we said of course, if it helps him.
"Fingers crossed that they find out the cause of all these injuries to his hamstrings."
