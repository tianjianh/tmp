The win moves Britain up to third in the table, five points behind leaders and host nation South Korea, who play North Korea later on Thursday.
If South Korea win, Britain will secure a bronze medal with victory over fifth-placed Australia on Saturday.
"This was a great performance and I am really pleased for the girls," head coach Cheryl Smith said.
"There were so many excellent performances all over the ice and they have much to be proud of.
"Of course, there are things we can do better but the girls deserve this victory."
