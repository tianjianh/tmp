Dutee Chand: Indian sprinter starts appeal against hormone test ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Indian sprinter Dutee Chand has started an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) against her indefinite ban from competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chand, 19, has not been allowed to compete since last summer after failing a hormone test.
The test revealed her body produced natural levels of testosterone above International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) guidelines.
Her legal team will argue the ruling is discriminatory and flawed.
There is currently no similar assessment for male athletes.
The landmark case against the IAAF and Athletics Federation of India started on Monday at Cas in Lausanne, Switzerland, and is expected to last up to four days.
A final judgement could take weeks or even months.
Chand was forced to miss the Commonwealth Games and Asia Games after failing the controversial test but refused medical treatment to help make her eligible.
Her appeal is the first to challenge the "hyperandrogenism" rules the IAAF introduced in the wake of the Caster Semenya affair in 2009.
South African teenager Semenya was asked to take a so-called "gender test" shortly before winning the 800m at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin.
Subjected to enormous media scrutiny, Semenya subsequently returned to the sport, winning an Olympic silver medal at London 2012.
