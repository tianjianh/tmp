Transcripts of Mr Rigby's police interviews conducted shortly after Ayeeshia's death in May 2014 were read out to the jury.
When asked if he had deliberately caused the toddler's injuries he replied: "How dare you?
"She's not even my child, I've never raised a hand to her."
Mr Rigby said Ayeeshia had an undiagnosed milk intolerance which meant she could have lacked calcium in her bones.
He said he may have caused injuries carrying out CPR on the laminate floor of the front room.
"Her ribs would have been like paper," he said.
When officers suggested the child may have been stamped to death, Rigby replied: "How can you state that opinion?
"You say it's not (caused by) CPR but I'll tell you until I'm blue in the face that it is."
Mr Rigby said his relationship with Ayeesha's mother, was "brilliant", describing how they met in a block of flats in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, where a friend lived.
He added: "We're a family. Families stick together."
Asked if Ms Smith might have inflicted the injuries on her daughter, Mr Rigby replied: "I couldn't physically sleep next to a woman capable of that."
Ms Smith, of Sandfield Road, Nottingham and Mr Rigby, of Sloan Drive, Nottingham have also pleaded not guilty to allowing or causing a child's death and child cruelty.
The trial continues.
