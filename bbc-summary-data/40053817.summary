Celtic treble winners: Pick your combined XI from 2000-01 and 2016-17

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic beat Aberdeen 2-1 in a dramatic Scottish Cup final at Hampden on Saturday to complete their fourth domestic treble.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Manager Brendan Rodgers repeated the feat of Martin O'Neill by securing a clean sweep in his first season in charge of Celtic, although Rodgers' charges did the treble without losing a domestic match.
O'Neill's team of 2000-2001 boasted stars such as Henrik Larsson and Lubo Moravcik, while players such as Scott Brown and Scott Sinclair have stood out for Rodgers' side.
So if you could pick a starting line-up from both treble-winning squads, who would make the grade?
