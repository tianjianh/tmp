No U-turn from chancellor on tax decision, says Tory MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Tory MP backing plans to devolve some income tax powers to Wales without a referendum has said he does not expect the chancellor to reverse his decision.

BBC Wales revealed five Welsh Tory MPs have urged George Osborne to reverse the announcement, made in November.
They said the policy change was "disrespectful" and breached the Conservatives' 2015 election manifesto.
But Cardiff North MP Craig Williams said there was no "big row" and AMs needed "some fiscal responsibility".
Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said devolving income tax powers would mean "better government for Wales".
Some of the MPs opposed to the move hope to raise the issue at a meeting with Mr Osborne on Wednesday.
The five - Byron Davies, Chris Davies, David Davies, James Davies and David Jones - have written to him on the issue
"This is a line in the sand for many of us," one MP said.
Another said it would be "very embarrassing" for the Conservative UK government if almost half of the party's 11 Welsh MPs were to vote against the measure.
The letter said that during the general election campaign Tory candidates "were able to reassure people that the assembly would not get tax raising powers without the consent of the people of Wales".
"To drop the commitment to a referendum would put us in breach of a clear manifesto commitment," it continued.
The Welsh Conservative manifesto for the 2015 general election made reference to an "expectation that the Welsh government will hold a referendum on income tax powers".
The five MPs said people in Wales should not be "treated differently in this respect from the people of Scotland, who did have a separate vote on the issue of tax varying powers" in the 1997 referendum on devolution.
"We frankly feel that to impose such powers without a referendum would be disrespectful to the Welsh people," they added.
Mr Williams responded: "You're going to have cases with business rates being devolved to areas like Manchester, where Manchester City Council might have more fiscal responsibility than the entire Welsh nation," Mr Williams said.
"It's about time they [the assembly] had some responsibility for income of money as well as spending it on their pet projects."
In December, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said he thought public opinion was "fluid" on the matter, but there were "very, very strong reasons for why we need to press ahead" for Wales and the Welsh economy to get stronger.
Splits within the Welsh Conservative group in Cardiff Bay on the devolution of income tax led to the party's leader Andrew RT Davies sacking four members of his front bench team in February 2014.
They were re-instated in the summer.
Mr Davies said he would use income tax powers to take 5p off the higher rate and 1p off the basic rate in Wales if he was first minister.
A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said: "The position of the UK government and chancellor is very clear on this matter and we have long called for the Welsh government to be more accountable for the money it raises and spends."
A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: "This latest development shows the Tories' true colours when it comes to empowering Wales.
"They support transferring substantial powers, including policing, to English cities without a referendum and yet are trying to block Wales having powers over small proportion of income tax which could be of benefit to the Welsh economy."
