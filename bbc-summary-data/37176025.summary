[SN]TITLE[SN]
OCI: Justice Carroll Moran to head Irish Olympic tickets inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Retired judge Carroll Moran has been appointed to lead the Irish government's inquiry into the Irish Olympic ticket controversy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pat Hickey, the former president of the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) was arrested in Rio De Janeiro last week by police investigating alleged illegal Olympic ticket sales
Mr Hickey has not been charged and has denied any wrongdoing.
The non-statutory inquiry's work should be completed in 12 weeks.
The investigation will look at how the OCI handled ticket allocations and accreditations at the Rio Olympics, the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi and the 2012 London Olympics.
The inquiry is to establish the procedures relevant to the receipt, distribution and sale of tickets allocated by the International Olympic Committee to national Olympic committees as well as accreditations given by national Olympic committees.
It will also examine the government funding of the OCI and its corporate governance.
The OCI said it welcomed the appointment of the retired judge and said that it intends to co-operate fully with the inquiry.
The Irish Minister for Agriculture, Michael Creed, said that if there was a situation where anyone was dragging their feet and not co-operating, the government could establish a statutory inquiry.
This would mean that witnesses could be compelled to give evidence.
Mr Creed said the facts must be established because the controversy had taken from the achievements of Irish athletes and had tarnished the country's reputation.
