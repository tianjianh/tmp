The canines were given the K-9 Medal of Courage, and are the first to receive the honour created by welfare group the American Humane Association.
The medals were presented by top commanders at a ceremony at Capitol Hill in Washington.
All four dogs had saved humans' lives by smelling out explosives.
"Soldiers have been relying on these four-footed comrades-in-arms since the beginning of organised warfare and today military dogs are more important than ever in keeping our service men and women safe," said Robin Ganzert from the American Humane Association, which works to promote animal and child welfare and has been working with US military animals for 100 years.
