A dog attack in Denbighshire which left three sheep and 21 lambs dead has been described as "horrific" by police.

A dozen of the lambs are missing and believed to have drowned in a river at St Asaph trying to escape, according to Sgt Rob Taylor, wildlife officer for North Wales Police.
The incident follows the deaths of three sheep in an attack last week.
Sgt Taylor said a pet dog from homes nearby could be roaming free and carrying out the attacks.
He said people often believed such incidents happened in full view of a dog's owner but evidence showed that, in some instances, they were not being kept secured at home and went on to commit acts which could leave their owners in court.
"It's an horrific crime," he said, given that the dogs can leave a "gruesome" scene after such an attack.
He has taken to Twitter to urge dog owners to be aware of the issue, saying: "This dog will attack sheep again if not found soon."
