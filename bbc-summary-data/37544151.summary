The 35-year-old was a free agent after leaving National League club Tranmere Rovers in the summer.
"He will be a welcome addition to the squad at a time when we have a number of players missing with injuries and suspensions," said boss John Coleman.
Taylor-Fletcher could make his debut in Tuesday's Checkatrade Trophy game at Chesterfield, subject to EFL approval.
