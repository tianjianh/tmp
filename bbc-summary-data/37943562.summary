[SN]TITLE[SN]
Orkney Islands Council staff reject pay plans in ballot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The prospect of industrial action by some Orkney Islands Council staff has taken a step closer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the GMB union have voted overwhelmingly to reject proposals for changes to the terms and conditions for frontline staff.
More than 98% of ballot papers returned opposed the council's proposals after a three-week consultative ballot.
The council has said no decisions have yet been made on the options, which are still at the consultation stage.
The union has described the plans as ''unacceptable, unfair and unsustainable''. The vote opens the way for a second ballot on whether to take industrial action.
