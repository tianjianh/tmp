The 20-year-old left-back will join the Gunners on a deal worth Â£40,000.
Liam McDonald signed Bramall for the Northern Premier League side and believes he could follow the path of Leicester striker Jamie Vardy, who also started out in non-league.
"He's a natural athlete and he's got a great opportunity to develop that now," McDonald told BBC Radio 5 live.
"He'll take it in his stride. I'm very positive he'll have a similar impact to Jamie Vardy."
Bramall follows the road taken by Everton and Wales defender Ashley Williams, who started his career at the Staffordshire club.
Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday had both reportedly watched Bramall, but only Arsenal agreed terms.
He travelled to Arsenal's London Colney training ground on Thursday with his agent Dan Chapman, following an initial period on trial.
Bramall, from the South Cheshire area, worked full-time in the Bentley car factory in Crewe until being made redundant, before working in a clothes shop.
He spent a short spell at nearby Nantwich Town before joining the Pitmen.
"It's fantastic to see players go through like this," Nantwich director of football Jon Gold told BBC Radio Stoke.
"He was obviously a great talent when he first came to us but the manager at the time was going with older players. That happens. Jamie Vardy was turned down by many clubs, don't forget, including even Crewe.
"Cohen's a lovely lad. I'm not sure he was taking his football that seriously and he went around the area a bit before moving on to Hednesford, but sometimes it can take time.
"He played against us earlier in the season and he was man of the match. We're proud to have played even a little part in his development."
