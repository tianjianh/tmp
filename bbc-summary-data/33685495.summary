A kite chick which broke its beak after growing too big inside its egg, has undergone reconstructive surgery.

The yellow-billed kite chick, named Beaky, underwent surgery on his lower beak just nine days after hatching.
The hatchling's beak was left deformed and pointing towards the floor, after it was bent up against the side of his egg's shell during incubation.
Wiltshire vets said he was flourishing and expected to live a normal quality of life, for up to 25 years.
The chick hatched at the International Centre for Birds of Prey (ICBP) in Newent, Gloucestershire.
Neil Forbes, from Vets Now Referrals in Swindon, said breaking and resetting the jaw on such a young bird had been "challenging and complex".
He said: "I'm absolutely thrilled. We've essentially taken a chick that stood no chance of survival and given him another chance."
Holly Cale, from ICBP, said Beaky had "recovered amazingly well".
She said: "We're so delighted it was such a success and, despite everything, he is now thriving."
Beaky will remain at the ICBP before being transported to Belgium to form part of a new demonstration team.
