They will be published by Esquire magazine on Friday and submitted to a scientific journal.
Froome, 30, chose to share the data because he wants to prove that people can "trust" his achievements.
The Briton was spat at by some spectators during this year's Tour following media claims of doping.
Pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline performed the tests in its human performance laboratory.
Froome, who won the Tour this year and in 2013, wanted to determine the characteristics which make him an exceptional athlete.
Team Sky manager Sir Dave Brailsford said: "There are opportunities to do what we can to make the unbelievable believable.
"I think the independence thing is a good thing. And why not? I can't see the negative in it.
"There's a lot of talk about transparency these days, trying to have a leadership role. He's won the Tour twice, we should make the effort."
