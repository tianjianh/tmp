The Volkswagen Passat was spotted in the water at Penmaenmawr on Saturday evening and North Wales Police said the driver suffered minor injuries.
Bangor Coastguard also attended, but was stood down as nobody was in the car and it was not causing pollution.
A recovery firm attended on Sunday to remove the car, which was stuck on rocks.
Aled Thomas, general manager of Moduron Maethlu Motors Ltd, said: "The tide had carried the vehicle away from the slipway and we could only see the roof bobbing about when we got there.
"I waded out to the car and secured a line to stop it dragging further down the beach.
"We then waited for the tide to go out far enough for our Land Rover to go onto the beach.
"The car was stuck on a rock bed so we then cleared large stones out of the way to a point we could winch it out."
He also thanked onlookers who gave information about the tides and sand.
