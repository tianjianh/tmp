The local authority's cabinet gave the go-ahead for the facility that will cater for youngsters aged three to 19.
It will include a revamped library, community cinema and sporting facilities.
It is also hoped it will be a catalyst for attracting further investment, such as in a proposed international standard 3G playing field.
