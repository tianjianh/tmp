Walters, 32, sat out training on Wednesday having limped out of Monday's opening draw against Sweden as his recent Achilles problem returned.
The Republic face Belgium in their next Group E game in Bordeaux on Saturday and play Italy in Lille on 22 June.
"He thinks he is going to be able to make the Italian game," O'Neill said.
Walters, the current Republic player of the year, was the only absentee from Wednesday morning's session at the squad's training base in Versailles.
When asked afterwards if Walters had a chance of playing against Belgium, O'Neill admitted: "he is going to be struggling".
"If the game was tomorrow, he wouldn't make it.
"There would have to be a lot of improvement for him to make it.
"We can play without Jon.
"He's been influential in our games, he has probably been our talisman, but if he's not fit we've got a number of players who can step in and do really well for us."
Walters was replaced by James McClean in the 63rd minute, who would be the obvious choice to come into the starting line-up in Bordeaux, if the Stoke City man is ruled out.

O'Neill was upbeat about the team's prospects against Belgium, ranked number two in the world, in the wake of an encouraging performance against Sweden in the Stade de France.
Wes Hoolahan's opener for the Irish was cancelled out by a Ciaran Clark own goal but the manager has taken the positives from the 1-1 draw.
"If that performance doesn't lift you, nothing will.
"We will have to show the same attitude again, go and compete and be strong on the ball."
