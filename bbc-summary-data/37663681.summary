[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grimsby Town 0-1 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Billy Waters' first-half goal was enough to give Cheltenham a hard-fought 1-0 win at Grimsby.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The forward struck after some smart work from a free-kick to give Gary Johnson's side just their third victory of the season in League Two.
Grimsby made a bright start as Omar Bogle and Dominic Vose went close to giving the hosts the lead inside the first five minutes.
But it was Cheltenham who took the lead as a well-worked free-kick was played to James Dayton on the edge of the box and he laid the ball on to Waters to slot home.
Bogle had a glorious opportunity to bring the hosts level in the second half as the ball fell to him just a few yards away from goal but, not for the first time, he found Robins goalkeeper Russell Griffiths in his way just as he got his shot away.
But Cheltenham held on to their lead well as they frustrated their hosts, and claimed a third win in a row against their former National League rivals.
