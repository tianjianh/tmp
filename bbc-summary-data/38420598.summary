Newport County: Rodney Parade capacity reduced after seats damaged

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County have been forced to reduce the away allocation for their next two home games after 195 seats were damaged during their FA Cup replay defeat by Plymouth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pilgrims fans celebrating caused the floor to give way in the stand behind one goal, leaving broken seats.
Newport have called in engineers but do not expect the work to be completed until the new year.
Home ties against Portsmouth and Exeter will be affected.
A Newport club statement said: "Due to damage in the south stand at Rodney Parade we have had to reduce capacity for both the forthcoming visits of Portsmouth and Exeter.
"The decision has been taken on safety grounds due to the nature of the damage caused.
"The away capacity due to the damage means the away capacity has been reduced by 195.
"We are working to repair the damage with our provider but given the time of year it is unlikely work required will be completed before New Year's Eve.
"We would like to thank Portsmouth FC and Exeter City FC for their help and understanding."
