The 29-year-old man, from the Bury St Edmunds area, died on 24 December.
He had been arrested on suspicion of theft from the Tesco store in Fordham Road, Newmarket, at about 18:00 GMT.
The man was taken to Bury St Edmunds Police Investigation Centre but then transferred to West Suffolk Hospital. Police said an investigation was under way.
The matter had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), a police spokesman added.
An IPCC spokesman said: "The IPCC is in the process of reviewing CCTV evidence and speaking with anyone who had contact with the man or who may have witnessed the incident.
"The man's next of kin have been informed and are being offered support at this difficult time.
"Investigators would like to speak to anyone who witnessed the man interacting with store staff prior to police arrival and his subsequent arrest outside Tesco, in Fordham Road, Newmarket."
