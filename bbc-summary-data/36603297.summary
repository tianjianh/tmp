Euro 2016: Michael O'Neill happy Northern Ireland will face Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Michael O'Neill believes results elsewhere have put Northern Ireland on the 'favourable' side of the draw in the last 16 of Euro 2016.

Northern Ireland will play Wales in Paris on Saturday after advancing as one of the best third-placed teams.
"It is going to be a fantastic game," said O'Neill.
"The results [on Wednesday] put us in what is arguably the more favourable side of the draw, so we are pleased about that."
Tournament hosts France, World Cup champions Germany, reigning European champions Spain, Italy and England are all on the other half of the draw.
Northern Ireland and Wales, neither of whom had previously qualified for a European Championship finals, will play in the Parc des Princes on Sunday - the venue of Northern Ireland's 1-0 defeat by Germany on Tuesday.
"[It] is a brilliant stadium," O'Neill said.
"We will benefit from the familiarity of having been there already, of having done the journey and of having played on the pitch.
"We are in no doubt that it is going to be a tough game against Wales but we will go into the match believing that we can win and that we can progress."
Manager Chris Coleman says Wales will be prepared for Northern Ireland's physical approach when they meet in the last 16 of Euro 2016 on Saturday.
Michael O'Neill's men had already reached the knockout stage as one of the best third-placed teams, but needed the Republic of Ireland's 1-0 win over Italy to confirm it would be they and not Turkey playing Wales next.
"Northern Ireland are more physical than Turkey," said Coleman. "They get the ball forward quicker - that's where their strength is."
Coleman added: "They are superbly organised and defensively so difficult to break down. They are excellent from set-plays."
