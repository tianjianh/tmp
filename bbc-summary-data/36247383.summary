Edward Wood, 50, was attacked and "left to die" by a group of people on Railway Road in Leigh on Wednesday.
He had items stolen from him before he was taken to hospital, where he later died, Greater Manchester Police added.
Four men - aged 28, 31, 38 and 46 - have been arrested in connection with Mr Wood's death and released on bail.
His family said they are "shocked and deeply saddened" by the "tragic and meaningless loss of Edward" in a "mindless attack".
"Edward was a dad of two, Ryan and Daniel, and had just learned he was to be a grandad later this year and was really looking forward to it.
"This news had given him a new spring in his step and he was excited about the future."
The family said he was "a much loved son, dad, brother and uncle" who had "a special bond with his mother Lois with whom he spent a great deal of time."
Police are continuing to appeal for information about the attack which happened at about 23:00 BST close to the Oceans Eleven chip shop.
Det Ch Insp Jane Little said: "Edward's death has left his family absolutely devastated... This was an innocent man who was not causing anyone any problems and was attacked and left to die in the street.
"Leigh is quite a tight-knit area and we believe that the answers may lie within the local community."
