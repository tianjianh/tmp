Sarah Outen, from Rutland, had been travelling around the world using only a kayak, bike and rowing boat.
But she was forced to abandon her craft Happy Socks after 143 days at sea because of worsening weather conditions and hurricane Joaquin.
She is now aboard the Federal Oshima which will reach Montreal in a week.
The 30-year-old had been expected to reach the UK in September after setting off from Cape Cod in May but strong winds slowed her progress.
On Saturday it was announced she had taken the decision to seek help after winds of up to 60 knots (69mph), large waves and two low pressure system predicted to hit in the coming days.
Close to tears in a recording for her website, Ms Outen said: "In the next few hours I'm going to get a call from passing ships to say they are coming to pick me up.
"That's right. I'm getting off this ocean... because we have a hurricane forecast heading this way next week.
"With conditions more severe than those that led to me being rescued from the north Pacific, it felt like there wasn't really much of a choice."
She added that she shed "lots of tears" at the thought she might have to abandon her trusty boat but was smiling at the amazing memories.
Since recording the message she was rescued by the cargo ship which is en route to Canada but Happy Socks had to be left behind.
Ms Outen was the first woman to row solo across the North Pacific in 2013 having previously failed in an attempt because of a tropical storm.
