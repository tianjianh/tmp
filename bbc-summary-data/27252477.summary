D-Day: Your memories of Operation Overlord

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is the 70th anniversary of D-Day in June. We want to hear your recollections from the time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After much of Europe had been occupied by the Axis powers for four years, the Allies launched their campaign to liberate Western Europe on 6 June 1944.
Over three million service personnel were involved and it all hinged on the success of the Normandy Landings on D-Day.
Originally planned to take place on 1 May 1944, the operation, codenamed Operation Overlord was postponed a month to allow time to gather more troops and equipment.
The invasion of Normandy was the largest amphibious assault ever launched. It involved five army divisions in the initial assault and over 7,000 ships and 11,000 aircraft.
Were you involved in some way in the Normandy landings? Do you have family who were involved in the action, or the build up to that day? Will you be doing anything to mark the anniversary?
We want your stories - and pictures if you have them - to feature as part of BBC News coverage on the anniversary. Get in touch by emailing us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk using the subject line "D Day". Remember to include a phone number if you are happy to be contacted.
