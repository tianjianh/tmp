Media watchdog Ofcom is investigating ITV's This Morning over complaints that a segment about bondage was unsuitable to be broadcast before the watershed.

In the item on 3 February hosts Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley looked at bondage equipment and sex toys with "sex expert" Annabelle Knight.
Ofcom said it received 120 complaints about the item, which was inspired by the film Fifty Shades of Grey.
Product demonstrations with scantily clad models featured in the piece.
A "Bondage for Beginners" segment examined products including an eye mask, a "feather spanker" and a crystal-encrusted vibrator.
ITV said it would be responding to Ofcom. "This Morning is a lifestyle programme that covers a diverse range of human interest topics," said a spokesperson for the show, which is broadcast at 10:30 on weekdays.
"The programme has dealt with advice on sexual matters many times in the past, and a suitable announcement was given at the start.
"Many of our items spark debate and we welcome feedback from our viewers about our content."
The regulator is also investigating a scene on ITV's Emmerdale involving a character being sexually assaulted, which drew 47 complaints following its broadcast on Thursday.
