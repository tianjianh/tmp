The game is part of a six-day training camp in north Wales before the squad fly to the southern hemisphere to play Tonga on 17 June and Samoa on 24 June.
Ospreys wing Keelan Giles is one of five uncapped players in the side.
Cardiff Blues' Seb Davies starts at blindside flanker, while Newport Gwent Dragons' Ollie Griffiths is number eight.
Ospreys second row Adam Beard and Scarlets scrum-half Aled Davies are the other uncapped players in the team.
International caps will not be awarded for Friday's fixture at Parc Eirias.
Wales are without 12 leading players - including captain Alun Wyn Jones - who will tour with the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand.
With Warren Gatland as Lions boss and Rob Howley an assistant, regular forwards coach Robin McBryde will be in charge of Wales for the two Tests.
"Friday night's match will give us a perfect chance to give certain players an opportunity and see new combinations working together ahead of the tour," said McBryde.
"Some players need to prove fitness and form and this week's training camp, along with the match is the ideal opportunity to do that."
Wales will be up against an RGC side which won the WRU National Cup and reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Premiership Tier One play-offs.
"It's something nice at the end of the season," said RGC coach Mark Jones, the former Scarlets and Wales wing.
"We wanted to try and help Wales out with their preparations for their tour.
"Robin was keen to try and get a little hit out before they travel and looking at us and how we've been doing he felt we'd provide good opposition for them
"I jumped at the opportunity for our players to be exposed to that level of competition and measure themselves against the best in Wales."
