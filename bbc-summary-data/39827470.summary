Winger Louis Longridge should be back from a thigh knock which kept him out of last week's Scottish Premiership defeat by fellow  strugglers Inverness.
Well boss Stephen Robinson hopes Steven Hammell will be fit to play.
The left-back had to limp off last week against Ross County after suffering a burst blood vein in his leg but returned to light training on Thursday.
Young goalkeeper Russell Griffiths is set to continue in goal after Craig Samson was dropped for the Staggies defeat, while Stephen Pearson (groin) is also likely to miss out again, as will Jacob Blyth (ankle), Ross MacLean (shoulder), Stephen McManus, Richard Tait (both groin) and Jack McMillan (wrist).
The Lanarkshire rivals are locked on 32 points apiece, with Motherwell's poorer goal difference consigning them to the relegation play-off spot as things stand.
Both sides have suffered damaging defeats to bottom six counterparts in their past two matches - Well lost to Dundee, then Ross County, while Hamilton were Kilmarnock, then Inverness.
Motherwell striker Louis Moult: "We need to win the game - simple as. Every game now is massive and it has been all season.
"If we can keep a clean sheet, we're fairly confident we're going to score in the game. If we can try and be solid at the back, and then get a few goals, I think that's where we're strong.
"People have been saying we're too good to go down all season - it's all well and good having a good squad but you need to perform on a Saturday, and that's what we haven't been doing. I believe we can do it, everyone at the club believes we can do it, it's just up to us now.
"The boys are really, really eager to get out there and put things right."
Hamilton Academical midfielder Danny Redmond: "It is going to be massive. It is one of the biggest derbies I have played in up here.
"We know it is still in our hands, we have got three massive games and obviously we need to pick up as many points as we can. But they are going to be very tough as they are all fighting for points as well.
"As a footballer you want to stay at the highest level you can, so obviously staying in the Premiership will mean a whole lot to us, individually and as a club.
"We talk about it most days and we are good enough and we are capable of staying up.
"There is a group of experienced players in our dressing room, we know what it means and none of us want to be in that position to be relegated."
