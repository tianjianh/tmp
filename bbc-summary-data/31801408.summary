Surrey Police has released footage on YouTube after driver Grzegorz Musial, of south London, was jailed over the incident.
The victim's ordeal began when uninsured Musial clipped his wing mirror in a car park in Camberley.
After saying he would call police, the victim was hit by Musial, who then drove off with him on the bonnet.
The footage, captured from the dashboard of a lorry, shows the victim hanging on as the car was driven along the A331.
Officers said the man was finally thrown on to the road and suffered serious ankle injuries, a broken nose and numerous cuts and bruises, last October.
Musial, of West Barnes Lane, New Malden, drove off but later called police to report he feared he had hurt someone, the force said.
He admitted causing GBH, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and failing to stop at the scene of an accident, at Guildford Crown Court.
He was jailed last week for 14 months and banned from driving for 18 months.
Det Sgt Yahya Aslam said it was a "terrifying ordeal for the victim who ended up literally clinging on for his life".
