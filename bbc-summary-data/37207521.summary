Fowler sank a four-foot birdie putt on the final hole at Bethpage Black, while Australia's Adam Scott was the big mover with a 65 to go seven under.
Scotland's Martin Laird is three shots off the pace after a 69, with Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy two under (71).
Olympic gold medallist Justin Rose of England is level par after a 70.
"It's nice to finally see some putts go in," Fowler said after a bogey-free round.
"With a few putts going in, it frees up the rest of your game. I've been swinging well for a long time, and I've been waiting for the putter to catch up."
The Barclays is the first of four FedEx Cup play-off events, with the overall winner earning $10m (Â£7.6m).
