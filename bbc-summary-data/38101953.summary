The Trafford Council leader was selected ahead of Stephen Woods, chairman of Wythenshawe & Sale East Conservatives, on Thursday.
The 29-year-old tweeted he was "so proud", adding: "Our city is on the verge of something special".
All the main parties have chosen their candidates for the 4 May election.
Mr Anstee is the youngest council leader in the region. He was elected as a councillor for Bowdon in 2008, and became Trafford Council leader in 2014.
Leigh MP and former shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham was chosen as Labour's candidate last August, while Trafford councillor Jane Brophy will represent the Liberal Democrats.
Deyika Nzeribe is the Green Party candidate and Shneur Odze will represent UKIP.
