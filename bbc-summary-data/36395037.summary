Mayka Marica Kukucova, 26, from Slovakia, killed Bristol businessman Andrew Bush, 48, at his mansion near Marbella on the Costa del Sol in April 2014.
Prosecutors at the Ciudad de la Justicia in Malaga told the court he died after being shot three times; once in the shoulder and twice in the head.
Kukucova did not enter a formal plea.
The court heard Mr Bush returned to his luxury villa near Marbella on 4 April 2014, with his new girlfriend Maria Korotaeva, while Kukucova was collecting her belongings.
The jury was told there had been a violent struggle moments before Mr Bush's death
During the trial Kukucova claimed that "shots were fired" during the fight but denied murder.
Mr Bush, who ran a jewellery business in Bristol, met Kukucova when she worked in his shop.
Kukucova told the court they were together for two-and-a-half years but the relationship had broken down around six months before Mr Bush died.
