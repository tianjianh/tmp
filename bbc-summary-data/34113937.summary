[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jersey smoking ban in cars with children introduced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new law which makes it illegal to smoke in a car if there is a child passenger in the vehicle has come into force.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jersey became the first place in the British Isles to ban smoking in cars carrying passengers under 18 years old when it was passed by the States.
It is part of a strategy to reduce the harm caused by breathing in second-hand smoke.
Drivers aged 17 are also not allowed to smoke at the wheel.
The Health Department has welcomed the change, and said children are particularly at risk of damage from passive smoking because their lungs are still developing.
About 20% of people in Jersey smoke, and there is already a ban on smoking in enclosed places.
Drivers or passengers who break the law could be fined, the States said.
