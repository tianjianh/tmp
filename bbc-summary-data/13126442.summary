[SN]TITLE[SN]
Strathaven road closed after tanker overturns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emergency services have "stabilised" a tanker which overturned during a delivery in South Lanarkshire, spilling some of its 35,000 litres of gas oil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The tanker came to rest on its side in a field, on the B743 near Strathaven, just before 0630 BST.
The driver was treated for shock and minor injuries and the road is expected to remain closed for some time.
A 200m-radius hazard zone was put in place and two homes were evacuated while the tanker was made safe.
Strathclyde Fire and Rescue said about 150 litres of gas oil had escaped from six relief valves on top of the tanker.
It has sought advice from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency about possible contamination.
The fire service said the vehicle had now been "stabilised" and gas oil was "being decanted by the relief fuel and decanting vehicle now on site".
Officers will remain on scene until the vehicle is righted and taken away.
The accident has caused long tailbacks in both directions on the A71 through Strathaven.
Local diversions have been set up but there are also delays in the area due to roadworks.
