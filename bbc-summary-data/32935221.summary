[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Martin Bell, 24, was killed in an explosion in January 2011 while going to the aid of a wounded friend and saving his life.
He was posthumously awarded the George Medal for his selfless act.
Martin Bell Way, a road in a new housing development in Leeds Road, Shipley, was officially named by Bradford's Lord Mayor Mike Gibbons.
Councillor Joanne Dodds said: "This is an ideal opportunity for us to show our appreciation for those who were prepared to sacrifice their lives for their country.
"The least we can do is to ensure that they are never forgotten in their home city."
The George Medal is awarded for gallantry not directly in the face of the enemy and was presented to Pte Bell's family by the Queen in 2012.
Pte Bell had worked as a police community support officer with West Yorkshire Police before joining the Army.
The paratrooper was on his first tour in Afghanistan, serving with the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, when he was killed.
