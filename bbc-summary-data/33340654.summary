Rotherham taxi drivers on strike over CCTV rule

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Taxi drivers in Rotherham have begun an "indefinite" strike over new rules requiring them to install CCTV cameras.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new licensing policy has been imposed by the council following the  Jay report into child sexual exploitation in the town.
The report said taxis had been used by abusers to traffick victims.
Taxi drivers are concerned about the cost of installing and maintaining the cameras. The council said the policy was about restoring confidence.
The town has about 50 hackney carriage taxis and 800 private hire vehicles.
Drivers have already taken action over the weekend and protested outside the town hall on Monday.
They have not said how long the current action will last and are also planning a "slow" drive through the town.
Driver Rajah Khan said: "It [the new policy] is draconian and punitive.
"We condemn those people who have been involved in child grooming but do not tar us all with the same brush."
The new licensing policy, which comes into force next Monday, also requires drivers to adhere to a dress code, reviews licences and introduces additional background checks.
Karl Battersby, from the council, said: "The starting point of all this is about public confidence in the trade. We are looking at whether people are 'fit and proper' to have a license."
He said the council was meeting again with taxi drivers representatives on Monday.
"I  would encourage them to work with us rather than a situation which causes disruption to the public," he said.
