The 18-year-old, a Spain Under-17 international, will officially join the Hammers on 1 July but is already training with his future team-mates.
A prolific scorer for Valencia's youth team, Martinez will initially link up with the Hammers' development squad.
"For me, it's a great opportunity to be here and I hope to make the most of being at such a big club," he said.
"I joined West Ham because of the progress that the club is making."
The Hammers are sixth in the Premier League with four matches remaining.
They will move to the Olympic Stadium next season and Martinez added: "The prospect of playing in front of 60,000 people really catches my attention."
