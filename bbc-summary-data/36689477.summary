Jebet, 19, posted a time of eight minutes 59.75 seconds, narrowly outside of Russian Gulnara Samitova-Galkina's world record of 08:58.16.
Kenyan Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi took silver, while Emma Coburn of the USA won bronze by just 0.59secs.
Kenya-born Jebet's gold is Bahrain's first of the Games, and their second medal in total.
Jebet opted to represent Bahrain when she was 16 years old.
She said: "Today it was too hot for the athletes, it was not easy to run a good time but I tried my best and the track is good.
"It's the first gold medal for Bahrain. They saw how I ran in the Diamond League and how I did there, and they told me when I was coming that 'we're sure of you, you're going to have a medal'."
