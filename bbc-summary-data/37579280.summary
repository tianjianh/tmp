[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first day-night Test to be played in England will take place against West Indies at Edgbaston in August 2017.

Play will start at 14:00 BST on 17-21 August and continue until 21:00, with an additional 30 minutes possible at the end of each day's play.
Teams will wear traditional white clothing but use a pink Dukes ball.
Australia beat New Zealand in Adelaide in the inaugural day-night Test in November 2015, while Pakistan play West Indies in the same format next week.
West Indies' final warm-up game against Derbyshire on 11-13 August will also be played under floodlights with a pink ball.
England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Tom Harrison said: "We are excited by the prospect of staging our first ever day-night Test match.
"It is a great opportunity to attract more fans to the game and see how staging Test cricket in the afternoon and evening fits with working patterns and modern lifestyles, whilst maintaining the deep tradition of Test match cricket."
Next summer, England and Wales will also host the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC Women's World Cup.
Pat Murphy, BBC Radio 5 live:
"This is a coup for Edgbaston. Several other counties have lobbied for a floodlit Test but Warwickshire - who staged the first floodlit one-day match against Somerset in 1997 - have been in the vanguard of night cricket for years. Permanent lights were installed at Edgbaston in 2011, 11 years after the ground staged its first floodlit one-day international against Zimbabwe.
"It will be Edgbaston's 50th Test - the scene of just eight defeats and 26 victories for England. It will be an invaluable learning process for the home side, with at least one [day-night] Ashes Test due a few months later in Australia.
"A three-day second XI match against Worcestershire was trialled under lights in September, with both the Duke and Kookaburra ball being used. The experiment was deemed a success, which led to the ECB's blessing for Edgbaston.
"More tickets have been sold for Edgbaston international matches than any other ground outside London in the past decade, and with West Indies hardly a major attraction these days the attendance is unlikely to be lower than if it were a daytime Test. The novelty factor and appeal to workers in the city centre - just a mile away - is likely to impact favourably on the gate."
