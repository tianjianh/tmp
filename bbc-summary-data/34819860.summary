[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were called to Pleasant View, Felinfoel, Llanelli, on 11 November after remains, believed to be of a Polish man, were found.
A man was arrested on Friday night, with four people currently in custody.
In a separate incident, a man has been charged with murdering Simon Bell, 22, in the town. Police said the incidents were "upsetting" for residents.
A police spokesman said: "Two murder investigations in Llanelli within days of each other is obviously concerning.
"These are exceptional circumstances and a situation that no one could ever have foreseen."
He said officers are keeping Llanelli residents, including the Polish community "informed and supported" as the Pleasant View investigation continues.
Four men and a woman are in custody.
