Sean and Mary Lawson were found in Rugby at the weekend. Their deaths are not being treated as suspicious.
The Right Reverend Martyn Snow said Mrs Lawson worked for the diocese and was also a canon of Leicester Cathedral. She had been ill after a stroke.
As diocesan director of education she made a "very significant contribution" to the work of the church, he said.
"I am shocked and deeply saddened by this news and my thoughts and prayers are with Mary and Sean's colleagues, family and friends," he added.

Mr Lawson, 50, had worked at Rugby Borough Council for more than 12 years as head of its environment and public realm department.
The council said on Tuesday news of his death has been a "shock to us all".
Mrs Lawson, 63, was director of education between 2010 and 2014 and led the diocesan board of education through many significant changes.
Bishop Snow said she left her role to become head of a primary school in Leicester but had recently suffered from ill health following the stroke.
Warwickshire Police has confirmed officers were called to a property on Wiggins Close, Rugby, where they found the two bodies.
No-one else is being sought over their deaths.
