Mumford & Sons: There was no 'burning of banjos' meeting ahead of new album

Marcus Mumford says there was a conscious decision from Mumford & Sons to go for a new sound on their third studio album, Wilder Mind.

The singer says the guitar-led feel to their latest music came naturally.
"There wasn't some sort of big burning of banjos meeting," he told Annie Mac on her new Radio 1 evening show.
"It was just the noise we wanted to make and we've always followed our noses on that. The first rule of rock 'n' roll is, do what you want."
The band's first single from Wilder Mind, Believe, had its first play on Radio 1 on Monday night.
Marcus Mumford says it was written after a friend's wedding in America last year.
"The boys wrote it in Texas," he says. "We were all at a wedding and we were on this ranch.
"One of our best mates got married and the parents of the bride kindly let us stay on in this little outhouse for a week.
"I left a day early and by the time we'd met up again in London the boys had written this song, Believe.
And then I got in and started singing it and it was just great because normally there's a guitar in my hands.
"This is the first time in the band that I've just got to sing without having to worry about faffing with instruments. I really enjoyed it."
Following the success of the band's 2012 release, Babel, Marcus Mumford and bandmates Winston Marshall, Ben Lovett and Ted Dwane took some time off.
Marcus says they got back together at the beginning of last year in America to write new material.
"We started doing demos at Aaron Dessner's garage [from The National] in Brooklyn, New York, about a year ago and started getting some songs together.
"And then when we were ready we went ahead in the autumn of last year and smashed it out.
"And now we're running around trying to learn how to play it live."
Last week the band revealed they will be headlining this year's Reading and Leeds Festivals as well as announcing their own Stopover Festival, a two-day music and arts event which will take place near Aviemore.
Marcus Mumford says fans are in for something a little bit different with that one.
"That's going to be a lot of music," he says. "We're putting on these festivals. It's kind of our favourite thing that we get to do as a band actually, to curate our own festivals, put together the line-ups.
"And it's not a headline Mumford & Sons show. It's a festival in small, out of the way towns.
"It's cool, because it's a destination gig, you will travel somewhere interesting and watch music for the weekend. It's great fun."
