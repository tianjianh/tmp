Essex Police said Mr Jozwik, who was from Poland, was attacked late on 27 August in The Stow shopping precinct. He died in hospital two days later.
In a tribute statement issued at the time, the family of Mr Jozwik, who was known as Arek to his friends, said: "He was a hard-working man who loved spending time with his family, specifically his nephew, with whom he loved to play table football."
Five other teenage boys who were initially arrested in connection with Mr Jozwik's death were told they would face no further action by Essex Police owing to a lack of evidence.
