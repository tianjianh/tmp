The clockwise carriageway near Thurrock was closed for over eight hours and tailbacks reached 12 miles after the crash just past J30 for Lakeside.
Police advised motorists to avoid the area before the motorway reopened in the early afternoon.
"Emergency services were contacted at 04:40 BST," police said.
The trapped driver suffered leg injuries which "were not serious".
Essex Fire and Rescue Service assistant divisional officer John Harris said releasing the driver was a complex operation.
"The cab of the lorry was extremely badly damaged and the casualty severely trapped.
"We worked with paramedics to release the man and as soon as he was out he was taken from the scene by ambulance."
