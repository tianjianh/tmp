The Sikorsky S-70 was carrying senior military officers and members of their families, among them several children.
It came down in hilly terrain in Giresun province near the Black Sea. No cause of the crash has been given but the weather was poor at the time.
The passengers were reportedly flying to Eid celebrations in Giresun.
"Seven of our companions in arms, their wives and children have lost their lives," the army chief of staff said in a statement, without giving details of the fatalities.
A brigadier general and two colonels were among the passengers, Turkish media said.
The incident took place at about 17:15 local time (14:15 GMT) near Tohumluk village in the Alucra district of Giresun province, the army said.
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters the accident resulted "purely from poor weather conditions".
Deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Canikli, who travelled to the area of the crash, ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack.
