London mayor in last-ditch plea for Gatwick expansion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mayor of London has written to the prime minister in a last-ditch plea for an extra runway to be built at Gatwick Airport, rather than at Heathrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sadiq Khan claimed expanding the West Sussex airport was "the only option that can actually be delivered".
His letter to Theresa May was signed by 30 cross-party London MPs, council leaders and London Assembly members.
It claimed a second runway at Gatwick would be the "obvious choice" for the capital and Britain.
"Gatwick would not only require no public subsidy - a huge factor in our current uncertain economic times - but would give Britain all the benefits of expansion whilst keeping our air quality safe and within legal limits," Mr Khan said.
In her keynote address to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Mrs May confirmed that the government would "shortly announce" which airport would get the go-ahead.
The shortlisted options being considered are a third runway at Heathrow, extending its existing northern runway and a second runway at Gatwick.
