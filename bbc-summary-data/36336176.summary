It means GB will head to the Rio Paralympic Games this summer with the full contingent of six boat places.
Emma Wiggs won gold in the women's KL2 200 with Nicola Paterson second.
Anne Dickins took KL3 200 gold while there was KL1 200 silver for Jeanette Chippington and bronze medals for Nick Beighton and Martin Tweedie.
Beighton was competing in men's KL2 200 final, and Tweedie in the men's VL3 200.
