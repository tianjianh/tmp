The 29-year-old limped off during the first half of Friday's Premiership win over local rivals Bristol.
The former Scarlets player - who switched to the English club in 2015 - will see a specialist on Wednesday, Bath head coach Tabai Matson said.
"It is not looking really good. He is going to be out for a chunk of the winter," Matson told BBC Points West.
"For us, it is a big loss and a big blow for the squad."
Priestland was omitted from Wales' squad for the autumn Tests, as he was not one of their three players selected from outside Wales, a decision he "expected".
Bath are second in the Premiership after winning seven of their first eight league games this season.
