Cwmbran fire: Samantha Thomas inquest opened and adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest into the death of a woman killed in a Torfaen flat fire has been opened and adjourned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samantha Thomas, 29, died in the blaze on Shakespeare Road, St Dials, Cwmbran, on 19 May despite neighbours' attempts to save her.
The inquest in Newport heard Ms Thomas was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic inside the flat.
A post-mortem gave the provisional cause of death as exposure to fire.
A 49-year-old man was initially arrested on suspicion of murder but later released without charge.
Gwent Police said officers were continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the fire.
Senior coroner for Gwent David Bowen formally released the body so a funeral could be held.
He adjourned the inquest until 2 August when he said there would be a review of the "position of these outstanding inquiries."
