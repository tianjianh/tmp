An average of 5.8 million viewers watched the conclusion of the psychological thriller, which revealed who killed Kay and the truth about Paula, played by Vicky McClure.

Metro was in the first camp, calling it a "stellar triumph, keeping us gripped from start to finish", adding it was "a satisfying conclusion - even if the concluding scenes were a little too rushed".
