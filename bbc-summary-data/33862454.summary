The man was assaulted between 03:00 BST and 04:00 BST on Monday in the area around Fitzwilliam Road and Mushroom Roundabout.
It is believed he was on his way to early morning prayers.
The victim suffered life-threatening head and facial injuries and is in a critical but stable condition,  South Yorkshire Police said.
Det Sgt John Yoxall said: "The assault on this elderly and vulnerable man was brutal.
"There's little doubt that if the victim had not been found by officers this could have been a murder inquiry.
"I can assure the local community that all the necessary resources are being put into finding those responsible for this vicious assault."
Detectives are urging witnesses to come forward.
