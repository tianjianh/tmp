The authorities ordered 500 government-run liquor shops to shut down and also reduced the store timings.
Ms Jayalalitha had promised in her poll manifesto to gradually ban the sale and consumption of alcohol in the state.
She has been sworn-in for the sixth time as the state's chief minister.
On Monday morning, thousands of people lined the streets with posters and flowers as she drove to Madras University, the venue of the oath-taking ceremony in the capital, Chennai (Madras).
Her AIADMK party won the assembly polls with a comfortable majority last week, defeating the rival DMK party, led by 93-year-old Muthuvel Karunanidhi.
Twenty-six ministers also took oath on Monday with Ms Jayalalitha.
Within hours of taking oath, the new chief minister approved several government orders to fulfil some of the promises she had made in her election manifesto:
A former film actress, Ms Jayalalitha has been a leading figure in south Indian politics for three decades.
She enjoys enormous popularity in Tamil Nadu, where fans know her simply as "Amma" or mother.
During a press conference last week, she had hailed her party's win as a major achievement.
"After 1984, no ruling party in the state has been able to win an election and form the government for a successive term," she said.
Her party won 134 seats, while the DMK secured 98 to become the main opposition in the assembly.
