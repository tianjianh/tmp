Members of the public have been asked to take and share photographs at specific locations, starting with a pilot at the beach at Abereiddy.
It is part of Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority's Changing Coasts project.
Amateur photographers have been asked to take photographs from marked posts.
National Park Authority interpretation officer Rebecca Evans said: "Winter storms have battered our coastline in recent years, dramatically changing some of the beaches.
"We are hoping that volunteer amateur photographers will help us to capture that change with images taken in different seasons, at different times of the day, at high and low tide.''
