The 34-year-old victim was shot once in the shoulder while he was standing outside the Jolly Roger pub in All Hallows Road, Easton, at about 02.00 BST on Saturday.
Police said his injuries were not life-threatening.
A 29-year-old man and two boys, aged 17 and 15, have been arrested and are being held in police custody.
Avon and Somerset Police said one of the focus points of their inquiry was to locate a red Peugeot 206, registration KY02 AUH.
Det Insp Simon Brickwood said: "It's vital we trace this red Peugeot 206 and I'm appealing for anyone who has seen a car matching this description before, during or, crucially, after the incident, to call us as soon as possible."
Det Insp Brickwood also spoke to reassure the community, saying "crimes involving a firearm are extremely rare".
