A road in Somerset could be raised in a bid to protect a village from future flooding, the county council has said.

Muchelney was cut off by flood water for two months earlier this year and residents were reliant on tractors and boats to bring in supplies.
The proposed scheme would raise the first 500m of the Drayton Road from Muchelney by 60cm.
The plans are part of the 20-year Flood Action Plan with the council hoping it will secure access in future floods.
A council spokesman said the exact cost of the scheme "will not be known" until tenders for the work have been received.
Conservative councillor Harvey Siggs, cabinet member for Highways and Transport said: "Being cut off for so long had a massive impact on the community which is why this is one of the first actions in the plan being addressed.
"All solutions are expensive, and while no decision has been made this is our preferred option.
"Compared to the other options, this is relatively affordable and, depending on other factors like the weather, could be completed this year."
A decision on whether to proceed with the preferred scheme would be taken "before the end of July", the council said.
