[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scot Peter Campsie, 48, was killed by two gunmen in Rio de Janeiro as he returned home to his family following a business meeting.
The operations manager for Diamond Offshore Drilling International was shot twice, the Aberdeen-based Press and Journal newspaper reported.
Mr Campsie, from Montrose, Angus, had worked in Brazil for 16 years.
He lived in the city of Macae, north of Rio, with his wife and 10-year-old daughter. He also has two sons.
It is understood Mr Campsie died at the scene of the attack in the late afternoon of Wednesday in the Niteroi municipality.
News of the shooting came as the government in Brazil deployed federal troops to tackle crime in Rio de Janeiro.
Nearly 3,000 Brazilian troops are being used to confront powerful drug gangs in key areas of the city ahead of the football World Cup.
A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: "We were made aware of the death of a British national in Brazil on 2 April.
"We stand ready to provide consular assistance to the family at this difficult time."
