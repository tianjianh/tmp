James Richardson's body was discovered on Tuesday after he was reported missing after attending T in the Park.
Prosecutors have instructed the Police Investigation and Review Commissioner (PIRC) to launch a probe.
It will focus on the initial police response following a report of concern made about Mr Richardson's welfare.
Police Scotland said it would "co-operate fully" with the investigation.
A report on the commissioner's findings will be submitted to the Crown Office.
Mr Richardson's body was discovered near Forteviot on Tuesday.
Mr Richardson, who was from Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, was last seen getting off a bus which left the Strathallan site on Monday.
Police said that the cause of his death was not suspicious.
A Tayside Division spokeswoman said: "Police Scotland acknowledges the PIRC investigation into the initial police response following a report of concern made about James Richardson's welfare in the Forteviot area of Perthshire.
"We will co-operate fully with the investigation and will address any recommendations which may be made."
