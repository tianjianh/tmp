Parliament 'too middle class' says Miliband as he targets ex-military MPs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ed Miliband has said he wants to recruit more prospective MPs who have served in the armed forces to help make Parliament "more diverse".

The Labour leader said he wanted more people like Dan Jarvis, the ex-army officer who entered Parliament in 2011.
Mr Miliband also said he hoped to appeal to business people to represent Labour at the next election.
"I think Parliament is too middle class and doesn't have that diversity it needs," he told the House magazine.
With the general election scheduled for 2015, the political parties are busy choosing their candidates across the country.
Mr Miliband - who started his career as Labour Party adviser - said he wanted candidates from all backgrounds, not just professions such as law, accountancy and journalism.
"What you are going to see from us this year, as we select our candidates now the boundaries are settled, as we target those 100 or so seats for the general election, is a party reaching out to all parts of the country.
"But also a party that's going to get people from all backgrounds - business people - I want more people who are military and ex-military, like Dan Jarvis, in the party.
"People from all class backgrounds because frankly I think Parliament is too middle class and doesn't have that diversity that it needs to have."
He also suggested David Cameron was sending out "mixed messages" about the prospect of the leaders of the main Westminster parties taking part in TV debates again as in 2010.
Mr Miliband said the debates were a "good innovation" he welcomed.
"I just want to do the debates. I want the debates to happen wherever and whenever they can happen.... I think I feel warmer about them than the prime minister clearly does... I don't think he should be ducking them."
Speaking last year, Mr Cameron said that, while he enjoyed the debates, he felt they "took all the life" out of the 2010 campaign.
He suggested the three main parties "could learn from last time" and stage the 2015 debates "in a slightly different way".
