Denmark led through Nadia Nadim's early penalty but the Dutch soon levelled as Arsenal's Vivianne Miedema tucked in.
Lieke Martens put the hosts ahead with a precise 20-yard finish, but Denmark's Pernille Harder slotted in to equalise.
Dutch captain Sherida Spitse blasted in a free-kick to make it 3-2, and Miedema sealed a historic triumph late on.
Surprise finalists Denmark had pushed for another equaliser late on, as Sanne Troelsgaard went close with a swerving half-volley which dipped past the right-hand post.
But the Dutch, backed by the majority of a sold-out 28,182 crowd in Enschede, never looked in serious danger of conceding again and put the game beyond the Danes when Miedema scored the fourth.
It sparked a party atmosphere inside the FC Twente Stadion where virtually every home supporter was wearing the national team colour of orange.
An emotional Miedema appeared to be in tears in the final few seconds of the match, before the stadium erupted when the final whistle was blown.
The Netherlands had never reached the final of a major tournament, with their previous best performance coming when they reached the semi-finals of the 2009 European Championships.
They were not among the pre-tournament favourites, but once France and holders Germany - who were going for a sixth successive title - had been eliminated, they built on the momentum created with the support of their fans.
The Dutch had won all of their games at the tournament leading up to the final, conceding just once in five matches, and beating England in the last four.
Watched by Dutch football legends Marco van Basten and Louis van Gaal in the stands, the home side produced a professional display to fight back against a Denmark team they had already beaten 1-0 in the group stage.
After going behind, the Netherlands started to find their rhythm midway through the first half and eventually showed their superiority.
The Netherlands are only the fourth different nation to win the women's European Championships, after Germany's 22-year reign ended.
Joint-captains Spitse and Reading's Mandy van den Berg, who came on as a substitute in the closing stages, lifted the trophy amid joyous celebrations for the host nation.
It was not the only prize won by the Dutch, with Barcelona winger Martens being presented with the official Player of the Tournament award after a series of dazzling displays on the left flank.
However, the Golden Boot was won by England's Jodie Taylor.
Arsenal's Taylor finished as the tournament's top scorer with five goals, although Arsenal striker Miedema could have levelled by scoring a hat-trick against the Danes.
Rachel Brown-Finnis, ex-England goalkeeper:
This is the perfect ending, having the hosts win it, after they created so much momentum with their fans watching them.
They've been absolutely stunning. The way that they play the game is with so much energy, so much enthusiasm and so much interaction with the crowd.
The speed and the power, and the way they flood players forward, with the quality of the likes of Jackie Groenen, Miedema, Danielle Van de Donk, Martens - the list goes on.
They have been a pleasure to watch and they are deserved champions.
Denmark captain Harder worked tirelessly and was a constant threat but, with two clinically-finished goals, imaginative movement and some world-class hold-up play, new Arsenal signing Miedema was the deserved Player of the Match, scoring for the third game in a row.
The former Bayern Munich star would have had a hat-trick to savour, but for Danish keeper Stina Lykke Petersen's magnificent reflex save to keep out her far-post volley in the second half.
"It was an open match," Netherlands coach Sarina Wiegman said. "There were two teams who really wanted to play football.
"A match with six goals, that's very important for women's football as well."
Striker Miedema added: "We've played six amazing games and today we showed that even if we get behind in a game we can still change the game.
"The moment we scored for 3-2, I just thought 'it's not going to go wrong again'.
"We played so much better in the second half and we deserved to win the tournament."
Denmark boss Nils Nielsen said: "The Dutch team was the best team in the tournament.
"It's not easy to play at home. It's so easy to disappoint everybody, but they didn't, they performed so well.
"I am very, very proud of my own team. We have had so many problems and they kept fighting right until the end."
