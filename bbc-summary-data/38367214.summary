Private college pays student for slow marking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A private college has paid £1,377 to a former student who claimed that slow feedback and marking led to her course certificate being issued months late.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Monika Maldrik says the delay by ABI college in west London meant she "lost a year".
The college was initially ordered to pay her £5,000 but this was reduced to £1,377 at a later hearing.
A spokesman for the college said late feedback was the only part of her claim that the court had upheld.
The issue has since been rectified, said the spokesman.
Ms Maldrik, from Margate in Kent, who works part-time as a carer, received her Higher National Diploma in health and social care management in June this year - more than a year after the course ended.
The college contested an order for £5,000, made against it in May by the County Court Money Claims Centre.
Last month, Thanet County Court reduced the amount payable to £1,377, including £277 costs.
Ms Maldrik says she is disappointed not to have received the higher amount and still maintains that she did not get a satisfactory service during the two-year course.
The college rejects the bulk of her criticisms but accepts that changes in teaching personnel did cause some delays in marking assignments, an issue that it says has now been resolved.
