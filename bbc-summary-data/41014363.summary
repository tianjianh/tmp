The court was told the charges related to three attacks carried out across Exeter by Abukar, 19, of Alum Rock Road, Birmingham, Kadir, 21, of no fixed address, and Mohammed, 18, from Birmingham.
In the first of the attacks, which began in February, the gang used a shotgun to blast open the door of a flat where they believed 22-year-old Amber Olivia, who worked for them, was being held by a rival operation.
They then attacked and kidnapped the 28-year-old woman, who they recognised from a rival gang, in revenge, Exeter Crown Court heard.
In court the victim said the gang made her drink toilet water and threatened to "pimp her out".
The third attack was on a rival dealer they traced with the help of Olivia.
He was stabbed from behind outside a pub, with wounds to his chest, legs and buttocks.
Abukar and Kadir were found guilty of possession of the shotgun with intent to endanger life or cause fear of violence.
Olivia was found guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of heroin with intent to supply.
