Sir Daniel Gooch ran the project, which saw Isambard Kingdom Brunel's ship SS Great Eastern lay the seabed cable.
Sir Daniel, a locomotive engineer, worked for Brunel and became chairman of the Great Western Railway.
The plaque was unveiled earlier by the Mayor of Windsor and Maidenhead at Windsor & Eton Central station.
Mayor Eileen Quick said: "Before the age of the internet and telephones the telegraph was the fastest way to communicate.
"It could be said that Sir Daniel was a pioneer in bringing us the truly connected world we live in today."
Born in Bedlington, Northumberland in 1816, he died at his country estate near Windsor on 15 October 1889.
He was buried at the Church of St Andrew, Clewer.
