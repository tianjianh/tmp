The 27-year-old, who played for New Zealand in the World Rugby Sevens Series, has previously appeared for Crusaders in Super Rugby.
Tuitavake made his Tonga debut against Fiji earlier this year.
"He is an exciting talent who has all the attributes to be a success here and we look forward to welcoming him," said Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder.
Tuitavake added: "I have really enjoyed my time at Narbonne, but the opportunity to join Northampton was one I could not resist.
"They are a world-renowned club with some amazing players and I can't wait to get started."
