For the BBC's Africa Beats series he has reunited with Mozambican guitarist Tiago Correia-Paulo, from his former group The Volume, to perform Signs.
He says the song was inspired by a cockroach in his kitchen, which he assumed had scuttled off into a crack in the wall.
"But then I started to think... what if this cockroach just disappeared? We always rationalise these things away."
His latest album, Rob the Church - made after a year travelling and performing around Africa and making the documentary Afrique - has a contemporary hip-hop sound, but the African influence is there in the shape of polyrhythms and Afrobeat syncopations.
