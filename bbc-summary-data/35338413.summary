Women's segregation in UK communities must end - Cameron

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"More assertive" action is needed to tackle discrimination against women and their segregation in some communities in the UK, the prime minister has said.

Writing in the Times, David Cameron said "passive tolerance" too often supported the isolation of women.
"This is Britain. In this country, women and girls are free to choose how they live," he said.
He pledged Â£20m for language tuition in England, citing data suggesting 22% of Muslim women had little or no English.
Mr Cameron said he would not shy away from the "hard truths" required to confront a minority of Muslim men with "backward attitudes" who exercised "damaging control" over women in their families.
Such a situation, said the prime minister, could help lead to a slide towards radicalisation and extremism.
Health visitors, job centres, nurseries and schools should play their part, he said, adding: "But we all have a shared responsibility to tackle prejudice and bigotry, and help integration.
"We will never truly build 'One Nation' unless we are more assertive about our liberal values, more clear about the expectations we place on those who come to live here and build our country together, and more creative and generous in the work we do to break down barriers," he wrote.
"We don't just need a strong economy to thrive; we have to build a strong society."
The English language classes will be targeted at "specific communities" identified by a review into segregation being conducted by Louise Casey, head of the government's "troubled families" unit.
The lessons will take place in homes, schools and community facilities, with travel and childcare costs - described as "some of the greatest barriers to participation" - being covered.  An existing scheme is said to have helped more than 30,000 adults.
Highlighting statistics showing that 190,000 Muslim women lack English language skills, the prime minister said he had heard directly about people's experiences when he chaired a community engagement forum.
He said: "It's our values that make this country what it is, and it's only by standing up for them assertively that they will endure.
"In Britain, men are not frightened of women's success; it is celebrated proudly."
In his article, Mr Cameron said it was the responsibility of migrants to improve their English language skills if they wanted to extend their stay in the UK or seek citizenship.
There are no plans to remove people who fail to reach a required level, but the government points out that language skills are taken into account when people request to extend visas or apply for permanent residence in the UK.
