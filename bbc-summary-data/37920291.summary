[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of an anti-litter app has said lawyers for Instagram and Facebook have dropped their case demanding he change its name.

Littergram invites people to share pictures of rubbish on their smartphone and report it to their council.
Danny Lucas, of Wrotham, Kent, said Facebook "is allowing us to keep our name and wishing us continued success".
Facebook, which owns the US photo-sharing giant, said it had nothing more to add.

Earlier in the year, lawyers representing the internet giants had said Littergram's name was too similar to photo editing and sharing app Instagram, and that it was not "not acceptable".
Facebook added that it was obliged to take reasonable measures to protect its brand.
However, in a letter sent to Littergram this month, lawyers said given that the organisation was "not claiming trademarking rights", it considered "this matter closed at this time".
They added that they reserved the right to take action should circumstances change, but went on to wish the "commendable anti-litter campaign much success".
Mr Lucas said: "We applaud Facebook for taking this admirable approach and thank them very much for lifting a weight from our shoulders that will allow [us] to focus on the job in hand."
