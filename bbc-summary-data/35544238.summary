Georgina Edmonds: Rolling pin murder evidence 'shaky'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The evidence against a man accused of beating a pensioner to death with a marble rolling pin is "pretty shaky", his defence has told a court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Georgina Edmonds, 77, was found dead after being tortured at her home in Brambridge, Eastleigh, in 2008.
Matthew Hamlen, 36, from Bishopstoke, has pleaded not guilty to her murder.
William Mousley QC told Winchester Crown Court the main pillars of evidence against Mr Hamlen would "crumble and fall".
The jury has been shown CCTV footage of a man, said by the prosecution to be Mr Hamlen, wearing a high-vis jacket and attempting to use the victim's debit card at a cash machine on the night she was murdered.
But Mr Mousley said the court would hear from two witnesses who would "cast doubt on the very shaky evidence that Matthew Hamlen was 'ATM man'".
He told the jury the witnesses saw something that did not fit with the prosecution's theory.
The 36-year-old is on trial for murder for a second time after being acquitted of the same crime in 2012.
The trial continues.
