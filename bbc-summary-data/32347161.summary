[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Patients in a Warwickshire town have said they will be left without a local practice after NHS England said two surgeries would close.

Brownsover Medical Practice and Albert Street Medical Centre, Rugby, have not had their NHS England contract renewed.
The NHS said the surgeries had closed following an "internal dispute" and were working to build a new surgery in Brownsover.
But patients said they had not been contacted about interim arrangements.
Patient Tony Campbell said he had "heard nothing" about which surgery he was meant to be using after the practices close later.
"It's a disaster," he said. "It certainly doesn't fill me with confidence about the interim arrangements."
"We will really miss the two practices and their staff. My family and I have been going to them for a long time."
The two practices have 7,000 patients between them.
NHS England said Rugby Town Medical Practice would take over the running of GP services for an interim period until a new medical centre opened in Brownsover in the summer of 2016.
"NHS England is working with the Rugby Town Medical Practice to minimise disruption and provide an uninterrupted service for patients," it said.
Dr Francis Campbell, associate medical director for NHS England in the West Midlands, said a letter had gone out to patients notifying them of the changes.
"We wanted to make sure the information was as accurate as possible and the telephone number was correct. That look longer than expected," he said.
