A legal order to stop people causing a nuisance in one place could move the problem elsewhere, said the new North Wales police and crime commissioner.

Arfon Jones was speaking amid claims of anti-social behaviour in Wrexham.
He said issues at Benjamin Road started after people frequenting a site at nearby Capel y Groes church moved on.
Wrexham council, which is consulting on a Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) in the town, said it was liaising with police about issues at Benjamin Road.
Mr Jones said: "I welcome any attempt by our local partnerships to address anti social behaviour in the town centre but I feel this order is only moving the problem on to other areas."
The order would ban rough sleeping, drinking alcohol and taking drugs and other behaviour likely to "be having, or likely to have, a detrimental effect on the quality of life of those in the locality".
People would face a Â£100 fixed penalty fine or court action.
Councillor Hugh Jones, lead member for communities and partnerships, said the council's planned PSPO was not intended as a "fix all" solution and that wider help was needed from other agencies.
"I have been made aware of the developments at Benjamin Road and will be liaising with North Wales Police and our Streetscene department to address this," he said.
