Ava-Jayne Marie Corless was taken to hospital from Emily Street, Blackburn, at 23:00 GMT on Monday where she died.
The baby's mother Chloe King, 20, and her boyfriend have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. They were downstairs when she was attacked.
Ava-Jayne was not at her home address but lived nearby. The pet, classed as a dangerous dog, has been destroyed.
Ms King and her 26-year-old boyfriend Lee Wright, who is not the child's father, are also being questioned on suspicion of child neglect.
A post-mortem examination will take place to find out the exact cause of Ava-Jayne's death.
During a press conference, Ch Supt Chris Bithell said: "This is an absolutely horrific incident in which a baby girl has lost her life."
Police were first alerted by the ambulance service who were called to reports of the girl being mauled by a pet dog.
"I'm told it's quite a large pit bull-type dog," Mr Bithell said.
"As part of the investigation we are making inquiries to see whether there have been previous issues with this particular dog," he added.
A Lancashire Police spokesman later confirmed that the dog was a "pit bull terrier-type dog prohibited under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991".
The mother and boyfriend remain in custody, he added.
No-one else was injured during the attack.
A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: "She was a lovely little girl, always smiling, always happy, just like her mum.
"It's sickened me to my stomach."
