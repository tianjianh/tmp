The 36-year-old all-rounder retired from playing at the end of the 2015 season and coached Sussex's Under-17 side in 2016.
Yardy scored more than 14,000 runs for the club in all formats and will oversee all age groups in his new role.
He played 28 one-day internationals and 14 T20s for England between 2006 and 2011, and was part of the side which won the T20 World Cup in 2010.
Left-arm spinner Yardy had a successful stint as skipper at Hove between 2009 and 2012, leading the side to the Twenty20 Cup and the Pro40 title in 2009 and promotion from County Championship Division Two in 2010.
"Since Michael returned to the club at the start of last summer, it has been clear the impact he has had on our young batsmen," Sussex director of cricket Keith Greenfield said.
"To have him with us full-time will be fantastic for all of us."
