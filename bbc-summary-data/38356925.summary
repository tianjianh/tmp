York Minster's bell-ringers have denied intimidating or threatening other ringers who might replace them.

A row led to the bell-ringing group being dismissed in October, following a sex assault claim against a member.
The bells could remain silent on Christmas Day for what is thought to be the first time since the 14th Century.
A statement by York Minster Society of Change Ringers (YMSCR) has claimed Minster bosses have also declined attempts to "restore good relations".
Thirty volunteers from YMSCR were sacked amid the row over one of its members being accused of indecent assault.
On Friday, the Minster said efforts to recruit replacements from other areas to cover Christmas bell-ringing had been thwarted by "intimidation".
The Minster has said the team member concerned was deemed to pose an "ongoing risk" and could not be reinstated.
This was despite an application for a Sexual Risk Order - which can be made by a court against an individual deemed to pose a risk of harm, irrespective of whether an offence has been committed - being refused by magistrates in December 2015 and no charges having been brought.
The volunteer ringing team of 30 were then dismissed after refusing to accept the Minster's decision.
The YMSCR has now said no members have engaged in any intimidation of other ringers.
The statement also said no member had been found guilty of any crime related to safeguarding, and that no evidence for the Minster's risk assessment had been sought from the group.
The group said it had not been offered safeguarding briefings by Minster staff, and the group had always complied with safeguarding policies.
The Minster has previously said it had always intended to recruit a new team of volunteers by Easter 2017 and that all the dismissed bell-ringers were welcome to apply.
