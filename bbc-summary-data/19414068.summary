[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One of the most prosperous and politically stable countries in the region, Costa Rica is the only Central American state without a permanent standing army, after it was abolished in 1948.
It also enjoys one of the highest standards of living in the region, although a significant percentage of Costa Ricans - or Ticos - continue to live below the poverty line.
Known for its beaches, mountain ranges, volcanoes and varied wildlife, Costa Rica's rich biodiversity makes it a popular destination for eco-tourists. Traditionally a producer of agricultural goods such as coffee and bananas, its economy has diversified and tourism now ranks as the country's number one earner.

President: Luis Guillermo Solis
Luis Guillermo Solis was elected president in April 2014.
As candidate of the moderate Citizen Action Party (PAC), Mr Solis won the run-off election with 78% after his main rival, Johnny Arraya of the ruling National Liberation Party (PLN), withdrew after opinion polls showed he would be soundly defeated. The PLN had been beset by allegations of widespread corruption and economic mismanagement under outgoing President Laura Chinchilla.
An academic and former diplomat, during his campaign Mr Solis pledged to bring transparency and humility to the presidency. Not long after coming to power, he passed a decree banning plaques bearing his name and portraits of him being hung in government offices.
His victory ended Costa Rica's traditional two-party system, which for decades saw power traded between the social democratic PLN and the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC)
Costa Rica enjoys a vibrant media scene, with nine major newspapers, private and public TV stations and a busy FM radio dial. Cable TV is widely available.
The country "is very proud of its reputation as having the best human rights and freedom of expression in Latin America", says Reporters Without Borders. The watchdog has hailed moves towards decriminalising media offences.
There were more than 4 million internet users - 88% of the population - by November 2015 (Internetworldstats). Access is unrestricted.
