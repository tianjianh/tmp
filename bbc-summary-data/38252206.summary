Policing Board to sell 12 closed police stations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Northern Ireland Policing Board is to sell 12 police stations that have closed, as it aims to raise £1.5m and save £600,000 on annual running costs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plans are part of the 2016 PSNI Estate Strategy which outlines "major and minor works, custody provision" and "proposed station disposals".
The current police estate is worth £445m.
The PSNI is set to spend an estimated £90m on "estate-related works" in the next three years.
The stations which are due to be sold are:
Policing Board Chair Anne Connolly said:  "Whilst policing is not about bricks and mortar, an effective police service must have the necessary range of buildings to support its work.
"Part of our role is to ensure that the PSNI operate efficiently so we need to be satisfied that the plans for the current estate and future investment in it meet policing need and demand.
"As the legal owner of the Police Estate, the Board has carefully examined the plan prior to approval and welcomes the capital investment in new stations planned, the redevelopment of facilities at the Police College in Garnerville and a new custody provision in Craigavon and Waterside."
The Policing Board is responsible for approving all acquisitions and disposals relating to the Police Estate.
