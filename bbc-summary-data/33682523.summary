The Australian was appointed in June 2014 to help develop Britain's coaches and players.
"I have enjoyed my time at the LTA," said Brett, who previously coached Boris Becker during his 35-year career.
LTA chief executive Michael Downey will take over for an interim period until a new performance director is found.
The LTA say the search for a replacement "is progressing well".
Downey said: "Despite a relatively short tenure at the LTA, Bob has made a difference in improving our nation's chances for greater success."
Brett also previously coached Grand Slam champions Goran Ivanisevic and Marin Cilic.
