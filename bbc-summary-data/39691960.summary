The hired cars - a McLaren 570s, a Lamborghini Aventador and a Ferrari - are worth up to Â£700,000 combined.
South Yorkshire Police said the male drivers were seen moving very slowly side by side across three lanes near Barnsley on Friday before accelerating.
The force said it was "pretty sure" the cars "won't be crushed and turned into tin cans, but you never know".

On the force's Operational Support Facebook page, a spokesperson said: "Under the Police Reform Act if you are seen driving in an anti-social manner we can seize your vehicle and impound it.
"We are pretty sure it won't be crushed and turned into tin cans, but you never know."
They added several members of the public called to report the racing on the southbound carriageway and it was also captured on CCTV between junctions 38 and 37.
The force said anti-social driving would not be tolerated and offenders would be dealt with "accordingly".
