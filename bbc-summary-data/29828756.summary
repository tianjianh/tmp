Japan Crown Princess Masako attends first banquet in 11 years

Japan's Crown Princess has attended a banquet for visiting Dutch royals, her first such appearance in 11 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Princess Masako, 50, is the wife of Crown Prince Naruhito, the heir to the Japanese imperial throne.
She began to suffer from a stress-related illness after joining the imperial family in 1993.
Since the birth of their daughter in 2001, she has made rare public appearances but has largely stayed away from royal duties.
Princess Masako also attended a welcoming ceremony for King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and his wife Queen Maxima, at the Imperial Palace earlier on Wednesday. It was her first welcome ceremony appearance in five years.
The event was hosted by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko.
Princess Masako and the family did travel to the Netherlands last year to attend the king's inauguration in what was seen as a sign of her recovery.
Before marrying the Crown Prince, who is the eldest son of the Emperor and Empress, Princess Masako was a successful diplomat who spoke several languages and travelled extensively.
Observers say she had an abrupt transition from her cosmopolitan lifestyle to the rigidity of royal life in Japan.
She was diagnosed with "adjustment disorder", which is linked with symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Many blame her ill health on the pressure to produce a male heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne as the royal family went through a succession crisis.
The crisis was resolved when Crown Prince Naruhito's younger brother, Prince Akishino and his wife, had a son in 2006.
