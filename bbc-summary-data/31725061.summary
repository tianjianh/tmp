Derry's Peace Bridge has been included in the latest collection of first class stamps from the Royal Mail.

The new stamps celebrate advances in engineering that have seen UK bridges evolve from humble stone crossings to dramatic and symbolic landmarks.
Completed in 2011, the Peace Bridge features a pair of tall masts, whose system of cables overlap mid-river to form a symbolic structural 'handshake' across the River Foyle.
The new stamps go on sale on Thursday.
Andrew Hammond, Head of Stamps and Collectibles at Royal Mail said: "The story of Britain's engineering genius can be found in its bridges. These new stamps celebrate ten beautiful and ground-breaking landmarks that span centuries of our history."
In a joint statement the First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness described Derry's newest bridge as a beacon of hope.
"We welcome the announcement the Peace Bridge will feature on the latest collection of Royal Mail first class stamps. This stamp will celebrate and raise awareness of this iconic bridge which has not just physically connected two parts of the city but united our people.
"When the bridge was opened in 2011 we hoped it would be a catalyst for change. Now in 2015 the bridge symbolises a new chapter in our history and is viewed not just as a foot bridge but as a beacon of hope.
"The Peace Bridge belongs to everyone and through this initiative we can share it with the world."
The other bridges featured on the stamps are: Tarr Steps (Exmoor); Row Bridge (Lake District); Pulteney Bridge (Bath); Thomas Telford's Craigellachie Bridge (Moray); Pont Grog y Borth / Menai Suspension Bridge; Robert Stephenson's High Level Bridge (Newcastle/Gateshead); Royal Border Bridge (Berwick-upon-Tweed); Tees Transporter Bridge (Middlesbrough); and the Humber Bridge.
