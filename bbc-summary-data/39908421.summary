The 20-year-old, who has attracted attention from other Premiership clubs, has become a key player for Oran Kearney's team.
"I wanted to stay and I'm happy that my immediate future will be at Coleraine," said the full-back.
"Finishing third in the league and qualifying for Europe is an added incentive to any player."
It's a second boost for the Bannisiders in three days following the signing of midfielder Josh Carson.
"Lyndon is Mr Consistency for us and I'm over the moon that he has agreed this extension," said Coleraine boss Kearney.
"We want to build the club and it has been key to get the young players tied up.
"We have come through the transition period of the young players breaking through to them now becoming the senior pros with 100 games under their belts.
"It's important that we have them at the club during their best years and we also have to meet their needs."
