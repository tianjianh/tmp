Benghazi attack: US not seeking death penalty for suspect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The US will not seek the death penalty for Ahmed Abu Khattala, the Libyan Islamist charged over the 2012 attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A court filing from the US Justice Department gave no explanation for the decision, which means Mr Khattala now faces life imprisonment if convicted.
Four people were killed when militia stormed the consulate, including US ambassador Chris Stevens.
Mr Khattala has denied involvement in the attacks.
He was captured by US special forces two years ago and then transferred to the US.
Prosecutors allege he was the ringleader of the attacks, which critics accused President Obama and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of not doing enough to prevent.
