British and Irish Lions 2017: Sam Warburton not thinking about captaincy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Warburton says he is flattered to be put forward as a potential British and Irish Lions captain for the summer tour of New Zealand, but maintains his prime focus is just making the squad.

The Wales flanker led the Lions to victory over Australia in 2013.
Despite being replaced as Wales captain by Alun Wyn Jones, Warburton is being tipped to lead the Lions again.
"Fans, pundits, media are all talking about it but I haven't had a single conversation about that," he said.
"I've been having these questions, noticing things on my Twitter feed. Every day people are predicting their teams and captains. You can't get away from it.
"You just know that's part and parcel of playing international rugby. It's a compliment but it's something I'm not thinking about."
Warburton is expected to be a part of the Cardiff Blues team for their European Challenge Cup quarter-final at Gloucester on Saturday.
Lions coach Warren Gatland has said this weekend's round of European knockout matches gives players a chance to impress before the squad is announced on 19 April.
Warburton was in excellent form during the Six Nations, despite Wales losing three of their five matches.
The 28-year-old has been tipped by many as a Lions Test starter, while others such as 2005 captain Brian O'Driscoll think the Blues player could be skipper.
Warburton has led Wales on 49 occasions, but was initially reluctant to accept the captaincy in 2011.
"It took me two months to work out the decision with the captaincy with Wales," he said.
"I'm not going to lie about it, I'd love to to be in that [Lions] squad and I can't look past further than that. There's so much competition in the squad.
"I would love to go on tour and I've always respected the players who've gone on multiple Lions tours and that's something I'd love and try and do."
