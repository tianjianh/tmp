Laura Stewart, 20, was walking on North Hanover Street with her friend Mhairi Convy, 18, when they were hit by a Range Rover on 17 December.
The funeral of Ms Stewart, an accounts student from Cumbernauld, was held at Our Lady and St Helen's Parish Church in her home town.
About 200 people attended the ceremony to pay their respects.
Outside the church floral tributes were laid, including the name "Laura" written out in red and white flowers opposite the word "sister" in purple flowers.
Tributes left with the flowers included a card saying "with all our love for always, mum and dad" and another to a "beautiful" girl who was a "loving friend and sister".
The order of service showed a photo of the student with the words "Courage grows strong at a wound" - the motto of the Stewart clan.
Mourners wept as the white coffin with purple handles was carried out of the church to the hymn Walk With Me Oh My Lord.
Father Gerald Sharkey led the procession out of the church through the snow. The body was then driven to Eastfield Cemetery in Cumbernauld for a private burial.
Ms Stewart and Ms Convy, of Lennoxtown, studied at Glasgow College of Commerce.
Following the crash, the two women were taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where they died.
A 36-year-old male pedestrian and the 50-year-old male driver of the Range Rover were also treated in hospital after the crash.
Strathclyde Police are investigating the deaths.
