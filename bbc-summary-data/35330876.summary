United were back at home seven weeks after Storm Desmond flooded Brunton Park, forcing them to play three games at neutral grounds.
Jason Kennedy put the hosts in front with a low finish before leading scorer Jabo Ibehre headed a great chance wide.
And two minutes from time York's Luke Summerfield drilled home after Bradley Fewster's shot hit the woodwork.
York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York:

"We're delighted with the draw, but disappointed with our ball retention.
"The difference in the first half was that everything was sticking with their centre forwards, where it was breaking off ours.
"I was delighted with the point in the end. I thought our subs made a real difference and brought energy. If it had gone on a bit longer we might have got the three points."
