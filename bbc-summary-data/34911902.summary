Chester Winter Watch: Pressure over Coca-Cola clash forces U-turn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to cancel a city's Christmas parade in favour of a festive Coca-Cola truck's appearance prompted councillors to save the 600-year-old tradition.

Officials in Chester intended to scrap one of two annual Winter Watch parades in the city because large crowds are expected for the truck on 3 December.
Council Leader Samantha Dixon wrote that she would be "sorry" to see a community event "cancelled to make way for a 'commercial' proposition".
The parade has now been rescheduled.
The diary clash came about as the result of a local business group organising the appearance of the Coca-Cola truck on the same day as the first Winter Watch parade.
CH1ChesterBID's chief executive Rita Waters said: "It's important we diversify our offer to make sure the city appeals to a broad range of visitors and that's why we've committed to other major events like the Coca-Cola truck."
The drinks company's vehicle is making 46 stops on its Christmas tour.
What's Winter Watch?
Dating back to the 15th Cenury, Winter Watch features local officials parading around Chester before handing the keys to the city over to the police - who were known as the City Watch - before merrily celebrating Christmas in the knowledge the city was in safe - and sober - hands
In an internal email released following a Freedom of Information request from a local resident, Cheshire West and Chester Council events coordinator David Atkinson wrote: "It has been deemed that the new event should take precedence over the Watch due to the number of people involved."
He added that there was not a suitable alternative date for the Watch.
As the cancellation announcement was made, Ms Dixon emailed a council official to say: "I want it made clear publicly that the decision to cancel this Winter Watch parade was made without the knowledge or agreement of the administration."
Opposition councillor Jill Houlbrook wrote: "As a long-time supporter and participant I'm really disappointed."
On 3 November it was agreed the first Watch event would be rescheduled for 17 December.
The authority's culture spokesman Louise Gittins said: "Given the potential scale of the Coca-Cola event - which is known to attract up to 10,000 people - it was decided that the Winter Watch Parade should be re-scheduled in the interests of public safety.
"The Winter Watch Parade on 10 December is unaffected."
