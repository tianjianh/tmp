Amy Macdonald will headline the second day of the event at Linlithgow Palace.
They will be performing alongside Razorlight, Lightning Seeds, Ash, Bjorn Again and many others including Glasgow band Hipsway.
In its fourth year, the festival will be held on 12 and 13 August. It was voted Best Outdoor Festival by The Scottish Outdoor & Leisure Awards 2016.
Amy Macdonald said: "I've heard a lot of great things about Party at the Palace and I'm so excited that I'll finally get to visit.
"It's in such a beautiful setting and I'm sure it will be a great weekend.
"My band and I are very excited about the show."
John Richardson, Party At The Palace co-producer, said: "We're incredibly excited to welcome music fans to the party again this summer.
"We have made a few changes for this year and the crowd can look forward to some great new additions to the site as well as a fantastic line up over the weekend.
"We've set the bar very high in previous years by bringing some amazing artists to Linlithgow - from Deacon Blue and Simple Minds in our first year, to Nile Rogers, Travis, The Proclaimers and Billy Ocean, so, we are delighted to have The Kaiser Chiefs and Amy Macdonald alongside a host of other great bands, spread across our two stages for 2017.
"It's going to be the biggest party yet."
