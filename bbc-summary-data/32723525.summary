The Cardiff University initiative hopes to highlight the experiences of soldiers who served in the Middle East during the conflict.
Funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund, it will display the images collected from the public on a website.
It aims to "reveal the often-overlooked Middle Eastern front in a way not seen before".
Professor Paul Nicholson, from Cardiff University, said: "Egypt and Palestine in the First World War are often overshadowed by the Western Front, but they are important areas and this project seeks to make them better known."
More than 2.5 million British troops served in the Middle Eastern theatre during World War One.
The 'British views of an antique land' project will begin with a collection road show at the Firing Line Museum in Cardiff Castle at the weekend.
Further shows are planned for 11 and 12 July, at the Regimental Museum of the Royal Welsh in Brecon, Powys.
