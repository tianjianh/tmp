The 38-year-old was walking near a children's play area in Everton at about 20:00 GMT on 11 February, when a man shouted racial abuse at her.
Another man then punched her repeatedly near to the junction of Thirlmere Road and Ullswater Street.
The woman suffered a fractured cheekbone and will need facial surgery following the "unprovoked" attack.
Appealing for witnesses, Det Sgt Jennie Keating said: "This was a particularly nasty assault on a woman who was simply going about her day-to-day business."
One man is described as slim with blonde hair and was wearing a black tracksuit. The other man had brown hair and was wearing a blue tracksuit.
Both are described as white and having Liverpool accents.
