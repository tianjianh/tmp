A man who raped a woman multiple times over a three-year period has been jailed for 12 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At Bristol Crown Court, 31-year-old Nermesh Singh, of Brigstocke Road in the city, was found guilty of five counts of rape.
All of the offences relate to the same victim and happened between 2007 and 2009.
Singh also received an extra four-year extended licence and was put on the sex offenders register indefinitely.
Avon and Somerset Police said Singh's victim "suffered horrific crimes" at his hands, but had shown "courage and dignity" throughout the investigation.
Det Con Dan Watts said: "Singh has refused to take any responsibility for his actions. He abused the trust his victim had in him for his own sexual gratification.
"I hope the sentence today sends a strong message that we will always robustly investigate any allegation of sexual assault and offer unwavering support to victims of crime."
