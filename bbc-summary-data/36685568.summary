[SN]TITLE[SN]
Angela Rayner appointed shadow education secretary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Angela Rayner has been appointed shadow education secretary, the Labour Party has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Rayner becomes the third MP to hold the post this week after Lucy Powell and Pat Glass both resigned.
The move comes amid a wave of resignations by Labour MPs seeking a change in leadership.
She was previously a shadow work and pensions minister before moving into the shadow cabinet on Monday with the women and equalities portfolio.
Ms Rayner was elected MP for Ashton-under-Lyne in 2015.
Ms Glass was appointed shadow education secretary by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn after the resignation of Ms Powell on Sunday - but she herself also resigned on Wednesday.
Ms Glass said she had stepped down from the post "with a heavy heart" because the "situation is untenable".
