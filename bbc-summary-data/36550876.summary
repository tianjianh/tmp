South Africa v Ireland: Quinn Roux to make debut for Ireland in second Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Quinn Roux will make his Ireland debut as one of five changes for Saturday's second Test against South Africa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pretoria-born Roux joins Craig Gilroy, Stuart Olding, Tadhg Furlong and Rhys Ruddock in Joe Schmidt's side for the match in Johannesburg.
Tiernan O'Halloran and Sean Reidy could win their first caps off the bench.
Ireland are aiming to become the first home nation to win a test series in South Africa, having triumphed 26-20 in the first game in Cape Town last week.
The third and final Test will be played in Port Elizabeth on 25 June.
The Springboks have not lost a Test series at home in the past 19 years and have never lost a Test series to Ireland.
South Africa coach Allister Coetzee makes two enforced changes from last weekend with fly-half Elton Jantjies and lock Pieter-Steph du Toit  replacing injured Patrick Lambie and Lood de Jager.
Jantjies' inclusion raises the number of black players in the starting line-up to six.
The South Africa government has demanded that the Springboks better reflect the demographics of a country where 90 percent of the people are black.
Ireland won at Newlands despite being reduced to 14 men following the dismissal of CJ Stander.
A gruelling season that began with a pre-World Cup training camp back in July 2015, the physical toll of defending with 14 men for almost an hour last weekend, and playing at altitude are believed to have influenced Schmidt's thinking with regards to freshening up his side.
Gilroy replaces Keith Earls and will form an all-Ulster back three alongside Jared Payne and Andrew Trimble, while Olding comes in for provincial team-mate Luke Marshall at inside centre.
Olding, who last started for Ireland against Georgia in November 2014, will link up with Robbie Henshaw in a new-look Irish midfield.
Mike Ross, who has been virtually an ever-present during Schmidt's time in charge, drops out for his Leinster team-mate Tadgh Furlong, who makes his first Test start having won all of his six previous caps from the bench.
Roux's promotion to the second row alongside Devin Toner comes as something of a surprise, the 25-year-old having been on the periphery of Connacht's starting side this season.
With Stander serving a one-match ban, Iain Henderson moves from the second row to the blindside and Ruddock comes in for Jordi Murphy at openside flanker.
Ruddock last started in the number seven shirt for Ireland as a late call-up for Chris Henry on the morning of Ireland's 29-15 victory against the Boks in November 2014 at the Aviva Stadium. Jamie Heaslip remains at number eight.
Earls, Ross, Marshall, Murphy, Ultan Dillane, Sean Cronin, and the suspended Stander are all absent from the 23-man matchday squad, with Richardt Strauss, Dave Kilcoyne, Donnacha Ryan, Reidy and O'Halloran coming on to the bench.
