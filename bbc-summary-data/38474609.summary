The Seasiders had the upper hand for much of the game, with Barnsley's Adam Davies by far the busier keeper.
He denied striker Kyle Vassell three times after Jim McAlister had pulled an early opening wide of the post.
Barnsley raised their game after the break, and Sam Slocombe did well to deny Conor Hourihane a late winner.
Midfielder Hourihane burst through the home defence just a couple of moments after shooting wide from Stefan Payne's flick, but the home keeper kept out his effort with his legs.
Sam Winnall, the Championship player of the month for December, had a quiet game after being restored to Barnsley's starting line-up against a Blackpool side who were well worth a second chance at Oakwell.
Blackpool boss Gary Bowyer:  "I thought it was a proper cup tie and we did ourselves justice against a very good Championship side.
"Their keeper has made some really good saves, he was the busier of the keepers, but we had to rely on Sam Slocombe to make a save at the end too.
(on 3-5-2 system) "The players only had one session on it because the pitches were frozen on Thursday but they took it on and against a talented team like Barnsley they did very well with it.
"It might be something we look at in the league as it gives us a chance to be flexible and pick a system for certain opposition."
Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom:  "Blackpool came out here and had a right good go at us. The first half has cost us - we didn't perform as individuals and that puts you on the back foot.
"I knew we'd perform better second half but we just couldn't break through. I was disappointed that they got too many attempts at our goal as well.
"I think Blackpool will come to Oakwell and be as determined and dogged as they were here.
"You just want to get through in the FA Cup, that's the nature of it. The further you get, the more likely you are to draw a really big team and have really big days."
