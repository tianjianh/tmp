China-based FUN88 will replace payday loans company Wonga as shirt sponsor for the next three seasons in a deal thought to worth about Â£8m a year.
The Magpies are returning to the Premier League after spending the last season in the Championship.
The club said FUN88 would be supporting "a number of fan initiatives" to be unveiled later.
Newcastle's managing director Lee Charnley said: "It was important for us to find the right partner and in FUN88, we have a shirt sponsor that understands the club and brings significant benefits commercially.
"The relationship will enable the club and FUN88 to enhance our respective global profiles together as we celebrate a landmark season and embark on the exciting Premier League campaign ahead.
"As part of a three-year agreement, FUN88 will feature proudly on the club's famous black and white stripes, starting with an historic season as the club celebrates its 125th anniversary."
FUNN88 director Nathan Walker added: "It's a hugely exciting time to partner with one of the most famous clubs in English football.
"Our previous sponsorships in English football have delivered great results and I'm certain Newcastle United provides us with a platform to move to new heights.
"We are looking forward to engaging with the club's huge fan base in Newcastle and worldwide."
FUN88, which was founded in 2008, have had previous deals with Tottenham Hotspur and Burnley FC.
Newcastle's split with Wonga came after the payday lender suffered huge losses of more than Â£80m in 2015.
