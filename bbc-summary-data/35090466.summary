Match officials reported the off-spinner, 34, during his side's first Test defeat by Sri Lanka in October.
An independent assessment revealed his elbow extension exceeded the permitted 15 degrees while bowling.
He was handed a year-long ban because he had already been banned from bowling his faster deliveries in December 2013.
An International Cricket Council statement read: "As this report constitutes the player's second suspension within a two-year period, he is now automatically suspended from bowling in  international cricket for a 12-month period.
"Samuels is entitled to appeal any procedural aspect of the independent assessment that has led to this automatic suspension. However, only after the expiry of this one-year period will he be entitled to approach the ICC for a re-assessment of his bowling action."
Samuels, who bats in the top order, has taken 145 wickets in 279 matches for his country across Test, one-day and Twenty20 formats, but may continue to play as a specialist batsman.
