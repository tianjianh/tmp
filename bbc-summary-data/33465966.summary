First Great Western rail strike ends after 48 hours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail passengers in south Wales should see services return to normal after a 48-hour First Great Western (FGW) strike ended.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strikes started on Wednesday evening, after last-minute talks with the Rail, Maritime and Transport union broke down, and ended at 18:30 BST on Friday.
The dispute was over plans to scrap guards and buffet car services on FGW's new Hitachi Inter City Express trains.
Reduced services were in place during the walkout.
