Adam Bogdan: Wigan lose on-loan Liverpool goalkeeper with knee injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On-loan goalkeeper Adam Bogdan will miss the rest of Wigan Athletic's season with a serious knee injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old Hungary international joined the Latics in July from Liverpool and had started in every Championship game so far this season.
He suffered the injury in Wigan's 0-0 draw at Barnsley on Saturday and will undergo surgery on his knee.
"To lose him for him to be out for the season is a blow," boss Warren Joyce told BBC Radio Manchester.
"It's hampering his career for a period of time when he was looking to kick on and establish himself."
