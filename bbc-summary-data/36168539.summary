[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford United striker James Roberts is hoping to put an "awful" year behind him by helping the club win automatic promotion from League Two.

Roberts' brother Ben died after he was hit by a car aged just 16, in October.
He has also been plagued by persistent hamstring injuries, but made a return to the first team earlier this month with Oxford third in the table.
"It's been an awful year for me and my family," the 19-year-old academy graduate told BBC Radio Oxford.
"It's a hell of a time to be part of what's happening here at Oxford and to have had the chance to come back. I feel I've done well for the team when I've been involved."
Roberts has made one start and three appearances off the bench since his return in the 5-1 win at Crawley on 9 April.
"This has been a bonus to not just me, but to my family as well," he added.
"That's important because they love watching me play. They travel up and down the country following me.
"But, it's a bonus to be back playing with a group of players who are fantastic."
