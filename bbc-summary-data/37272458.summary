Thomas Muller scored twice for the world champions as he netted either side of a Joshua Kimmich effort.
Northern Ireland drew 0-0 with the Czech Republic and Azerbaijan beat San Marino 1-0 in the group's other games.
In Group E, Denmark beat Armenia 1-0 while Kazakhstan held Poland 2-2, and there was late drama as Romania drew 1-1 at home with Montenegro.
Adrian Popa gave Romania the lead after 85 minutes and, after Stevan Jovetic equalised two minutes later, Nicolae Stanciu missed a penalty for the hosts in the seventh minute of added time.
Tottenham's Christian Eriksen got the winner for Denmark, while Poland were 2-0 up in Kazakhstan before squandering their lead.
Leicester City's 19-year-old winger Bartosz Kapustka had put Poland ahead and Robert Lewandowski doubled the lead from the penalty spot, only for Kazakhstan to score twice in the second half.
Group F saw plenty of late drama.
After Adam Lallana scored a 95th-minute winner for England away to 10-man Slovakia, there was another late goal in the game between Lithuania and Slovenia.
Lithuania led 2-1 with moments to go when former West Bromwich Albion loan signing Bostjan Cesar equalised for the visitors.
Scotland rounded off the group with a comprehensive 5-1 win over Malta, with Robert Snodgrass getting a hat-trick.
