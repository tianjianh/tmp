Having confirmed her passage to the Olympics, Jenkins is skipping the event in Leeds as part of her preparation.
Husband and trainer Marc Jenkins confirmed she will instead run in Stockholm or Hamburg ahead of Rio.
"We have gone with the correct decision," he told BBC Wales Sport.
Jenkins has no injury concerns, with her husband saying that skipping Leeds is a tactical consideration and that she might not race again until the main event this summer.
"Helen is planning on racing Stockholm and or Hamburg," he added. "These fit much better in to the time scale we have and preparation for Rio.
"That said, Helen doesn't necessarily need to race between now and then if things don't go 100% as we would like."
