[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old, who was a free agent after leaving Belgian team Royal Excel Mouscron, has signed a three-year contract with the O's.
Mezague came through the youth ranks with Montpellier in his homeland and moved to play in Belgium in 2014.
Meanwhile, Barnet winger Luke Gambin has turned down a move to Orient.
Chairman Tony Kleanthous told his club's website that a Â£100,000 deal had been agreed, but the 23-year-old is out of contract in the summer and wants to play at a higher level than League Two.
