Craig Disley struck early on to boost Grimsby's promotions hopes, denting Wrexham's in the process.

It was the hosts' fourth win in five National League games as they consigned Wrexham to a first defeat in nine.
Disley's drive amid sloppy Wrexham defending from Nathan Arnold's assist gave them Paul Hurst's men the lead at the break.
The hosts went on to deny Gary Mills' side's increasingly desperate attempts to equalise.
The Mariners went close to adding a second when Rob Evans had to hack another Disley shot off the line and Patrick Hoban headed against the crossbar.
Wrexham's best chance was an overhead effort from Connor Jennings, which was cleared off the line by Evan Horwood.
Grimsby boss Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside:

"As I said, going into the game they were the form team and hadn't conceded a goal in the last six. We managed to put that to bed pretty early. Overall I think it's a deserved win.
"I thought we played very well first half. I think that's the best we've played for a very long time and I said that to the players.
"Training hasn't been great in truth on Thursday and Friday. When it mattered the players produced a performance which we've been asking from them."
