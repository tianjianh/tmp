Officers are investigating whether Karen Flett, 57, and her husband William Flett, 56, died at the house in Cornhill Terrace as a result of a murder-suicide.
Detectives were not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident.
A statement from the couple's family said: "We are completely devastated by our loss and will help each other through this extremely difficult time."
They added: "We would also like to take this opportunity to thank those who have passed on their wishes and offered their support.
"We would ask that we are left in private to come to terms with what has happened."
Police said the husband and wife died as a result of injuries they sustained at the property in the incident on Wednesday.
In a statement, Det Insp Allen Shaw said: "Inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of what occurred at the property."
He asked anyone who may have witnessed anything unusual at the property on Wednesday, or in the previous days, to contact police.
