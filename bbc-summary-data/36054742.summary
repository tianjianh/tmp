The breakdown left the cortege, led by a vicar carrying a cross, with a half-mile walk to the cemetery up St Gluvias Hill in Penryn, Cornwall.
A funeral service had earlier been held for Julie Wilson, of Penryn, at St Gluvias Church.
The trolley procession was filmed by Mrs Wilson's husband, Brian, who said it was a sad moment, but also amusing.
