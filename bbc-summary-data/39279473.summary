[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
William Porterfield's century was not enough to prevent Ireland losing the first of five one-day internationals against Afghanistan by 30 runs.

Ramat Shah contributed 78 and Noor Ali Zadran 51 as Afghanistan scored an impressive 292-7 off their 50 overs, Kevin O'Brien taking 3-47.
Despite a brave attempt, Ireland fell short with 262 all out in 46.5 overs.
Porterfield smashed 119 and Paul Stirling 68 as they put on a second-wicket partnership of 157.
The Ireland captain's innings came off just 98 balls and included 18 fours, but most of the remainder of the Ireland batting line-up were unable to replicate his form.
Dawlat Zadran and Rashid Khan took four wickets apiece to help see the Afghans to victory at Greater Noida on Wednesday.
Ireland had already been whitewashed 3-0 in a Twenty20 series between the sides in India.
The teams will play four further one-day internationals, before meeting in an Intercontinental Cup match at the end of the month.
