His career spanned five decades and saw him appear in TV shows including The Good Wife and 30 Rock and films such as Meet the Parents, My Cousin Vinny, Carlito's Way and Basic Instinct.
Diagnosed with melanoma in 1992, he continued working until last month.
His agent told The Hollywood Reporter: "He fought it all this time.
"He died [on] Friday afternoon at his home in New Jersey, where he had been receiving hospice care for a week and a half."
Rebhorn had more than 100 screen credits, one of the most recent being for Homeland, in which he played Frank Mathison, the father of Claire Danes' CIA officer Carrie Mathison.
His films included The Talented Mr Ripley, in which he played a shipping magnate, plus Meet the Parents and The Game.
Rebhorn often played authority figures, including the headmaster in 1992's Scent of a Woman and the US secretary of defence in the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day.
