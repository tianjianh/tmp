Here are a selection of images from the first three days of the event, which kicked off on Wednesday with a screening of French film La Tete Haute (Standing Tall).
Ingrid Bergman's face adorns the exterior of the Palais des Festivals, the imposing edifice that provides the centrepiece and focal point of the annual film festival.
Jury co-president Ethan Coen entertains juror Sienna Miller by finding a new use for a translation device at Wednesday's jury press conference. Joel Coen, Ethan's older brother and co-president, appears mildly amused.
Jake Gyllenhaal joins Miller and the Coens on a jury that also includes French star Sophie Marceau and Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro. Gyllenhaal told reporters he was "thrilled to see films before anyone else... and for free!".
Natalie Portman, pictured at Wednesday's opening night with husband Benjamin Millepied, is presenting her first feature as a director at this year's festival. Portman also appears in A Tale of Love and Darkness, a film told entirely in Hebrew that is "well-meaning but dreary" according to Variety.
Lupita Nyong'o, Oscar-winning star of 12 Years a Slave and the upcoming Star Wars film, shows off her gown to photographers at the opening night gala.
Having otherwise been engaged 12 months ago, Julianne Moore finally accepts the best actress award she won at last year's festival for Maps to the Stars from master of ceremonies Lambert Wilson.
French actors Tahar Rahim and Adele Exarchopoulos do without shoes during a photocall for their film The Anarchist, part of the festival's Critics' Week section.
British actor Toby Jones shields his eyes as he arrives for a press conference to promote Matteo Garrone's Tale of Tales, a fantasy that was greeted enthusiastically by critics on Thursday.
Mexican actress Salma Hayek also has a role in Garrone's film, for which she was required to eat a "disgusting" pasta dish made to resemble the giant heart of a sea creature slain by her husband (John C Reilly).
Tom Hardy cups an ear while fielding questions about his title role in Mad Max: Fury Road, a post-apocalyptic action movie that brought autovehicular car-nage to the celebrated Croisette.
Hardy's co-star, actress Charlize Theron, was joined by her partner Sean Penn as she stepped out in yellow at the Fury Road screening on Thursday.
Emma Stone and Woody Allen grapple with the wind and boredom respectively as they do the rounds for his latest feature, Irrational Man. The Cannes Film Festival runs until 24 May.
