[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sport Wales no-confidence vote inquiry to take eight weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Events surrounding a vote of no confidence in the chairman of Sport Wales are to be investigated for ministers in an eight-week review.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rebecca Evans, the minister for sport, suspended the activities of its board last week amid concerns.
A leaked report by the chairman, Paul Thomas, said Sport Wales was in "danger of stagnating" and had spent an "unacceptable" amount on its board.
Ms Evans revealed the vote of no-confidence in him had been unanimous.
In a statement issued on Monday, the minister said: "On Tuesday 22nd November the Vice Chair and Board of Sport Wales unanimously passed a vote of no confidence in the Chair who was not present at the meeting.
"On Wednesday 23rd November, and with the full agreement of the Chair and the Vice Chair, Ministers suspended all of the Sport Wales Board activities until an assurance review could be completed."
Ms Evans said the suspension of activities was a "neutral" act and that the day-to-day activities of Sport Wales continued as normal.
Any matters normally dealt with by the board would be referred by the organisation's chief executive to a senior Welsh Government official, Ms Evans added.
Ms Evans said the assurance review had been called:
The minister added that the review would not consider Mr Thomas's draft review or the wider effectiveness of Sport Wales itself.
The review will consist of a series of structured interviews and examination of records, Ms Evans said, leading to a report to the Welsh Government's director of governance with evidence, conclusions and recommendations.
