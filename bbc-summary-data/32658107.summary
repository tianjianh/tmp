Election 2015: Tories dominate South local council results

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives have dominated the local, district and borough council elections across Dorset, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Hampshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party took Poole, Winchester City, Basingstoke and Dean and Hart District councils, which had previously been under no overall control.
Despite losing all of their MPs across the South, the Lib Dems held on in Eastleigh, even with a two-seat loss.
Labour has retained control of Reading and Slough borough councils.
The party also managed to hold on to Southampton City Council, despite its majority being cut like in Slough.
At Rushmoor Borough Council the Tories increased their majority by two seats - one from Labour and one from UKIP.
They also increased their hold on New Forest District Council, taking four seats from the Lib Dems and two from UKIP, leaving them with 58 seats on the 60-seat council. The Lib Dems hold the remaining two.
The party has also taken 16 of the 17 available seats on West Oxfordshire District Council, and retained control of Havant Borough Council and Cherwell District Council, Vale of White Horse District Council and South Oxfordshire District Council.
Majorities were also increased across Berkshire in Bracknell, Windsor and Maidenhead, West Berkshire and Wokingham.
Portsmouth City Council and Weymouth and Portland Borough Council remain under no overall control. On both, the Conservatives were five seats short of a majority.
In Bournemouth, the Conservatives increased their control and wiped out any representation from Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
Three councillors are still to be determined with a recount required on Monday in one ward.
