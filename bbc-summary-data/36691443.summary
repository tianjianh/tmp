Park shot a final-round 66 to finish on 16 under, five clear of world number one Lydia Ko of New Zealand.
China's Shanshan Feng took bronze, a shot further back on 10 under par.
Hull carded a three-under-par round of 68 to finish tied for seventh on eight under as women's golf returned to the Games for the first time since 1900.
Catriona Matthew of Great Britain finished on level par, 29th overall.
Japan's Harukyo Nomura, American Stacy Lewis and South Korea's Hee Young Yang shared fourth place on nine under.
Park, a seven-time major winner, had not competed in top-level competition for two months and missed the past two majors on the LPGA Tour because of a thumb injury.
However, the 28-year-old took a two-shot lead into the final round and was six clear after a hat-trick of birdies from the third and another on the eighth, before Feng closed the gap with a birdie on the 10th.
Her advantage was reduced to three shots when Park bogeyed the 10th as Feng birdied the 11th in the group ahead.
But birdies on the 13th, 15th and 17th all but sealed victory - and saw the focus switch to the battle for silver and bronze, in which New Zealander Ko prevailed with a birdie on the 18th.
Britain's Hull was within a shot of the bronze-medal position after a birdie on the 11th, but three-putted the 13th and was unable to pick up any shots until a two-putt birdie on the last.
"I was quite happy with the way I finished," said the 20-year-old. "Especially on the back nine I gave myself plenty of opportunities, I just didn't hole them.
"I missed one short putt, which was a bit silly, but apart from that I feel like my game is in good shape.
"My first Olympics was a fantastic experience and I got a good buzz off it."
Team-mate Matthew, from Scotland, shot a final round of 70.
"Today I was never really in with a chance for a medal so it was just trying to play good golf and try something different with my putting to help that. It was nice to finish with a good round.
"It has been a great golf course for such a new course and it has played really well. It has been great being at the Olympics. I have loved it.
"Hopefully golf will stay in the Olympics and we'll get to watch it a few more times."
