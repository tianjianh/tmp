[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottinghamshire made a solid start in their reply to Surrey's 323 on a weather-affected second day of their County Championship game at The Oval.

Openers Jake Libby fell for 10 and Steven Mullaney 34 as the visitors reached 82-2 at stumps, trailing by 241.
Persistent rain meant play on day two did not begin until 16:15 BST.
Gareth Batty's 28 from 32 balls at number nine secured a third batting point for Surrey, who resumed on 299-8.
Notts required only 6.1 overs to take the bottom club's final two wickets.
Jake Ball (4-85) ended skipper Batty's entertaining cameo by having him caught behind, before Stuart Meaker lobbed a return catch to Samit Patel.
Notts opener Libby was lbw shouldering arms to seamer Ravi Rampaul and captain Mullaney was bowled by a Zafar Ansari delivery which turned sharply to clip the top of off stump.
Michael Lumb, who has hit three One-Day Cup centuries since Nottinghamshire's last Championship outing at the end of May, will resume on 23 not out on day three, alongside Brendan Taylor, who is unbeaten on 13.
