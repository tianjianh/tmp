Grade I listed Plas Glynllifon is the centrepiece of the Glynllifon estate six miles from Caernarfon on the main A499 to Pwllheli.
Former uses for the 102-roomed property include offices and accommodation for an agricultural college.
The mansion was originally the seat of Lord Newborough.
A wall 10ft (3m) high and eight miles long (12km) surrounds the Glynllifon estate which includes various houses, an agricultural college, craft workshops and a cafe as well as the mansion.
David Currie from receivers Winterhill Largo said Plas Glynllifon was one of the "more unusual appointments" for the company.
"It is a truly unique property with massive potential," he said, pointing to its location near Snowdonia and the Llyn peninsula.
"We are anticipating a great deal of interest from potential buyers and hopefully the house will have a great future."
Before partial renovation work over recent years the house was featured in the book Forgotten Welsh Houses which showcased buildings which had fallen on hard times.
The house is said to be haunted by the ghost of Maria Stella, a young bride who came to the Plas from Italy in the 1700s to marry the then Lord Newborough.
