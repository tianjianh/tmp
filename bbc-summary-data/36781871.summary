[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Albertina Choules, 81, died at her home in Ragmans Lane, near Marlow Bottom, Buckinghamshire, on 6 July.
Tautuydas Narbutas, 23, of Chiltern Avenue, High Wycombe, was arrested on suspicion of murder last Wednesday.
Mr Narbutas, who was also charged with two counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, appeared before magistrates earlier.
He was remanded in custody and is due at Reading Crown Court on Thursday.
In a statement, the family of Ms Choules, known as Tina, said she was "incredibly special, as was her simple, self-sufficient way of life with no electricity, television or washing machine".
She was "completely selfless" and would be missed "very dearly", they added.
