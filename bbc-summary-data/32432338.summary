The time-travelling elevator takes people on a journey through 415 years of the city's history in a three-dimensional time-lapse.
It's one of five lifts opening soon at the One World Trade Centre building in the Big Apple.
It will show passengers how the city, famous for its giant skyscrapers and other big buildings, grew up from the ground, from the seventeenth century, to the present day.
The lift takes 47 seconds to make the journey up to the 102nd floor.
