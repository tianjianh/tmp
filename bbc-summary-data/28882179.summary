St Johnstone: Simon Lappin agrees deal after Cardiff exit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Johnstone have agreed a contract with Simon Lappin after the midfielder was freed by Cardiff City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old has been secured by the Scottish Premiership club on a two-year deal.
Lappin, who began his career with St Miren, joined Cardiff in January 2013 but failed to make a single appearance for the Welsh club.
He played 10 times during a loan spell with League One outfit Sheffield United.
Glasgow-born Lappin spent 10 years with St Mirren before being sold to Norwich City for Â£100,000 in 2007.
He made more than 100 appearances for the Canaries but also had loan spells with Motherwell and Cardiff.
The latter led to a permanent switch to the Bluebirds, but he was released this summer.
Lappin had recently been on trial with Championship title hopefuls Rangers.
