An estimated 21,000 British soldiers died in the Battle of Loos in 1915, about 7,000 of whom were Scottish.
A large number of casualties were from the Dundee-based 4th Black Watch.
Prince Charles and Camilla joined about 1,000 people at a service in the city to pay their respects.
The prince is the Royal Colonel of the 3rd Battalion (The Black Watch), The Royal Regiment of Scotland.
His great uncle, Captain Fergus Bowes-Lyon, died on the third day of fighting in the battle, which took place in north of France.
About 8,000 lives were lost within the first four hours of fighting on 25 September 1915, the first day of the battle.
Events to mark the centenary of the battle started on Friday with the lighting of a beacon at dawn at the top of Dundee war memorial.
Saturday's service started with a parade of about 250 current service personnel and 300 veterans.
The City Square was then transformed into a "cathedral", with four ministers from Dundee representing the Scottish Episcopal, Roman Catholic Church of Scotland, Church of Scotland and the Chaplain General to the Armed Forces.
Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, laid wreath against a specially-commissioned memorial stone along with the first minister and Lord Provost of Dundee.
Unveiling a commemorative plaque at the reception, he said: "The units involved at the Battle of Loos form a roll-call of Scotlands finest regiments. They left the farms, factories and fishing villages of their native country and fought ferociously for our freedom in a foreign land.
"Their example is deeply humbling and is something in which the people of Scotland can take enormous and justifiable pride."
Ahead of the event, Ms Sturgeon said: "With around 30,000 Scots serving at Loos, its effect was felt throughout every village and town in Scotland.
"The weekend of national commemorations will be a fitting tribute to those that fought, those that died and those that were left at home."
Lord Provost Bob Duncan said: "The battle affected every Scottish regiment and was also Dundee's darkest hour.
"The terrible losses, particularly among local Black Watch battalions, had a profound effect on the city.
"This weekend presents an opportunity to remember their heroic sacrifice and to honour their memory."
Charles and Camilla will later attend a reception for forces personnel and veterans and view an exhibition on the Battle of Loos by pupils from Dundee schools.
