[SN]TITLE[SN]
Female genital mutilation risk girl, 13, made ward of court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A High Court judge has granted an order protecting a 13-year-old girl believed to be at risk of female genital mutilation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl was made a ward of court at a family court hearing following a South Yorkshire Police investigation.
The decision also prevents her family from taking the child out of the country or making travel plans.
Det Sgt Suzanne Bluck said: "Female genital mutilation is a form of child abuse and... it will not be tolerated."
Breaches of the non-molestation order could result in a jail term.
The partial or total removal of external female genitalia is illegal in the UK but the practice occurs in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
