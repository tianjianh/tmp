Domestic violence victims housed with violent ex-offenders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Not all ex-offenders have a violent past, but if you are forced to live alongside one who has it can be "frightening" and "scary".

That's what some people who've been housed by councils in temporary accommodation have been telling us.
They say officials need to make sure vulnerable residents are protected.
A violent ex-offender, Matthew Williams, murdered 22-year-old Cerys Yemm in his South Wales room two weeks ago.
Police caught him reportedly engaged in an 'act of cannibalism'. He had been placed in a hotel temporarily by his local council after his release from prison.
While it isn't believed that Cerys was a victim of domestic abuse, the charity Women's Aid is concerned that too often women and children escaping domestic violence end up in these kinds of hostels or hotels.
One 27-year-old, who we are calling Sara, told us: "It really made me cry. I didn't want to stay there."
She had escaped a violent relationship and was eight months pregnant.
"The first hostel they put me in was in an old church and there were all kinds of people.
"My ex, the person I was running from, had a problem with drugs and they put me in a hostel with people with the same issue, and that really freaked me out."
Sara believes "it wasn't appropriate for a pregnant person seeing all these drunk people coming back at night".
It comes after the murder of Cerys Yemm in South Wales two weeks ago by violent ex-offender Matthew Williams.
He had been placed in a hotel temporarily by his local council after his release from prison.
Local councils are responsible for providing accommodation for homeless people.
But the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said 40% budget cuts have made it more difficult - especially for younger people.
Despite this they told us: "Councils do everything they can to protect vulnerable people from the risk of harm."
Violent ex-offender Matthew Williams was living in The Sirhowy Arms Hotel when he was found attacking Cerys.
His mother has claimed he'd stopped taking medication for paranoid schizophrenia but Mandy Miles, the woman who runs the accommodation, said she had no idea.
She also says the local council said nothing about Williams' past.
"We don't get filled with ex-offenders but when we do I ask them what they've done. I rely on them to tell me the truth."
She says if she knew about William's past she would have refused to keep him.
Others who've stayed with her include people who've lost everything in a house fire, or who've had their homes flooded, she says.
It also includes Rolly who was sent to the Sirhowy Arms Hotel to recover from heart surgery.
He'd lost his home after being made redundant.
"Some of them come in there, angry young men from prison.
"I was scared for myself sometimes."
He says he is also concerned for people, like Mandy, who offer this accommodation.
"You don't know what kind of background they've got. She could have anyone in there. They could turn on her one day."
Rolly says one fellow resident revealed that they'd just been released from serving a sentence for manslaughter.
Mandy's local authority, Caerphilly Council told Newsbeat: "B&Bs are used for short-term emergency accommodation while a permanent solution's found.
"Those running them are given relevant information about residents where appropriate."
Mandy however insists that didn't happen in the case of Matthew Williams.
She says data protection laws - designed to protect private information - are to blame for details being withheld.
She wants the system changed: "Any service provider who has taken in a prisoner needs to know their background.
"That Data Protection Act is no good to us. Not when someone has been killed."
And it seems more and more people are facing weeks, sometimes months, in these environments.
Women's Aid told Newsbeat one in six dedicated domestic violence refuges have been closed in the last ten years, due to funding cuts.
The housing charity Shelter told us the number of homeless families living in bed and breakfast (B&B) accommodation in England has almost doubled in just three years.
