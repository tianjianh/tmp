[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Metropolitan Police officers have been interviewed under caution over suggestions they failed to properly respond to an incident in which a man was killed.

The two sergeants from Croydon, south London, are on restricted duties pending the outcome of the inquiry.
Andrew Else, 52, was stabbed more than 200 times during an incident in Selsdon Park Road, Croydon, in April 2014.
The claims came to light during an ongoing misconduct probe, the Met said.
The Met said officers were at the scene of the attack within seven minutes.
Paranoid schizophrenic Ephraim Norman, 24, admitted Mr Else's manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility in February and was ordered to be detained indefinitely at the maximum security hospital Broadmoor in February.
A file has been handed to the Crown Prosecution Service regarding the two sergeants, who have not been suspended.
Det Ch Supt Alaric Bonthron, from the Directorate of Professional Services, which is carrying out the investigation, said: "The suggestion that any police officer has in some way failed to do their duty and respond properly to any call for a response must be fully and properly investigated.
"If any officer has failed in their duty it is only right that they are held to account.
"Everyday in London police officers work hard to keep the public safe.  Allegations such as these trouble us all."
