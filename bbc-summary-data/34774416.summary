Henry Reilly: Former UKIP member joins TUV

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former UKIP councillor Henry Reilly has joined Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Reilly, from Kilkeel in County Down, was expelled from UKIP last week. He had originally been suspended in September.
He was UKIP's candidate in last year's European elections, receiving more than 24,000 votes.
TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Reilly "fits exactly into the TUV profile".
"Henry is both a proven, staunch traditional unionist and a Eurosceptic," Mr Allister said.
"I welcome him as a considerable asset to the party."
