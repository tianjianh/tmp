Burnley 1-2 Manchester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sergio Aguero scored twice as Manchester City came back from a goal down to earn a hard-fought win at Burnley and claim back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time since September.

The home side might have had a penalty before surprisingly taking lead when City defender Nicolas Otamendi could only head a clearance straight to Clarets midfielder Dean Marney, who volleyed in from 25 yards.
City struggled for fluency but Aguero equalised when he poked in a shot at the far post after a corner was deflected into his path.
The visitors controlled the game after the break and took the lead when a Fernandinho cross hit Aguero and went in after some sloppy Burnley defending.
Clarets defender Michael Keane had a late header blocked by Aleksandar Kolarov and an overhead kick from Ashley Barnes was saved by City keeper Claudio Bravo but Burnley failed to prevent a third home loss in the top flight this season.

This was hardly City at their best but their battling win highlighted their squad strength and battling spirit at what is proving one of the tougher trips in the Premier League this season.
City boss Pep Guardiola was worried about the toll on his players after his side's Champions League exertions at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday, with his side having lost one and drawn two of their past three games following outings in Europe.
He made five changes to his starting line-up, including leaving out defender John Stones and putting key player Kevin de Bruyne on the bench, as he wanted "fresh legs".
However, City conceded early on - and now have just two clean sheets in their past 16 league games - before they improved and dominated the second half to claim a sixth away win out of seven in the top flight.
"If you want to be a champion you have to play a game like this," said City skipper Fernandinho.
Aguero's goals were not exactly collectors' items but it was his ability to be in the right place at the right time which proved key against Burnley.
The Argentine's movement, desire and ability on the ball kept the Burnley defence occupied and he has now scored more than 10 goals in each of his six seasons in the Premier League.
Aguero has now scored against 29 of the 30 different teams that he's faced in the Premier League, only failing to score against Bolton.
"He played really well and moved really well. He had a really good game," said Guardiola.
"From the beginning he was ready, his body language was very good."
Burnley boss Sean Dyche wanted a reaction from his side after the 4-0 hammering by West Brom on Monday, and he certainly got it as they were back to their tenacious selves against City.
Dyche's side had a strong shout for a penalty after Otamendi shoved Jeff Hendrick before Marney gave them the lead with his first top-flight goal in 2,558 days.
The home side were helped by 37-year-old keeper Paul Robinson, making his Clarets debut and first Premier League appearance since May 2012. He produced three key saves before a "comedy of errors" cost them the winner.
"I can't believe we haven't had a penalty again," said Dyche. "You need those decisions in these games. It's an obvious smash in the back and is a penalty."

Burnley boss Sean Dyche: "We deliberately made it awkward for City, by pressing them and playing it forward earlier than I usually believe in.
"Generally it worked very well. I was pleased with our understanding and execution of our tactical plan, and we created enough to get something out of the game."
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: "I have to learn how to control the second balls because in Spain and Germany teams do not play long or with these flat balls and crosses with the same intensity, or so frequently as Burnley did.
"All of our players showed huge character and we are so happy because this week was very important for us.

"The other thing I have to learn about English football is the referees. Sometimes it is a foul, sometimes it isn't. I am not judging them but it is simple like that - here it is completely different to other countries."
