Jordanna Goodwin and Megan Storey, both 16, were killed in a two-car collision near Conisbrough on 15 November.
Fellow passengers Blake Cairns, 16, and Arpad Kore and Bartosz Bortniczak, both 18, also died.
Speaking for the first time since charges against one of the drivers were dropped, Megan's mother, Tracey Storey said "nothing can replace them."
She added: "For both of them to be gone just like that is such a massive, massive loss in our lives.
"Nothing can replace them. The electricity that came from both of them was just amazing."
Jordanna's mother, Vicki McCarthy, added: "They didn't live their lives, it was one life led by the two of them."
The five teenagers, all pupils at Danum Academy, Doncaster, died when the car they were travelling in collided with a grey Seat Leon. The 45-year-old driver of the Seat suffered a broken leg.
Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case against a 21-year-old man driving a third car, who was arrested on suspicion of causing the deaths by dangerous driving.
Mark Marriott, senior crown prosecutor for Yorkshire and Humberside, said: "After an extensive police investigation, we have not been able to identify any evidence that would prove to the very high standard required in a criminal case that the driver of the car being followed contributed to the collision."
The girls were buried in pink coffins following a joint funeral service in November attended by hundreds of family, friends and pupils from their school.
Ms Storey said she had to carry on with her life for the sake of her other two children.
"I think a part of me has died with her," she said.
"I'll just remember her as being the fun-loving, beautiful person that she always has been."
