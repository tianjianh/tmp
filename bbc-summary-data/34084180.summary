Scotland's first national plan to better protect peatlands has been published.

Campaigners argue they need to be preserved because they support biodversity and also store carbon.
Scottish Natural Heritage's National Peatland Plan highlights actions to protect, manage and restore peatlands.
The Flow Country in Caithness and Sutherland is Europe's largest area of blanket bog peatlands, extending to 1,544 sq miles (4,000 sq km).
Peat is found across large parts of Scotland, storing an estimated 3,000 megatonnes of carbon as well as providing a habitat for a range of wild animals and plants.
Dr Aileen McLeod, Minister for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, welcomed the release of the plan.
She said: "Scotland is a peat-rich nation, and our peatlands are now recognised globally for their outstanding biodiversity and carbon storage.
"I am delighted to see the publication of a plan which sets out what we are doing, and where we are heading, in our programme to conserve and restore peatlands and so support the multiple benefits they deliver.
"I thank the many organisations and individuals who have contributed to the plan which sets a firm foundation for action."
Ms McLeod added: "I am also greatly heartened by the significant roles played by land managers and non-government organisations in improving the state of our peatlands."
The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has described peatlands as a "Cinderella habitat" which has been "overlooked and undervalued".
Jonathan Hughes, of IUCN UK, said: "Scotland's National Peatland Plan is a vital to tackling the globally important issue of peatland conservation.
"We urgently need to convert peatlands from a liability to an asset. Healthy peatlands can lock up carbon, support wildlife, regulate water flow and improve water quality - but only if we make an investment to restore them.
"We must all play our part but clear leadership from the Scottish government with the right policies and funding in place is essential if people are to be empowered to look after Scotland's peatlands and appreciate their true benefits to society."
