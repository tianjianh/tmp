[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 2-1 Sheffield United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steve Morison's 89th-minute penalty secured a 2-1 victory for Millwall over Sheffield United at The Den.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 32-year-old coolly tucked away the spot-kick after Jack O'Connell's handball in a thrilling climax. Shaun Williams and Stefan Scougall had traded first-half goals.
Lions boss Neil Harris made two changes to the side thumped 5-1 at Peterborough, with Williams and David Worrall replacing Shane Ferguson and Jimmy Abdou.
The visitors named Paul Coutts in their starting line-up and were quickest out of the blocks with Mark Duffy's cross narrowly eluding Leon Clarke.
But Williams fired the hosts in front on 14 minutes, beating Simon Moore with a low drive after Worrall's corner was not cleared.
United hit back just seven minutes later as Jordan Archer failed to keep out Scougall's tame shot. Lee Gregory wasted a great chance to restore the lead after the break, the striker raced clear on goal but was denied by Moore's outstretched left hand.
Gregory's miss did not prove decisive though, as Morison kept his cool to send Moore the wrong way from the spot and earn the Lions a dramatic victory.
Report supplied by the Press Association.
Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder told BBC Radio Sheffield:
"It's disappointing for everyone at the football club. One point from four games isn't good enough.
"We started well and went behind against the run of play, and showed great steel to get back in the game and dominated the first half.
"But when you're on top, you have to put teams to bed and that's been the downfall for us.
"I've let the players think about their own performances, think about what's happened over the last four games and make a more sensible appraisal on Monday.
"If you've been involved with this club and you feel a lot about the club, as I do, you get very emotional about the start we've had and I need to take myself out of that situation and make a more considered approach on Monday because one point out of four games is not good enough and we're all hurting."
