James Haskell and Jack Nowell are set to miss England's third and final Test against Australia in Sydney.

Flanker Haskell - who made 21 tackles in Saturday's historic series-clinching victory in Melbourne - left AAMI Park wearing a protective boot.
Wing Nowell suffered a head injury in the 23-7 win, and will go through the concussion return-to-play protocols.
Both men are unlikely to be considered for selection as England look to seal a 3-0 whitewash next Saturday.

Captain Dylan Hartley says it will take a combined effort from all 32 players in the squad to complete the clean sweep.
"The challenge within the group is to win 3-0," Hartley told BBC Sport.
"If we are really serious about improving as a team and getting better every time we play, we have to go out there and train next week and win next week as well."
The Northampton hooker says the players will be desperate to avoid complacency before the final match of the season.
"It's the biggest challenge," he added. "We could easily park it and think about holidays and not really care about next week.
"The harsh reality of sport is that you are always judged on your next performance.
"We want to be the best in the world. We have climbed from eighth to second - which is an achievement - but there is still a long way to go."
