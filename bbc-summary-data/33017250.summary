The pace of hiring permanent staff in the UK slowed down in May, according to a report.

KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) reported that the rate of expansion in hiring employees sank to a four-month low.
The rate of growth in short-term jobs however had sped up since April, the report addded.
It suggested that companies needed time to "digest the election result", which saw the Conservatives win a majority.
The number of job vacancies made available also fell to their slowest in 2015.
Although starting salaries for permanent employees continued to grow, the pace of growth sank to its lowest since April's nine-month high.
Recruitment agencies reported that the pay of temporary and contracted staff also continued to grow, although at its slowest since January.
The availability of temporary staff saw its fastest drop in seven months, leading recruitment consultants to report difficulties in hiring suitable people.
KPMG partner Bernard Brown said: "The UK job market saw a slight slowdown in May, as those on boards took time to digest the election result and work out the ramifications for their business.
" The public sector continues to suffer, with pay growth rising by just 0.2% in the last reported quarter."
