Ouseph, 29, faces the Danish fourth seed, who beat Ireland's Scott Evans 21-16 21-12, on Wednesday.
Langridge and Ellis have a chance to secure Britain's first Olympic badminton medal since Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms won mixed doubles silver in Athens 12 years ago.
"Our record against the Chinese pair is not as good as we would like but the thing is, this is the Olympics and anything can happen," said Langridge.
"If you had told me before the start that we would make the semi-finals I would have bitten your hand off.
"It is amazing - we are one of these pairs that are quite up and down - but this tournament we have shown our ability."
