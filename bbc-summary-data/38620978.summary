The Tynesiders forged in front after 35 minutes as Jordan Burrow glanced in Wes York's pinpoint corner.
Just before half-time, Gary Waddock's men equalised when Scott Rendell collected Jake Gallagher's pass and cracked an angled shot into the bottom-right corner.
After the interval, York fluffed a golden opportunity to put the Heed ahead when he blazed over from close range with only the goalkeeper to beat.
Gateshead also came close to a winner when James Bolton had a header cleared off the line by Tony Straker.
