Chris Gayle is targeting another big World Twenty20 score when West Indies take on India in Thursday's semi-final.

The 36-year-old hit a 47-ball ton in his side's first game, against England.
The opener has batted just once since, scoring four against South Africa as the West Indies topped Group 1 to set up the last-four clash with the hosts.
"This is a perfect opportunity to try and pick up where I left off, get a big one for the team and put them in a winning position," said Gayle.
West Indies tarnished their record in the Super 10 stage by losing to Afghanistan by six runs in their final match, after having followed the win over England with victories against Sri Lanka and South Africa.
Thursday's opponents India have also lost once in the competition - their opening game against New Zealand - but have followed that up with three successive victories.
"The only positive you can look from the Afghanistan game is the motive,'' said Gayle.
"We saw India bounce back from losing games as well, so it can put us in a strong position as well to actually lift our game and do better on Thursday."
Virat Kohli has been key in guiding India into the semi-finals with 55 against arch-rival Pakistan and an unbeaten 82 off 51 balls in the must-win last group match against Australia.
Gayle is not surprised by the form of India's master middle-order batsman, who has scored 184 runs at an impressive average of 92.
"No surprise there," he added. "I have said it over the years he is going to be the world beater he is today.
"He has been fantastic right through the year. He has been in a great form. He can still get runs but in a losing cause. We'll be happy with that as well."
