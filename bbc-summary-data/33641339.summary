[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Withers, 82, fell 4m (12ft) to his death at a NHS medical centre in Fareham, Hampshire, in September 2012.
An inquest jury at Portsmouth Guildhall had previously heard the glass-panelled walkway Mr Withers had been using was "severely decayed".
Mr Withers was pronounced dead at the scene and died of head injuries.
Health and safety inspector Michael Baxter earlier said that after decades of exposure the walkway was "badly decayed", adding "all natural structural integrity was lost"
The coroner had heard that maintenance was the responsibility of the now defunct body NHS Portsmouth, but that despite the matter being referred 19 times it was not considered high priority.
Mr Withers' son Trevor told the inquest his father had been riding a mobility scooter for four years and the one he was on had been used for about six months.
He also said his father was "very safety conscious".
