Bradley Dredge: Welsh golfer slumps to miss US Open cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' Bradley Dredge missed the cut at the halfway stage of the US Open at Erin Hills in Wisconsin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dredge, taking part in his first US Open, hit a one over par 73 in the second round to go to three over.
Birdies on the second, fifth, 10th and 15th holes were undone by a double bogey on the third and bogeys on the eighth, 12th and 14th.
That left the 44-year-old Welshman 10 shots behind a four-way tie for the lead.
English duo Paul Casey and Tommy Fleetwood, and Americans Brian Harman and Brooks Koepka are locked at seven under.
