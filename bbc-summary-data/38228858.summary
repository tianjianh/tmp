Crabb warns UK ministers on 'foot-dragging' on Swansea tidal lagoon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former cabinet minister has warned the UK government against "foot-dragging" over the proposed Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project.

Ex-Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb told a Westminster debate there were "powerful and compelling arguments" for ministers to support the project.
But Energy Minister Jesse Norman said a decision this year was "unrealistic".
An independent report into the technology was submitted to ministers on Tuesday afternoon.
Supporters say the project would create and deliver enough energy for 150,000 homes over 120 years.
They argue that, over time, it would require less subsidy than nuclear power.
Mr Crabb, Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, said: "This can't become another third runway decision where industry makes repeated calls for a government only for it to be kicked further down the road there is too much at stake on this occasion."
Mr Crabb said "a myth of unaffordability" had grown up around the vision of tidal lagoons.
He reported to MPs that a minister had told him it was "eyewateringly expensive".
Mr Crabb said it was "embarrassingly clear" that minister did not understand the project at all.
He said he hoped for the go-ahead to be given next spring or summer.
But Mr Norman said that the lagoon technology was "new and untested" and had to deliver value for money.
Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: "The tidal lagoon could bring thousands of jobs to Wales and put millions into our economy so it's hard to fathom why the UK government are delaying the decision yet again.
