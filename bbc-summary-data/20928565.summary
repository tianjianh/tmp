[SN]TITLE[SN]
Become a BBC Sport app beta user

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fancy trying out our newest BBC Sport app features before the rest of the public? We're looking for a small group of regular app users to offer exclusive access to the latest version of our award-winning app. Think you fit the bill? Read the instructions below...

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BBC Sport app open beta programme provides an opportunity for BBC Sport users to test the latest versions of our app before we release it to a wider audience. This will help ensure we provide the best possible experience for the audience and also provide beta users with the opportunity to feed back on our latest features so we can improve them further before they are fully launched.
As this is a pre-release beta version of the app, it may contain some errors and new features may not fully function. If this might be a problem for you, you should not join the beta group and continue using the latest version of the BBC Sport app.
The beta programme is available to UK users of the BBC Sport Android app. All users on Android 4.4 and above are eligible. We are looking to recruit regular users of the app who visit frequently and are therefore more likely to discover new features and changes. Unfortunately we are only able to accept a limited number of beta testers on a first come, first served basis. We plan to extend our beta programme to Apple's iOS platform in the future.
Beta testers will be given early access to the latest releases of the BBC Sport app. The latest version may include new features and designs not currently available to the wider audience. Your feedback will help us to identify and fix any problems plus will be pivotal in deciding whether we adapt a feature further before we launch. We may even decide to cease development of a new feature or design change if we receive a lot of negative feedback.
Android users can sign up to be a beta tester on Google Play (external site). Once you've been enrolled you can download the beta app from the Google Play store, just as you would with your other BBC apps. The beta version of the BBC Sport app will replace your current version and you will be notified when new releases are available.
Unfortunately this is not possible. In order for you to download the latest public release of the app you would need to delete the current beta version on your device. Google Play restricts users to using either the live or beta version only.
There are three simple steps to complete to send your feedback while in the app:
Step 1 - Tap to access the menu.
Step 2 - Expand the 'Other' section.
Step 3 - Tap 'Send Feedback'.
Step 4 - Select the mail client you wish to use to send an email to us.
Step 5 - Add your feedback to the email alongside the device information - this will help us resolve any issues with bugs or crashes.
Step 6 - Hit send and we will review your feedback.
Alternatively you can leave feedback in the Google Play store.
All you need to do is use the app as you would do normally and provide feedback on any changes or issues. What do you think of the latest design changes, navigation or new features? Generally, how could we improve the app?
If you have a problem while using the app, please contact us. We'll get back to you as quickly as possible.
If you have requested a response we will aim to respond within two working days.
Yes. Once you are enrolled in the programme, your Google account will be associated with our beta programme. All you have to do is go to the Google Play store on any of your devices and you will be offered the option to download the beta version of the app.
There is no restriction on the number of devices you can use the beta app with.
No. As the beta app is distributed through the Google Play store, it works just like any regular app - no changes to your device are required.
To leave the beta group please visit the URL below on your Android Device and select the 'Opt Out' option:
Google Play (external link)
This will remove your Google account from the BBC Sport app beta programme.
It may take several hours for your account settings to be updated once you opt out.
