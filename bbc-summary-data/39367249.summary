Boss Flynn calls for Newport to stop conceding penalties

Newport County boss Mike Flynn does not believe the remarkable number of penalties his side has conceded is down to bad luck.

The Exiles have given away 19 spot-kicks this campaign, more than any other side in League Two.
That statistic has contributed to Newport finding themselves six points from safety.
"We've not been unlucky, there's been mistakes. I will be drumming it home to the boys again," said Flynn.
Of the 19 spot-kicks County have given away, 14 of them have been converted, often robbing the Welsh side of points.
Most recently, Luton's  Danny Hylton fired home from 12 yards on Tuesday night before Newport fought back for a point in their bid to avoid dropping out of the Football League.
Caretaker boss Flynn said that while there had been some questionable decisions, it was a lack of care in their own box from his players that was contributing.
"There's been a lot of silly fouls, there's been a few dubious decisions against us, but on the whole I think a lot of them have been penalties," said Flynn.
"You can't dive in in the box, you can't pull shirts. You have to be so careful now, stand up, move you feet, make the striker do something extraordinary to get a shot off.
"But it's done now, I can't change it. I'd love to change it, but we've given away too many penalties and it's cost us."
Newport head to high-flying Portsmouth on Saturday looking to try to drag others into the relegation fight.
The club brought in former Cardiff City manager  Lennie Lawrence to act as  'first team management consultant' alongside Flynn.
But, rather than feeling threatened by the appointment, fledgling manager Flynn said bringing 69-year-old Lawrence in had actually been his idea.
"It was my idea so I obviously welcome him here," Flynn added.
"I'm not arrogant. I know the things I need to improve on and I know what I'm good at.
"If I can't learn from someone like Lenny then I am in the wrong game.
"Against Luton, straight away, his advice was outstanding. His experience is invaluable."
