Men in jail for producing N-bomb drug in Greenock flat

Two men are in jail after being caught at an improvised drugs lab capable of producing £5.5m of the illegal class A drug 25i-NBOMe, known as N-bomb.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dutch nationals Mitchell Lotz, 27, and Robin Sedmak, 29, were arrested during a police raid at a flat in Greenock, Inverclyde, on 14 May 2014.
They both admitted being concerned in the supply of N-bomb.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, sentence on both men was deferred and they were remanded in custody.
The court heard that at the time of the offence, N-bomb was illegal in Britain under a temporary order and was later classified as a Class A drug, like heroin or cocaine.
The powerful synthetic hallucinogen is sold as an alternative to LSD or mescaline.
Police raided the flat in Greenock after receiving information that the address was part of a drug supply operation.
The court heard that Lotz and Sedmak arrived at the flat while officers were carrying out a search.
Lotz was asked if there was anything that was potentially hazardous and replied: "Yes, don't touch the chemicals upstairs with your bare hands."
He said that liquid in a container was "N-bomb".
Advocate depute Allan Nicol told the court: "It appears that N-bomb tabs were being manufactured in the flat and being sold online."
Police found about 1,150,000 tabs at the flat but the vast majority had yet to be dipped with N-bomb.
The court heard that 17,500 dipped tabs were recovered which had a street value of about £88,000.
If the remainder had been dipped the operation had the potential to realise more than £5.5m.
A third man, Roderick Boudewijns, 35, was also found in the flat and later charged with drugs offences, but he was acquitted after the Crown accepted his not guilty pleas.
Boudewijns told officers that his flatmate Lotz had an internet business selling "legal highs".
Laptop computers seized during the raid showed a link between Sedmak's email address and an internet company which sold legal highs and is believed to belong to Sedmak.
Lotz admitted being concerned in the supply of N-bomb between June and December 2013, and being concerned in the supply of ecstasy on 14 May 2014.
Sedmak admitted being concerned in the supply of N-bomb.
