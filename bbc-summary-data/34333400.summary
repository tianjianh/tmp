Elderly care improves at two south Wales hospitals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The risk of serious problems in elderly care at two south Wales hospitals has reduced following improvements.

A review in May 2014 highlighted "serious concerns" over how elderly patients with dementia were treated at the Princess of Wales, Bridgend, and Neath Port Talbot hospitals.
A report on Wednesday said the public should be "significantly reassured", but some areas required more work.
The health board said it was pleased and heartened by the findings.
The original Trusted to Care report gave 14 recommendations, of which eight still need attention. It prompted Health Minister Mark Drakeford to instigate a series of unannounced spot checks at district general hospitals in Wales.
The Trusted to Care 2015 review by Professor June Andrews and Mark Butler that followed, pointed to more work needed in the following areas:
It said a clear deadline for delivery must now be set.
However it praised Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) for its "excellent" progress in addressing issues with making sure elderly patients are well fed, given water and have opportunities to be mobile.
The board has also made progress on making sure enough staff work on elderly care wards, and was praised for "exemplary action" in relation to tackling the improper administration of sedation and medicines.
Overall the report concluded the two hospitals "continued to be exemplary in part" and improvements have been made in the areas where previous serious failings occurred.
However the authors warned: "There remains variation in the patient experience between wards and services, especially at the Princess of Wales hospital", and "more needs to be done" to improve standards and professional practices.
ABMU chief executive Paul Roberts said: "We hope that patients, their families and the public are now assured about the care we are providing.
"It would be a foolish health organisation that claimed the care it provided was always perfect. But we hope that not only are we now providing better care, but our improved systems will help us pick up issues much sooner, deal with them quickly, and better help us learn from mistakes."
Mark Drakeford said he was pleased the report had found progress had been made, and he expected the board to continue the work.
Conservative shadow health minister Darren Millar said the progress was welcome but similar reassurances were also required at other sites, such as the Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital in north Wales, where an investigation found poor patient care amounted to institutional abuse.
