[SN]TITLE[SN]
Borders Railway works compensation claim heads to court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Â£1.6m compensation claim for roads and bridges allegedly damaged during construction of the Borders Railway is to go to court next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dispute between Scottish Borders Council and Network Rail started before the route opened in 2015.
It centres on the condition of the A7 and other minor roads with heavy trucks and plant blamed for the damage.
Talks aimed at resolving the situation have failed and it is now heading to court.
The multi-million pound railway between Tweedbank and Edinburgh was officially opened by the Queen in September 2015.
Major works to transport infrastructure along the length of the route were carried out prior to the opening.
Both Scottish Borders Council and Network Rail have declined to comment on the case.
