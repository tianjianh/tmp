The 21-year-old joined the Cherries in 2013 from non-league Christchurch but is yet to make a first-team appearance for the Premier League club.
He spent last season on loan at Yeovil, scoring eight goals in 42 matches to help them avoid League Two relegation.
Cornick could make his O's debut in Saturday's pre-season friendly against Gillingham at the Matchroom Stadium.
