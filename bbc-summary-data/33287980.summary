Three-day 'jumble sale' in Bristol to sell train lost property

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of unclaimed items found on trains are being sold off in a three-day "jumble sale".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 400 forgotten items are collected by First Great Western (FGW) on its trains each week.
The company's hoard of found objects is being sold from a stall on Bristol's Harbourside.
Bryony Morgan, from eco-initiative Bristol 2015, said the items on display were a small selection of those discovered on board services.
Travellers have 12 weeks to reclaim their lost items, after which time the objects are bagged up and stored in a basement at Bristol Temple Meads station.
Ms Morgan said lost property tended to be newly-purchased items left on board trains by their new owners.
"So the meat and veg of the items on sale are clothes - coats and scarves- shoes and suitcases, she said."
A photo of a couple cutting their wedding cake was also among the items on offer, Ms Morgan added.
Proceeds from the sale will be donated to charity.
