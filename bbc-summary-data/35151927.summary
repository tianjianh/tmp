The force has released images of the suspects and said the stolen gold, worth a lot for sentimental reasons, is "irreplaceable".
A 39-year-old man is being hunted in connection with the crime.
More than 1,400 people were arrested over burglary offences from 21 September to 14 December, the Met said.

Simon Letchford at the Met's Territorial Policing arm said he was stepping up efforts to find and arrest "outstanding wanted suspects" to tackle burglary in the run up to Christmas.
He asked anyone with information to get in touch.
Mr Letchford added: "We will use every means at our disposal to catch those wanted so they can face justice, so our message is clear, 'if your face is on this list, hand yourself in - don't ruin Christmas for your family'."
