[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Garry Barkhouse was so drunk that he did not know what day of the week it was when stopped by police.
A court was told the 48-year-old drank a bottle-and-a-half of vodka before getting behind the wheel.
A sheriff told Barkhouse he was an "intoxicated, incoherent, and incontinent individual".
Barkhouse was found guilty of drink-driving after a trial at Falkirk Sheriff Court in January.
He was banned from driving for five years and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work.
Sheriff Craig Caldwell told Barkhouse: "I told you at the trial you should have been nowhere near a car.
"In fact, given your level of alcohol, I'm surprised you could even find your car, let alone open it and get into it."
Barkhouse, was arrested at the wheel of his daughter's Vauxhall Astra after a concerned member of the public called the police at about 16:30 on 21 September last year.
Two officers saw Barkhouse drive slowly towards them and park.
PC Paul James said it was "immediately apparent" that the driver was heavily under the influence.
He said: "He was kind of slumped, slurring his words, and smelling of alcohol.
"He was very unsteady on his feet and I had to physically conduct him to the rear of the police vehicle.
"At that point I noticed he had urinated himself."
Barkhouse, of Links Road, Bo'ness denied drink-driving.
He said he had been drinking at a friend's house nearby and had got into the car to get some tobacco.
Sheriff Caldwell said he had to weigh up "two competing versions".
He said: "On the one hand I have the Crown case, from two sober and professional road policing officers with over 40 years experience between them.
"On the other hand I have an intoxicated, incoherent and incontinent individual who says he wasn't driving. "
Barkhouse was also placed under supervision for 12 months to get alcohol treatment.
