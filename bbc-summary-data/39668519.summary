Father's agony over Kona Gamble's Cyprus death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father whose son died on holiday in Cyprus four years ago has described his daily agony following his death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kona Gamble, 21, from Braunstone in Leicester, died in summer 2013 after a fall while apparently trying to get to his hotel balcony from the roof above.
His father, Dorian, said seeing his son in hospital before he died was every parent's worse nightmare.
The cause of death was recorded as a head and brain injury as a result of a fall from a height.
The inquest in Cyprus, which was adjourned 12 times, heard that Kona had been drinking in Ayia Napa and returned alone to the four-storey Hotel Christabelle Apartments.
He did not have a key and seems to have got on the roof and then tried to access his 2nd floor balcony from above.
He was found badly injured beside an air conditioning unit on the balcony and died days later.
Mr Gamble said: "It is everyday, you think about it everyday. It has been a nightmare being adjourned 12 times, because you think about it all the time.
"It's every parent's worse nightmare when you there [to hospital] and you see the machines keeping him alive and keeping him going, it wasn't nice at all."
He added Kona's organs were donated and one recipient had got in touch through Facebook with the family to thank them.
"[Kona] had said 'Dad, make sure if I do go, my organs are donated...' that was two weeks before his accident. We kept his promise.
"A guy, same age as me, wanted a liver and he was dying in the hospital, as Kona was dying, and Kona saved his life.
"It felt magic [to receive the message], there was happiness and sadness."
A UK inquest has been opened and adjourned in Leicester, pending further inquiries.
