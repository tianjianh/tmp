Police said the four men, aged 20, 31, 40 and 42, were arrested at addresses in Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Edinburgh, over alleged assaults and disorder.
The operation brought the number of arrests following the game between Rangers and Hibernian to 32.
The men are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Friday.
Det Supt Kenny Graham, who is leading the investigation, said: "This investigation is extensive and involves a significant number of people, however, we remain committed to identifying those involved and rest assured we will identify people and they will be arrested.
"As our investigation progresses, there will be additional arrests and continued police action to track down those responsible.
"I would ask if anyone has any information or knowledge about people involved or for anyone with information, including footage or images, to contact us."
The scenes of disorder at Hampden unfolded after Hibernian won their first Scottish Cup Final in 114 years.
Thousands of Hibs fans invaded the pitch and there were reports of alleged assaults on Rangers players.
A number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch and clashed with rival fans.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.
Rangers players were not able to pick up their cup final medals.
