[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives have gained Southport from the Liberal Democrats who have held the seat for almost two decades.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conservative Damien Moore won 18,541 votes, securing a majority of 2,914 - a swing of 7.6% from the Liberal Democrats who came third.
Liberal Democrat Sue McGuire, who was selected after former MP John Pugh retired, won 12,661 votes. Labour's Liz Savage was second with 15,627 votes.
Elsewhere in Merseyside, Labour retained all of its seats.
There was a turnout of 69.1% in Southport, where Liberal Democrat MP John Pugh had stepped down in May after 16 years representing the town.
He said in April he would retire as he he did not want to work through "the nightmare chaos of Brexit" in the next parliament.
Mr Moore said he will be "hard working" and that people in Southport had told him their priority was to get on with the business of leaving the European Union.
Labour's Liz Savage said coming second was an "historic occasion" for the party.
Labour's Margaret Greenwood retained Wirral West, a marginal seat that was targeted heavily by the Conservatives after they lost it in 2015 when Esther McVey was ousted after just one term.

Ms Greenwood got 54.3% of the vote and an increased majority of over 5,000 from 417, while Conservative Tony Caldeira came second on 42.1%.
She said she believes Labour have done better than expected because more young people voted.
"People really value public services... and realise that you need a Labour government to get them", she said.
There was a clean sweep for Labour in Wirral as Alison McGovern also held Wirral South, winning 25,871 votes.
Former Labour leadership candidate Angela Eagle retained her seat in Wallasey with 72% of the vote and an increased majority.
She said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn "fought a great campaign" and praised his "authenticity and honesty".
Labour MP for Bootle Peter Dowd took a sideswipe at Theresa May in his victory speech after he was re-elected on 42,259 votes with a 36,200 majority.
"We've moved from strong and stable to definitely weak and wobbly," Mr Dowd, who was first elected to the seat in 2015, said.
"Theresa May was walking through wheat fields this week - it's not wheat fields she's walking through tonight, it is something much more smelly."
Labour's Dan Carden retained the party's stronghold in Liverpool Walton, winning 85.7% of the vote.
His 36,175 votes marked an increase of 4.4% on predecessor Steve Rotheram, who is now the party's mayor of the Liverpool City Region.
Laura Evans of the Conservatives came second with 3,624.
Labour's Luciana Berger remains Liverpool Wavertree MP with a sizeable 79.6% share of the vote.
"The result is a very strong indication of people's support for Labour values today... we saw an increase in turnout - it's very heartening - of young people", she said.
Meanwhile in Cheshire, Chris Matheson increased his majority in the marginal seat of Chester by more than 9,000, gaining 32,023 votes. He was defending a majority of 93.
