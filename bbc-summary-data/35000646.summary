[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Ford accused world number 29 Liang Wenbo of "boring him off the table" after losing a final-frame decider in the UK Championship fourth round.

The Leicester man led China's Liang 2-0, 3-2 and 5-3 but lost three frames in a row to miss out the quarter-finals.
"He is the most boring player I have played this season," Ford told BBC Sport. "He was so slow.
"Every time he got to the table he took so long. When I did come back I felt I had not been there for half an hour."
Ford, who beat Scott Donaldson, former world champion Mark Williams and Shangai Masters champion Kyren Wilson to move into the last 16, eased into a 2-0 lead and seemed well on top.
But Liang suddenly found his form, scoring a superb 122 in frame three and a 67 in the fourth frame to go in level at the mid-session break.
Ford responded with breaks of 86, 58 and 92 to take three of the next four frames and lead 5-3.
"I didn't really get too many chances for 5-3," Ford added. "I got a chance at 5-4, a difficult black which I rattled, and I didn't really get a chance in the last frame.
"I played well but am just disappointed with the way I went out. If I had got played off the table then fair enough, but to get bored off the table is something different.
"I don't like slow play. I actually heard a few people behind me saying they were bored."
