Members of the George Formby Society performed at the unveiling on Inner Promenade in Fairhaven.
Marion Coupe, from the Lytham St Annes Civic Society, said she was "amazed" there was still so much interest in the entertainer.
"We didn't publicise the event, but so many people have got to hear about it, it's wonderful," she said.
The house, built in 1932, was originally named Cintra and has another musical link - Formby bought it from tenor Joseph Locke.
Formby, who was born George Hoy Booth in Wigan, Greater Manchester, in 1904.
He was a comedian, actor, singer and songwriter who appeared in 21 films and was awarded an OBE in 1946 for entertaining British and American troops during World War II.
