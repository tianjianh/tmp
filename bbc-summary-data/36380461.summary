Claire Rafferty, Toni Duggan, Eniola Aluko and Katie Chapman have been left out after being in the last squad.
Jade Moore, Jodie Taylor and PFA Women's Player of the Year Isobel Christiansen all return after injury.
England first face Serbia at home at Wycombe on 4 June, then travel to Stara Pazova for the away tie on 7 June.
The Lionesses are unbeaten in Group 7 of qualifying for next year's tournament, but are second behind Belgium, who have played one game more.
"Sometimes to get better, you have to make big decisions," said Sampson, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra.
"Chapman has been fantastic for us, I can't talk highly enough about her. But it will do her good to have a break and come back refreshed."
On Aluko, who described being dropped as "tough", Sampson responded: "She will do her best to force her way back into our plans."
Following the squad announcement, Chelsea captain Chapman scored as her side beat Sunderland 2-1 in Women's Super League One.
She told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra she was "disappointed" to miss out, but had "nothing to prove".
Houston Dash's Daly, 24, was last in a squad in 2014, while 22-year-old Parris was an unused replacement in the most recent squad.
Sampson said: "Rachel has been playing very well in the NWSL with Houston Dash and really fits the profile of a Lioness, so I am delighted to welcome her into the group.
"We have selected a squad that I believe can get us the six points we want against Serbia. It's great to welcome back Jade, Izzy and Jodie who have been fantastic for England every time they have been called up and they will have a big, positive impact on the group.
"Serbia will be coming here full of confidence after getting a hard-earned draw in Belgium, so we will need to produce a good performance to get the win."
