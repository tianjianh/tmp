Ten victims are still being treated at two hospitals after the shooting and officials are investigating a motive. But police have described how Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27 had an arsenal of weaponry in their home.
Here is a look at the numbers behind the US' latest mass shooting.
14
people dead in initial shooting at Inland Regional Center
21 people injured
2 police officers injured
While some individual family members have come forward to confirm the loss of their loved ones, police have not named all 14 killed in the attack. Officials are still notifying relatives.
65-75
rounds fired by Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik during initial shooting
1600 bullets found on couple after they died in gun battle with police
More than 3,000 rounds later found inside their home
While inside the Inland Regional Center, the two suspects fired dozens of shots, but had vastly more ammunition on hand.
Bombs and bomb-making tools
3
pipe bombs attached together left at Inland Regional Center, but failed to detonate
12 pipe bombs found at attackers' house
100s of tools found at home police say could be used to construct more bombs
In addition to large numbers of rifle and handgun rounds, Farook and Malik had a number of already assembled pipe bombs and elements for even more in their home.
deadliest
mass shooting since Sandy Hook Elementary School (2012)
6th Deadliest since 1949 (14 - same number of deceased as 1986 post office attack)
33 Number of people killed in deadliest mass shooting incident overall (Virginia Tech, 2007)
Virginia Tech remains the deadliest single-day shooting in the US but this attack is not far from that distinction, matching the number of killed in a 1986 post office shooting (not including deaths of perpetrators).
