Casement Park: GAA says new stadium capacity not 'pre-determined'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) has said that the redeveloped Casement Park in west Belfast may not now lead to a 38,000 capacity stadium as originally planned.

The association said it is working on a new design for the stadium and will hold a 20-week public consultation.
In a statement, it said capacity of the new design is not "pre-determined".
The multi-million pound project has been beset with problems and delays.
Planning permission for the redevelopment was overturned in 2014 after objections by local residents.
Safety concerns have also been raised about how long it would take for the new stadium to be evacuated in the event of an emergency.
Tom Daly, chairman of the Casement Park Project Board, said that the GAA were now launching "an entirely new process that will inform the design and build of the new stadium".
"We're still in the early stages, with the consultation and technical evaluations set to inform the stadium design at a later stage," he said.
Mr Daly added that a "proposed capacity" will emerge after consultation with various groups such as statutory agencies, the PSNI and the public.
DUP MLA William Humphrey, who has been scrutinising the stadium plans as part of Stormont's culture, arts and leisure committee, welcomed the move.
"I think that's progress," he said. "People need to be realistic about this.
"We can't get certification around this stadium with the capacity that is being talked about, 38,000, without the approval of Belfast City Council, without the statutory agencies agreeing and expertise of the sports ground safety authorities.
"All of that should have been happening and I'm glad it's going to happen now."
