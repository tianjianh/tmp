Caerphilly council is to consult on proposed physical improvements in Newbridge and regeneration of derelict land for economic and community use.
Plans for Bargoed include a new site for business as well as an urban park.
Projects which include funds for firms in both towns to improve the frontage of their premises will be delivered by mid-2015, the Welsh government said.
Finance Minister Jane Hutt announced the funding while on a visit to Newbridge.
The Welsh government said the new money will build on previous projects which included the Calzaghe Bridge - named after local boxing hero Joe Calzaghe - and the renovation of Newbridge Memorial Hall and Institute.
Ms Hutt said: "The funding will help build on progress already made in creating an attractive environment to ensure the success of both towns.
"It will also boost private sector investment and contribute towards the long term economic prosperity of the area.
"This is another example of how Wales benefits from EU Funds and membership of the EU."
Ken James, Caerphilly cabinet member for planning and sustainable development, said: "Over recent years we have seen some dramatic transformations of some of our key towns in the Caerphilly county borough.
"Working in partnership with Welsh government, we are able to make a commitment to grow and enhance our existing town centres to create attractive, vibrant and prosperous places for residents and visitors to live, work and visit."
