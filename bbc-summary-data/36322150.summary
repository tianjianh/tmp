Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) chief executive Martyn Phillips says changing the Six Nations could improve the competition.

Newly-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said moving the Six Nations to April "could be a solution" along the way to forming a global rugby calendar.
"If you sit on something and expect it to be good the year after, it probably won't as things change," Phillips said.
"There's lots of opportunities to make things better. We're trying to be broad in how we look at it."
Phillips told BBC Wales Sport: "The fact the Six Nations can be reviewed and made a better tournament, I would do that every year and I am sure the other guys would say the same."
The WRU chief executive, who was appointed in July 2015, said implementing any changes could be difficult on a global scale due to differing conditions on either side of the world.
"There won't be a solution that fits for everybody, it's impossible. One hemisphere's in summer whilst the other one is in winter," Phillips continued.
"Everything will be about compromise but everything we do has got to be right for rugby, the players, the supporters, the sponsors."
Phillips' colleague at the WRU, chairman Gareth Davies, warned against making changes to the tournament, which has taken place during winter since its Home Nations tournament inception in 1883, without cooperation from other nations.
"Moving the Six Nations can't just be considered in isolation, it's part of the bigger picture," Davies told BBC Wales Sport.
"We need to look at whether it's possible to get a proper global season with some sort of coherence and to look at player welfare to ensure they aren't playing too much.
"Moving it, and indeed moving other things, would have to be considered in order to facilitate the bigger picture of a global season."
