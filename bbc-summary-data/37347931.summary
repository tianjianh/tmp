Sgt Emile Cilliers, 36, of Amesbury, Wiltshire, was arrested after his wife Victoria fell 4,000ft (1,219m) on 5 April 2015.
Mr Cilliers faces a further charge of criminal damage reckless to the endangerment of life of the couple's two children.
He has been released on bail.
He will appear in Salisbury Crown Court in October.
Victoria Cilliers suffered "multiple serious injuries" after falling to the ground during a routine jump near Netheravon Airfield over Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire on 5 April.
