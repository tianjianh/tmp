[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Timothy Mardon, 51, was shot in the thigh by raiders - who wrongly believed he was a drug dealer - in Sible Hedingham, Essex, in February.
Gunman Charlie Sims, 23, was convicted of attempted murder and aggravated burglary following a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court.
Christoper Bergin, 27, was also found guilty of aggravated burglary.
Police described it as an "extremely violent crime which left a man fighting for his life".

As well as the attempted murder and aggravated burglary charges, Sims - of North Road, Great Yeldham - was convicted of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.
Bergin, of Hawkwood Road, Sible Hedingham, was also found guilty of wounding with intent, and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.
A third defendant, Kalebh Shreeve, 24 of Gibson Road in Sible Hedingham, was cleared of all charges.
"Charlie Simms and Christopher Bergin are violent, dangerous men and Essex will be a safer place with them off the streets," Det Ch Insp Leighton Hammett said following the verdicts.
"This was not a premeditated attack but one conjured up on a whim following a night of heavy drinking and smoking drugs.
"It was an attack based on the fictional notion drugs were being grown at the victim's house.
"It is galling that they were prepared to use this level of extreme violence with such little thought and paid such little regard for the welfare of the victim."
The pair will be sentenced at a later date.
