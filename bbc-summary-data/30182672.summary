Stevi: Scampi with Simon Cowell 'best hour of my life'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevi Ritchie may have been voted off The X Factor on Sunday, but he's got no intention of heading back to his former job at a call centre.

Not after his whirlwind bromance with Simon Cowell.
It was the second week in a row he'd been in the bottom two, and a showdown with favourite Andrea Faustini proved too much.
But Stevi told Newsbeat he's got no regrets, and he wants his new friend Simon to give him a job.
"I'm happy I went out on such a high, and to the best singer in the competition," he said.
He sang live to a TV audience of millions but Stevi says one of the best things about the whole X Factor experience was a dinner date with Simon Cowell.
"It was the best hour of my life - seeing him and having a beer, talking about girls and dates and X Factor - just everything two guys will talk about on a Saturday night before they hit the lash.
"I was waiting for him in the cab - with Dutch courage, a pint of beer in my hand.
"They shut off half the area in the Harvester, and we walked in together.
"It was like carnage - people were like VROOM, like flies on poo. Everyone wanted a picture.
"He ordered scampi and chips and I ordered a mixed grill. He was like, 'Cor blimey, Stevi you could feed 10 people with that.' It was massive. It was like a cow on a plate.
"He said it was the best scampi and chips he ever tried - he's a down-to-earth geezer.
"Me and Simon have a connection, a bond off-camera.
"It's the persona I love, and I still get star struck every time I see him."
So what was his advice on dating?
"He said you just gotta be you," he revealed.
"He's just like got this thing - women are just drawn to him, he's just like this 'Mr Charisma' with his shirt unbuttoned."
Stevi says Simon has promised to set him up with Sarah Jane Crawford, Sinitta, and "some of his PA staff as well".
"He's helping a man out - he's helping a friend out in need," said Stevi, although he admits no dates have actually been set up as yet.
And what about Sarah-Jane Crawford? On Sunday night's Xtra Factor Louis and Simon implied Stevi had spent the night with her.
"I'll put the rumour straight. We did not spend the night together," he said. "I wish.
"Sarah Jane Crawford is absolutely fit as they come - I've got a bit of a soft spot for her."
She's not the only one.
"Mel B is very attractive - I remember the first time seeing her at the audition, I couldn't keep my eyes off her and Cheryl."
So what next for Stevi?
"I don't think I'll get a record deal," he said. But he's not short of ideas.
"I wouldn't mind some musicals or some TV presenting, and West End or Broadway is something I've always wanted to do - I'll even throw EastEnders in there."
And he's asked his new best friend for a job too. And Simon's reaction?
"He sort of laughed, so I don't know."
Whatever the future holds, Stevi says he'll still be watching X Factor.
"I think Ben (Haenow) or Fleur (East) will definitely be in the final out of the three. I want one of them to win and I'll put money on it."
