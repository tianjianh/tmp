[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dave Allen has resigned as chairman and director of League One side Chesterfield.

Allen, who previously had shares in Sheffield Wednesday, took over back in 2012 from Barrie Hubbard.
The Spireites twice won the League Two title during his time at the club and also the Johnstone's Paint Trophy.
Allen said he "never intended to become chairman", adding: "It is a sad day for me, but I can't carry on like this. I wish you all the best."
He announced his decision at the club's AGM on Monday, saying he had originally planned to only be an investor and then sell on his investment.
"I took over as chairman because the previous incumbent sat at the end of the boardroom table and said after one meeting that unless I put a further £600,000 into the club, they could not carry on," he said.
"The reason I'm resigning is because at the board meeting held this afternoon, I suggested that all the directors should not seek repayment of loans and waive any interest until such time as the club is in a position to pay it.
"The interest alone amounts to just over £150,000 per annum, so it would be a considerable saving.
"Over the last couple of years, I've put in an extra £1.9m, for which I personally have not taken any interest at all."
Chesterfield are currently bottom of League One, seven points adrift of safety, with only three wins from 17 matches.
