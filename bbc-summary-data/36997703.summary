The attack followed a minor crash between a car and a van on Gressel Lane, Kitts Green at about 18:30 BST on Friday.
The van driver hit the car driver in an "unprovoked" assault before leaving the scene, police said.
The motorist suffered serious head injuries and is unconscious in hospital.
"This was a vicious attack on a family man who was on his way home to his partner and four-year-old child," Det Cons Katie Lees of West Midlands Police said.
"The road is a really busy road and we are sure that there were lots of people who would have seen what happened and we are appealing for them to come forward."
She appealed to the van driver to "search his conscience".
"We have several lines of inquiry and it is only a matter of time before we come knocking at your door," she added.
