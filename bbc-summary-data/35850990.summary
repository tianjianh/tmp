Union reps back Glasgow council strikes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A strike by Glasgow City Council staff over changes to public holiday entitlement has moved a step closer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
GMB shop stewards unanimously voted for industrial action in protest at the removal of bank holidays from contracts and changes to flexi-time working.
The changes include six public holidays being replaced with annual leave days.
GMB Scotland will ballot members working for the council over the next month with a view to holding a minimum two-day strike in either May or June.
The union claims staff who regularly receive enhanced payments for working the set holidays will lose out by Â£500 a year on average.
GMB regional organiser Benny Rankin said: "GMB Scotland's members have consistently told the council that we will oppose these changes.
"This was never an empty threat, and if the council ever thought it was, this will be yet another error in a long line of errors from this administration.
"Our members are determined to see this fight through to the end. It is now up to the employer, Glasgow City Council, to come to the table and have meaningful discussions with the trade unions rather than provide sounds bites without any substance."
A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: "We are disappointed that GMB Scotland has opted for this course of action.
"The council is dealing with an unprecedented cut to our budget which means we must find Â£130m of savings in the next two years.
"We will continue to work with the union to find an agreed way forward."
