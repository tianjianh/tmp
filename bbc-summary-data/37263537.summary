[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 2-0 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton secured back-to-back wins by beating Walsall at a rain-sodden Sixfields, extending their unbeaten league run to 31 games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides had early chances in a bright start to the game as Northampton's Kenji Gorre spooned over and Amadou Bakayoko forced home goalkeeper Adam Smith into a fine save.
The breakthrough arrived on 24 minutes when Harry Beautyman delivered a pinpoint cross which Matty Taylor expertly guided into the far corner.
Beautyman twice went close to adding an immediate second, sending a low effort whistling wide and then shooting straight at Saddlers goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.
For Walsall, Kieron Morris screwed a long-range attempt wide and Scott Laird spurned a glorious chance to level when side-footing wide.
Etheridge brilliantly denied Alex Revell on two occasions in the second-half.
But he could do nothing about Northampton's killer second goal which came on 78 minutes when Revell confidently rolled home a penalty after Jason McCarthy had handled inside the area.
