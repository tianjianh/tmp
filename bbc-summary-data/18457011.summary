Nick Skelton, 54, is appointed OBE after 33 years as an elite showjumper.
"I am truly honoured to be awarded an MBE by Her Majesty, particularly in her Jubilee year," Donald said.
"Both 2011 and 2012 have been very significant years for me, both personally and professionally, and I am touched that my accomplishments have been recognised in this way."
Donald became the first golfer to top both the European and PGA Tour money lists last year and has had 48 weeks as world number one since first achieving that honour in May 2011.
Tessa Jowell, the former Olympics minister who played a key role in London winning the right to stage the 2012 Games, becomes CBE, as does UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner, who led a successful bid for London to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships.
Veteran athletics coach Malcolm Arnold, still working for UK Athletics at 72, is appointed OBE and Peter Keen, former performance director of UK Sport, becomes CBE.
Alison Williamson becomes MBE for services to archery and Alex Arthur receives the same honour for services to boxing.
Former Chelsea and Celtic player Elliott, 48, is honoured for services to equality and diversity in football. His CBE represents the highest honour so far received by any player from the Premier League era.
Elliott, who works for anti-discrimination group Kick It Out, said: "I am flabbergasted by this honour, and feel privileged and humbled.
"You do not set out in life to win these honours, I have just tried to make a bit of a difference and I would like to thank organisations such as Kick It Out for all the work they have done."
Skelton, who recovered from breaking his neck in 2000, is Britain's number one showjumper more than three decades after his national debut.
He said: "I am very, very pleased and this is great for the sport of showjumping as well. It is a real honour."
Warner, who was appointed chairman of the 2017 World Athletics Championships earlier this year, said: "I was surprised and delighted to learn of the honour.
"I have hugely enjoyed the last five years, these are momentous times for the sport and I'm very proud to be chairman leading up to 2017."
Matt King, who was left paralysed below the neck two weeks after his 17th birthday after being injured playing for the London Broncos Academy in 2004, is appointed OBE for his charity work.
Since then, the RFL Benevolent Fund has given him the financial and practical assistance which has allowed him to gain a first class degree in law and a greater level of independence.
As a fund-raiser for the RFL Benevolent Fund, he has painted Christmas cards using just a mouth-stick to raise money for the charity which supports players whose lives are affected by serious injuries sustained while playing rugby league.
King is also an ambassador for the Variety Club of Great Britain and an advocate for spinal injury charities.
Northern Ireland's Mike Bull, the 1970 Commonwealth Games pole vault champion, becomes an OBE for services to sport and charity.
