The Women's Football Show on BBC Two will show highlights, while games will be shown live on the BBC Sport website.
Promoted Yeovil Town's opening match against Liverpool on Sunday, 23 April will be live online.
The Spring Series is a one-off transitional competition before the WSL's switch to a winter calendar for 2017-18.
Last year, the BBC, along with BT Sport, extended a deal to show the Women's FA Cup final until 2021.
"It's a really positive step that the BBC are streaming FA WSL games for the first time," said FA head of women's leagues and competitions, Katie Brazier.
"Clubs also have more opportunities to stream their games through their own channels.
"It demonstrates that the domestic women's game is in a really healthy place and we're looking forward to a season of great football and big crowds."
BT Sport will broadcast live Spring Series matches on television including the game between last season's champions Manchester City and runners-up Chelsea on 25 May.
The Spring Series will take place before Euro 2017, which starts in the Netherlands on 16 July, and England's first match is against Scotland on 19 July.
