Ceri Jones, 21, from Beddgelert in Gwynedd, said scans showed a vertebra "basically exploded" after a jump at Flip Out Chester on 25 January.
She has been left in a brace, requires five more weeks of physiotherapy and plans to sue the activity centre.
Flip Out Chester said it had an excellent safety record and has replaced the attraction in question.
Ms Jones is the latest in a number of people who said they have been injured at the activity centre, including a 29-year-old woman from Oswestry in Shropshire and a 21-year-old man from Ellesmere Port.
It has prompted Cheshire West and Chester council to launch an investigation into the park.
Ms Jones said she was injured after going on The Tower Jump attraction at the park.
She told BBC Wales that she had jumped from a 12ft (3.7m) platform into a foam pit, as instructed in a safety briefing.
"As I landed I heard a crunch in my back. Instantly I had like a sharp shooting pain in my spine and it came all around my hips and down my legs.
"I couldn't stand up or anything - I lost all the strength in my legs."
She said doctors later discovered a bone in her lower back had been seriously damaged and could have left her paralysed.
"I've been extremely lucky. It's just an unnecessary injury that shouldn't have happened in the first place," she added.
A spokesman for Flip Out Chester said more than 240,000 people had visited the centre since it opened in December last year.
"Safety is our number one priority and we strive to ensure that everyone who visits can enjoy all of the activities in a safe environment," he said.
"We welcome feedback from our customers and we are investigating these claims to establish exactly what happened.
"We have replaced the tower jump with a new battle beam attraction."
