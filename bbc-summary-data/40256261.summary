The Sun and Daily Mirror printed the joint message to support The Great Get Together organised by Mrs Cox's family.
The editors of the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian have also written a joint opinion piece, printed in both papers.
Thousand of community events will be held this weekend, a year since the Labour MP was fatally shot and stabbed.
The mother-of-two and MP for Batley and Spen, 41, was attacked while she was on her way to a constituency event on 16 June last year.
Her family have organised The Great Get Together to mark the first anniversary of her murder, with people asked to throw street parties, organise bake-offs and arrange football matches.
Iona Lawrence, director of the Jo Cox Foundation, said more than 110,000 separate events were being planned "in every corner of the UK".
In a joint editorial - published as part of their respective "The Sun Says" and "Voice of the Mirror" columns - the fierce tabloid rivals explain they have come together for one day to support the "hugely important" event.
The message says: "She said that in Britain we 'have far more in common than that which divides us'.
"She was right. It's part of what makes Britain such a great nation."
It added: "After the turmoil of the past few weeks, it's just what Britain needs."
The Guardian's Katharine Viner and the Telegraph's Chris Evans also paid tribute to Mrs Cox in a joint opinion piece published in the two editors' newspapers.
They said Mrs Cox represented "some of the best aspects of our political tradition" and they had "no hesitation in uniting, if for one day only".
Meanwhile, Mrs Cox's widow Brendan has said he wants people to just his wife as more than just an MP.
He has written a book about his wife, with proceeds going to charity.
He told BBC Radio 5 live's Afternoon Edition: "I think there was a danger that she became seen as this one dimensional politician. I didn't want people to be left with that impression.
"She was a mum, she was a sister, she was a campaigner, she was an activist and I wanted some of that to come across."
Mrs Cox's parents and sister have told the BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme they are still learning to cope with the loss.
Her father, Gordon, told the programme that after a year the hurt is not getting better.
"It doesn't. It won't go away. But we have to be positive," he added.
The full interview with Brendan Cox can be heard on Afternoon Edition on BBC Radio 5 live from 13:00 BST.
