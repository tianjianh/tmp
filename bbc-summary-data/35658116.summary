Sharvin slipped from five to three under, but made amends with a two at the par three 17th in Australia.
In what is only his second tournament as a professional, the 23-year-old expressed delight at his impressive start.
"This being my first European Tour event, it's really nice to post a nice number and see myself up the leaderboard with names I'm usually watching on TV," he said.
"My main focus this year is going to be Challenge Tour events and I can't think too far ahead, but I know if I play well I can compete."
