Election 2015: Labour funding for Wales depends on review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ed Miliband has declined to say whether Wales will be safe from funding cuts under a future Labour UK government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On a campaign visit to Barry, he told BBC Wales an extra Â£350m would come to Wales from new taxes within the first year of his party taking power.
He said the longer-term picture would depend on the results of a spending review once Labour settled into office.
Mr Miliband said the party's "broad approach" was to have "fair" taxes, cut the deficit, and "balance the books".
"As a result of the tax changes that we've announced like the mansion tax, the bank bonus tax and other tax changes, Â£350m extra will be coming to Wales and that'll be happening within about the first year of a Labour government," he said.
"As for the decisions on the precise allocations of the budget in terms of what happens overall, that's going to wait for our spending review in government because we've got to look at the books.
"We've said we're going to protect key areas like health and education and that will obviously have a positive effect on the block grant for Wales.
"But we're going to get the deficit down and we're determined to do so."
Mr Miliband also set out Labour's plan for action on immigration within 100 days of taking office.
It includes an extra 1,000 border staff, full exit checks and measures to stop serious criminals entering Britain.
This issue includes EU and worldwide migration, border controls and rules on work and benefits.
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Attacking the government's record, Mr Miliband said: "David Cameron once promised to cut net immigration to tens of thousands and told people to throw him out of office if he didn't deliver. He has broken that promise, with net migration standing at 298,000.
"Nothing damages people's faith in politics more than broken promises like that."
Elsewhere on the campaign trail on Tuesday, the Welsh Conservatives were promoting a plan to help people buy their first home.
The Help to Buy ISA, announced in the Budget in March and due to take effect in the autumn, will give first time buyers a 25% bonus on savings made towards a deposit on their first home.
The Tories claim it could help 45,000 people in Wales get onto the housing ladder in the next five years.
Welsh Conservative chairman Jonathan Evans said theirs was "the party of home ownership and aspiration".
"For many thousands of people across Wales the idea of owning a home was once a distant dream," he added.
"Thanks to the changes we have brought in over the past five years, such as amending the way Stamp Duty is collected and introducing the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, buying a home has become a real possibility."
Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have launched a manifesto specific to Cardiff, with local priorities including cleaner streets, keeping local libraries open, and a "city deal" of investment to boost the local economy.
Welsh leader Kirsty Williams said: "This is an ambitious manifesto for the people of our capital city, building on our Wales and UK manifestos with truly local priorities to ensure we create opportunity for everyone in Cardiff."
Also on the campaign trail on Tuesday, Plaid Cymru is promising to end what it calls a "postcode lottery" over funding for patients to get new drugs and new types of treatment on the NHS.
Health spokesperson Elin Jones said the party would ring-fence a Â£50m rebate from drugs companies to spend on the scheme, and would set up a national panel to ensure equal access to such treatment for patients wherever they lived in Wales.
