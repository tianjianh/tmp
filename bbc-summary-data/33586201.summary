The BBC understands Anthony Quinn was with a group of friends at the Dollar Glen gorge, which features two rivers and a number of waterfalls.
Police Scotland said emergency services attended after concerns were raised at about 16:10 BST on Saturday.
Anthony was pronounced dead at the scene. His death is not believed to be suspicious.
Sergeant Derek McKie, from Police Scotland in Alloa, said: "This is a tragic loss of a young man's life and our sincere condolences are with Anthony's friends and family, who have respectfully requested that they be left to grieve in private at this very sad time."
A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.
