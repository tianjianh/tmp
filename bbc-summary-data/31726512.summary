[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A blaze at an historic mansion on the outskirts of Dumfries is being treated as suspicious.

The flames engulfed an annex of the derelict Carnsalloch House at about 23:00 on Tuesday.
Three fire appliances were deployed to the scene, with water drawn from the nearby River Nith used to douse the flames.
Police said they are investigating the incident at the 18th century building.
Carnsalloch House owner Ian Foster said he was still seeking information about the blaze which had affected his property.
"Ever since we bought the house we have had problems with vandalism," he said.
"If it is the lower house annex then it is OK but if it has affected the house it will be a huge problem."
The incident comes with plans to re-develop the historic mansion at the centre of a planning deadlock.
The A-listed property is on the national Buildings at Risk Register, but planners have so far refused permission for a scheme to save it which involves converting the house into flats and building additional houses in the grounds.
The proposals are set to go before a local authority review committee next week.
