Lamara Bell brother in police whistleblower plea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The brother of M9 crash victim Lamara Bell has called on police officers to report failings in the force to "save any more people from dying".

Martin Bell told the BBC: "If 999 calls are being unattended it is serious and it's only a matter of time before there is another fatality."
It comes days after an anonymous officer said the force was "on its knees" with high numbers of calls.
Police Scotland said it had a "high level of performance on call handling".
Ms Bell, 25, lay trapped in her car for three days after Police Scotland failed to respond to a 101 call reporting the crash because the details were not logged correctly.
She was found conscious inside the car near Stirling on 5 July, but died in hospital four days later. Her partner John Yuill, 28, also died in the crash.
On Thursday, an anonymous whistleblower called BBC Radio Scotland to say the force was "on its knees" with control rooms struggling to cope with the volume of calls.
He said: "I know for a fact, having spoken to some of my colleagues in the control rooms, that treble nine calls are still not being actioned, so they are not being resourced and members of the public are not being given the service that they deserve."
Mr Bell said he wanted other officers to "come forward and say it as it is".
"They signed up to serve and protect and this isn't happening right now. The public have lost all faith and respect. Surely they didn't want to be in the force to be looked at like this," he said.
"They need to come forward and make a change and save any more people dying. If 999 calls are being unattended it is serious and it's only a matter of time before there is another fatality due to this mess the system is in.
"It's time to stand up and make the change."
Responding to Mr Bell's comments, Police Scotland said there was a "regular engagement" with the Scottish Police Federation, which represents officers up to the rank of chief inspector, as well as the Association of Scottish Police Superintendants and staff unions.
A spokesman said: "Officers and staff have fully engaged in the service-wide staff survey, which has had a return rate of 50%. Results are being assessed and will be published before the end of September."
The spokesman also pointed to a report on call handling performance presented on Thursday which showed a high "grade of service".
He added: "Police Scotland is subject to scrutiny at local and national level in a number of different ways including local panels, SPA board and committees, HMICS and the Justice Committee."
Scottish Labour has also hit out at plans to shut police call centres in Aberdeen and Inverness, saying their closure would only "make matters worse".
Graeme Pearson, the party's justice spokesman and a former senior police officer, said: "The most important job of our police service is to keep communities safe. People need to know that when they call the police they can get a quick response and that their concerns will be dealt with.
"Our police officers are doing their best under difficult circumstances, but because of SNP government cuts too often they are having to fill backroom functions instead of being out on the streets like they were trained to do."
A report into call handling at Police Scotland is due to be published shortly.
Mr Pearson said the Scottish government should "seriously consider" any proposed reforms coming from that before going ahead with the closure of the Aberdeen and Inverness call centres.
A Scottish government spokesman said: "Agreement on the siting of Contact, Command and Control Centres is a matter for Police Scotland, with the oversight of the Scottish Police Authority."
It would not be appropriate to "prejudge" the results of the review, or the independent investigation into the crash by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner, the spokesman added.
