Trampolines 'dangerous', says top bone surgeon

Amir Ali Qureshi, from the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, predicts adverts featuring a dog on a trampoline will boost sales.
But he also expects a spike in people with broken bones turning up at A&E this Christmas.
He said injuries were common, even with trampolines that come with safety netting.
"Just last week I had a 27-year-old female referred to me with a life-changing injury to her left knee as a result of a trampoline accident," Mr Qureshi said.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) says more than 13,000 trampolining injuries are treated each year.
Broken arms, legs, knee dislocations and neck injuries can all result from having an accident on a trampoline.
Mr Qureshi added: "Some of these injuries are simply unpleasant, but others can be extremely serious.
"The issue at the moment, particularly where young people are involved, is that the use of nets gives children and their parents a false sense of security that they will be fine whatever the level and intensity of activity on a trampoline.
"In my opinion, as an experienced orthopaedic surgeon, the equipment is dangerous and should only be used in appropriate circumstances, which I believe can only be achieved under professional supervision."
Dave Walker, the leisure safety manager at RoSPA, said: "When using a trampoline at home parents must be aware that, just like any high-energy leisure activity, there is a risk, and they should take precautions to prevent potentially serious and life-changing injuries.
"Having netting around the trampoline is a good preventative measure, as is only allowing one child on at a time, and supervision to ensure the activity being carried out on the trampoline is appropriate.
"Many serious injuries occur when a larger person is on with a child, so parents should avoid getting on at the same time as their children."
