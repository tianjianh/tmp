[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
School pupils in Slough are being taught about the importance of genetic testing in response to babies being born with rare birth defects.

Fifteen babies under the age of one died in Slough between 2012 and 2013, including seven from "chromosomal, genetic, and congenital" anomalies.
It is believed the deaths are linked to intermarriage in some communities.
A 2013 study conducted in Bradford found marriage between cousins doubled the risk of birth defects.
Following the Bradford study, Slough Council began collating data on child deaths and on people living with disabilities due to genetic disorders.
Herschel Grammar secondary school, which draws 81% of its pupils from minority ethnic groups, is the first school in Berkshire to offer the genetic guidance.
Headteacher Joanna Rockall, who also chairs Slough Child Death Overview Panel, said there were a number of communities in the town where intermarriage was common.
Genetic counsellor Lyndon Gallacher said if people were concerned, they could request a referral to their GP and talk to a genetic service about their family background of disease.
He said: "Some populations have higher incidents of breast cancer or cystic fibrosis as a result of marrying within their population.
"We're helping people make decisions based on their cultural and family values."
Mr Gallacher said genetic disorders were still "comparatively rare", but "higher incidents" were seen in "closed populations" in which people had children with partners from the same country or ethnic group.
Slough Council has offered all schools in Berkshire its new educational programme, which also addresses issues such as female genital mutilation (FGM), honour based violence and forced marriage.
