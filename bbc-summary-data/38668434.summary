European Champions Cup: Toulouse 19-10 Connacht

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Connacht missed out on a first European Champions Cup quarter-final after this dramatic defeat by Toulouse.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A win would have ensured Connacht's progress but Toulouse go through along with pool winner Wasps.
Tries from Gael Fickou, Arthur Bonneval and Joe Tekori helped a dominant Toulouse to a commanding 19-3 lead.
Connacht fought back and John Muldoon's converted try left the visitors just short of a losing bonus point which would have also taken them through.
The Irish side started the day top of Pool 2 but second-placed Wasps, as expected, picked up a bonus-point win over Zebre.
That left Connacht needing a win while a losing bonus point would be enough if Toulouse did not earn a winning bonus point.
It looked bleak for Pat Lam's team midway through the first half as Toulouse powered their way to a 14-0 advantage at the Stade Ernest Wallon.
Fickou touched down after sustained pressure before Bonneval burst down the line to score a second converted try for the hosts.
Craig Ronaldson's penalty put Connacht on the scoreboard but lock Quinn Roux was shown a yellow card for a deliberate foul four minutes before the break.
Jean-Marc Doussain missed the resulting penalty as Toulouse went in 14-3 ahead at half-time.
Toulouse extended their lead to 16 points when Tekori rumbled over for an unconverted try seven minutes into the second half.
Connacht showed their resilience and determination with a fightback which came close to clinching a place in the last eight.
Skipper Muldoon charged over on 54 minutes and Ronaldson added the extras to leave Connacht within a penalty of securing a losing bonus point.
Connacht were now the team with the momentum but their attacks were thwarted by infringements, poor handling and excellent Toulouse defending.
Toulouse survived to make the quarter-finals while Connacht ended their campaign in third place.
