Mattel, the US company who make the toy, is adding "tall, curvy and petite" body shapes to its line-up.
Different skin tones, eye colours and hair styles will also be added, the company said.
Many people had complained that the traditional Barbie size was unhealthy, creating an unrealistic body image for girls.
With the new body shapes, the toy makers say they are "offering girls choices that are more reflective of the world they see today".
