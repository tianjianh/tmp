Paul Bowers, 47, died when several tonnes of metal fell on him in 2013 while working at the warehouse of CAV Cambridge at Cambridge Airport.
A jury heard CAV had failed to act on requests for a new stacking system.
After investigating, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) described his death as "entirely preventable".
CAV Aerospace, based in Consett, County Durham, was also found guilty of failing to discharge its duty by a trial jury at the Old Bailey last week, for which it was given a concurrent £400,000 fine, meaning it was fined £600,000 in total.
The company was also ordered to pay £125,000 in costs.
The trial heard warnings about dangerous working conditions were ignored by CAV bosses.
The jury was told an unstable stack of aircraft components had toppled on to Mr Bowers, trapping him up to his chest and crushing him.
HSE inspector Graham Tompkins said the CAV Aerospace board had failed to act on requests from local managers and a health and safety consultant's advice that a new stacking system be installed.
"Paul Bowers paid the ultimate price for the company's senior managers ignoring that advice and his death was entirely preventable," he said.
Speaking after the guilty verdict, Mr Bowers' wife, Jose, told of her "unbearable sadness" and "insurmountable hurdles to carry on living without my husband and soulmate".
"This has taken from me an amazing and unique husband and our children have lost a very special father and stepfather," she said.
