The film was nominated for 11 awards going into the Los Angeles ceremony, but only won three including prizes for its stars Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver.
Following on from his Oscar win in February, Leonardo DiCaprio won best male performance for his role in The Revenant.
Mad Max: Fury Road's Charlize Theron won best female performance.
Will Smith was given the MTV Generation award, recognising his film career. Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry, who presented Smith with his award, praised the star as "a champion for diversity in Hollywood".
"[He] blazes a path for actors by showing that someone of any colour can play any role, and can open any movie and win any award and be the biggest freaking movie star in the whole world," she said.
Accepting his award, Smith joked the honour was "code for the old dude award".
He added: "This is absolutely beautiful. I released my first record when I was 17. I'm 47 years old now. This June marks 30 years in this business."
British actress Ridley beat her Star Wars co-star John Boyega to win the breakthrough performance award, while Driver was voted best villain for his role in the franchise.
Chris Pratt and Amy Poehler also collected awards for best action and best virtual performance respectively, while Oscar-winning Amy Winehouse film Amy was voted best documentary and Straight Outta Compton won best true story.
Bridesmaid's star Melissa McCarthy received the comedic genius award and said although she was the first woman to achieve the feat, she was "certainly not the first one to deserve it".
Ryan Reynolds collected two awards - best comedic performance for his role in comic book movie Deadpool, and best fight for a sequence in the film with Ed Skrein.
Among the other quirky category winners were Pitch Perfect 2's Rebel Wilson and Adam Devine for best kiss, and Jennifer Lawrence for best hero for her part in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2.
The awards will be screened on MTV in the UK on Monday evening.
