[SN]TITLE[SN]
Small isles could get own councillors, suggests government

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has asked whether islands that are part of mainland councils should be represented by their own dedicated councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Highlands, Argyll and Bute and North Ayrshire have small isles that could potentially have a councillor.
The question forms part of wider government consultation on which additional powers should be given to Scotland's three island authorities.
These are Shetland, Orkney and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.
Islands Minister Derek Mackay said: "This is the next stage of a conversation with our island communities, councils and wider stakeholders about what a future bill may look like - and who better to inform these decisions than the very people who live, work and study there.
"Life on our islands can be very different to living on the mainland and I am keen to ensure that people who live there have their views properly represented at a local and national level."
