A theatre adaptation of short stories by Canadian Nobel Prize winner Alice Munro will feature at this year's Edinburgh International Book Festival.

The View From Castle Rock imagines the experiences of Munro's Scots ancestors who sailed from Leith in 1818 with the hope of a better life in Canada.
It was adapted by playwright Linda McLean.
Event organisers said the specially-commissioned work would form the centrepiece of August's festival.
The full programme will be announced on 9 June.
Following daily performances at the book festival, The View From Castle Rock will go on tour to the Borders including the Ettrick Valley - home of Munro's ancestors.
Festival director Nick Barley said: "Alice Munro is celebrated across the globe as the greatest living short story writer.
"She is also fascinated by her heritage and her family's voyage from Scotland to Canada in the early 19th Century.
"Today, at a time when the refugee crisis is such a topical issue right across Europe, I am proud that the Book Festival and Stellar Quines will bring Munro's story dramatically to life as the centrepiece of a thoughtful, far-reaching discussion about human migration."
Munro has published 13 collections of stories and a novel and in 2013 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
