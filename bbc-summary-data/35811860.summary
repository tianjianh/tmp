Schools in Republic of Ireland mark Proclamation of Independence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Schools and colleges across the Republic of Ireland are holding ceremonies to mark the 1916 Proclamation of Independence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the biggest event so far in the Easter Rising commemorative programme, school pupils are raising the Irish flag and reading the proclamation.
Some pupils have written new proclamations, setting out their visions and ideals for the future.
The event is the culmination of months of work by pupils and teachers.
Almost every school child in the country will be a participant, having played a part in drawing up their school's proclamation for a new generation.
School principals have said the initiative has captured the imagination of students in a way they did not expect, with many pupils addressing topical issues such as homelessness in the new proclamations.
As well as the raising of the flag and the reading of proclamations, schools have developed their own individual programmes for the day, with poetry, music and pageantry.
