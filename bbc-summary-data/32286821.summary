[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bin lorry crash inquiry details set out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) into the Glasgow bin lorry crash will look at the driver's medical background and his fitness to hold a licence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will also consider the technical aspects of the vehicle itself and whether it was appropriate for it to take the route it did.
Six people died and 10 more were injured when the council bin lorry crashed into pedestrians in Glasgow city centre on 22 December.
The inquiry is due to start on 22 July.
A preliminary hearing for the inquiry, which is expected to last four weeks, was held at  Glasgow Sheriff Court on Monday.
Scotland's second most senior law officer, Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC, who will lead the inquiry, said the FAI will cover three main areas.
Ms Thomson said: "The issues fall into three categories which are firstly around the driver of the vehicle, his medical background, his fitness to hold the licence, his employment record and training.
"Secondly the vehicle itself and the technical aspects, if there could have been any measures or interventions to have brought that vehicle to a controlled stop.
"And thirdly the safety of the refuse collection route taken by the motor vehicle. In relation to that I would intend to explore not just the route but the time of week and the time of year and assess the appropriateness of that route at that time of year."
Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the incident in the city's Queen Street and George Square.
Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed when the truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel.
Lawyers for the families of the victims, the driver, the DVLA and Glasgow City Council were present at the preliminary hearing.
The Crown said it was ready to proceed with the inquiry.
The other parties said they would need to see productions and reports before they could advise whether they were ready.
Another preliminary court hearing is scheduled to take place on 18 May.
