A 13ft (4m) digital screen is touring areas such as Benidorm, Malaga and Puerto Banus as part of Operation Captura.
So far, 68 out of 86 people have been apprehended.
The images include people wanted in connection with crimes such as murder and drug trafficking.
The initiative is being led by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Crimestoppers, but features suspects wanted by forces across Britain.
They include Allan James Foster, 43, from South Shields, wanted in connection with the murder of David "Noddy" Rice in a car park in May 2006, as well as for drugs and diamond offences.
Christopher Guest More, 36, who has links with Spain and Malta, is suspected of murdering a man at a remote farmhouse in Tabley, Cheshire, in June 2003.
They are among 18 men whose faces will feature on a screen attached to the back of a van touring some of Spain's biggest resorts.
"This is something that we have never done before but we believe that broadcasting these fugitives' faces right in their backyards will not only encourage the public to speak up but show these individuals that there really is nowhere to hide," said Roger Critchell, director of operations for Crimestoppers.
"There will be no avoiding the faces on this screen - they'll be broadcast in all the popular expat areas.
"I would urge anyone who recognises any of those faces to contact Crimestoppers anonymously."
