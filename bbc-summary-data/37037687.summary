Work on Rhigos Mountain Road which links the Rhondda and Cynon valleys began in April and is due to be finished by Sunday.
It forms part of a £23m investment by the local council to tackle damage caused by severe winters.
Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said the focus had been to complete work before next winter.
About 6,000 tonnes of new surface has been laid on a 5.6 mile (9km) section.
