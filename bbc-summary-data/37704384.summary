An exhibition showcasing the artists in the running for a Â£30,000 prize in honour of Barbara Hepworth has opened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hepworth Prize for Sculpture exhibition, on display at the Hepworth, Wakefield, has four short-listed artists.
Work from Phyllida Barlow, Steven Claydon, Helen Marten and David Medalla is featured.
The winning artist is to be announced at an award dinner in the gallery on 17 November.
Sophie Bowness, art historian and granddaughter of sculptor Hepworth, said the prize was "a fitting legacy to... one of Britain's greatest sculptors".
The prize was announced in May as part of the gallery's fifth anniversary celebrations.
Each of the four artists is exhibiting new and recent work.
On show are Phyllida Barlow's monumental constructions and the sensory work of Steven Claydon.
Helen Marten, who is also nominated for this year's Turner Prize, is to display her intricate sculptures, while David Medalla's installation gives the visitor the chance to collaborate in the making of the work.
The gallery said the prize aims to "demystify contemporary sculpture" and recognise a British artist who has made a significant contribution.
Exhibition visitors are also encouraged to vote for a people's choice award.
The Hepworth Wakefield gallery opened in 2011.
Hepworth, who was born in the West Yorkshire city in 1903, was a contemporary of Castleford-born Henry Moore, with the pair among the most highly regarded sculptors of the 20th Century.
She attended Leeds School of Art in the 1920s and opened a studio in St Ives, Cornwall, in 1949.
The artist and sculptor was made a CBE in the 1958 New Year Honours list and died in a fire at her studio in 1975.
