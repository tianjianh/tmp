Taiwan profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The media environment in Taiwan is among the freest in Asia, and extremely competitive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are hundreds of newspapers, all privately-owned and reflecting a wide range of views. Laws which prohibit the promotion of independence from China or communism are not generally enforced.
Taiwan's major terrestrial TV networks tend to be politically partisan. The take-up of multichannel cable TV is very high. The switch to digital terrestrial TV was made in 2012.
There are more than 170 radio stations, many of them with specific music formats. Phone-in programmes are particularly popular.
The government has taken steps to end government, military and political party ownership of the broadcast media.
There were more than 18.5 million internet users by 2013 (via InternetWorldStats). A digital convergence plan adopted by the government aims to integrate telecoms, the internet and broadcasting.
