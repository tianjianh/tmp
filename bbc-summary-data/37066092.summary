Dutch sailor Dorian van Rijsselberghe, who won gold in 2012, will retain his title.
Dempsey, 35, won silver in London, having taken a bronze in Athens in 2004, and will retire after this event.
"Tomorrow's a day off and my birthday, and Sunday is my last ever race so I'm going to want to win," he said.
"I feel very happy to have won a silver medal," Dempsey added. "It's cool, it's amazing.
"It's nice to have had a good spell at the top and be competitive over five Olympic Games. I'm pretty proud of that.
"I'm unemployed as of next week - I'll have to get a job. I'd like to do photography if I can make it work, and a bit of coaching. I'd like some new challenges and new goals and I want to keep being driven in life and achieve something else."
Friday's result is subject to protest and both Dempsey and Van Rijsselberghe will still have to sail in Sunday's medal race.
Beijing 2008 bronze medallist Bryony Shaw is through to the women's RS:X medal race and is eighth overall, after three fourth places on Friday.
London 2012 runners-up Hannah Mills and Saskia Clark won their only race of the day to go top of the women's 470 class, while Luke Patience and Chris Grube are up to third in the men's event.
Two-time world champion Nick Thompson is fourth overall in the Laser class after a 24th and seventh on Friday, while reigning Laser Radial champion Alison Young posted a seventh and 10th to move ninth overall.
Dylan Fletcher and Alain Sign are 14th overall in the 49er after day one, while Charlotte Dobson and Sophie Ainsworth are seventh in the 49erFx.
Giles Scott resumes competition on Saturday as Finn class leader, and Ben Saxton and Nicola Groves restart second in the Nacra 17.
