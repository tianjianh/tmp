"He's one of those that listens," Crewe boss Steve Davis told BBC Radio Stoke. "He's got the bit between his teeth.
"I asked him to come in during close season, although his family are quite a way away. He was prepared to do that."
The 24-year-old, who made his 100th appearance for the Alex in Saturday's 2-1 win at Stevenage, will become a free agent in the summer of 2017.
The League Two club are keen to get his future secured before then, with Davis saying he first spoke to Guthrie about a new deal at the end of last season, when he also talked about doing some extra training.
"He's seeing the reward now," added Davis. "He can't fail to have caught the eye of anyone who has watched him.
"He's done well from where he's come from. It's taken us four seasons now but he's now played 100 games at left-back and left-side central defender too, and I think he is intelligent enough as a footballer to be used in front of the back four, where he can collect it and play."
Guthrie joined the Alex in February 2012 after being spotted in his native Wiltshire playing for Wessex League Division One side Pewsey Vale.
Crewe Alexandra manager Steve Davis was talking to BBC Radio Stoke sports editor Graham McGarry.
