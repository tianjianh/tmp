[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called to Hope Street Lane in Edinburgh city centre on Sunday 7 February as a large group of men fought in the street.
The disturbance followed a Scottish Cup tie at Hearts' Tynecastle Stadium, which ended in a 2-2 draw.
As a result, 32 men aged between 18 and 47 have now been formally charged.
All charges have been brought under the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act.
Police Scotland said officers were following positive lines of inquiry to trace a number of other males now identified.
Insp Emma Croft, from St Leonard's Police Station, said: "We will continue to work closely with the National Football Co-ordination Unit and football clubs to carry out investigations as necessary into any football-related criminal activity which occurs."
