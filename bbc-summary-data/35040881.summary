[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor who had sex with a patient who was on a cocktail of medications and alcohol, has been struck-off the medical register.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Arpad Adorjan treated the "vulnerable" woman at the Priory Hospital Bristol, but went on to abuse his position.
A tribunal found he had sex at the patient's house, despite knowing she was on a "sedating and disinhibiting" mix of alcohol and medication.
Adorjan was not present at the hearing.
Dr Adorjan worked as a resident medical officer at the Priory - an independent hospital specialising in mental health issues - between 2010 and July 2013.
The Medical Practitioners' Tribunal Service panel heard how in 2013 he had "pursued a sexual relationship" with a patient who suffered from anorexia, depression and was a suicide risk.
It was told on one occasion, he had stroked her hair, hugged her and told her she was beautiful. He had also discussed the "sexual traits of their respective star signs".
On another occasion, he told her she could be "pregnant by the time she was 41" and on her discharge from hospital gave her his contact details.
After a meeting in Bristol, the panel heard he texted her saying 'Feelings R getting more certain. XO' and when he met her at her house - had sex despite knowing she had been mixing alcohol with her medication.
The tribunal found his behaviour was "fundamentally incompatible with being a doctor", violated the patient's rights and caused "psychological harm".
"Dr Adorjan's sexually motivated behaviour towards a vulnerable patient constituted a particularly serious departure from the principles set out in good medical practice," a spokesman said.
"The panel considers that erasure is the only appropriate sanction."
In a statement the Priory Hospital said Dr Adorjan had been contracted through an agency, which had carried out a "full background and clearance check".
"The safety and wellbeing of our patients is our top priority," a spokesperson said.
"As soon as this allegation came to light, Dr Adorjan was immediately reported."
