[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 0-1 Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship side Sunderland reached the second round of the EFL Cup with a hard-fought win at League One Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Honeyman lifted the ball over Bury keeper Joe Murphy after a neat move to win the tie in the second half.
That came after a first 45 minutes of few chances at Gigg Lane, the best of which saw Murphy deny Aiden McGeady.
The Black Cats were wasteful late on as they pushed for a second goal, but Lee Clark's hosts rarely looked likely to force an equaliser at the other end.
Victory was new boss Simon Grayson's first in a competitive game since taking charge of the relegated club, following their draw with Derby in their Championship opener on 4 August.
Sunderland will now go on to play Carlisle United in the second round.
