Pakistan batsman Younus, 37, agreed to a return to the White Rose on a short-term deal in February.
However, Younus has now said that he would be unable to turn down a possible call to tour Bangladesh with Pakistan.
Pujara, 27, has scored 2,073 runs at an average of 47.11 in 27 Tests.
Pujara, who played three County Championship games for Derbyshire in 2014, averages 57.01 in first-class cricket.
"We have moved quickly to bring in Pujara and he is a superb player," said director of cricket Martyn Moxon.
"He is an outstanding young Test cricketer who is hungry to perform in the English game.
"In the brief conversations I have had with him, he is very much looking forward to be joining Yorkshire and being part of our plans."
