Notts posted 158-6, Samit Patel scoring 55 and Jeehat Patel taking 4-22.
In reply Fletcher was struck on the head by a drive from Sam Hain and play was held up for more than 30 minutes before Ian Bell's 47 set up a six-wicket win secured on the final ball.
Derbyshire beat Yorkshire in Saturday's other North Group game.
Birmingham looked likely to win as the match entered the closing stages but still needed one run from the last ball after a fine final over from Dan Christian.
However, a fumble by Michael Lumb on a simple run-out chance meant Birmingham scrambled to victory.
The Falcons made it two wins from two in this season's T20 Blast as they defended 165-8 to secure a three-run victory against Yorkshire at Chesterfield.
Adam Lyth scored 68 from 53 balls as Yorkshire started strongly, but leg-spinner Imran Tahir took 3-18 from his three overs to keep the innings in check.
Yorkshire needed 18 off the last over, but captain Tim Bresnan (24) was caught at cover off the final ball by Luis Reece as they finished on 162-7.
Wayne Madsen had earlier hit 42 from 28 balls with Daryn Smit adding a rapid, undefeated 30.
