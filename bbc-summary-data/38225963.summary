Derbyshire 'people's cow' in clover over new sponsor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The future of a cow saved by a crowd-funding campaign has been secured after a sponsor agreed to fund its keep.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jean Jeanie, an eight-year-old Dexter cow, was "adopted" by Derbyshire woman Trisha Boyko who "fell in love" with her after walking past her field.
But struggling to meet costs, Ms Boyko raised ??3,500 online and called her "the people's cow".
Now Cornish accountant Martin Sands, who saw the news story, has agreed to pay ??65 a month for ongoing keep.
Mr Sands said it was "not a normal thing" for him to sponsor a cow as he did not have a particular interest in animals.
But he said Jean Jeanie was "a really beautiful cow" and he was overwhelmed by her story.
"Some of her sponsors had promised income for 12 months and then dropped out, so I promised to fund her for 12 months - probably longer."
The cow was spotted alone in a field by Ms Boyko who, after hearing she might be destined for market, purchased the animal.
The 52-year-old made a Facebook page for Jean, short for the cow's registered name of Mooridge Jeanie, which attracted donations.
"She lit my days up and I'd like to think I cheered her up. She's got a lovely character, she's really gentle, she's lovely.
"She is the people's cow," she added.
Ms Boyko said on her Facebook page that Jeanie and her Cornish sponsor got along well: "I am pleased to say he was most impressed to meet the beautiful Jean and she was on her best behaviour."
She added the cow was "so much better than this time last year - what a difference a year makes".
