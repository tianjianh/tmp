[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hibernian 4-0 Greenock Morton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hibernian moved clear at the top of the Championship as their commanding performance against Morton, and Raith Rovers' draw with Dundee United, left them the only team on maximum points.

Andrew Shinnie headed Neil Lennon's side in front after 29 minutes before Grant Holt headed in his first Hibs goal.
Jason Cummings scored for the third straight game, also with a header.
And Brian Graham headed in the hosts' fourth on his debut.
Hibs were eager to avoid a repeat of the last time the sides met at Easter Road when they dominated the opening half hour but found themselves losing 3-0.
The match followed a similar pattern with Hibs again starting the stronger of the two sides. Liam Lindsay was well placed to clear a goal-bound Holt shot with just six minutes gone while Derek Gaston saved low at his post from Shinnie 13 minutes later.
Ofir Marciano, making his debut in Hibs' goal, had a peaceful start to his Easter Road career as he watched his new team-mates set about finding the first goal.
Hibs had enjoyed space down both sides and after 28 minutes David Gray's deep cross appeared to be evading everyone but Shinnie's deep run was rewarded when he met the cross and headed in at an angle for his first Hibs goal.
Holt's play in his first six Hibs starts had merited a goal and he finally got off the mark four minutes from half-time, outmuscling Morton goalkeeper Gaston to head high into the net.
And Cummings met Shinnie's cutback cross from the by-line after 53 minutes for number three.
The effort from the visitors never dropped but they were second best and rarely troubled Marciano.
Graham on his debut became the third Hibs player to score his first goal for the club when he connected with a 30-yard Cummings cross, his diving header giving substitute goalkeeper Andrew McNeil little chance.
It was an emphatic performance from Hibs who top the Championship with 12 points after four games.
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "We had to be patient but we scored two good goals in the first half with good balls into the box.
"You can't always play through teams. It is something that we have practised as we didn't score enough from cross balls last season.
"I really enjoyed the fourth goal, great centre-forward play - there was a good intensity to our play today.
"We have added to the squad and think we are in a decent place at the moment. We are going to try and get one more player in.
"Everyone has their price but we've made it clear that the likes of (John) McGinn, Cummings and (Paul) Hanlon are not for sale."
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "We have to be honest and realistic to say Hibs have got a huge gulf in quality and resources and that was shown today on the pitch.
"It's the first game we've lost and I've said to the players it's about the standards and Hibs today both with and without the ball didn't give us a minute.
"They put balls into the box - difference between a Lennon side and a Stubbs side - both very good, but in Grant Holt they have a presence and we struggled to cut the wide areas off."
