The west London venue, home to rugby union side Ealing Trailfinders, will also become the club's training base.
The Championship side have been playing at The Hive in Barnet since 2014 and will move at the end of the current season.
"This enables us to plan a sustainable long-term future for the club," said Broncos general manager Jason Loubser.
The Broncos, London's top rugby league club, have led a nomadic existence since their formation as Fulham Rugby League Club in 1980, playing at a number of venues around the capital.
Craven Cottage, Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, The Valley, Griffin Park and Twickenham Stoop were among their longer-term homes before they started a groundshare with League Two side Barnet.
The Broncos will train and play on a 3G synthetic surface at Trailfinders Sports Club, which has an overall capacity of 3,020 - of which 1,020 are seated.
"We made the decision to move to Trailfinders Sports Club as the facilities were the best suited for the London Broncos, not only in the Championship but also in the future when we return to Super League," Loubser added.
"The venue has the ability to further develop to meet the standards of Super League which will involve increasing the current capacity."
The Broncos' Under-16 and Under-19 sides will also move to Ealing and club chairman David Hughes said he was "really pleased" with the deal.
"The move will bring the club together for the first time in our history," he said.
"I'm fully committed to ensuring the club is in a position to return to Super League at the earliest opportunity. We all look forward to a long and successful partnership."
