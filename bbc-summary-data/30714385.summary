Neil, whose team sit third in the Scottish Premiership, will travel south on Friday to discuss personal terms.
Assuming there are no glitches, he will be transferred as a player, with the midfielder, 33, having been in charge at New Douglas Park since April 2013.
"All that has happened is the clubs have agreed compensation, but there is still work to be done," Neil said.
Speaking at a media conference on Thursday, he added: "As far as everything is concerned with Norwich, nothing has been agreed, signed or finalised on my part."
Having experienced early success with the Accies, Neil is not phased by the challenge of taking the Canaries back to the Premier League.
"When I got the job here I was only 31 and still focused on playing," he explained. "You think to yourself: 'Am I ready to take it?' But it's like anything else, when something crops up that you can't refuse
"I had to take it on, and it ended up going really well.
"I have learned a hell of a lot over the last two years at two different levels, which is good. I have learned about the play-offs as well.
"It's one of those situations that I am just excited, thrilled and looking forward to a challenge, if things get sorted."
Earlier in the day Neil spoke to the squad at a meeting at New Douglas Park.
On his way in to that, goalkeeper Michael McGovern told reporters he believed Neil would go "right to the top".
He said: "He's right up there with the best. He's sought-after but it's not surprising. He's got the lot. He's very clued in tactically and he's a very good man-manager."
The English Championship side approached Accies on Tuesday following the resignation of Neil Adams, who stood down on Monday, nine months after taking charge, with Norwich seventh in the table.
The 49-year-old will take a break from football and return to the club in an unidentified role in July.
Neil, who has made eight outings as a player this term, has been with Hamilton since 2005, having played in England with Barnsley and Mansfield Town.
"I've had massive links with the club for a long, long time and I've spent the best years of my life here, as a player, as a manager, and working closely with (vice chairman) Ronnie (MacDonald) and (chairman) Les (Gray), and as captain for eight years.
"So it's going to be extremely difficult if I do end up moving on."
Accies, who average home crowds of 2,533, have lost just five of their 20 league games this term having won promotion via the play-offs last season.
They topped the Premiership in early October following a 1-0 win over champions Celtic, their first success at Celtic Park in 76 years.
