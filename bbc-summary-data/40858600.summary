[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 6-1 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient were thrashed by Bromley as the short trip south of the Thames ended in misery for Steve Davis and his team.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bromley swept ahead after just 11 minutes, with George Porter heading past Charlie Grainger. And despite Orient threatening at times to get back on level terms, the former Football League side slid 2-0 adrift in the 39th minute when Frankie Sutherland's corner was nodded in by home captain Jack Holland.
The misery increased for Orient early in the second half, with Bromley stretching their lead after 55 minutes when Josh Rees struck from close range, after an initial save from Grainger. It got worse seven minutes later when Adam Mekki fired the fourth after strong work from the impressive Louis Dennis.
Orient mustered a consolation when former Colchester man Macauley Bonne scored his first for the club in the 66th minute, but they were red-faced in the 74th minute when Holland struck again and more so when Brett Williams notched Bromley's sixth late on.
