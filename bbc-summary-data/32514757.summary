[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of Leeds City Council has announced he is to stand down from the role.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour's Keith Wakefield said it was a "difficult decision" to leave after 12 years in the job.
Mr Wakefield will continue to lead the council until 21 May when a new leader will be elected.
He will continue to serve as the ward councillor for Kippax and Methley, where he has another two years to serve before considering re-election.
Mr Wakefield led the council from 2003 until 2004, when the labour group lost control of the council.
In a statement, he said: "Needless to say it's always a difficult decision to make, especially given the achievements of the council and this great city since 2010 when I resumed my second term of office as council leader.
"Together we've made real progress with our ambition to be the best city and I know you will continue work with the council to improve the lives of everyone in Leeds."
