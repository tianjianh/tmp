These are some the images and tweets she has sent back as she travelled into the city - it was a "horrifying" sight, she said.
The BBC team joined dozens of fire engines and military vehicles heading towards Tianjin, about 120km (75 miles) from the capital, Beijing, in the early hours of the morning.
This sheet of metal was twisted and burned, and thrown into the street by the force of the blast.
