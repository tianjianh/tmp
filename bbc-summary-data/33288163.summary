Eight no entry signs and an illuminated road closure sign to mark an Inverness one-way system have been described as unnecessary by people who live there.

The signage on Anderson Street in Merkinch is part of a phase of work in the construction of the city's new flood alleviation scheme.
Local resident Sarah Mackay said: "A no entry sign is a no entry sign, you don't need nine signs to say no entry."
The contractor involved said they were needed for the number of access points.
Another resident, David McCall, said: "Everyone can see the road's closed.
"Why do you need signs taking up the pavement?"
A spokesperson for the contractor McLaughlin and Harvey said the traffic management system was drawn up by another firm and approved by Highland Council.
The spokesperson added: "The reason there are so many signs on that section of Anderson Street is that there are a lot of access points."
