[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ched Evans rape appeal decision delayed until April

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Court of Appeal will not give its decision on an appeal by footballer Ched Evans against his conviction for rape until April, judges have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wales international was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire.
The judges at the two-day hearing reserved their judgement after hearing submissions from Evans' legal team.
Evans, 27, was released from jail in 2014 after serving half of his five-year term.
The panel of three judges heard submissions from both Evans' legal team and the Crown Prosecution Service, with new evidence being considered.
The court was told a decision and reasoning would be given "as soon as possible in April", with reporting restrictions imposed at the start of the hearing kept in place until then.
The former Manchester City, Norwich and Sheffield United player has not been signed by a new club since his release from prison.
