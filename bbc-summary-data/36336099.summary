Abdul Hafidah, 18, died in hospital from a stab wound to the neck after the attack in Moss Side.
Police believe he had been chased by a group of men near Greenheys Lane before he was hit by the car and then attacked.
His family said they were experiencing "the most difficult time in our lives".
They added: "Abdul was a composed and caring son, who bought us all so much joy. You felt his presence when he was there and you missed it whenever he wasn't.
"His strength was in his loyalty to his family and friends, and honesty whenever he spoke."
Mr Hafidah's family also urged young people to spend time with their parents and think about the community they wanted to grow up in.
Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder.
A 17-year-old boy was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and later bailed.
