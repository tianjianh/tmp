The Wood, who had won one of their previous eight league games, missed a number of chances in the first half.
Jamie Lucas opened the scoring for Boreham Wood early in the second period when he met Ricky Shakes' throughball and fired home.
Eastleigh searched for an equaliser late on and it eventually came after Drury latched onto Jai Reason's cross.
