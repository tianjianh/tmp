[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has admitted murdering a friend in a frenzied attack at her home in Glasgow.

Danielle Watson, 29, left her 49-year-old neighbour Edward Bennett with black eyes, bleeding on the brain, 18 rib fractures and broken bones in his neck.
During the attack in November last year, she also strangled Mr Bennett with a scarf and rammed scouring pads down his throat, blocking his windpipe.
Watson faces a mandatory life term when she is sentenced next month.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that the murder took place in Watson's home in Crowlin Crescent, in the Cranhill area of the city, on 6 or 7 November.
During the attack, Watson, who is slightly-built and under 5ft tall, also stamped on father-of-four Mr Bennett, leaving impressions of her footprints visible on his body.
Advocate depute Leanne Cross, prosecuting, said: "A post-mortem examination revealed evidence of severe blunt traumatic injury to multiple body regions, including the neck, chest, back and his airways were blocked as two sponges or scourers were found tightly placed within his throat area."
The court heard that in the early hours of 7 November, Watson texted her cousin saying: "I need sum where 2 run just now I've done summit awful."
When she was asked what she had done she replied: "Murder."
At about 08:15, while Mr Bennett lay dead in her living room, Watson was caught on CCTV footage at a shop in Cranhill chatting and laughing with staff as she bought cigarettes and a lighter.
Watson then returned to her flat and confessed on the phone to her parents that she had murdered someone and he was lying on her living room floor.
Minutes later she took a taxi to her aunt's house. As soon as she got in the door she said, referring to the black scarf she was wearing: "I'm going to take that off my neck, I strangled him with that."
Ms Cross said that Watson told her parents, who arrived at her aunt's house, that she had strangled him "because he got fresh with me".
When she was arrested, Watson later told police: "I know I am a violent person, but I didn't think I was capable of being this violent."
The court heard that she has a number of previous convictions in both Scotland and England, including crimes of violence.
Solicitor advocate Murray Macara, defending, said: "One of the main reasons Miss Watson has taken the step of pleading guilty at this stage is to spare the family the ordeal of a trial. Though that will be of scant consolation to them."
Judge Lord Turnbull deferred sentence on Watson until next month, when he will decide the minimum term she must serve before she can apply for parole.
