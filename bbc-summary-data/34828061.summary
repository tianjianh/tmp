Wales boss Chris Coleman keen on England pre-Euro 2016 friendly

Wales boss Chris Coleman says playing England would be ideal preparation for Euro 2016, but would rather avoid their British rivals at the finals in France.

Coleman's side will be among the bottom seeds, while Roy Hodgson's team are in the top pot.
"Everyone wants to play England in the same way they want to play top sides like Germany and Spain," Coleman said.
"But in the tournament itself it would be viewed as a battle of Britain - that could make it a distraction."
The draw for the Euro 2016 pools takes place in Paris on 12 December.

Wales' next friendly window will be in March and the ramifications of the draw will be considered before a list of suitable opponents is drawn up.
England have already organised March friendlies with Germany and the Netherlands, but more games will be played at the end of May before the finals start in France on 10 June.
"We know we will be drawn against one of the top teams and England are one of the top teams," Coleman added.
"We will play [at least] three games and we don't want it to all be about one of them.
"But it is our first major tournament for a while and we could maybe play England in a friendly somewhere down the line. That would not be a problem at all."
Wales lost their first pre-Euro 2016 friendly to the Netherlands 3-2 in Cardiff on Friday.
Without the likes of leading star forward Gareth Bale of Real Madrid and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey, Wales gave a good account of themselves.
Coleman's side twice came from behind through Crystal Palace midfielder Joe Ledley and Emyr Huws, but Dutch captain Arjen Robben struck the decisive goal nine minutes from time.
