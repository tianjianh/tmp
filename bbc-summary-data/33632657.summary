The family of a student murdered on a Thai island have collected their son's posthumous first class degree from the university where he studied.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Miller, 24, from Jersey, attended the University of Leeds and had been travelling with Hannah Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk.
Their bodies were found on a beach on Koh Tao in September 2014.
The university awarded Mr Miller a degree in civil and structural engineering.
He had just completed the third year of his degree and was about to start the fourth year of the master of engineering course.
His mother Sue Miller and girlfriend Jessy Howorth collected the degree on his behalf.
The trial of two Burmese men - Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo - accused of murdering the pair continues. Both deny the charges.
