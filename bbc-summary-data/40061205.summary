Alessandra, 28, joined from Rochdale in July 2016 and scored nine goals in 50 games for Pools last season.
His most profitable spell came with Plymouth between 2013 and 2015, when he scored 25 goals in two seasons.
"When the chance arose I grabbed it with both hands," Alessandra told the club website.
"I don't think I would have come here if I didn't think we had a shot at doing well next season."
Notts manager Kevin Nolan added: "There were a number of clubs interested in Lewis and it looked tricky at one stage, but I'm absolutely delighted that he chose to come and work with us."
