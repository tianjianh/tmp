Pro12: Munster 23-24 Cardiff Blues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Winger Tom James scored two tries as Cardiff Blues narrowly defeated Munster in Cork to make it two wins from two in the Pro12.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In an enthralling match where the lead was never more than seven points, Dan Fish's 68th-minute try proved to be the decisive score.
Andrew Conway and Dave Kilcoyne scored tries for Munster as they picked up a losing bonus point.
In the first round the Blues beat Edinburgh 34-16.
It was a disappointing result for Munster who were hoping for another win after last week's 23-13 victory over the Scarlets.
The visitors took a deserved lead after eight minutes, the lively James finding a gap in the Munster defence to touch down under the posts.
The home side got back on level terms when the Blues failed to deal with Ian Keatley's neat kick over the top. A clever pick up and offload by Darren Sweetnam saw full-back Conway cross the line.
Both teams pursued an attacking and expansive brand of rugby. The Blues turned down a very kickable penalty for out-half Gareth Anscombe in favour of a kick into the corner.
James got his second try of the game following a scintillating line break by Rey Lee-Lo. The Samoan found the international winger on his inside shoulder as the Blues secured a 17-10 half-time lead.
The introduction of Ireland internationals CJ Stander and Donnacha Ryan early in the second half gave the home team renewed impetus. The forwards' pressure was rewarded with a try in the 62nd minute when Kilcoyne barrelled over after 12 phases on the Bues' try-line.
Danny Wilson was also able to call on some experienced heads on the bench. Wales captain Sam Warburton made his first appearance and played his part in what was an end-to-end encounter.
Blues regained the lead with their first meaningful attack of the half. Fish scored the try after terrific work by Lee-Lo and replacements Matthew Morgan and Lloyd Williams.
In the next round of Pro12 fixtures Cardiff will host Glasgow at Arms Park while Munster are away to Newport Gwent Dragons.
