A scheme designed to see more public art in Jersey was launched a decade ago and planners describe it as "very positive" for the island.

Kevin Pilley from the planning department said the Jersey percentage for art scheme was evolving.
The scheme has seen works from the likes of Antony Gormley and Mariel Neudecker in St Helier.
Mr Pilley said developers were now focusing more on working with schools and local groups.
"You can get lots of benefits from this, it isn't just about the artistic output it can be about engaging the community in the design of the project."
Colin Mcleod from the Channel Islands Co-operative society recently announced one of the largest percentage for art projects to date.
It will see a "river of light" created in Pitt Street, St Helier, featuring underground lighting and words.
This is a voluntary scheme but planning officers say they do consider the artistic contribution when looking at the application, especially for larger projects.
Environment Minister, Deputy Steve Luce, said in future people will look back and be pleased the work was created.
