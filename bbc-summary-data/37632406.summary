The Wimbledon and Olympic champion is backing the armed forces charity's Sport Remembers campaign.
It commemorates the sportsmen who gave up their careers and lives for their country.
The charity is calling on the nation's sporting organisations, clubs and individuals to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.
Andy Murray said: "During the First World War many tennis players left the court for the battlefield and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.
"I find it humbling that so many players sacrificed so much for us, and I'm proud to be part of the Royal British Legion's Sport Remembers campaign".
One tennis player who lost his life during WW1 was four-time Wimbledon champion Tony Wilding, the only man before Bjorn Borg to win four straight men's singles titles.
A vast number of footballers, rugby players, golfers, cricketers, boxers, tennis players and Olympians served in the war.
The Royal British Legion has released a toolkit which includes a souvenir pennant, poems, readings and music.
