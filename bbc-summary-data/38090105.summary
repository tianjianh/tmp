Norwich City manager Alex Neil has the support of the club's board despite four straight Championship defeats, says Canaries chairman Ed Balls.

Neil's side are currently sixth in the second tier following relegation from the Premier League last campaign.
"He knows he's got the backing of the board," Balls told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"We've worked with him very closely for a couple of years, we know his quality, we know his integrity and determination and we know he can do it."
Balls continued: "Two seasons ago when he came in we had a much tougher start to the Championship, he came in and delivered a turnaround which, had it been reflected over the full season, we would have finished runaway top of the Championship."
Balls was speaking at the club's Annual General Meeting on Wednesday, where Neil and board members fielded questions from club shareholders.
Fan questions ranged from some concerning the defence, which has failed to keep a clean sheet in the league since August, to striker Kyle Lafferty's absence from the starting XI.
"You could see how much he was listening and think hard about the challenges from the room around set plays, the defence, the transfer window," said Balls.
"He knows we've got to do better in the future but at the same time I think he's somebody we know can do this. The players are with him, we just need to win some games in the next few weeks."
While Norwich's recent weekends on the field have left fans less than entertained, chairman Balls has been delighting millions every Saturday night on BBC TV's Strictly Come Dancing.
One fan even said on Wednesday "having been to (recent away defeats) Brighton and QPR you are far more entertaining than our first team Mr Balls".
Balls said: "I've actually been missing coming to Saturday games in the last few weeks. My son and brother have been, but I haven't because I've been doing the tango and the cha cha.
"The gentleman asked whether there was anything I could teach the players. Unfortunately I've been bottom of the league for nine weeks out of 10 and the football club are sixth in the Championship.
"I don't think I've anything to teach them, I think they've got more to teach me."
