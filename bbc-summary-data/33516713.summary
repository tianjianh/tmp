[SN]TITLE[SN]
SNP will vote to keep English fox hunting legislation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP group at Westminster has decided to vote against attempts to relax the ban on fox hunting in England and Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nationalist MPs agreed to support the current restrictions.
The House of Commons is to consider the legislation on Wednesday.
SNP Westminster group leader Angus Robertson said the ban in England and Wales should be maintained while the Scottish parliament considers strengthening the law in Scotland.
The UK intends government to introduce measures to prevent Scottish MPs voting on purely English matters in future.
Mr Robertson said: "We totally oppose fox hunting, and when there are moves in the Scottish Parliament to review whether the existing Scottish ban is strong enough, it is in the Scottish interest to maintain the existing ban in England and Wales for Holyrood to consider.
"We are in a situation where the Tory government are refusing to agree to any amendments to improve the Scotland Bill - which are supported by 58 of Scotland's 59 MPs - and imposing English Votes for English Laws to make Scotland's representation at Westminster second class.
"In these circumstances, it is right and proper that we assert the Scottish interest on fox hunting by voting with Labour against the Tories' proposals to relax the ban."
Traditional fox hunting with dogs is illegal across Britain, but in England and Wales, only two dogs can be used to flush out a fox so that a farmer or landowner can shoot it, while in Scotland an unlimited number of dogs can be used.
Conservative MPs have been given a free vote on the issue but hunting supporters appear unlikely to muster sufficient numbers to win the vote now that the SNP have against them.
Reaction on Twitter to the SNP decision, Scottish Secretary David Mundell's adviser Prof Adam Tomkins said: "More posturing from the SNP: last week EVEL, this week foxes. It's just tactics, designed to irritate. Ignore them and don't rise to it."
