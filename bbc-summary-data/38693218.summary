You can expect to see loads of Olympic and Paralympic heroes in action - but what will the mascot look like?
Well, Blue Peter is launching a new competition for you to design the mascots for the London 2017 IAAF World Championships.
The judges are some familiar sporting faces - Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill and Paralympian Richard Whitehead.
Jenny caught up with them to put their previous mascot knowledge to the test.
What will they score out of five? Watch and seeâ€¦
