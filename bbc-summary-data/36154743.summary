Robson, the former British number one, had break-point chances in the third game but could not convert them.
Babos then took charge, dropping just two more games in a 6-1 6-2 victory.
Robson had earned her first WTA main draw win since 2013 in round one, as she tries to return to the top of the game following a wrist injury.
The 22-year-old is currently ranked 426th, but looks set to move inside the world's top 350 in next week's rankings.
