King, 27, played in 25 games on the way to helping the Foxes win the Premier League and is confident of a Gareth Bale-inspired Wales' chances in France.
"We've got the best player in the tournament so why can't we win it," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"They said we [Leicester] couldn't win the league at the start of the season so that's given us a bit of belief."
The midfielder is currently with Wales in a pre-tournament training camp in Portugal.
He has made 32 appearances for Wales since making his debut in 2009, and believes that Bale gives their side the edge over every other team in the tournament.
"If you want to name me another that might be better than him then go for it," he said.
"The way he can win a game on his own is something that not many players have the capability of doing."
Bale will play for Real Madrid in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid on Saturday and will receive support from his compatriots.
"Gareth's played a lot of football in his career, it's just going to be another game for him. Obviously it's a massive game and one which we want his team to win," King added.
"We want him to arrive fit and ready to go but we're not nervous. We just hope he can get the win and that will bring him here buzzing."
