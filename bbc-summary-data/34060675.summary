Melissa Morton, 12, was among 34 pupils at Brentwood School in Essex aboard a coach that crashed into a motorway bridge near Middelkerke, West Flanders.
Her father Keith Morton said she had been "very disturbed by it all".
The school said some staff still needed hospital treatment, but all pupils were due back in school next week.
The coach, which was heading to Cologne in Germany for a languages trip, hit a bridge on the A18 (E40) near Middelkerke during the morning of 28 June.
Driver James Chance, who worked for a coach firm in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was killed. A second driver was also injured.
Two boys who were badly hurt, with one receiving head injuries and another having a broken leg, have both been back to the independent school to meet their friends, a spokesman said.
He said some injured teachers, including one who suffered a broken collarbone, had continued to receive hospital treatment and were due to continue recovering for a number of weeks until they could return to work. Some pupils and staff are also receiving counselling.
Keith Morton, whose daughter Melissa escaped unhurt, told BBC Essex she was still "emotionally not quite right".
"There's been some teary situations and sleepless nights and it's still quite a shock for her," he said.
"There was one occasion when she had to get into a coach and was very disturbed by it all."
The school's second master David Taylor said he had spoken to police in Belgium and it was "going to be a long process" to find out what caused the crash, but he said he would still like trips to continue.
