[SN]TITLE[SN]
Absenteeism rises at 12 Northern Ireland councils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dozen Northern Ireland councils saw staff absenteeism rise last year, with the problem the worst in Ballymoney Borough Council, according to a report from the local government auditor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Overall, average sickness absence rate across all councils was just over 11 days, a slight improvement on the previous year.
But in Ballymoney council it rose to 16 days, and in Larne to nearly 15 days.
The lowest rate was six days at Fermanagh District Council.
The auditor looked at absenteeism in all 26 councils, which in April this year reduced to 11 councils in a shake-up of local government.
The report noted that the problem had improved most at Carrickfergus Borough Council, the council where it was the biggest issue in 2013.
Absenteeism there has now fallen from 17 days to 13 days.
The auditor, Louise Mason, said in her report it is important councils "rigorously manage absence" to ensure staff welfare is protected and front line services are not affected.
