Super Tuesday is all about winning delegates, who endorse a candidate at the party conventions in July.  The delegate tracker charts who's ahead in the nomination races.
The totals include the delegates won per state, as well as so-called "unpledged" or "super delegates".
They are generally party leaders or elected officials, though the Democrats include former officials as well. Each super delegate is entitled to one vote at the convention.
AP conducts surveys of these super delegates, and adds them to a candidate's totals if they indicate their support.  In the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton has gained the support of more than 500 super delegates so far.
Super delegates can - and do - change their minds during the course of the campaign, so the figures may shift as the race unfolds.
The delegate tracker is updated automatically. There may be a short delay between the delegates being assigned and the totals changing.
