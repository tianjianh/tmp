Police said post mortem examinations would be taking place later.
Family members were being spoken to by officers "to establish the circumstances of what appears to be a very tragic case", said a force spokesman.
People living near the street have been putting flowers near the building.
One woman said she came to lay flowers out of "respect for the children".
Michael Jameson, strategic director of Children's Services at Bradford Council, said: "This is a very tragic and shocking incident.
"We are doing all we can to assist the police with their inquiries and support those affected."
