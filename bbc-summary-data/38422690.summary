[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The sale of financially-troubled Championship club Bradford Bulls is expected to go through after Christmas, report BBC Radio Leeds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Rugby Football League had revealed on Thursday that a consortium was considering a formal bid for the Bulls.
A decision was expected on Friday, but it is understood certain points of the offer need to be clarified by solicitors, which has caused a delay.
Bradford - who were relegated in 2014 - entered administration on 14 November.
