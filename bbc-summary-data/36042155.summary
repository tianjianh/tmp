Brian Rouse, 48, from Watford, was jailed for four months on 30 March after pleading guilty to four charges at Aylesbury Crown Court.
He was dismissed from Hertfordshire Constabulary without notice at a public misconduct hearing on Wednesday.
A spokesman for the force said his conduct "fell way below what is expected".
"Hertfordshire Constabulary is committed to ensuring that its officers and staff uphold the highest standards of integrity and that we are accountable to the public we serve," the spokesman added
"Where those standards are not met, it is right that a full investigation takes place and appropriate action taken."

Rouse, who was based at The Mount prison in Bovingdon, had been suspended from duty since the case came to light.
The National Crime Agency uncovered his offences, that took place between 2010 and 2015, during an investigation into online child abuse.
Rouse has been placed on the sex offenders register for seven years and is the subject of a Sex Offenders Prevention Order, that will run for seven years.
