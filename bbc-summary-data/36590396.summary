The animal was found lying next to its mother in a field at Llanelian, near Colwyn Bay, in Conwy county.
The heifer was just three days old.
"It's a truly, truly despicable act and the rural crime team will be investigating it thoroughly," said Sgt Rob Taylor, of the North Wales Police rural crime unit.
"She was born on Saturday. Last night she was with her mother and was perfectly happy and healthy.
"This morning she was dead with her mother next to her. She's got an extensive head wound and it looks like someone has gone into the field and struck her across the head with a piece of wood, which was also left there."
