Donald Trump plans to take his legal challenge to an offshore wind farm to the European courts.

It follows the UK Supreme Court rejecting the US presidential hopeful's appeal against plans for 11 turbines off Aberdeen, close to his golfing development at Menie.
The Trump Organisation said it was not planning to withdraw future investment in the north east, despite the setback.
Representative George Sorial predicted the wind farm would not happen.
The US businessman was taking on the Scottish government, which approved the plan.
Former First Minister Alex Salmond said the latest court verdict left Mr Trump a "three-time loser".
The Trump Organisation hit back: "Does anyone care what this man thinks? He's a has-been and totally irrelevant."
Mr Trump had begun his challenge to the decision to grant planning permission more than two years ago.
He was angry at the Scottish government approving plans for the renewable energy development within sight of his multi-million pound golf development north of Aberdeen.
He argued the turbines will spoil the view.
Mr Trump made a series of legal challenges in the Scottish courts, and then took the fight to the UK's Supreme Court in London.
However, the Supreme Court judges delivered a unanimous ruling.
BBC Scotland revealed the planned European legal challenge on Wednesday evening.
