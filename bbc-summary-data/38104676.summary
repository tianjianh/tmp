[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 20-year-old man and a 34-year-old woman were both arrested at an address in Bow on Friday on suspicion of attempted murder.
A 17-year-old man was arrested  on Tuesday night following the attack on suspicion of attempted murder.
He was released on bail until late January 2017.
The officer, in his 40s, was attacked in an alleyway near to the Bow bells pub in Bow road.
He suffered three stab wounds and remains in hospital.
After attacking the officer, the group of four ran off.
Detectives do not believe the group were aware the man they attacked was a police office.
Detectives believe the group of four had arrived in the area via the Docklands Light Railway (DLR)  getting off at Bow Church Station. The group was made up of three males and one female.
Detectives also believe the group was involved in another incident on the same night where a motorist was threatened with a knife.
At about 21:00 GMT a man was sitting in his parked car in Purdy Street near to Devons Road DLR station when the group approached his vehicle and threatened him with a knife.
Det Ch Insp Gary Holmes leading the investigation, said: "Whilst we have made two new arrests in our investigation I am continuing to appeal from any witnesses and information.
"Fortunately, whilst our injured colleague remains in hospital with serious injuries, he is making good progress with his recovery, and we wish him well.
"I am sure the thoughts of all officers and staff remain with him, his family and friends at this time."
