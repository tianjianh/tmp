Paul Wilmott, 63, died at his home on Springwood in Haxby when it was wrecked by the blast on 19 February.
A neighbouring property was demolished after the explosion but some damaged homes are yet to be fixed.
MP Julian Sturdy has met residents and said there was frustration "that things haven't been moving forward".
One resident, Maggie Kitson, said: "Every single property in the street has been affected and we are all pursuing claims through insurance companies to get our properties back to what they were before.
"We collectively want the insurance companies to get together so that we're all being represented in the same way.
"We're all being dealt with individually, which is a nightmare and uncoordinated in terms of rebuilding and project managing."
Residents have collectively contacted an expert with experience of dealing with blast damage to assess properties.
Mr Sturdy, Conservative MP for York Outer, said: "There is frustration that things haven't been moving forward over the last few weeks.
"It was important to bring everyone together to get their questions answered.
"There is a feeling now the council and insurance companies will take some of these issues away."
