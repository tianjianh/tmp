Researchers at Glasgow University have claimed a breakthrough in producing hydrogen fuel from water.

They said their process is fast, clean and cheap. It can store energy from the sun and wind.
Writing in the journal Science, the Glasgow researchers said their process is thirty times faster than the current method.
Without using any more energy, it is claimed to store the hydrogen in a carbon-free liquid.
Prof Lee Cronin, of the university's School of Chemistry. said: "The process uses a liquid that allows the hydrogen to be locked up in a liquid-based inorganic fuel.
"By using a liquid sponge known as a redox mediator that can soak up electrons and acid we've been able to create a system where hydrogen can be produced in a separate chamber without any additional energy input after the electrolysis of water takes place.
"The link between the rate of water oxidation and hydrogen production has been overcome, allowing hydrogen to be released from the water 30 times faster than the leading PEME process on a per-milligram-of-catalyst basis."
