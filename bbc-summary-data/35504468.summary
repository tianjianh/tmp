The event aims to give an insight into mountain terrains and culture and offers film makers the chance to show their work to a wider audience.
The two-day festival at George Square Lecture Theatre in Edinburgh.
Tickets for the event, which starts on Saturday, start at Â£6.
Stevie Christie, Edinburgh Mountain film festival director, explains: "Whether you are a committed outdoor enthusiast or more of an armchair fan, or if you simply enjoy hearing enthralling stories set against incredibly beautiful scenery, there is something for you at the EMFF.
"And if you wish you could have adventures like the ones you see but can't find the time in your life, we even have a short film which tells you the solution."
