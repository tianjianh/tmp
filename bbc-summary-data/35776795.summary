Mistreated cancer patients say hospital revoked promise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Breast cancer patients mistreated by a surgeon have claimed the trust that runs the hospital has gone back on promises and put lives at risk.

The GMC suspended Ian Paterson in 2012 after a review found he performed unnecessary or incomplete operations.
A patients' support group claims 3,500 patients will not be recalled after funding for them is withdrawn.
The Heart of England NHS trust, which runs Heartlands Hospital, said support had ended so it could stay independent.
Mr Paterson performed an unrecognised cleavage sparing operation, which left 700 patients at greater risk of breast cancer returning.
The GMC said the procedure, which left a small amount of tissue for cosmetic reasons, breached national guidelines because it risked the return of cancer.
A patient support group was set up for those affected, with promises of compensation and follow-up support by the trust.
However, the group has been told all support, contact and funding is to be withdrawn. Members have also been told two staff members, a support worker and an academic doctor who identified patients at risk have left and will not be replaced.
A trust spokesperson said: "The trust has for some time funded a room for the group to meet and a support worker. Following a conversation with the chief nurse at Heartlands, it was decided that this support had to come to an end.
"This was not for financial reasons but, given the ongoing inquiries, was so the hospital could remain independent and not be intertwined.
"It is also unusual for a hospital to fund one support group," she said.
Sir Ian Kennedy conducted a report in 2012 that stated: "The trust is wrestling with the further challenge of whether to recall patients who have undergone procedures other than mastectomies or CSM, for instance, a lumpectomy or a wide local excision.
"The concern is obvious: given what is known about the patients already reviewed, does the trust have a duty to look at all patients (around 3,500) to reassure both the patients and the trust that there are no further areas of concern?"
The trust told the BBC: "Sir Ian Kennedy was not a breast surgeon and cancer care has moved on since his report. It was important to have clinical pathways, but not necessarily all he said in the report."
Chair of the patient group, Ann Butler, said the trust's actions had caused "immense anxiety and stress" to patients who feared the return of the disease.
The group said patients would no longer get fast track access to cancer specialists - despite women in the group seeing their cancer return.
More than 50% of the women identified by the trust have already died, Ms Butler claimed.
The trust said: "We would also like to reassure patients that there is no clinical evidence or rationale to believe that any patient, apart from those who have had incomplete cleavage sparing mastectomies, has a higher risk of a recurrence of breast cancer over and above that of any patient unfortunate enough to suffer from the disease.
"Despite this the trust has initiated a process to recall 10% of these patients to reassure both the patients and the trust that there are no further areas of concern. The results to date support the view that there is no added risk of recurrence."
Ms Butler claims contact with the trust had been met with "obstruction, disrespect and a failure in the hospital's duty of care".
The trust said it met Ms Butler before Christmas and maintained its response was "not rude or unsympathetic".
The change of heart has been attributed to a change in management - the trust is now run by executives from the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.
The support group has written to the chair of the two hospitals, Jacqui Smith, about its concerns and to health secretary Jeremy Hunt.
Mr Paterson, 58, who worked at hospitals run by the Heart of England NHS Trust and Spire Healthcare, is charged with 21 counts of unlawfully and maliciously wounding 11 patients. His trial is due to start in May.
