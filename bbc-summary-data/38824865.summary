However, the draw did extend Chelsea's lead at top of the Premier League to nine points.
Liverpool keeper Mignolet made up for his first-half embarrassment when he was beaten by David Luiz's superb free-kick from 25 yards.
Georginio Wijnaldum's close-range header in the second-half gave Liverpool a draw they fully deserved, ending a run of three home losses in a row.
However, it could have been much better for Chelsea and worse for Liverpool when Costa went to ground 14 minutes from the end.
Referee Mark Clattenburg pointed to the spot but Mignolet dived low to his right to save the Spain striker's spot-kick.
