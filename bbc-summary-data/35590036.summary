[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh school plan for Newport being resubmitted to council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new Welsh-medium secondary school in Newport are set to be resubmitted to the council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors had rejected the plans for the existing Duffryn High School site after flooding concerns were raised.
But Newport council said it was resubmitting the application to full council, along with plans for "major improvements" to the high school.
The council said it was due to "the importance to the city of both developments".
The Â£17m plans proposed that the existing Duffryn High School site would be split, with a new Welsh medium school being developed on part of it.
Natural Resources Wales had objected to the application because of potentially "dangerous" floods.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the council said: "This resubmission and redetermination is no reflection on the correctness of the earlier decision taken by the planning committee, based on planning officer advice.
"However, in view of the significance of this application... it was considered appropriate and more democratic for all councillors to take collective responsibility for this decision."
A decision is not expected to be made by full council "until later in the year", it added.
