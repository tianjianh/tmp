Some Royal Bank of Scotland customers have had problems using credit and debit cards in stores and at cash machines, the day after RBS was fined £56m for its 2012 computer meltdown.

Customers of RBS and its subsidiaries, NatWest and Ulster Bank, were unable to use Visa debit and credit cards.
An RBS spokesperson said the breakdown had "minimal customer impact".
It said the problems affected "a small number of people" conducting higher value and international transactions.
The problems started at 7.45am and were resolved by 9.15am, the bank said.
On Thursday, the bank was fined £56m by UK regulators over its huge systems crash in 2012, when 6.5 million customers - equivalent to 10% of the UK population - faced problems that lasted in some cases several weeks.
Also on Friday Barclays online customers experienced some difficulties with their service for a short time.  A Barclays spokesperson told the BBC: "Barclays online banking service was unavailable for around an hour earlier today.
"All other services were up and running as usual during this time however we apologise to those customers that were impacted.  We are currently investigating what caused this to prevent it happening again."
