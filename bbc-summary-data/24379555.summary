Everton FC have revealed the new club badge design most popular with its supporters, after a previous redesign was criticised.

In September, the club said its motto would be reinstated after its removal for this season led to protests.
Fans were given a choice of three new crests they could vote for.
Nearly 80% of fans that took part opted for the winning design, which garnered 10,343 votes, while 12% of fans chose the second option and 9% the third.
Unveiling the crest, Everton manager Roberto Martinez said: "I was impressed straightaway when I saw it but there has been a huge majority of fans have chosen this one.
"It captures what we were looking for: to have a modern touch and to be a global badge without taking away all the key icons of the football club.
"Certain icons represent many years of history and that is important. Fans made it clear they wanted to see the tower and our motto and I think it is important 'Nil satis' is back on the badge."
The motto Nil Satis Nisi Optimum, which means "nothing but the best", dates back 75 years but disappeared as part of the redesign.
The club apologised in May after 22,000 fans signed an online petition condemning the "awful" 2013-2014 badge.
The winning design, which was voted for via the club's website, will be used from next season.
