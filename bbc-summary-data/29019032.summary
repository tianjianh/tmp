Ukrainian forces have suffered a series of setbacks, as pro-Russian rebels advance in the east of the country.

Officials said nearly 700 soldiers had been taken prisoner since the rebel offensive began.
Earlier the military said government forces had been forced to withdraw from Luhansk airport, saying they had been attacked by a column of Russian tanks.
Ukraine's defence minister said it was now fighting a "great war" with Russia in which tens of thousands could die.
Valery Heletey said on his Facebook page that the rebels had been defeated and Russia had been forced to begin a full-scale invasion of the region with regular forces.
"A great war has arrived at our doorstep - the likes of which Europe has not seen since World War Two," he said.
"Unfortunately, the losses in such a war will be measured not in the hundreds but thousands and tens of thousands."
Russia has repeatedly denied Ukrainian and Western accusations that it is providing troops and equipment to the rebels.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian and Russian officials are holding talks with separatist rebels and international monitors in Minsk.
Some 2,600 people have died in eastern Ukraine since fighting began in April.
The conflict broke out after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in March.
In other developments:
The rebels have been gaining ground on Ukrainian forces in recent days, in both the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and further south around the port of Mariupol.
Ukrainian news agency UNIAN quoted a senior official as saying that as many as 680 soldiers had been captured in Donetsk region after the recent fighting.
Col-Gen Volodymyr Ruban, chairman of the Centre for Prisoner Exchange, said "about 80%" of them were captured around Ilovaysk, east of the city of Donetsk, where hundreds of Ukrainian troops have been cut off since the latest rebel advance began.
Ukraine's security council confirmed that its troops had withdrawn from Luhansk airport "in an organised manner".
Clashes are said to still be taking place near the airport of the city of Donetsk, with separatists claiming that two Ukrainian platoons have surrendered.
There were also reports of an attack on a Ukrainian patrol vessel in the Azov Sea on Sunday night.
The talks in Minsk started on Monday, involving the so-called Contact Group which includes representatives from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
After several hours they were adjourned until Friday.
Rebel representatives appear to have softened their demand for full independence, telling Russian media they were seeking a "special status" for their regions within Ukraine which would leave them in charge of security and give them amnesty from prosecution.
The status would also "take into consideration the necessity of deepening economic integration with Russia", the rebels say.
Correspondents say what they are demanding would mean the de facto division of the country, as the Ukrainian government is set on closer economic ties to the EU.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, said he was counting on the talks to focus on "agreeing an immediate and unconditional ceasefire".
He also insisted there would be "no military intervention" from Russia in Ukraine.
Last week's first direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Petro Poroshenko, did not lead to any major breakthrough.
