A convicted murderer has admitted a "horrific" rape carried out two years before he went on to commit the "sadistic and sexual" killing of a student.

Jason Dockrill, 46, is serving a life term for the murder of 23-year-old Finnish national Suvi Aronen in 2003.
He had been due to face trial for the 2001 rape but changed his plea after DNA evidence linked him to the crime.
Dockrill also admitted two indecent assault counts.
He raped the victim in a park off Seething Lane in the City of London.
City of London Police said a routine case review and advances in DNA forensics had enabled detectives to link Dockrill to the attack.
"Plainly, having read the statement of the victim, this is a very serious sexual attack. She was in fear for her life," said Judge Timothy Pontius.
"It was a stranger rape carried out in a park and it consisted not just of rape but two serious indecent assaults as well."
The judge said it was "fortunate" Dockrill had decided to change his plea and "saved the victim the ordeal of giving evidence about these horrific crimes".
Two years after the Seething Lane rape, the unemployed fitter from Stratford, east London, dragged Ms Aronen into scrubland near Wanstead Common as she walked home, sexually assaulted her and battered her with a brick.
Her cries were heard by her parents who had called her mobile phone just as he struck.
"I knew something evil was taking place," Ms Aronen's mother told the court in 2004.
"I heard Suvi's very desperate voice and she asked faintly for help, saying something like 'no more' in both Finnish and English."
Dockrill had attacked three other women in the hours leading up to Ms Aronen's death.
He denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility but was convicted after trial.
Sentencing Dockrill in 2004, Judge Michael Hyam said he was a "danger to women and likely to remain so for a long time, if not indefinitely".
He described the attack as "wicked and without remorse. I can find no mitigating factors."
Sentencing for the 2001 rape has been adjourned until July 18 so that mental health reports can be carried out.
