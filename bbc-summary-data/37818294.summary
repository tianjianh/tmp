Fourth seed Matthew won 3-1 and goes on to face Egyptian sixth seed Karim Abdel Gawad in the last eight.
The 36-year-old from Sheffield dropped the opening game but came through 6-11 11-9 11-7 12-10 in 65 minutes.
Matthew is trying to win his fourth world title after victories in 2010, 2011 and 2013.
"It was windy and there was a little bit of humidity," he said of the open-air tournament.
"But at the World Championships you have to dig those results out and I think I will benefit a lot from this match tonight in terms of getting me back match-fit for the next round."
Top seed Mohamed El Shorbagy beat fellow Egyptian Karim Ali Fathi 3-0 to reach the quarters in Cairo.
