First Minister Carwyn Jones published an update on a report by Dr Margaret Flynn into one of the owners, Prana Das, on Tuesday.
She concluded Dr Das "should and could" have been prosecuted.
Inquests into the deaths of Stanley Bradford, Megan Downs, Edith Evans, Ronald Jones and others known to the Gwent coroner have been recommended.
Dr Das had faced charges relating to neglect and fraud at two care homes - Brithdir Care Home in New Tredegar, Caerphilly county, and The Beeches in Blaenavon, Torfaen.
But the Â£15m case against him collapsed after he suffered brain damage when he was attacked during a burglary at his home in 2012.
Mr Jones said he had now been contacted by Gwent Coroner David Bowen and inquests would be held "where he does have jurisdiction and where the law requires" and "he is already working to that end".
The first minister said he was aware of the "very real frustration" among patients' families after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) refused to reconsider criminal proceedings following the publication of Dr Flynn's report.
"I know that the families were both surprised by the speed of the response - on the same day as the report was published in the media - and the refusal to reconsider the case," he said.
"I know the families continue to ask why so few have been held accountable. I hope they take can take some comfort from the reply from the coroner who indicates he is pursuing inquests, as Dr Flynn recommended, where he has jurisdiction," he said.
Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, has decided there is "no need" to refer the case back to the Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division of the CPS, Mr Jones added.
Operation Jasmine was launched by Gwent Police in 2005 to look into alleged abuse at six care homes in south Wales.
It began after the death of an 84-year-old woman at one of the homes and involved 75 police officers over seven years.
Loraine Brannan was among several relatives in the Senedd on Tuesday to listen to the first minister, and later met Carwyn Jones to discuss Operation Jasmine.
"We do need to know where we can move on from here," she said.
"We're hoping now that this will provide us with the aim that we're campaigning for - that we will have justice for our loved ones and someone will be held accountable."
Mrs Brannan, who chairs the Justice for Jasmine campaign group, said inquests for families was a step forward.
"Really, we do need the CPS to reopen the case," she insisted.
