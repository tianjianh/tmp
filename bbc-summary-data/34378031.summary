Drivers facing parking charges in Holywell, Flintshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers in a Flintshire town now have to pay to park in council-owned car parks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Holywell has joined Mold and Buckley in having pay and display meters and Connah's Quay, Queensferry and Shotton are set to get them in October.
The council approved introducing the charges in April in a bid to raise funds and prevent congestion.
Flintshire council has faced a budget cut of Â£18m.
