[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Law firm Aberdein Considine is expanding its Glasgow and East Renfrewshire presence by merging with legal estate agency A&S Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will be the eighth Central Belt expansion of the Aberdeen-based partnership in only five years.
Three branches will be branded under the Aberdein Considine name from next month.
Ireland's legal office will become the partnership's main office in the city.
The combined business will employ 360 staff, with turnover of more than Â£21m. It offers a wide range of legal, property and financial services.
A&S Ireland was founded in 1985, specialising in private client legal work, and moving into estate agency.
It has two partners and 20 employees, all of whom will transfer to the expanded firm.
Gavin Crowe, one of the A&S Ireland partners, indicated that one of the attractions is the scale a larger firm can bring to providing services online.
"As estate agency continues to evolve in the digital age, this merger will give Glasgow clients a significant new player both online and 'on the ground'," he said.
