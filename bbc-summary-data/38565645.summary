[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gillingham P-P AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tuesday's League One game between Gillingham and AFC Wimbledon has been postponed because of a frozen pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was deemed that the surface at the Priestfield Stadium was unsafe during an inspection at 15:00 GMT on Monday.
The postponement means that Ady Pennock must wait until Saturday's visit of Shrewsbury Town to take charge of his first home match as Gillingham boss.
The Gills are 17th in League One, six points and six places behind Neal Ardley's Wimbledon.
