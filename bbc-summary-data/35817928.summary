[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rabbit illegally kept as a pet in Queensland state has been re-homed after its owner failed to convince police that it was a guinea pig.

The pet will be sent to a sanctuary in the state of New South Wales.
"Somebunny tried unsuccessfully to convince Springwood Police that this little guy was actually a guinea pig," Queensland Police posted to social media.
Queensland's anti-rabbit laws are the world's strictest.
While rabbits can be kept as pets in all other Australian states, Queensland banned the practice to protect its agricultural industry.
Owners without permits face six months' jail and fines of up to A$44,000 ($33,000; Â£23,000).
The Queensland Government says destruction caused by rabbits costs up to A$1b each year.
