The rapper's announced a 17-date tour starting in Sweden in March and ending in Glasgow a month later.
She said: "It's been way too long since I've seen my European Barbz! We have more than a few surprises in store."
The 32-year-old will perform nine dates in the UK in cities including London and Birmingham, with special guest, Grammy-nominated R&B star, Trey Songz.
He said he's thrilled to be heading to Europe, adding: "The love I feel overseas is overwhelming and I can't wait to get the tour started to bring fans the best TRIGGA show possible."
Last month, Minaj apologised after the lyric video for the track Only was accused of containing Nazi imagery.
The European leg of The Pinkprint Tour is announced days after Nicki Minaj found out she was nominated for two 2015 Grammy awards - best rap song for Anaconda and best pop duo/group performance for Bang Bang with Ariana Grande and Jessie J.
Her album - also called The Pinkprint - is released next Monday.
Tickets for the UK shows go on sale at 9am on Friday 12 December.
