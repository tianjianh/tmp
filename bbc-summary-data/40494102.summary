Barack Obama was gifted a kilt and a pair of trousers in his new family tartan when he attended a charity fund-raising dinner at the EICC in May.
It has navy blue to represent the flag of Hawaii where the 44th, and first African-American, president was born.
Green from the Kenyan flag, where his father was born, has also been used.
Sky blue and white are taken from the flag of Chicago where Mr Obama lives and works.
Tartan designer Brian Halley of Glasgow-based Slanj Kilts, who was asked to design the special tartan, said he had been "sworn to secrecy" over the project.
He told BBC Scotland: "When I received the email asking me if I could make a tartan quickly, and who it was for, I felt very excited and honoured.
"I don't think there is a more famous man and I think he has the second most Twitter followers in the world, so it was very exciting.
"I was sworn to secrecy at the time, it was all very hush-hush.
"Apparently, he loves the tartan and said he would wear the trousers rather than the kilt as he thinks his legs are too thin.
"I don't think his legs are too thin, anyone can wear a kilt."
Now that Mr Obama has officially registered the tartan under his name, he has the rights to it.
The charity fund-raising dinner raised Â£670,000 for charities taking part in the Kiltwalk campaign including the Maggie's Centres and Glasgow's Beatson Clinic.
