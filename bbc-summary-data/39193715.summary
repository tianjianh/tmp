The 20-year-old was selected for their Sheffield Shield game against South Australia, which started on Tuesday.
He took his first wicket on his Shield debut, taking 1-24 on a rain-affected first day in Sydney.
Englishman Crane is the first overseas player to represent the state since Pakistan's Imran Khan in 1984-85.
Crane has been playing grade cricket in Sydney during the English winter, and has taken 45 wickets in 11 matches, including three seven-wicket hauls.
His form at Gordon Cricket Club in the city, taking his wickets at an average of just over 20, saw him selected for NSW.
In his 16 first-class appearances for Hampshire, he has also taken 45 wickets, but at an average of 40.75.
New South Wales spinners Steven O'Keefe and Nathan Lyon are on Test duty with Australia in India, and Crane has been selected alongside off-spinner William Somerville.
Despite only bowling five overs on the opening day in Sydney, he had Tom Cooper caught for 19 as South Australia reached 169-5 at stumps.
In November, Crane signed signed a three-year contract extension with Hampshire, keeping him at the county until 2019.
