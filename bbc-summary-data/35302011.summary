Hundreds of people gathered at St Andrew's Church in Newgate Street, Newcastle, to pay their respects.
Organised by his agent Steve Wraith, Srnicek's brother Milan and friends and family joined fans and former Newcastle and Sunderland players at the church.
Srnicek died on 29 December aged 47, nine days after suffering cardiac arrest.
Srnicek became a favourite with Newcastle fans during his first spell at St James' Park, between 1991 and 1998.
He returned to the club on a season-long deal in September 2006 but was released in May 2007 after making 190 appearances across his two playing periods there.
Srnicek also played for Sheffield Wednesday, Portsmouth and West Ham in England, and made 49 appearances for his country.
Mr Wraith said it was a "fitting goodbye" to somebody who was loved "very much".
"I think there's an outpouring of grief on Tyneside because we feel like we've lost one of our own."
He said it was a simple, football-themed service, with hymns and songs that meant a lot to him, including Abide With Me and You'll Never Walk Alone.
Speaking after the service, Shearer said: "It's not surprising, but it's great to see so many old faces here today. People have come from all over the world, all over the country to be here, and that tells you what a nice, genuine, humble, honest, hard-working professional Pav was. He was great to be around."
Former goalkeeper Steve Harper said Srnicek was a "huge influence" on his career.
"The time and effort - when he used to take me to one side and try the brilliant training drills he used to do, which I couldn't do, but I certainly had a good go at, he was just a great influence," he said.
"The work ethic he had made you realise how hard you had to work... to get that head start from somebody like that was a great legacy that he left behind which I then tried to continue when he left.
"He was just a wonderful man who loved Newcastle, and today gives me an opportunity to tell him that the people of Newcastle loved him more. Pav was a special person.
"It [the memorial] gave people of this great city and region the opportunity to say farewell to him too."
On Tuesday, Newcastle and Manchester United players took part in a minute's applause for Srnicek, ahead of their 3-3 draw.
