In her first competition since UK Sport axed all funding for British Weightlifting, the 18-year-old lifted 100kg in the 'snatch' phase and 124kg in the subsequent 'clean and jerk' stage.
Her combined total of 224kg saw her miss out on an overall medal by 1kg.
"I'm buzzing with that performance," she told BBC Sport.
"It was my first competition since the Rio Olympics and there's lots of new faces and older lifters out there so to come out here and lift as I did is really encouraging."
Anastasiia Romanova (243kg) of Russia took the overall European -69kg title at the event in Split, Croatia, with Ukrainian Mariya Khlyan and Belarus lifter Anastasiya Mikhalenka both awarded silver medals for totalling 225kg's.
In her first competition since suffering a stress fracture in her back in December, GB's Emily Godley finished eighth in the same category with a combined total of 209kgs.
On Sunday Britain's Sarah Davies finished fifth in the women's -63kg division.
Sonny Webster (-94kg) and Owen Boxall (-105kg) will compete on Friday.
