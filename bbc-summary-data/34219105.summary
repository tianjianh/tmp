[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams has said he wants to meet Northern Ireland's Chief Constable over the arrest of his party's chairman in a murder inquiry.

Bobby Storey was one of three senior republicans arrested following the murder of Kevin McGuigan last month.
PSNI assessments that IRA members were involved led to a political crisis.
The men were released unconditionally. Mr Storey's solicitor said the detention was "unjustified" while Mr Adams said he had "grave concerns".
In response to the criticism, a Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokesperson said anyone who has a complaint about the actions of the police should contact the Office of the Police Ombudsman, the watchdog that holds the PSNI to account.
A member of the Policing Board has also defended the chief constable over the arrest.
Trevor Lunn of the Alliance Party rejected claims of "political policing" and said George Hamilton and his officers were simply doing their jobs.
Mr Storey is a former IRA prisoner who is now chairman of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland.
His solicitor, John Finucane, told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that they would be making a complaint to the Police Ombudsman.
Mr Finucane also repeated his remarks that his client intends to sue the PSNI's Chief Constable George Hamilton for wrongful arrest.
"We are talking about an arrest that is based on non-existent evidence," the lawyer said.
"I sat with my client for 35 hours in Antrim [police station].  We had 11 interviews and at no stage was any evidence produced to connect my client to the offences for which he was arrested for, and I think that raises some very, very serious questions."
Mr Finucane said the murder of Mr McGuigan was a very serious offence and the police were entitled to carry out an investigation.
However, he added: "Arrests must be based on evidence, you can't simply hold somebody for 35 hours without justifying that detention.
"I think the police really need to explain who made the decision to arrest Mr Storey, I think they need to be clear on what basis was that decision made and why was the arrest and detention allowed to proceed for 35 hours," Mr Finucane said.
