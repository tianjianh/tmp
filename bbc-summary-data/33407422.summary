'No' prompts mixed feelings in Greek press

Greek newspaper commentators have responded to the result of the referendum with a mix of triumph and anxiety.

While some papers praise the country for refusing unacceptable bailout conditions, others fear for what comes next.
The leftist, pro-government I Avyi paper praises the "sovereign people" (in Greek) for being "so determined not to bow to brutal asphyxiation".
The left-leaning I Efimerida ton Syntakton says the Greek people have sent a clear message to the world.
"The partners need to understand the Greeks' historic decision and to stop treating the government of Athens as a pariah," the paper says.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras comes in for praise from Ethnos, which is normally critical of the government.
"The government initiative was vindicated," it says.
"The result impressively confirmed the prime minister's leading position in Greek political life, and at the same time the Greek people's firm demand for the best deal possible within the context of the eurozone and the euro."
Ta Nea says "little Greece's contribution to the European cause has been tremendous at this historic juncture".
But it says the government faces the dilemma of committing to a programme of reform or heading for an exit from the eurozone.
"Brussels and Berlin await proposals from Athens, while tomorrow's eurozone summit will judge everything."
The conservative Kathimerini is worried about what comes next, saying: "The messages from European capitals, ahead of the summit of eurozone leaders expected to be held tomorrow, are alarming.
"The government will probably be faced with the dilemma of agreeing to profound reforms, or assuming the responsibility of an exit from the eurozone.''
The paper says that having achieved victory in the referendum, Mr Tsipras faces the challenge of "picking up the thread of negotiation again, as the mandate he received does not constitute a passport to exit from the euro".
Dimokratia appeals for unity after the conclusion of the "crazy initiative to hold a referendum".
It says: "There are only Greece and the Greeks, who must continue to live in unity and strive together for the best."
