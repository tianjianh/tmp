London Midland cancels more trains due to driver shortage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ongoing shortage of drivers has caused 39 more London Midland services to be cancelled or disrupted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trains on the Birmingham-Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton-Walsall, Birmingham-London Euston, Coventry-Nuneaton and Lichfield-Redditch have been affected.
More than 950 services have been disrupted since 14 October.
London Midland said it would be bringing in new timetables and staff rotas from Sunday, which would "close the shortfall of drivers".
The train operator said five shifts were affected on Friday, which meant 39 of its 1,300 trains were subject to alteration.
New trainee drivers will be qualified by mid-December, it said.
