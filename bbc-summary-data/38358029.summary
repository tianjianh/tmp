The woodland was searched by 60 volunteers as part of efforts to find Corrie Mckeague, 23, who was last seen on 24 September.
No trace of Mr Mckeague was found on the land near RAF Honington, where he was based, but his mother Nicola Urquhart hailed the search a success.
The search was co-ordinated by experts Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue.
Teams had been searching for evidence to back up the theory Mr Mckeague had been hit by a car while walking back to the base.
Ms Urquhart said the experts carried out the search for her son, originally from Dunfermline in Fife, to a high professional standard.
There was now no need to go back to any of the areas covered and they would be "confidently crossed off as areas Corrie is not in", she said.
"We will continue to search and I will let everyone know of the next date shortly," she added.
He was escorted out of Flex nightclub in Bury's town centre and was spotted several times on CCTV but the trail went cold after he entered a dead end road.
