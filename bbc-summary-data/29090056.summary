Cardiff City 2-4 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City staged a dramatic second-half recovery to win at Cardiff City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff were cruising at half-time after Joe Ralls, with a low, left-foot shot, and Aron Gunnarsson, cutting in from the left, had given them the lead.
Martin Olsson started the comeback when the ball fell kindly for him after a challenge on Lewis Grabban.
Wes Hoolahan equalised from a rebound, Michael Turner turned in from Alex Tettey to put Norwich ahead and Cameron Jerome scored a late breakaway.
The Canaries, unbeaten since their opening day defeat at Wolves, were awful during the first half and deservedly trailed.
Inside a minute Kenwyne Jones had seen his goalwards glancing header hacked clear, but soon after Ralls seized on Turner's loose pass and drove forward before sending a left-footed drive into the bottom corner.
Norwich fell further behind when Jones played in Anthony Pilkington down the right and his cross was expertly tucked home by Gunnarsson.
Despite great expectations and plenty of money spent to strengthen the squad, Cardiff had stuttered through the start of the Championship season.
But a two-goal lead at half-time against Norwich, like their hosts tipped for an immediate return to the Premier League, had the fans happy and suggested Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team were about to hit their stride.
Instead the Bluebirds fell flat on their face as Norwich picked them apart after the break, not helped by the injury withdrawal of Fabio at left-back.
Firstly Hoolahan was given far too much room to get a ball into Grabban and although Sean Morrison got in a foot, the ball sat up for Olsson to slot home from close range.
Norwich soon levelled, as Nathan Redmond evaded Ralls and Declan John to deliver a pinpoint cross for Jerome.
The former Cardiff striker's header was parried by Marshall, but the Scotland goalkeeper could do nothing as Hoolahan dispatched the follow-up.
The Canaries continued to surge forwards and Russell Martin's mishit shot was turned in by Turner as Marshall appealed in vain for offside.
Despite the capitulation, Cardiff did respond and Peter Whittingham twice worked John Ruddy in the Norwich goal.
But Jerome put the result beyond doubt three minutes from time, splintering the hosts' offside trap to round Marshall and send Norwich into second in the table.
Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:
"You could say it was our best 45 minutes in the first half, and the second was our worst.
"This league is about consistency and we did not have that today.
"We stopped playing. We did not get the second balls, we did not move the ball quickly enough and these are simple things you have to do."
Norwich manager Neil Adams:

"That's the first time I have had to get angry with them.
"They had to have the rocket at half-time as the first-half performance was nowhere near good enough, and it was justified by the second-half performance.
"I told the players from the off I will take defeats and draws but only if we go about it in the right way."
