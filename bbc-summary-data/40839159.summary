Robert Downs, 63, from Mold, Flintshire, was killed in the collision on the A525 link road between Denbigh and Ruthin on Friday.
North Wales Police said he died at the scene.
In a tribute, Mr Downs' family described him as a "loving" father and grandfather.
"He was a kind, loving and caring man who was always willing to assist anyone when he could. He was the rock of our life and was a long-standing and passionate motorcycle fanatic," the tribute said.
"He left our side so suddenly and we all sorely miss him. But he will always be there in our minds and hearts and never forgotten."
Police have appealed for witnesses.
