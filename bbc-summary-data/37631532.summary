Planning officials approved the Trafford Waters scheme, which includes 3,000 flats, a 300-room hotel, a 150-bed care home, shops and offices, and a primary school.
Trafford Council leader Sean Anstee said it had "all the characteristics to be a model for urban regeneration".
Developers Peel Land & Property said it had been 15 years in the making.
The development is on land bordering the Manchester Ship Canal in the north, Grade I listed All Saints Friary in the north-east and the Trafford Centre to the south.
It incorporates approximately 750,000 sq ft (228,600 sq m) of office space and 125,000 sq ft (38,100 sq m) of retail space, which will be linked to the shopping centre by bridge.
James Whittaker, development director for the firm, said Trafford Waters would turn the "disused site" into a "unique... urban community" and provide "much-needed" residential housing and office space and "help unlock business and employment opportunities".
He said the development would be "sustainable" and feature cycleways, plenty of landscaped, green spaces and waterways.
Trafford Council said the development made the "best use of this strategically important, vacant site" and "would contribute towards addressing the identified housing shortfall in Trafford."
Councillor Anstee said coming on the say day as the £350m tramline to Trafford Park was approved "simply goes to show that where we have a plan for major development, the necessary improvements to public transport and roads alongside new schools and green spaces can be a reality."
Peel Land & Property said it has pledged £30m towards the new extended A57 road into Traffordcity at junction 10 of the M60, including a new lifting bridge link crossing the Manchester Ship Canal, to "further enhance its accessibility".
