People aged between nine and 18 were asked to capture animals on camera for the Young Photographer Awards.
Lily Edwards, 16, photographed the moment a piglet snoozed with its siblings, which she called "Nap Time", earning her a runner-up place.
She said it looked "so peaceful and happy".
"I took this photo at a local farm. As I was taking a photo of the piglets sleeping, one opened its eyes," she said.
Springwatch presenter Chris Packham who judged the entries said: "These young people are going out and experiencing the environment around them and in their local area. It is just fantastic."
