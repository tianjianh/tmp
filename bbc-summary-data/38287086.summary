[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A voyeuristic Elvis impersonator has been sentenced to 18 years in jail for a string of sexual offences including the attempted rape of a child.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derrel Weaver, 62, from Widegates near Looe, Cornwall was branded a "dyed in the wool, predatory paedophile" by a judge.
Weaver filmed women using secret cameras and sexually abused children.
As he left the dock at Truro Crown Court, Weaver threatened to curse those in the courtroom.
Jurors took three hours to find Weaver guilty of 19 counts of sexual assault and gross indecency with a child, and two of attempted rape.
He had already pleaded guilty to eight voyeurism offences - and admitted filming women with hidden cameras disguised as light switches in a toilet.
Recorder Iain Hughes QC told Weaver: "I am absolutely sure you are and will remain a substantial danger to children physically and psychologically"
He said Weaver had an "ingrained, long-term and continuing sexual depravity towards young women and children".
Throughout the trial the Elvis impersonator wore aviator-style sunglasses, and he was animated throughout the sentencing.
As he was led away from the dock he shouted: "My Grandma is a real witch and I call upon her to curse everyone in this courtroom".
"Apart from my friend", he continued, pointing to a man in the public gallery.
He then appeared to cast a spell on the court as he was taken away, saying: "You think it's mumbo jumbo but you wait."
He was also found guilty of attempting to take an indecent photo of a child.
He was found not guilty of two charges of indecent assault and one of indecency with a child.
Weaver is already serving a five year sentence for firearms offences.
