Both sides were already out of play-off contention but defeat leaves the Wildcats two points adrift of Widnes at the foot of the table.
Patrick Ah Van crossed for two of the hosts' tries as Vikings dominated.
Wildcats' consolation tries through Craig Hall and Ben Jones-Bishop came only after they were 38 points behind.
Rhys Hanbury, Matt Whitley and Corey Thompson's scores added to Ah Van's early opener to put Vikings 24-0 up at the break.
After half-time, Stefan Marsh and Lloyd White - who kicked five goals - bolstered the hosts' tally before Wakefield finally got on the scoreboard through Hall.
Sunday's home win was in stark contrast to the 38-0 thrashing Widnes suffered in their previous outing at home to leaders Hull FC.
Widnes coach Denis Betts: "The job was done and dusted at 24-0. They had some injuries but I was pleased with the roster that they brought here and we did a really professional job.
"The players spoke about the Hull loss a week ago and they wanted to put a few things right and they did that today. We are making progress.
"We were really disappointed with the Hull game and we reacted well. For us it's about improvement, year on year, game on game and I'm pretty satisfied with what we've done."
Wakefield coach Chris Chester: "I do feel sorry for the fans. They know where we have come from, but today's performance was disappointing.
"Widnes marched us up the field far too easily and put us under pressure which we didn't handle well. We have four weeks now to turn this around.
"There are players out there who are playing for contracts so they should be looking over their shoulders. We don't want to finish this season on a downer - but it's up to them."
