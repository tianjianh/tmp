Election 2015: PM pledges 'paid volunteering leave'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifteen million workers would be offered three extra days of paid leave to do volunteering under a Conservative government, David Cameron has said.

The move, affecting the public sector and large companies, is announced alongside Tory plans to extend the real-terms freeze of some rail fares.
Labour said the volunteering pledge was a "re-announcement" and called the rail fares policy "unfunded".
Ed Miliband's party is to promise to safeguard policing numbers.
The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, are pledging a new scheme to help young working people borrow up to Â£2,000 from the government to put towards a tenancy deposit.
Under the Conservatives' volunteering plans, a new law would be passed requiring public sector employers and companies with more than 250 employees to give staff up to three days a year to do voluntary work.
Employers would cover the cost.
BBC home affairs editor Mark Easton said the prime minister's announcement was a reminder of the Big Society theme from the 2010 election "which many had thought had been binned".
He said a number of employers, including the CBI, had welcomed the move but some firms "may baulk at the idea of having to organise and pay for the policy, while schools, hospitals, emergency services and other public bodies may struggle to buy in cover for front-line workers from shrinking budgets".
Mr Cameron said the proposal was "the clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action" and represented a "double win".
He added: "It's good for our economy, as it will help create a better, more motivated workforce. And it's good for our society too, as it will strengthen communities and the bonds between us."
But Labour pointed out he had made a similar pledge in 2008, while leader of the opposition, in relation to the public sector.
"Since then this has become just another broken promise with volunteering falling under the Tories," Labour's civil society spokeswoman Lisa Nandy said.
She said there was "no sense" of how the public sector could fund the pledge, adding: "If just half of public sector workers took this up it would be the time equivalent of around 2,000 nurses, 800 police and almost 3,000 teachers."
Mr Cameron is also due to announce that the freeze on regulated rail fares at the level of inflation - which has been in place for the previous two years - would continue throughout the next Parliament if the Conservatives win power.
Regulated fares cover about half of all tickets sold, including season tickets and off-peak intercity returns.
The Conservatives said the move would save the average rail commuter around Â£400 between now and 2020.
But shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said it was "unfunded, uncosted and frankly totally unbelievable", and that fares had risen by an average of 20% since 2010.
Another policy pledge on Friday comes from the Liberal Democrats, with new plans aimed at young workers who are still living with their parents.
The party's "Help to Rent" scheme would allow under 30s to borrow the cash for a deposit from the government, and pay it back within two years.
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: "It's simply unfair that thousands of hard-working young people still have to live in the same bedroom they lived in when children.
"When you get your own job, you want to stand on your own two feet, have your own space, and not have to rely on the bank of mum and dad."
