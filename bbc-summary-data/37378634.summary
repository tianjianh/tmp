Arlene Arkinson: Specialist police team to examine new Castlederg site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police searching for the missing Castlederg schoolgirl Arlene Arkinson are due to bring in specialist teams to examine a new site.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 15-year-old disappeared in 1994 after a school disco in County Donegal.
Police sealed off an area in a field near Killen, outside Castlederg, on Wednesday after a farmer alerted them to the site.
The field is about a mile from the house where the teenager was last seen alive.
It is on the same road where she was seen in a car with Robert Howard, the main suspect in her disappearance.
Specialist search teams from England are due to arrive on Friday morning to assist in the operation.
Police have requested a number of examinations and tests, which they say may take some time.
Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray, head of Serious Crime Branch, said: "The family of Arlene Arkinson have been advised of this development purely as a precautionary measure.
"It would be premature to draw any inference from this initial report or the police response to it at this time."
Since her disappearance, a number of searches have been carried out at various locations.
Convicted child killer Howard, who died in prison in England last year, was the main suspect in the schoolgirl's disappearance.
In June 2005, Howard, then 61, was found not guilty of murdering Arlene.
The prosecution had accused him of trying to conceal his movements on the night Arlene went missing and getting others to lie for him.
The jury did not know that by then he was already serving a life sentence for raping and killing another teenager.
Hannah Williams, from South London, went missing during a shopping trip in April 2001.
Howard was found guilty in October 2003 of raping and murdering the 14-year-old before dumping her body.
An inquest into Arlene Arkinson's death formally opened in February after years of delay and dozens of preliminary hearings.
