NHS Grampian said it had invited Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) to carry out the "short review".
The move comes just days after a report highlighted accident and emergency consultants' concerns over staff shortages at the hospital.
The review will assess "leadership, culture, values and behaviours" which ensure "good quality healthcare".
It will also look to strengthen "engagement between clinicians and senior management".
A report on the findings of the review is expected to be published later in the year.
Last week, fears from accident and emergency consultants at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary that doctors would not be able to provide the "safe care" of patients because of staff shortages were revealed in a report.
A recruitment drive is ongoing as the number of "senior" A&E doctors could have dropped from 10 to two by August.
The report from consultants said they feared doctors being unable to resuscitate the most serious patients.
NHS Grampian chief executive Richard Carey said he welcomed the HIS review.
He said: "NHS Grampian is an open, transparent organisation.
"We recognise the importance of external scrutiny in helping us to identify the scope for further improvements."
Robbie Pearson, HIS director of scrutiny and assurance, said: "Having been invited to conduct this review we are aware that NHS Grampian recognise the importance of addressing any concerns rigorously.
"The review team will work conscientiously to identify the scope for further improvements, acknowledge good practice and enable NHS Grampian to improve services for the benefit of patients and the public.
"We will also work closely with NHS Grampian staff to ensure that any key issues identified are actioned quickly."
Prof Jason Leitch, clinical director of NHS Scotland, said: "This action clearly demonstrates the health board's commitment to providing the highest standards of patient care and supporting clinical staff."
