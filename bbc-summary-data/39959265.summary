Swansea City manager Paul Clement says he will have "a conversation" with Chelsea captain John Terry about the possibility of signing him.

Former England skipper Terry, 36, will leave the Premier League champions at the end of the season.
He captained Chelsea to an FA Cup and Premier League Double in Clement's first season as assistant to then manager Carlo Ancelotti in 2008-09.
"I don't know his thinking, whether he is going to carry on," Clement said.
"I will have a conversation with him. I've known him a long time."
Terry made his senior debut for Chelsea in 1998, and Sunday's home Premier League game against Sunderland could be his final appearance for the club.
"There's been talk in the media it could be his last game or that he will go on," Clement said.
"Whether that is here in the Premier League, or whether that is abroad, that is all unsure at the moment."
Swansea's Premier League rivals Bournemouth are also reported to be interested in signing Terry, should he carry on playing.
Meanwhile, former France and Chelsea midfielder Claude Makelele is to become a permanent part of Swansea's coaching staff.
The 44-year-old, brought in until the end of the season following Clement's appointment in January, is now set to sign a long-term deal.
"All the terms have been agreed, he just needs to sign," said Clement. "We are very happy Claude is gong to be staying on.
"He is very well-liked by all the staff and the players. He brings great experience of what it is like to play at a very high level.
"He and all my backroom staff have been fantastic."
