The remains of two females - whose remains were found years apart - have been identified as a young mother and her daughter, Australian police say.

The mother, whose bones were found in a forest in New South Wales in 2010, was named as Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson.
The daughter, whose skeletal remains were discovered in a suitcase near a motorway in South Australia in 2015, was Khandalyce Kiara Pearce.
Police say they both suffered "violent and deliberate" deaths.
Police from the two states are now working together on their suspected murder investigations into how and where the two died.
On Wednesday, the identification of the remains via DNA tests and blood samples was described as a major breakthrough by detectives involved in the investigations.
"This is one of the most shocking crimes imaginable; one that has not only devastated a family, but also had a terrible impact on the wider community," South Australia Detective Superintendent Des Bray said.
He appealed for assistance from the public, saying that "those responsible for these horrific crimes remain amongst us in the community, and they must quickly be caught and held to account for their actions".
Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson's remains were found at Belango State Forest. She was initially named "Angel" because of a T-shirt she was found with.
For the past five years detectives had been pursuing numerous lines of inquiry to try to identify the woman.
The breakthrough followed the discovery in July of the bones of a young girl in a suitcase on the side of Karoona Highway in Wynarka.
Police were later able to establish that Pearce-Stevenson was a single mother from Alice Springs, Northern Territory.
She is believed to have left her home in search of work and also to travel between 2006-08.
The pair were last seen in November 2008. The mother was 20 at the time, while her daughter was aged two.
