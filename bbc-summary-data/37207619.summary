World Cup 2018: Czech Republic 0-0 Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland picked up a rather fortunate point as they started their World Cup qualifying campaign with a dreary draw away to the Czech Republic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In their first match since reaching the knockout stage at Euro 2016, Michael O'Neill's men managed just one decent shot on target in a half-empty arena.
The Czech Republic should have taken the lead on 62 minutes but defender Filip Novac shot wide from six yards.
NI's best moment was a Paddy McNair shot saved by Tomas Vaclik.
Normally, an away point would be seen as a decent outcome, but O'Neill may feel this was an opportunity missed against an unimpressive Czech side regarded as being in transition.
Northern Ireland, who memorably beat Ukraine and made it out of their group in the Euro finals in France, never got into their stride in a Group C game riddled with mistakes and poor passing.
For the 1,100 Northern Ireland fans in the Generali Arena, it was not the performance they were looking for, but avoiding defeat in a tricky opening qualifier was a key objective.
Germany, with an exceptional record of losing just twice in 85 World Cup qualifiers, are huge favourites to top the group, so Northern Ireland might not be too disappointed with a draw away to potential rivals for the runners-up and play-off slot.
For much of the first half, lone front man Kyle Lafferty - badly lacking practice - looked badly isolated and NI struggled to retain possession.
Apart from outstanding defenders Jonny Evans and Gareth McAuley, Northern Ireland's top stars like Steven Davis and McNair did not really produce their best form.
Manager O'Neill looked relieved when he spoke after the game, admitting his side had come under pressure in the second half.
A big problem for the NI boss is that several of his squad are not getting much first team football at their clubs.
He will hope that situation improves as the campaign progresses and NI look to mount a serious attempt to qualify for Russia in 2018.
By then, it might be clearer if the draw in Prague was a point gained, or two dropped.
On 8 October, Northern Ireland return to their redeveloped Windsor Park base for the first time since Euro 2016 when they play San Marino who were beaten by Azerbaijan in their opener.
Three days later Michael O'Neill embark on what they'll expect to be their toughest of the qualifying campaign - facing Group C favourites Germany in the 49,000-capacity HDI Arena in Hanover.
