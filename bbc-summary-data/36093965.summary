Happy Birthday Your Majesty from BodyPositive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
2016 marks the Queen's Birthday - here are six things we here at BodyPositive HQ love about Her Maj.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
1.HRH has awesome style
Have you ever seen the Queen in an outfit that wasn't perfectly put together? Hat, shoes and coat are all matched to pantone colour book levels of detail. Rarely caught without some fabulous millinery, her Majesty said wearing bright colours is the best way to maximise her presence when she meets her subjects. She even goes as far as matching the trim on her umbrella, getting them made bespoke by a company in London's East End.
2.She's a keen animal lover
The Queen is well known for her cavalcade of corgis. She's owned over 30 of them since she took the throne in 1952, but she's also a keen horsewoman. There aren't many 90 year olds who are frequently out riding, but Her Majesty is one of them.  During her time as Queen she's also been presented with two tortoises, a bull elephant called Jumbo, a sloth, a jaguar and two black beavers who were all then dispatched into the capable hands of London Zoo.
3.Has zero issues with wearing a tiara
First up, there aren't many women who can rock the tiara with confidence after the age of 10. However they're pretty much work attire for the Queen, the equivalent of her skirt suit, and she looks flipping fabulous. Secondly have you ever tried to wear a tiara? They are high maintenance head gear, so to wear one with grace and ease is an achievement in itself.
4.She strikes fear into the world's best rugby players
Back when England was hosting the Rugby World Cup in 2015, Buckingham Palace hosted an event for the World Cup teams, attended by the coaches and captains of each nation. Richie McCaw, captain of the All Blacks, and thoroughly intimidating guy on the rugby pitch, confessed he was a little nervous about meeting the Head of the Commonwealth.
5.Best Bond girl ever
Who could forget her appearance alongside Daniel Craig at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics? She was picked up in suitable fashion by 007, hopped in a helicopter and then skydived into the stadium (ok maybe the last bit wasn't really her). Apparently she was delighted with her appearance and even managed to get the corgis involved. Honey Ryder who?
6.Loves to photobomb a selfie
Her Royal Highness is down with the kids, as everyone wants a selfie with The Queen. At the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Australian Hockey player Jayde Taylor was the unwitting victim of a photobomb by our longest serving British monarch.
