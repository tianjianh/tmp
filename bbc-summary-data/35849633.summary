Danny Carr put the hosts in front early on when he fired a low shot past on-loan Harriers goalkeeper Max O'Leary.
McQuilkin then levelled for Kidderminster with a spectacular 20-yard strike with 11 minutes to go.
The draw ended a run of six straight defeats in the National League for Garry Hill's Cards.
Harriers, who are bottom of the table, are 10 points adrift of 20th-placed Altrincham.
Woking manager Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"It was nice to get a result because we've been low on confidence. There's no doubt about that and we've had some poor, consistent performances.
"In the first half we played probably the best we've played in a long time, I felt we moved the ball forward very well.
"We had chances and opportunities to make the second one count and we should have taken them when we had those opportunities. Two or three times that would have been it but not to be."
