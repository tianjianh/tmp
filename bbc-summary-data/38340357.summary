[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager who was obsessed with serial killers and school shootings has been detained for at least 10 years for the attempted murder of her friend.

The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was convicted of attempted murder at Winchester Crown Court.
She lured her victim to a quiet area of their Hampshire school and stabbed her in the chest in April.
Mr Justice Fraser said the girl, who was 14 at the time, had a "far darker side to her personality".
She was given a 14 year sentence and will only be considered for parole after 10 years.
Her trial at Winchester Crown Court heard the girl was obsessed with mass murders and had compiled a "kill list" of 60 people.
Mr Justice Fraser said the "intelligent, articulate young girl" had watched snuff movies online and had previously planned to kill her mother and brother.
She turned up for school on 25 April wearing a bandana and with her mouth cut to resemble the Joker from the Batman film The Dark Knight, the jury heard.
She told her 15-year-old victim she had a present for her and to "close your eyes and put your hands out".
The attacked girl stepped back and although the knife went through her blazer and shirt she only suffered a superficial puncture wound to the chest near her heart.
Prosecutors said the girl bore a grudge against her victim who she believed had set up fake Instagram and Tumblr accounts in her name.
In a statement read out by the prosecution barrister James Newton-Price, the victim's mother said her daughter is haunted by the attack and has since been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder.
She said: "It's a nightmare no-one wants for their child and we're living it."
A psychiatric report found the attacker did not have a mental illness but instead had a personality problem and struggled with empathy.
