The double Paralympic champions put in a dominant performance on Friday to win their first race since Rio.
Crystal Lane then won silver in the time-trial, while Saturday saw Craig McCann win silver in the road race.
GB struggled on Sunday and failed to add any further medals.
The team will now head to the second round of the Para-cycling Road World Cup season in Ostend, Belgium next weekend as they continue to build towards the Para-cycling Road World Championships in South Africa in September.
The squad for Belgium will be announced on Tuesday.
