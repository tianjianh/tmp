Actress Tina Hobley has said she has struggled to "drive, dress [and] wash my hair" since an accident on the Channel 4 reality show The Jump.

Hobley broke her arm in two places and injured her knee and shoulder in a fall in the celebrity sports programme in February.
The show saw celebrities compete at winter sports, including ski-jumping, bobsleigh and speed skating.
The actress was one of several stars forced to quit after getting hurt.
In an interview with Hello! magazine, the former Holby City actress described how the accident meant she had lost out on acting work, including a role in the hit ITV drama Broadchurch.
"My injuries have had a huge impact on my life and on the family," she said. "For much of the year I haven't been able to drive, dress, wash my hair or have a bath unaided.
"My elbow came out of its socket and my arm was broken in two places. I tore my rotator cuff in my shoulder - a common rugby injury which has ended careers - and I had a full rupture of my ACL [anterior cruciate ligament] in the knee.
"My daughter has had to help me put my clothes on. And for months at a time I haven't been able to take the kids to school, run errands or do any of the things I love like yoga, cycling or walking any kind of distance."
The actress said her injuries had been worse than originally feared and she had sustained "three major traumas".
She is due to have another operation on her knee later this month.
She said she now had a different attitude towards her physical health.
"My body is so precious and I wouldn't put my body or my family through that trauma again," she said.
Channel 4 issued a statement at the time apologising for the accident. It said: "Tina's fall was caused by simple human error when members of the ground crew failed to clear the outrun.
"All those involved have been spoken to and extra procedures have now been put in place by the producers to ensure that this will not happen again."
The Jump, presented by Davina McCall, hit the headlines after a series of accidents.
Former Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle needed surgery on her spine after a crash, while Made in Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli fractured his ankle.
Swimmer Rebecca Adlington dislocated her shoulder, athlete Linford Christie pulled a hamstring, ex-EastEnders actor Joe Swash chipped a bone in his shoulder, Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding injured a ligament and model Heather Mills hurt her knee and thumb.
