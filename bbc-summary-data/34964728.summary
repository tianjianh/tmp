[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hatton Garden raider 'used someone else's travel pass'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the Hatton Garden raiders used someone else's over-60s pass as he travelled by bus to carry out the burglary, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian Reader, 76, who admits being involved in the burglary, used the Freedom Pass to make his way into central London on the night of 2 April.
Valuables worth up to Â£14m were taken in the Easter weekend raid.
Three men deny conspiracy to commit burglary. A fourth denies conspiracy to conceal or transfer criminal property.
Woolwich Crown Court heard Freedom Pass records show Reader boarded the 96 bus from near his home in Dartford, before exiting Waterloo East station at about 18:30 BST.
Det Con Matthew Hollands told court the travelcard was found in Reader's wallet after his arrest.
Asked if the card was in Reader's name, the detective replied: "It is not, no. It is in the name of Mr T McCarthy. It does not have Brian Reader's photo on it."
Reader decided to withdraw from England's "largest burglary" when the men struggled to get into the vault on the first night, the court previously heard.
The court also heard evidence from Det Con Jamie Day, the first Flying Squad officer to arrive on the scene, who said one of those involved, a mystery red-haired burglar identified only as Basil, seemed to have got into the building using a key.
The only working CCTV camera in the building caught footage of a white van, driven by Collins, arriving in the area at about 20:30 BST before two men wearing high-visibility vests got out.
A second clip showed "Basil" allowing access to the building via a fire escape from the inside.
Shortly afterwards other men could be seen entering the building carrying tools, wheelie bins and other equipment.
During the hearing an "exact" polystyrene replica of the 25cm by 45cm (10x18 ins) hole the raiders drilled through the vault wall was presented to the jurors.
Prosecutor Philip Evans told the court: "I must point out it says it's for visual purposes only, do not attempt to climb inside."
The trial continues.
