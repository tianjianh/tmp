Work has started to repair a historical bridge in Ceredigion following a partial collapse.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 300-year-old Llanfair Clydogau bridge, near Lampeter, was closed earlier this month after one of its arches collapsed in adverse weather.
The closure split the village, with residents having to make an eight-mile (13km) detour to get to the shops.
Ceredigion council said it hopes to restore the grade-II listed bridge as "quickly as possible".
The council is working closely with Cadw during the restoration, which it hopes will be complete by June 2016.
Huw Morgan, the council's strategic director for sustainable communities, said: "Restoring and conserving such unique and historical landmarks like this bridge is very important to the heritage of Wales."
Pedestrian access will be maintained during the work.
