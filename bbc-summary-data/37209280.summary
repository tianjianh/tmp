The first minister, Formula One driver Susie Wolff and Scottish women's football captain Gemma Fay are backing the Girlguiding Scotland initiative.
It encourages girls and young women to highlight good role models around them.
Ms Sturgeon said: "That's how they are inspired to be the leaders, scientists and Olympians of the future."
The launch of the WOWwoman campaign follows Girlguiding research which showed that less than half (49%) of girls aged 11 to 16 regularly feel inspired by a role model.
Only 35% of those aged 17 to 21 believe men and women have the same chance of career success.
Ms Sturgeon said: "I hope seeing so many inspiring women in their communities and beyond will empower a new generation of girls and young women to believe in themselves."
Ms Wolff said: "I'm proud to be named a Girlguiding Scotland WOWwoman and have the chance to back this new campaign.
"From my own experience, I know how important a role model can be in empowering girls and young women to aim high, discover new talents and take the lead. Sometimes you just have to see it to believe it."
Ms Fay added: "I hope this campaign will show girls and young women across Scotland just how much they can achieve."
