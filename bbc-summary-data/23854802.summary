The 25-year-old's new deal includes the option of a one-year extension at the end of the 2017-18 season and a buy-out clause of 150m euros.
Busquets has made 238 appearances since breaking into the first team in 2008.
He said: "To be in the best Club in the world is a dream come true, this is the Club of my life. I'm very happy."
He has won four La Liga titles, two Spanish Cups and the Champions League on two occasions.
The defensive midfielder - whose father Carles played 79 times as a goalkeeper for Barcelona - signed his contract in the presence of club president Sandro Rosell, vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu and director of football Andoni Zubizarreta.
"I'm still young and I hope to continue improving," he added.
"I want to win more titles, fight to win each match, win and put on a show with the same philosophy that we've had up until now. We're doing well for now."
After joining the club's youth side as a 17-year-old in 2005, Busquets played for both Barcelona's second and third-string teams, before becoming a first-team regular under former coach Pep Guardiola.
He has remained an almost ever-present alongside the likes of both Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta in midfield for both his club and the Spanish national side under the management of Vicente del Bosque.
Busquets played in every game at the 2010 World Cup as Spain won the trophy for the first time, and formed part of the side that lifted the 2012 European Championship after a 4-0 win over Italy.
