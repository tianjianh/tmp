One person has died in a training exercise at RAF Tain bombing range, 30 miles north of Inverness.

Police said there were no other casualties, but the range remains sealed off and the person's next of kin have been informed.
A police spokesman said an investigation will be launched but it was a "contained incident" and there was no threat to the public.
An Army spokeswoman confirmed that officials were handling the incident.
She said: "We are aware of an incident at the Tain base, near Inverness.
"We will release more information as and when it becomes available. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this point."
Emergency services were called to the defence facility at about 17:55 GMT on Tuesday.
Police Scotland said it was leading the investigation to establish the full circumstances of the incident and was working closely with the armed forces.
RAF Tain is a long established, large air weapons range on the Dornoch Firth, about three miles east of the town of Tain.
It is used for the majority of the time by the RAF - in particular Tornado and Typhoon fast jets that operate out of RAF Lossiemouth in Moray - and the Army also uses the site, which has a rifle range and small arms range.
The US Air Force and Nato air crews use the range to fly low as the RAF aircraft do and to attack targets on the site, large parts of which are saltmarsh.
Civilian contractors work with military personnel in managing the range's control tower, targets and clearing ordnance.
