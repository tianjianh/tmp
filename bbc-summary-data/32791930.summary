Omari George, 22, now of Dora Road in Handsworth, has denied having crack cocaine with intent to supply to another.
Marvin Scott, 38, of City Road, Edgbaston, denies having crack cocaine with intent to supply and a separate charge of possession of cannabis.
The offences are all alleged to have happened between May and June 2013.
