The visit to Turf Moor takes place on the first anniversary of the stillbirth of Arter's daughter Renee.
The 26-year-old starred in a 2-1 win over Manchester United just days after Renee's death last December.
"It will be a strange sort of moment against Burnley," Arter told BBC Radio Solent. "We see Renee's birthday as a milestone, which will be difficult."
Arter's family raised £13,000 through a charity auction in aid of other bereaved families in the months after Renee's death.
But approaching the anniversary, Arter admits emotions on and off the pitch will be high.
"It's always going to be a memory for my family either a year or 20 years on," he said. "We'll never be able to forget it and it's not something I would want to be able to forget.
"When it comes to the game, I'll be professional and put my head down and family matters will have to be pushed to one side to deal with after."
His fiancée Rachel is currently well-advanced in her second pregnancy, with a baby girl due early next year.
"That's helped with a bit of hope, but it doesn't change the loss you have," the Republic of Ireland international added.
"When you lose a baby, you naturally just want to have one. We've got to make sure Rachel stays strong and her mind is focused."
