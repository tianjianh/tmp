[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man once "knee-capped" by republican paramilitaries has been handed a five-year sentence for burglary and throwing a petrol bomb at police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Belfast Crown Court heard on Friday that Patrick Quinn had thrown missiles at police on 12 July last year and a petrol bomb days later.
The court also heard that the 19-year-old from Rosehead in Dunmurry had broken into the home of a lone woman.
He pleaded guilty to burglary, theft, criminal damage and rioting.
CCTV footage showed Quinn throwing stones and other missiles at police during 12 July rioting at Ardoyne last year.
He was also recorded on 14 July throwing missiles and a petrol bomb.
The court heard that when arrested and interviewed, Quinn identified himself on the footage and admitted what he had done.
Judge Tom Burgess ordered the accused spend two and a half years in custody to be followed by the same period on licence.
He said it had been repeatedly made clear that anyone who involves themselves in rioting "will inevitably go to prison".
An earlier court appearance heard that a Nintendo Wii games system and an MP3 player had been stolen from a Cliftonville Avenue flat. A woman was in the home by herself.
When police arrived at the scene, they found Quinn a short distance away holding a stolen sat nav system but when they arrested him, he became violent and aggressive.
Quinn was on bail for this offence when he was arrested for rioting.
Judge Tom Burgess said he was "very impressed" with the work Quinn had undertaken whilst in the Young Offenders Centre to tackle his problems with alcohol and drug abuse.
The court also heard that in August 2009, Quinn was the subject of a paramilitary-style shooting as a warning to his brother Michael to stay away from west Belfast.
In May 2007, 22-year-old Michael Quinn was jailed for eight years for the double rape and sexual abuse of a 15-year-old English schoolgirl.
