Arthur Cave was found with life-threatening injuries on the underpass of Ovingdean Gap at 18:00 BST on Tuesday.
He was taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton but died later from his injuries.
His death is not being treated as suspicious and the coroner is investigating, police said.
In a family statement, Nick and Susie Cave said: "Our son Arthur died on Tuesday evening. He was our beautiful, happy loving boy."
Arthur leaves behind a twin brother, Earl.
The reason for Arthur's fall is not yet known but friends have told the BBC he was up there with a friend and they seemed to be having a good time, even posting updates on social media.
His friends say he was a "really, really happy boy" who will be dearly missed.
One friend, Kimye Hajisabagh, told BBC South East Today: "I'm going to miss him so much. I can't believe it. It's horrible."
Stars of the music world have also paid tribute.
Singer Alison Moyet tweeted: "How my heart aches for Nick Cave & Susie & Earl at their loss."
Singer Brian McFadden tweeted: "Very sad to hear the news about Arthur Cave. My thoughts are with Nick and the rest of the family. Heartbreaking."
