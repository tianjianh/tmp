Diego Costa: Jose Mourinho says stamps 'absolutely accidental'

Diego Costa's alleged stamps during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final win over Liverpool were "absolutely accidental", says boss Jose Mourinho.

Costa trod on Emre Can and Martin Skrtel in a second-leg tie that saw the Londoners progress after extra time.
The Football Association is waiting on referee Michael Oliver's report before deciding on whether to take any action.
Mourinho insisted the Blues striker was blameless, claiming he was only "looking to the ball".
But Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said: "He has this edge to him. With Emre Can, that was poor, I felt."
The first-half incident involving Can took place close to the technical area and prompted an angry response from the Liverpool player.
Rodgers felt Costa could have avoided treading on his player.
"He could easily hurdle over the young player and he directs his studs right on to his ankle, which could've been nasty," said the Reds boss.
"Again, the one with Martin Skrtel, there's no need to do it. That's the sad thing. He's a top-class player and he's clever enough that the officials don't see it."
Chelsea reached the final thanks to Branislav Ivanovic's goal, although they would have progressed on away goals having drawn 1-1 at Anfield in the first leg.
But most of the post-match talk centred on Costa.
Mourinho feels the Brazil-born Spain international is being targeted unfairly, with one unnamed television pundit in particular leading the way.
"There is a campaign on the television with a certain pundit that is saying Diego Costa 'crimes'," said Mourinho. "This guy must be nuts.
"Great campaign. We know how much that pundit loves Chelsea and particularly loves me."
Mourinho declined to identify the pundit, adding: "I don't know his name, because when I see him I switch off the television."
Costa was involved in three of the game's main talking points - he also had a penalty appeal turned down when tripped by Skrtel - and could face retrospective punishment from the FA for the two alleged stamps.
If he is banned, Costa would miss Saturday's Premier League clash with second-placed Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.
In a fiery second half at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho appeared to row on the touchline with Liverpool counterpart Rodgers.
The Portuguese described himself and Rodgers as "very different people", referencing the time they worked together at Chelsea.
"I don't know if he learned something with me or not," said Mourinho. "Maybe he did, maybe he didn't."
He went on to criticise Rodgers for failing to praise Reds goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in his post-match television interviews.
"He speaks about [Chelsea keeper Thibaut] Courtois, he forgets Mignolet," said Mourinho. "I speak about Courtois and Mignolet.
"He forgets his goalkeeper. I don't forget my goalkeeper, because my goalkeeper helped me to be in the final.
"He is what he is. He is a fantastic manager, but we are different people."
Rodgers played down talk of an issue between the two managers.
"There is no problem," he said. "It's a competitive game between two top sides and the chimp comes out every now and then."
