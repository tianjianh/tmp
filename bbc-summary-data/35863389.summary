Women's FA Cup: Holders Chelsea host Aston Villa in last eight

Holders Chelsea will host WSL 2 club Aston Villa in the quarter-finals of the Women's FA Cup.

Manchester City face third-tier side Sporting Club Albion - the lowest ranked team in the last eight.
Last season's losing finalists Notts County travel to Arsenal, who beat them in November's Continental Cup final, while Sunderland play Reading in the only other all-WSL 1 tie.
The quarter-final games are scheduled to be played on Sunday, 3 April.
The Women's FA Cup final will again be played at Wembley in May. A competition-record crowd of 30,710 watched the 2015 final when it was played at the national stadium for the first time.
