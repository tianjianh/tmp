West Berkshire parents' anger over Willink School bus cuts proposal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pupils will be forced to walk through two miles of dense woodland if school buses are removed in West Berkshire, parents have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
West Berkshire Council is proposing to cut the free transport for 233 students in Mortimer from April next year.
Parents said many will give up their jobs for the school run rather than have them walk the "dangerous" route.
The council said parents are legally responsible for making sure their children get to and from school.
The pupils, aged 11 and up, all attend The Willink School in Burghfield Common but the council could cut the bus service for those who live in nearby Mortimer as it looks to save Â£11m in 2016/2017.
Cutting the school bus service would save Â£123,500 per year.
Their parents, who have set up a Save Our Buses (SOB) campaign, have walked the council's proposed route, which also involves crossing two major roads, to highlight what they call an unfeasible and unsafe journey.
Mother-of-two Helen Symington said: "The roads are fast and the woods are big and dense, there are lots of paths and it's easy to get lost, we just don't think it's safe."
The Willink School, which has started a petition, is also against the cuts for safety reasons and added the route would be unlit during winter months and the paths are "intended for ramblers wearing appropriate walking boots" not school footwear.
The council's Executive Member for Education Dominic Boeck said he urged people to contact them regarding these issues during what is a consultation process.
He added: "Council officers make an assessment of all available routes, and their assessments are made in line with national guidelines.
"They will have assessed it is reasonably safe - that's what the legislation calls for."
