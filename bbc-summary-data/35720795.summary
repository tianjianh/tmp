Celtic player Callum McGregor has been given a 12-month driving ban after he was caught behind the wheel at almost four times the legal alcohol limit.

The 22-year-old midfielder, from Glasgow, was stopped by police for driving erratically in the Robroyston area at about 03:00 on 5 February.
Officers asked him to provide a breath test and he gave an alcohol reading of 78mg - the legal limit is 22.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, McGregor was also fined Â£500.
Sheriff Neil Mackinnon disqualified McGregor for 12 months, although he may get a reduction if he successfully completes a drink driving course.
Last August, McGregor was banned from driving for four months and fined Â£400 after being caught driving at 69mph in a 50mph zone.
The court opted to impose a four-month ban instead of a heavier penalty and left him with nine points on his licence.
He was convicted at Hamilton Justice of the Peace Court after claiming the speed gun was faulty.
McGregor began as a youth player at Celtic and spent a year on loan at English side Notts County in the 2013-14 season.
He returned to Celtic and scored in his first-team debut against KR Reykjavik in a Champions League qualifier in 2014.
