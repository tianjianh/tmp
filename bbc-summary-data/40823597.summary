The Golden State Warrior, 29, was given a sponsor's invite to compete in the Ellie Mae Classic on the Web.com Tour.
His opening shot landed in a golf cart, and he bogeyed three of the first five holes in Hayward, California.
"If you'd told me I was going to shoot 74 going into the round, I'd take that all day, every day," said the two-time NBA Most Valuable Player.
Frank Lickliter, a two-time PGA Tour winner, is among the players below Curry on the leaderboard, which is headed by Nicholas Thompson on seven under par.
The Web.com Tour is one rung below the top-level PGA Tour.
