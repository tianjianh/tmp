Captain Marc Richards would "love to stay" at Northampton Town but says his future is the hands of chairman Kelvin Thomas and boss Justin Edinburgh.

The 34-year-old scored his 12th goal of the season against League One leaders Sheffield United on Saturday.
But the striker, who has made 181 Cobblers appearances over two spells, is out of contract in the summer.
"I wouldn't have moved my family to the area if I didn't think there was a connection there," said Richards.
"Hopefully I'll pick a couple more goals before the end of the season. Who knows what might happen?"
Saturday's 2-1 defeat by the Blades - promoted to the Championship as a consequence - left Edinburgh's side six points above the relegation places with five games remaining.
And Richards has said the club are not "safe at the moment" going into Friday's match away at play-off hopefuls Millwall.
"We still need a point at least," Richards told BBC Radio Northampton.
"It's going to be tough at Millwall - they're doing OK in the league and it's always a hard place to go. We'll do well to get anything from there."
