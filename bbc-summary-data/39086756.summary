Torquay United 1-2 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-man Guiseley staged a remarkable comeback to secure victory and keep Torquay mired in the relegation zone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Referee Simon Barrow went down with an injury in the ninth minute at a rainy and blustery Plainmoor, and was eventually replaced by one of his assistants.
Both teams struggled to get into their rhythm after a long delay, but the game sprang into life thanks to a 25th-minute strike from Gulls skipper Aman Verma - his second goal of the season.
The Gulls nearly doubled their lead when Brett Williams' header from Luke Young's corner crashed against the crossbar.
Guiseley's hopes of salvaging anything from the game were dealt a severe blow 10 minutes into the second half when Jake Lawlor received a second yellow card for a late challenge on Dan Sparkes.
But they equalised in fortunate circumstances when a long ball struck the shoulder of Jake Cassidy who kept his composure to steer the ball home.
And the West Yorkshire side clinched the points 11 minutes from time when Will Hatfield controlled a long punt from goalkeeper Jonny Maxted before guiding the ball past Brendan Moore.
