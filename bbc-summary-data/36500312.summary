More than 400 people have been arrested for domestic abuse offences ahead of the Euro 2016 tournament.

West Yorkshire Police said the arrests were made between 30 May and 8 June by targeting known offenders and encouraging people to report abuse.
The force said the campaign was prompted by the "worryingly high volume of calls" it received during previous major football tournaments.
During Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup domestic abuse calls rose by a third.
The force said it received around 110 calls reporting abuse during each of England's games in those tournaments.
England's first match in Euro 2016 is against Russia in Marseilles on Saturday evening.
Det Supt Darren Minton said: "With a kick off at 20:00 we expect that many people will be drinking ahead of that time and whilst we want everyone to enjoy the football, we are also aware that during previous tournaments we have seen an increase in domestic abuse.
"Inflamed passions and excess alcohol on a match day or any other day is no excuse for aggressive, controlling or violent behaviour. And any forms of abuse will be met by the full force of the law."
