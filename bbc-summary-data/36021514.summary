"I thought we were magnificent all the way through, start to finish.
"We were very unlucky to go one-nil down tonight at home, but once again the response was excellent.
"Deserved the equaliser and all the second half, we could have got a goal at any time because we deserved it, the way we went about it.
"In terms of making it uncomfortable for the opposition, getting in their faces, closing down and doing those sorts of things then yes it was one of the best performances of the season."
