[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Remus Hamza, 40, who is Romanian and lives in Cardiff, had denied raping the woman near Cardiff University as she walked home alone on 20 September last year.
But he was found guilty by a jury at Newport Crown Court on Wednesday.
Judge David Wynn Morgan described Hamza as a "dangerous offender".
The court heard the woman lost her friends during a night out and started to walk home along Greyfriars Road, under an underpass by City Hall and then along Museum Avenue at about 02:00 GMT.
There she was approached by the defendant who raped her behind a bush.
The prosecution said Hamza was "preying on single, drunk females" and the victim was so drunk she could not have consented to sex.
But Hamza told the court the sex was "consensual" and the woman could "have said no" to his advances.
He admitted the woman was intoxicated but claimed she had been "aware of herself".
The court heard the attack was only interrupted when a witness took out his phone and photographed Hamza on top of her.
Sentencing Hamza, Judge Morgan said: "There were no mitigating factors in your case. The risk of harm you pose to women is high."
Speaking after the hearing, Rhodri Thomas, of the Crown Prosecution Service's Wales Rape and Serious Sexual Offences Unit, said Hamza was "responsible for a deeply unpleasant attack" on a "vulnerable young woman".
"We want the clear message to go out that being vulnerable through alcohol consumption does not mean that a victim is somehow to blame for what happens to them," he said.
