Sporting Lisbon beat Crystal Palace to win Cape Town Cup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sporting Lisbon scored two late goals to beat Crystal Palace 2-0 on Sunday and win the Cape Town Cup in South Africa, as both clubs continued preparations for the start of their respective seasons in a fortnight's time.

Colombian international Freddy Montero came on as a second-half substitute to net both goals.
The match was played in front of some 20,000 spectators at Cape Town's World Cup Stadium at the conclusion of a new four-team tournament.
Two South African clubs also participated but both Ajax Cape Town and SuperSport United were eliminated in Friday's semi-finals in contrasting fashion.
Palace easily strode past hapless SuperSport in a 4-0 triumph while Ajax were only eliminated on penalties after giving up a late equaliser to Sporting in a 2-2 draw in Friday's second semi-final.
The final on Sunday produced a high level of competition that delighted Palace manager Alan Pardew.
"I was pleased with everything but the result," Pardew said. "It was a good test for the players and played at a high level.
"I would say it was the same level as a Europa League game and having that opportunity before the start of the season means I'm delighted in terms of our preparation."
Palace made two errors, however, that proved costly as Montero squeezed home a free-kick that first hit the upright post before bouncing back into play, hitting the back of diving goalkeeper Alex McCarthy and dropping back into the net.
That gave Sporting a 71st-minute lead after their goalkeeper Rui Patricio had kept them in the game with several sharp saves.
Montero scored the second four minutes from the end when a stray pass caught out Joel Ward and the ball was snapped up by Algerian international Islam Slimani.
He ran forcefully at the defence before slipping the ball for Montero to finish with a clever left-footed chip.
"It is good that we get used to winning," Sporting's new coach Jorge Jesus said afterwards.
"It is important to win these trophies and get into the habit of winning."
