British Grand Prix: Sauber opt out of Silverstone post-race testing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sauber have pulled out of a second Formula 1 in-season test to save money.

The Swiss team will not take part in next week's post-British Grand Prix test at Silverstone, stating it was to "consider cost effectiveness".
They also missed the first in-season test in May as they had no test driver and a lack of car upgrades.
Sauber are last in the constructors' standings before Sunday's race at Silverstone, having failed to score a point so far this season.
