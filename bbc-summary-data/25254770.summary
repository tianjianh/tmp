About 200 Boston residents are still waiting to return to their homes after flooding hit large parts of the town.

The River Haven in Boston burst its banks at about 19:00 GMT on Thursday, flooding nearby streets and properties.
Boston Borough Council said the majority of those affected were staying with friends and family, with some being put up in local hotels.
The authority said it was working with other councils to provide accommodation while repairs were carried out.
On Friday, people in nearby Wyberton were also told to prepare to leave their homes after damage to the flood defences was identified.
However, engineers managed to repair the damage ahead of the evening's high tide.
The Environment Agency said Boston was one of the worst affected areas, with 300 homes flooded.
It described the tidal surge, which affected the east coast, as "the most serious" for more than 60 years.
The MP for Boston, Mark Simmonds, has called for Â£100m to be spent on a new flood barrier for the town.
Volunteers calling themselves the Boston Clean Up Crew have been on the streets supporting the clear-up operation.
Insp Mark Garthwaite, from Lincolnshire Police, said it was thought Boston had seen more flooding than coastal areas because The Wash acts as a funnel where pressure builds up as the waterway gets narrower along the River Haven.
Leigh Edlin, from the Environment Agency, warned people not to risk their lives by going into flooded areas.
He said: "The key concern now is around the safety and risk to people living near flood water and dealing with the aftermath."
Resident Neil McCafferty said water was "literally pouring down the streets" on Thursday.
"It is like a tidal wave coming down. It is something else," he said.
Mayor of Boston Paul Kenny said: "It's an experience that I hope we don't ever see in Boston again.
"Hopefully we can get people's lives back together in the run up to Christmas."
The town's St Botolph's church, also known as the Boston Stump, was severely damaged.
Fundraising manager Peter Coleman said the church, which had recently undergone a major renovation project, had about 2ft (0.6m) of water inside and 4ft (1.2m) outside the building.
"It's a rather devastating situation," he said.
Sea defences in Mablethorpe were also breached by the high tide. In Skegness, crowds gathered by the sea walls to watch and take pictures of the storm surge.
