Greg Dyke: Rooney Rule a good way forward in England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Introducing a form of the Rooney Rule to boost the number of black and ethnic minority coaches in England might be "a good way forward", believes Football Association chairman Greg Dyke.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rule, set up in the United States in 2003, requires the NFL's American Football teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching positions.
Dyke said: "The FA inclusion advisory board is looking at it.
"I think there probably will be the equivalent [of the Rooney Rule]."
There are currently just three black managers at English football's 92 league clubs, while a recent study found just 19 BME coaches in 552 top coaching positions at professional English clubs.
And speaking at the University of Manchester, Dyke said: "The people running football all recognise there's a problem and that was probably not where they were two years ago.
"[The Rooney Rule] might be a good way forward."
Dyke said he hoped that there would be between 50 and 100 top-level BME coaches in England within five years.
"I think we will succeed," he said. "We're in the institutional phase where we know there's a problem and we have got to find the solutions."
