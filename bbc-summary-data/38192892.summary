[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took a 33rd-minute lead when playmaker Graham Carey pounced to whisk the ball away from Rovers left back Niall Mason as he tried to control a pass from keeper Marko Marosi.
Carey swept forward from the right and fired home from a central position just outside the penalty area, curling the ball into the corner past the outstretched Marosi.
Argyle doubled their lead from the spot in the 63rd minute after Doncaster's Andy Butler fouled the recalled Ryan Donaldson just inside the penalty area.
Jake Jervis hammered the spot-kick in off the underside of the crossbar.
Liam Mandeville smashed a 90th-minute penalty off the post following a foul on Matty Blair and in the melee following the miss, Rovers midfielder James Coppinger was dismissed.
