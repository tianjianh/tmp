Delilah's hidden message and other song secrets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's a Welsh rugby tradition: a fist-pumping, chest-beating anthem.

Classic Tom Jones track Delilah reverberates around Cardiff's Millennium Stadium before every rugby union international.
But now there are calls for it to be played no more.
Veteran folk singer and politician Dafydd Iwan says the ballad should be replaced because it tells the story of the brutal murder of a woman who's cheated on her partner.
Quoted in several national newspapers, Mr Iwan said: "It is a song about murder and it does tend to trivialise the idea of murdering a woman and it's a pity these words now have been elevated to the status of a secondary national anthem."
The Welsh Rugby Union, quoted by the South Wales Evening Post, say they "condemn violence against women," and will "listen to any strong public debate on the issue of censoring the use of Delilah."
So will Mr Iwan's comments force other nations to reconsider their pre-match song choice?
Earlier this year, La Marseillaise, the French anthem, was labelled "racist and xenophobic" by French actor Lambert Wilson.
Its critics argue the song, which was written by Rouget de Lisle during the French Revolution, doesn't reflect the modern, multicultural France.
Les Bleus' international football players have often been slated for not singing along heartily prior to games.
There were even calls from France's far-right National Front party to sack Algerian-born striker Karim Benzema after he said he wouldn't to sing the anthem.
Flower of Scotland has long roused the national football and rugby teams to victory or comforted them in defeat.
The folk song was played when Scottish gold medallists stepped up to the winner's podium during the Commonwealth Games and was used by supporters of the "Yes" campaign during the Scottish Referendum.
It was written by Roy Williamson, whose band-mate Ronnie Browne still sings it at Murrayfield before rugby internationals.
"It's based on Battle of Bannockburn and the spirit of the men who fought and won our independence from a tyrannical English king," he said.
England's adopted anthem is actually all about slavery.
First recorded in America in the early 20th century, Swing Low, Sweet Chariot refers to the underground railroad that slaves used to escape to the north of the country.
The song has since been covered by iconic artists like Louis Armstrong, Etta James and Johnny Cash.
It was also used during the 1960s Civil Rights movement and was performed by American folk singer Joan Baez during the legendary 1969 Woodstock festival.
