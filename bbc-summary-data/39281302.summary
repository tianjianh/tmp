The 21-year-old, who is yet to make his debut for the La Liga side, was hit on the head by a ball on Wednesday.
"The tests carried out (radiography, scans) have not revealed any significant injury," Athletic said in a statement.
"It is expected the player will remain under observation in the coming hours."
Remiro, who recently returned from a loan spell with second-tier side Levante, is Athletic's third-choice keeper and has been capped at under-19 level by Spain.
"Thank you to everyone for your messages of support. I will soon be fighting back on the pitch," Remiro tweeted.
