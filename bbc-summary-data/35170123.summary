Chris Robshaw says he will back his successor if new head coach Eddie Jones strips him of the England captaincy.

The Harlequins flanker is expected to be replaced as captain for the Six Nations, with Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley a leading contender.
Robshaw led England throughout previous head coach Stuart Lancaster's reign and in 42 of his 43 international caps.
"If Eddie decides to go to someone else I'd respect that decision and fully back the person who comes in," he said.
Robshaw, 29, met with Jones to discuss his international future on 6 December, shortly after the Australian was appointed as Lancaster's successor.
Yet Robshaw said he was still "not sure" about the England captaincy situation but would be "hugely honoured" if Jones, 55, asked him to continue.
Hartley was dropped for the recent World Cup after being banned for a head-butt and has been out of action for a number of weeks with concussion.
Former Japan coach Jones is also thought to be considering moving Robshaw to blind-side flanker rather than on the open-side, where he has won the vast majority of his caps.
"As a player you want to be part of that team and my mentality is to first and foremost make sure I'm part of that team," added Robshaw.
"That has to be the focus, to make sure I'm playing."
Robshaw added he was "hugely disappointed" by England's poor World Cup campaign where they failed to advance from the group stages after defeats by Wales and Australia.
"The World Cup didn't go according to plan, but it's still a very exciting group of players that England have," he said.
"Myself and a lot of the other guys, we had our mope and dip in confidence but now we're back and enjoying it."
