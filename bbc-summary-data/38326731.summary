The 24-year-old moved to Welsh in the summer from Worcester and has also played for Nottingham and Plymouth Albion in the Championship.
Welsh told players to find new clubs after going into liquidation last week.
"Heath is a talented player who was very much on our radar last summer when he was leaving Worcester," said Jersey head coach Harvey Biljon.
"It didn't work out then, but we have now been able to finalise a contract and I know he'll be a real asset to our midfield, where our squad has been severely depleted since the start of the season owing to injuries and other factors," he added.
Stevens comes in after Jersey suffered another injury blow to new signing James McKinney.
The former Ulster fly-half only joined the club last month but hurt his ankle in the win over London Scottish last week.
"We're not sure whether he's going to be fit for the season or not, we'll wait and see on what his scan results are," Biljon told BBC Radio Jersey.
