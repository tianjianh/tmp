Glasgow City goalkeeper Lee Alexander believes Hibernian's title challenge is good for Scottish women's football, but wants to end their dream on Sunday.

The two sides have been inseparable at the Scottish Women's Premier League summit; tied on 37 points each.
Their only dropped points were in May's enthralling 3-3 draw between the pair.
"It's great for women's football to have two clubs playing in such a big game, it's a must win for both clubs," said Alexander.
"It's good, it's competitive for us. It's never really happened over the past few years. There's always been two or three challengers and they've been taking points off each other, but this year it's been great."
City, who are searching for their ninth league championship in a row, led the Edinburgh side 3-2 in the final stages of their last league meeting but were pegged back by Cheryl McCulloch's late own goal.
The two met again in the League Cup final, with City coming from a goal down to edge it 2-1 after extra-time.
It was Eddie Wolecki Black's last success before he left the club by mutual consent in July, being replaced as head coach by former Aberdeen and Borussia Dortmund striker Scott Booth.
"Hibs have had a great season so far," Alexander told BBC Scotland. "They've made it really difficult in the games we've played against them.
"The 3-3 draw was a hard game. They were ahead then we were ahead and then they came back, so there's not been too much that has separated us over the season.
"In the League Cup final it was extra-time that divided us and they had chances to go on and win it, as did we, so we were fortunate we were the ones taking the silverware home."
Heather Richards gave Hibs a cup final lead with a stunning long-range effort from the halfway line, one she modestly described as a "fluke".
It is a young, gifted Hibs side, however Richards admits they must adopt the same winning mentality as City if they are to topple them at Airdrie's Excelsior Stadium.
Richards said: "For 90 minutes we competed well. When it came back to one each it was tough for us. We've a lot of young players and we were tired, mentally as well.
"Everyone gave everything on that pitch and we were all shattered from it.
"I think they definitely have a winning mentality which they've gathered over so many years from winning so much and I think if Hibs can start to win some things that'll come naturally, but we need to start not just pushing Glasgow City, but start winning things. I think it starts on Sunday for us.
"The coach they've brought in, I think he's good for them, he's not changed them that much from what I've heard.
"I think they're just going to be the same old City. They're going to be really tough, they're a great team, they're really talented, so I'm sure we're in for a tough game on Sunday."
