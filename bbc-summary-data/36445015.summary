[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Huckle, 30, from Ashford in Kent, admitted committing the offences against victims aged between six months and 12 years between 2006 and 2014.
The Old Bailey heard that when he told his parents what he had done, they called the police.
The 91 charges against him relate to 23 children from mainly poor communities in Kuala Lumpur.
He admitted 71 of the charges and the prosecutor asked that the other counts "lie on file".
It is believed Huckle abused up to 200 children.
He boasted about his crimes on the "dark web", saying in one online discussion that "impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class Western kids."
Huckle, a freelance photographer, was arrested at Gatwick Airport by National Crime Agency officials in December 2014.
Prosecutor Brian O'Neill QC told the court that Huckle refused to answer officers' questions and his computer equipment was seized.
He was bailed on condition he return to his parents' home. The next day his mother asked him about the allegations and he admitted he had had sex with children aged between three and 13.

One word and a freckle indirectly led to Richard Huckle's arrest.
Police in Australia and Europe were aware of a paedophile site called the Love Zone hidden in the so-called dark web. It was protected by passwords, encryption and specialist software. Users were totally anonymous.
The images and videos there were particularly disturbing - showing the abuse of babies and very young children.
