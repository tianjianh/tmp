Goals Soccer Centres has reported a return to profit as it continues a turnaround plan following a major review of its operations.

The East Kilbride-based five-a-side football company saw group sales rise by 1.6% to £33.5m in the 12 months to the end of December.
Pre-tax profit stood at £3.7m, compared with a loss of £6.2m the previous year.
Chairman Nick Basing said the business was "on its way to being fit for purpose".
Last year Goals launched a new strategic plan following its first annual loss in 12 years.
It included upgrading 136 pitches as part of a modernisation programme.
Goals is also set to trial its "Clubhouse 2020" concept in an effort to create "a welcoming clubhouse feel" at its centres.
The trial is being launched in the first half of this year at its Ruislip, Beckenham and Glasgow South clubs at a total cost of £1.1m.
In the company's annual results statement, chief executive Mark Jones said: "Our vision is to create and develop Goals into a leisure destination brand rather than solely a football business.
"We have also made and are in the process of making significant improvements to our food and beverage offering with an emphasis on better products, better value pricing and better service.
"Many of our clubhouses require modernisation to provide an attractive pre and post-game environment for our customers to enjoy the additional products on offer.
"We envisage that Clubhouse 2020 will do this for the benefit of customers and shareholders alike."
The company is pressing ahead with expansion plans in the United States, having just constructed a second club in Los Angeles at a cost of $4.2m (£3.3m).
It is also about to start building a third USA club in Rancho Cucamonga, California.
Last year, the company's US sales declined by 4.3% in constant currency, having performed there strongly in recent years.
Goals said it had "identified the issues" and taken steps to strengthen the business.
