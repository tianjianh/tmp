Tranmere Rovers 1-0 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeff Hughes scored a late winner as Tranmere took advantage of Lincoln's Boxing Day loss to move to the top of the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Macclesfield appeared set to leave Merseyside with a point until Hughes got to a cross before goalkeeper Craig Ross to nod into an empty net seven minutes from time, to give Rovers a 1-0 win.
The victory means Tranmere will end the year at the National League summit after Lincoln suffered a late loss at Guiseley.
In a goalless first half, Andy Mangan forced Ross into two good saves while Scott Davies kept out Danny Rowe's powerful effort at the other end.
