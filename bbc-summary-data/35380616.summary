The families were joined in the protest by Travellers from across the country, with some coming from Navan, Tipperary, Sligo and Naas.
A spokesperson said the families have been traumatised by the last week.
She said the council could not hide behind doors and must present them with what she called acceptable solutions.
The council said the eviction was carried out due to health and safety concerns at the site and it is continuing to find short and long-term accommodation for those displaced.
Following the eviction, 15 families moved to a make-shift site off the N52 in Dundalk, however, they have been told by police they will have to vacate the area as it is private property.
Five more families with very young children, whose caravans were impounded during the eviction, were put up in B&Bs at the council's expense this week.
Their stay was due to expire at noon on Friday, however, it has been extended until next Friday.
Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams, the TD (MP) for Louth,  addressed the protest, saying he hoped to meet with the chief executive of the council to discuss the situation.
Elsewhere, an eviction notice has been extended for Travellers in Carrowbrowne, County Galway.
The Barna Waste recycling company has extended the notice until next Wednesday.
Eleven families with 15 caravans have been illegally encamped at the entrance to the company site for several months.
