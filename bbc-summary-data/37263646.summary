[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 0-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Akinde's second-half goal secured Barnet victory at Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Akinde broke the deadlock on 57 minutes with the Bees' first shot on target after the visitors broke quickly from a loose Mitch Rose pass.
Luke Gambin sent Akinde down the left and he ghosted past Krystian Pearce before lifting a cool finish over Scott Shearer.
Mansfield had the best of a first half short on real chances in which home goalkeeper Shearer did not have a save to make.
At the other end Josh Vickers got his body in the way of a Matt Green effort and he safely grabbed a tame header from the same player on 36 minutes.
Two minutes later Vickers got down to his right to turn away a low Mal Benning shot from 18 yards.
From the corner Green sent a downward header goalwards that looked to be creeping inside the post until Elliot Johnson headed off the line.
The Stags laboured after Akinde's goal, though Vickers did make a fine save late on to keep out a Darius Henderson header from Kevan Hurst's cross.
