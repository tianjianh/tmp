The video, which has since been removed, shows a pregnant Muslim woman being verbally abused and threatened.
A 36-year-old was arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence at her home in Willesden Green on Friday, the Met said.
She was taken into custody at a north London police station, the force said.
The incident happened on 13 October at about 10:30 BST as the bus was travelling along Knatchbull Road, according to police.
Enquiries are ongoing, said the Met, and they appealed for witnesses to come forward.
