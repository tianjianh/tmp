Mars recalls chocolates over salmonella fear

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chocolate maker Mars is recalling some bars of Galaxy, Maltesers Teasers and bags of Minstrels due to the "potential presence of salmonella".

Mars said the products, for sale in the UK and Ireland, should not be eaten.
The recall began after tests showed salmonella may be in ingredients.
"We are working closely with the relevant food safety authorities and our customers to ensure that the affected products are no longer available for purchase," Mars said.
Mars said thousands of potentially affected chocolates -  fewer than 3,000 - could already have been sold to customers.
Products including Galaxy Milk 200g bars, Minstrel 118g pouches and Maltesers Teasers 35g bars with best-before dates of 6 May 2018 and 13 May 2018 are affected.
Other products included in the recall include Galaxy Milk 4x42g multipacks and Galaxy Counters 78g and 112g pouches with the 6 May 2018 and 13 May 2018 best-before dates.
The company has asked food retailers across the UK and Ireland to pull the affected products from shelves immediately.
Tesco told the BBC that it wasn't going to sell any of the affected products it had in stock, whatever the best before date, as a temporary measure to help avoid any customer confusion.
The chocolate products affected were made at Mars' Slough factory.
People who have purchased the affected confectionary should contact the Mars customer call centre for "returns and reimbursement", it said.
The Food Standards Agency said the recall "is for a small number of products and is on a precautionary basis."
Mars said no other brands or varieties of chocolate, pack formats, bar sizes or best before dates had been affected.
The products being recalled are:
Mars said UK consumers can call 0800 952 0084 for reimbursement and Irish consumers can contact 1890 812 315.
