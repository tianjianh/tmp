The family of a nine-year-old boy murdered by his grandfather have said his death could have been prevented.

Alex Robinson was drowned in a bath by Stewart Greene at his Lincoln home two days before Christmas in 2014.
Last November Greene was jailed for life for his murder, which was described as "one of the most callous killings" a psychiatrist had ever seen.
The family's comments came after a report concluded Alex's death "couldn't have been predicted or prevented".
Greene had been angry with Alex's mother, who refused to let him live with her following his discharge from a mental health unit just 12 days before the killing.
During the trial, Alex's mother told the court she had pleaded with staff at the mental health unit not to let her father out.
A serious case review by Lincolnshire's Safeguarding Children Board ruled: "The only individual responsible for the tragic death is the maternal grandfather."
In the six months before Alex's death, his grandfather was admitted to an acute mental health unit for assessment by the Lincolnshire Partnership Foundation Trust (LPFT), the board said.
In its report, the board stated: "There were several missed opportunities for LPFT to respond differently."
It said the trust had discharged Greene without "a full analysis and risk management plan of risk to others".
The board also said: "However, there were limited indicators of the risk he posed to specifically to children and the degree of his violence towards Alex could not have been predicted or prevented."
In a statement, the family said it "cannot agree... Alex's death was not preventable or predictable".
"We believe Alex's death certainly was preventable."
Anne-Maria Olphert, director of nursing and quality at the trust, said it accepted the report's outcomes and would use it "to improve services".
