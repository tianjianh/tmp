They span the country, from Veneto in the north to Sicily in the south, and include the Lazio region around Rome.
Agriculture Minister Maurizio Martina said the government was ready to respond swiftly by activating the national solidarity fund.
Record temperatures and a long period without rain have created the drought.
Last week, local authorities in Rome reached a deal to avert drastic water rationing, while the Vatican has economised by shutting down its fountains.
The farmers' association Coldiretti says the agriculture sector has suffered losses of at least â‚¬2bn (Â£1.8bn; $2.4bn).
The other regions named on Wednesday are Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Marche, Molise, Puglia, Calabria, Sardinia and the autonomous province of Trento.
