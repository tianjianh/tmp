[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northern Ireland households have lowest UK incomes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland households have, on average, the lowest incomes of any UK region, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ONS has published data covering the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes in 2014.
The figures show the average household in NI paid £12,000 in taxes and received £13,000 in direct and indirect benefits.
Average earnings are £25,540 giving a final household income of £26,500.
The UK average final income is just under £32,000 and the highest average is in London at almost £39,000.
The figures also show that on average Northern Ireland households pay the second lowest amount in direct taxes, such as income tax, at £5,458.
However, they pay the second highest amount in indirect taxes, such as VAT, at £6,501.
Northern Ireland households are not, on average, the largest recipients of direct benefits - four other regions have higher average benefit incomes.
