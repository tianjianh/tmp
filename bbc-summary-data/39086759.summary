[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side took a seventh-minute lead when Taron Hare's cross was headed in deftly by Jake Skelton for his second goal of the season.
However, the scores were level in the 26th minute when Charlie Carter set up Gozie Ugwu, who made no mistake.
But North Ferriby secured back-to-back victories for just the second time this season when Reece Thompson scored his eighth goal of the campaign, converting Robbie Tinkler's pass.
Tinkler nearly made it three later on, but he was denied by Cards goalkeeper Michael Poke.
