[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonathan Trott reached a half-century for Warwickshire for the 123rd time in his first-class career at Taunton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But rain had the final word on a day in which Somerset's bowlers managed just 37 balls in the meeting of the County Championship Division One's bottom two.
Play did not start until after lunch as the groundstaff mopped up from the previous day's deluge, further hampered by early afternoon showers.
When play did get under way, the Bears added 31 runs to close on 124-3.
After Jack Leach had delivered one ball to complete his unfinished over from day one, the Overton twins took up the attack for Somerset.
Craig bowled a testing first over from the Pavilion End before Jamie had a big appeal for lbw against Trott rejected with his first delivery of the day.
Trott had just moved to 50 when bad light forced the players off, and more rain followed before umpires Alex Wharf and Paul Baldwin called off play for the day at 17:00 BST.
