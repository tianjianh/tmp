Norman Sharp, 91, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, was the first person to get an NHS hip operation in December 1948, aged 23, after suffering from septic arthritis as a child.
He now holds the Guinness World Record for the longest-lasting replacement hip replacement - and is still dancing.
BBC Points West's Fiona Lamdin put it to the test.
