Daisy Clark, 18, from Newquay, received critical acclaim online when she made a cover of the song Hopelessly Devoted to You from the musical Grease.
The video has received almost six million views on social media.
The young performer almost did not post the video due to "rude comments" made about her online.
Daisy said: "It did give me doubts, especially with Hopelessly Devoted To You. I just didn't let the comments stop me from doing what I love."
