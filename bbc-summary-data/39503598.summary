The 19-year-old is the junior world number one and will make his debut in the competition as the team's youngest member.
MacDonald, who trains at the British Judo Centre of Excellence in Walsall, won silver at the 2016 Junior European Championships in Malaga.
He is currently the top-ranked 60kg junior judoka in the world.
The 11-strong British team heading to Poland from 20-23 April contains a mixture of experienced judoka - among them Olympian Natalie Powell - and debutants.
In 2016 British Judo had its best return from the European Championships in 10 years with Colin Oates and Powell winning silver and bronze respectively.
GB Judo squad: Chelsie Giles, Kelly Edwards, Nekoda Davis, Bekky Livesey, Alice Schlesinger, Amy Livesey, Natalie Powell, Ashley McKenzie, Neil MacDonald, Max Stewart, Ben Fletcher
