Organisers of the rock event, which is usually held at Knebworth Park, said they struggled to get a good line-up.
They also couldn't find a weekend which didn't clash with other events.
A statement on the festival's website reads: ""Unfortunately our last irons in the fire have just been extinguished and it's clear that we won't be in a position to run the event this year."
It was also cancelled in 2012 and 2013.
In 2012, organisers said they had fought hard to keep it going but that "a very challenging year" meant the event wouldn't have satisfied fans.
The following year, the rock festival was called off because organisers said they were unable to secure a good enough line-up of artists.
Their statement about this year's cancellation added: "We've said in the past that Sonisphere will only go ahead if we feel it is going to be good enough and that hasn't changed.
"We hope all rock fans have a great summer with all the festivals and concerts already in the calendar and we plan to see you all in 2016."
Sonisphere Switzerland is still set to go ahead on 6 June with Muse headlining.
