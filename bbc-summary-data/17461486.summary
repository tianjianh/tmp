My Autism and Me looks at what it's like to live with autism, a condition that affects the way you live your life and see the world around you.
Rosie, the film's presenter, was at the awards party to pick up the trophy.
Rosie was born with autism, and says even though living with it is hard, it makes her unique and who she is.
