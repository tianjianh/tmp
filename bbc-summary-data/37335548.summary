"I'm sure there have been better prime ministers but there's never been a happier one," he told Melbourne radio station 3AW.
Since taking office a year ago, after ousting his predecessor, Mr Turnbull he has seen his approval ratings plummet.
He retained his job by a narrow margin at the July election, but his party to lose 12 MPs and three senators.
Mr Turnbull insisted in his interview that everything was going well.
"It is my lot in life in to be criticised but I am joyful subject of criticism and I am determined to do better," he said.
"I am a convivial person. I like being out and about - it's one of the reasons I like public transport."
Political commentators have accused Mr Turnbull of indecisiveness on a range of issues, and of failing to stand up to his party's conservative wing.
Supporters had hoped he would take bolder action on same-sex marriage, climate change and conditions at offshore detention centres.
Opposition leader Bill Shorten, who is in Canada this week, used the anniversary to take aim at Mr Turnbull's performance.
"This prime minister is the great national disappointment," he said. "From messiah to mediocrity; from agile to fragile."
Asked if he still enjoyed leading the country, Mr Turnbull said: "I love it."
