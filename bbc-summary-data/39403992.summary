Natasha Wake death: Jay Nava 'stabbed ex while children slept'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A soldier stabbed the mother of his child 11 times after she discovered he was being investigated for a sex offence, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jay Nava, 27, of the Royal Citadel, Plymouth, is charged with murdering mother-of-two Natasha Wake, 26.
He repeatedly stabbed her using a kitchen knife while her children slept upstairs, his trial was told.
Miss Wake was found wrapped in a duvet in a cupboard under the stairs of her Bournemouth home on 2 October.
Winchester Crown Court heard officers also discovered three notes at the Harley Gardens property written by Mr Nava, who was later found attempting to take his own life at Hengistbury Head.
"The worst thing I have ever seen is the death of my lover and my child's mother," one note read.
The other, addressed to Miss Wake's mother, said: "I'm sorry for hurting your daughter."
The last addressed to Miss Wake said: "To the most beautiful woman I have ever met and loved so much."
Jurors heard Mr Nava, who was a serving soldier at the time of the killing, had been investigated by police in May after a woman alleged he sexually assaulted her with another man.
But the weekend Miss Wake was killed, Mr Nava was informed police were dropping the case and that no charges would be brought.
Miss Wake first heard about the investigation on 1 October and was "very upset", the court heard.
She sent a message to Mr Nava's twin brother saying she "hated him" and left an angry voicemail on another person's phone at about 23:00 BST.
It is believed Miss Wake was killed shortly afterwards with 11 stab wounds to the chest and neck.
A young girl went downstairs that evening and saw Mr Nava in the kitchen with a knife in his pocket and Miss Wake's arms and legs poking out from under a blanket on the living room floor, the jury heard.
She told police she saw red spots on the knife, Mr Nava's neck, the walls, carpet, sofa and blanket.
The next morning Mr Nava told the girl it was a game and Miss Wake had gone shopping.
The court heard he later phoned his mother in Australia and admitted killing Miss Wake.
Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, urged the jury to consider not whether Mr Nava had killed Miss Wake, but the state of his mind when he had killed her.
The trial continues.
