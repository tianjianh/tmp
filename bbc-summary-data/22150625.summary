Chad, one of the largest supplier of troops battling Islamists in Mali, has started to pull them out, President Idriss Deby has said.

"The Chadian army does not have the skills to fight a shadowy, guerrilla-style war that is taking place in northern Mali," he said.
Three Chadian soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in Mali on Friday.

The Chadian retreat does not signal that the job of routing Islamist militants is complete in Mali. It indicates that President Idriss Deby does not want his 2,000 troops in the country to get drawn into the urban guerrilla war that is expected to be its main feature from now on.
Chad has lost more than 30 soldiers in operations carried out jointly with France in northern Mali.
Chad's presence alongside the French - who have lost five soldiers - has been crucial both militarily and politically.
The timing of Mr Deby's announcement positions him perfectly to negotiate a prominent role for his country's troops in the forthcoming UN peacekeeping force whose mandate is expected to be agreed at the Security Council later this month.
Mr Deby, who came to power in a coup in 1990, also has worries at home. Last month, a rebel coalition called l'Union des Forces de la Resistance (UFR) announced that it was taking up arms again after a two-year truce.
But fighting continues in some remote parts of the Sahara Desert.
Chad's 2,000 troops were seen as playing a crucial role in the fighting because of their experience in desert warfare.
About 30 have been killed - more than any other nationality, reports the Reuters news agency.
Three of them died in a suicide attack in Kidal on Friday.
Mr Deby told French media that Chad's soldiers had "accomplished their mission".
"We have already withdrawn a mechanised battalion," he said.
But he said Chad would contribute to a proposed 11,000-strong UN peacekeeping force in Mali.
France has also started to withdraw some of its 4,000 soldiers and hopes to have just 1,000 in the country by the end of the year.
France led the intervention in January, saying the al-Qaeda-linked militants were threatened to march on the capital, Bamako.
