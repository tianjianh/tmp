Israeli media concerned by jihadist threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Israeli general's assertion that he has intelligence linking the militant Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which dominates Gaza, with Islamic State's affiliate in Egypt's Sinai peninsula is a major talking point in the Israeli media.

In an interview with Al Jazeera TV, Maj-Gen Yoav Mordechai accused members of Hamas's military wing of training IS fighters and treating those wounded in clashes with the Egyptian military.
The interview came shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of IS "terrorism knocking at our borders".
Yisrael Hayom provides its usual strong support for Mr Netanyahu, and reports the immediate tightening of security in southern Israel as part of "raising preparedness" for any eventuality.
It is joined by Alex Fishman in Yediot Aharonot, where he writes that Israel cannot allow Sinai to become a "logistics rear for Hamas in Gaza, the fruit of this co-operation with Islamic State".
He adds that it would be "naive" to imagine that IS fighters are not already present in Israel's southern Negev desert, and recruiting among Israel's Arab population.
Other papers like the Jerusalem Post leave to one side the question of Hamas involvement, but have no doubt that Israel, Egypt and Gulf Arab states face a common threat in Islamic State. "It is time to confront this ideology throughout the region, beginning in Sinai," it says in an editorial.
The liberal broadsheet Haaretz questions both Mr Netanyahu's political agenda and the government's intentions in going on the record over its accusations against Hamas.
Commentator Amos Harel says Gen Mordechai's interview could only have come on "explicit orders from the highest levels of the government".
He thinks Israel's aim is to get Egypt to "take direct action" against Hamas - a "highly unusual move" that risks sending out mixed signals, given Israel's own restrained response to recent rocket attacks by possible Islamic State sympathisers in Gaza.
Haaretz's editorial concedes that there may be co-operation with IS, but cautions against using this as a pretext to "settle scores" with Hamas given the "regional chaos".
Whatever the truth of tactical co-operation in Sinai, IS has a history of denouncing Hamas and other Muslim Brotherhood groups as "apostates" over their willingness to contest elections and tolerate non-Sunni Muslims.
IS recently released a video threatening to overthrow Hamas, with Palestinian fighters in Syria condemning the movement's crackdown on Salafist groups in Gaza and its approach to enforcing Islamic law.
Some prominent commentators on jihadist sites even speculate that Islamic State is in fact planning to attack Hamas via Sinai as part of the current campaign, or by activating fighters in Gaza itself.
