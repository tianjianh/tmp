Firefighters were called to the Stables Market after the blaze broke out at about 20:00 BST. It was brought under control about two hours later.
London Fire Brigade (LFB) sent 10 fire engines and more than 70 firefighters to tackle the blaze.
The Stables Market is the largest of a number of markets in Camden, selling books, clothing, and jewellery.
A nearby supermarket was also evacuated.
Shortly after the fire broke out, LFB tweeted: "The fire at Stables Market on Chalk Farm Road can be seen from miles around."
It later tweeted: "Fire is in the roof voids of the shops at Stables Market in #Camden. We've stopped the fire from affecting the overhead passenger train line."
David Byard, who works in the Barfly pub opposite the market, said: "We noticed thick black smoke billowing from the market.
"The fire brigade were at the scene with a hydraulic platform."
He said that the fire appeared to have been put out by about 21:00 BST.
Ash Jones, who was in a pub close to the market, said: "An alarm went off and we were evacuated.
"Buses were abandoned as the roads were closed and 200 or 300 people were left standing in the street."
The Metropolitan Police confirmed Chalk Farm Road had been cordoned off at Camden High Street .
The market is located in the historic former Pickfords stables and Grade II-listed horse hospital which served the horses pulling Pickfords' distribution vans and barges along the canal.
Many of its stalls are set in large arches in railway viaducts.
