He said soon after deleting the tweet: "I'd like to apologise for any offence I've caused.
"It was a brainless moment from me and I'm really disappointed in myself for using that term. I'm not homophobic at all.
"However, I know it is not acceptable by any means and I'm really sorry to any of our supporters or anyone in the wider public who have been offended by the remark."
