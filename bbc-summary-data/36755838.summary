[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool owner Owen Oyston has said the club is "not for sale" despite revealing his son Karl has stepped down as chief executive.

Oyston senior attended a public meeting with members of the League Two club's Supporters Trust (BST) on Saturday.
He was heckled throughout as he attempted to answer questions from the floor at the Blackpool Hilton hotel.
Fans chanted "Oyston out" and "get out of our club" during the meeting, which lasted just over an hour.
Oyston was invited to make a rare appearance in front of supporters by trust chairman Steve Rowland.
At the end of the meeting, Oyston was escorted from the function room by security guards.
Blackpool, who were relegated for the third time in five seasons in May, have been owned by the Oyston family since 1988.
Relations between supporters and the owners have deteriorated since the club's relegation after one season in the Premier League in 2010-11.
This season, the club will play in the fourth tier for the first time since 2000-01.
BST launched a Â£16m bid to buy Blackpool in July 2015 but Oyston, whose son Karl is to continue as chairman, eventually ended those takeover talks.
Alex Cowdy will replace Karl as chief executive as Blackpool prepare for the coming season under new manager Gary Bowyer.
