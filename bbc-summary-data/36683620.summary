Dancers, musicians and acrobats from across the world will make their way from the Mound to the West End before finishing up in Princes Street Gardens and The Ross Theatre.
There will also be a performance stage and a market in the Grassmarket.
The parade will begin the festivities at 14:30 on 17 July.
The event, which finishes at 17:00, is free.
There will also be a special area for young people and families at the west end of Princes Street Gardens.
Performers are coming from Senegal, South Africa, China, USA, Italy, Portugal, Netherlands, Martinique, and Trinidad as well as a host of Scottish drummers, dancers, fire-eaters, jugglers, stilt walkers and circus acts.
Last year over 20,000 people flocked to the event.
Roger Spence, The Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival producer, said: "We are delighted to be able to bring the carnival atmosphere and another fantastic celebration of music and dance from around the globe to Edinburgh.
"It's the event that makes everyone feel good."
Richard Lewis, Edinburgh's festivals and events champion, said: "Founded on the belief that the arts really are for everyone, this all-inclusive, family event brings communities together for a truly spectacular experience.
"I am delighted that the carnival continues to be a free event for everyone.
"This year we're sure the Jazz and Blues Festival organisers will inject the streets of Edinburgh with the biggest, brightest, feel-good carnival yet."
