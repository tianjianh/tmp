Operation Stack: Kent residents 'prisoners in their own homes'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nearly 6,000 lorries are parked on the M20 in Kent as part of Operation Stack, with local residents and businesses complaining that its knock-on effects are becoming intolerable.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The M20 is the main route through the county, but a 23-mile stretch of the coast-bound carriageway is currently shut.
The closure was ordered as part of Operation Stack, which is implemented whenever there is disruption to Channel crossings, and involves lorries being parked or "stacked" along the motorway.
The current closure is due to the ongoing Calais migrant crisis.
Local roads are also affected as motorists going about their daily business - and lorry drivers too - look for alternative routes.
It has led to heavy congestion in town centres, villages and country lanes across south-east Kent.
Jenny Chessman lives on the Orchard Heights estate in Ashford, close to the Drovers roundabout, which has consistently been at a standstill.
"We're prisoners on our own estate... people are using every other route to try to get around the problem," she said.
"There are so many lorries causing absolute chaos."
Chris Wolfe runs a wholesale flower business from Ashford and said getting around was impossible, with side roads gridlocked and unable to cope, and everybody "jumping the lights".
"It's the wedding season and sometimes flowers have arrived 15 hours late, so we've been delivering late at night," she said.
"There are a lot of angry, frustrated people out there."
Linda Farrier, who runs a family funeral directors in Dover, said the firm was having to add extra time on to most journeys.
"It's not just funerals, it's also collecting the deceased from hospitals," she said, adding that some mourners had even been unable to get to funerals because of delays on the road.
Residents have complained of spending hours sitting in traffic, with parked lorries blocking junctions and roundabouts.
Ken and Jeanette Green drove from Folkestone to Kingston, south London, with their cousin Dave Williams on Wednesday in a round trip that took more than 10 hours.
"It was the worst journey I have ever had," Mr Williams said.
He recalled how they were visiting a sick relative in hospital and got almost as far as Ashford on the M20 when all the lanes came to a halt because Operation Stack had suddenly been brought in on the London-bound carriageway.
Mr Green said they were at a standstill for at least three hours.
"It's ridiculous, and a national disgrace," he said.
Paget Silvester, from Lympne, works 12-hour night shifts as a healthcare assistant in a nursing home in Blackheath, south-east London.
Her journey to and from work normally takes just over an hour, but has been taking up to three-and-a-half hours.
But she and her husband, who also has to drive up the M20 to Maidstone for his job, have decided to turn the situation around.
"We have a small caravan, and we're going to tow it to Bearsted to a caravan site to live there and cut our journey times down," she said.
"We're trying to turn a desperate situation into something a little bit easier."
