The Scarlets flanker, 29, did not make last year's World Cup squad and has been absent for the past three Six Nations campaigns.
Barclay will win his 46th cap alongside John Hardie and Dave Denton in the home back row at Murrayfield.
Glasgow centre Mark Bennett will also be in the starting line-up, having recovered from a shoulder injury.

Bennett will be partnered by Edinburgh's Matt Scott, with Sean Maitland and Tommy Seymour on the wings.
Barclay featured in two of Scotland's World Cup warm-up matches last summer, having been overlooked since 2013.
But he was omitted from the final tournament squad in favour of Hardie - recently arrived from New Zealand - while another adopted Kiwi, Blair Cowan, was summoned as a second specialist open-side during the group stages.
"I am still massively motivated and still feel I have a lot to offer at this level," Barclay told BBC Scotland earlier this week.
Since the World Cup, Alasdair Strokosch has retired and fellow flanker Ryan Wilson has not been chosen for the Six Nations.
"I played at number eight for the first 10 games, and then at seven for three or four games, but I've ended up switching in games and playing right across the back row," said Barclay of his season so far at Scarlets.
"Our coach, Wayne Pivac, is pretty relaxed about the number on your back. He wants the three guys playing the best rugby.
"It is quite exciting to play with two open-sides. It is a bit easier when the weather is better but it certainly adds another dimension to your defence."
The official team announcement is due to be made by Scottish Rugby at 12:30 GMT on Thursday.
Scotland XV: Stuart Hogg, Sean Maitland, Mark Bennett, Matt Scott, Tommy Seymour, Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw (capt); Al Dickinson, Ross Ford, WP Nel, Richie Gray, Jonny Gray, John Barclay, John Hardie, David Denton.
