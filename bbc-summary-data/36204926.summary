[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fire started in mixed commercial and residential buildings in Stony Stratford, Milton Keynes, on Sunday afternoon.
Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes Fire Service said a drone was used to try to find out how the blaze started because it was too dangerous to enter.
The service said the technology proved "invaluable".
At the height of the blaze, nine fire engines were at the scene including crews from Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire.
