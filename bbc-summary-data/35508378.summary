The red 335 Sport Scaglietti won the 1958 Cuban Grand Prix and set a lap record at the Le Mans 24 Hours race.
It was driven by top drivers of the era, including Britain's Stirling Moss and Mike Hawthorn.
Matthieu Lamoure, managing director of Artcurial Motorcars auction house, said it was a world record price for a car in euros.
The previous record was held by a Ferrari 250 GTO which went for 28.5m euros in 2014.
However, motoring correspondents say at current exchange rates, it becomes the world's second most expensive car in dollars, as the 2014 sale in California was for $38m.
The 335 Sport Scaglietti was one of only four models to come out of the Ferrari factory.
The new owner was described only as an "international buyer".
