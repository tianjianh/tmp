A former prison officer has admitted selling information about singer George Michael's time in prison to the Sun newspaper for £2,000.

Amanda Watts, 43, from Suffolk, pleaded guilty to one count of misconduct in public office and was told a prison sentence was "inevitable".
The Old Bailey heard that details of Michael's time in Highpoint Prison in 2010 led to five stories in the Sun.
Watts, who was arrested under Operation Elveden, will be sentenced next month.
Judge John Bevan QC told her: "You should understand the fact I'm bailing you until [16 October] is to enable you to make appropriate arrangements.
"A prison sentence is inevitable. I'm sure you understand."
The court heard she received £2,000 for the information she gave.
Operation Elveden is a Metropolitan Police investigation into alleged inappropriate payments by journalists to police and other public officials.
Michael was jailed for eight weeks in September 2010 for crashing his Range Rover while under the influence of cannabis.
