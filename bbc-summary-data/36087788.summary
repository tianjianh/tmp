The Foxes wrapped up victory, their first in the opening match of a season since 2012, shortly after lunch on the final day in Cardiff.
Paul Horton (64 not out) made his second half-century of the match, while Angus Robson was unbeaten on 49.
Earlier, Glamorgan added 19 runs for their last two wickets as they were all out for 191, Ben Raine taking 4-57.
Glamorgan head coach Robert Croft told BBC Wales Sport: "It was quite clear we were below the standard we set ourselves in pretty much every department.
"We pride ourselves in our strengths of accuracy, resilience and consistency. With the performance that was below the standard we set, to still have opportunities to win the game does give you hope.
"It's one game gone, it's not ideal, but whether you lose by 10 wickets or one, it's a loss. So I'm just focused on trying to turn around the standards that we set."
Leicestershire's elite performance director Andrew McDonald: "It was a very professional performance and we were pretty clinical in the way we got the job done. Being none down in the chase was exceptional.
"I think there were great contributions from every player - batting, bowling and fielding. The bowlers thought they had been a bit sloppy in Glamorgan's first innings, so to come back the way they did in the second innings to bowl them out for 200 was outstanding.
"But it was important the batters had given them the opportunity to rest, to put their feet up. Over four days it's a war of attrition, and to have your bowlers fresh again is always critical."
