Neil Warnock has urged his goal-shy Cardiff City side to start believing in themselves in front of goal.

The Bluebirds are the second-lowest scorers at home in the Championship with just eight and the third-lowest scorers in total with 19 from 20 games.
After a draw at Ipswich, third-from-bottom Cardiff face Wolverhampton Wanderers on Tuesday, hoping to climb out of the relegation zone.
"We've got to try to create more," Warnock told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
Only Wigan, with six have scored fewer times in front of their own fans than the Welsh club, while only the Latics with 16 and Ipswich with 18 have scored fewer than Cardiff in the Championship.
Former England-international striker Rickie Lambert remains the Bluebirds' top-scorer having found the net four times with Anthony Pilkington and Peter Whittingham behind him with three each.
Cardiff's next highest scorer is defender Shane Duffy, now with Brighton, who scored two own goals at Cardiff City Stadium in August.
Warnock believes defensively his side are starting to gel, but has urged his players to create more goal-scoring opportunities and, more importantly, to take them.
"The lads have got to be more convincing, have a bit more confidence in themselves," said Warnock.
"We are quite solid now. I thought (Matthew) Connolly did really well against Ipswich and (Lee) Peltier at the back.
"I was pleased with (Peter) Whittingham in there.  It's just a matter of getting a goal or two. We'll have to look how we can do that."
Cardiff are preparing for two home games with Barnsley the visitors on Saturday, 17 December following the Wolves game.
Warnock said those matches are a chance for his side to climb out of the Championship bottom three and insists the Bluebirds' home support will have a big part to play.
"It's going to be an interesting game (against Wolves), but it's one we have to look to win as it's at home," Warnock added.
"We've got two home games and we've got opportunities this week to get some points on the board.
"We are going into it with confidence, we've had two good games, really.
"It's an intimidating place when the crowd is going."
Warnock says Bruno Manga will come in for suspended Sol Bamba against Wolves.
The Cardiff manager has already indicated he is willing to sell Manga during the January transfer window.
