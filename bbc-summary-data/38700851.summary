[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 3-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Keshi Anderson's second-half hat-trick earned Northampton Town a much-needed League One victory over 10-man Coventry City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game was held up several times through flares being thrown on to the pitch and some Coventry supporters coming on to the playing area in protest at the club's owners.
But, on the Sky Blues' return to the ground where they played as tenants in 2013-14, it was the Cobblers who bagged the three vital points against the bottom club.
City received an early setback when they were reduced to 10 men after Jordan Willis was given a straight red card for a reckless challenge in the 19th minute.
The Cobblers had the better chances of a poor first half, but they began brightly after the restart, breaking the deadlock in the 53rd minute when a quick break ended with Richards finding Anderson in the box and he fired into the top corner.
John-Joe O'Toole was also denied by the excellent Burge as Cobblers got on top. And, after another delay, Cobblers doubled their advantage in the 64th minute.
Burge tipped over a shot from Anderson and, from Matt Taylor's ensuing corner, Zander Diamond set up Anderson, who fired home from six yards.
Burge produce more heroics to thwart Richards while O'Toole should have done better when he fired over from a good position, but Anderson completed his hat-trick in the 76th minute when he swept home a cross from Boateng into the bottom corner.
That led to more fans and flares coming onto the pitch but the delays failed to prevent Cobblers from picking up three crucial points to leave City in deep trouble - now eight points adrift of safety.
