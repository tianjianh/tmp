The comedian, author and TV star apologised on Twitter, saying police had "just" told him about the letters, sent via his publisher Harper Collins.
He added that those without a response should "please write again".
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said a member of the public had found items of discarded mail in Camden on 8 April.
He added that inquiries were continuing to identify if an offence had been committed.
Walliams, who is currently on screen as a judge on ITV's Britain's Got Talent, has written six books for Harper Collins, with three becoming children's bestsellers.
According to the publisher's website, he is due to release a new children's novel in September.
