Midfielder Camps picked up the ball 25 yards out before unleashing a rasping drive into the top corner to give the home side the lead.
Ian Henderson soon doubled Dale's advantage from the penalty spot after he was fouled by John Mousinho.
Lucas Akins' exquisite lob pulled one back for Burton, but Rochdale hung on to see out victory.
Burton Albion remain top of League One following Gillingham's defeat at Blackpool, while Rochdale move up to 14th.

"Two thirds of the performance was superb. I wanted to reassure myself and the players that there's no crisis at the football club.
"Progressively, I want to try and establish ourselves and take us close to being a Championship side.
"If we'd lost the game but performed like that, I would have been reasonably happy."
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:

"We stressed to the players after Tuesday night that this is Rochdale now. We knew what the pitch was going to be like. They've had a lot of rain up here. It was going to be a difficult game.
"They came off the back of a 6-1 defeat last week and it certainly makes them come out and fight a bit harder, but it was a strange first half.
"Jon McLaughlin has picked the ball out of the net twice and had nothing else to do."
