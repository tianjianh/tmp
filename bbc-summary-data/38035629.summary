[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 2-0 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Kashket scored in each half as Wycombe Wanderers beat Hartlepool to move back into the League Two play-off places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder took his tally for the season to six as Wycombe picked up a fourth successive league win.
The hosts were unlucky not to take an early lead when Kashket capitalised on poor play from youngster James Martin but could only hit the side-netting.
Kashket then gave the Chairboys the lead in the 23rd minute, collecting Luke O'Nien's ball in the area before unleashing a low effort beyond Pools goalkeeper Trevor Carson.
Hartlepool striker Padraig Amond wasted a glorious chance to restore parity 10 minutes before the break as he headed wide.
Wycombe almost gave themselves a two-goal cushion midway through the second half as Adebayo Akinfenwa's 18-yard effort struck the post.
Pools substitute Michael Woods wasted a golden opportunity to level as he burst into the area before screwing his effort wide.
And Wycombe then sealed victory 10 minutes from time as Kashket fired beyond Carson after finding himself in space in the area.
