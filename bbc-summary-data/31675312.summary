Wales devolution: Response to funding pledge 'bizarre'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh ministers' response to a promise on minimum funding is "bizarre", Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Friday, the UK government proposed a funding "floor" - guaranteeing a minimum Welsh government income.
The Conservatives now want Labour Welsh ministers to call a referendum on devolving part-control of income tax.
First Minister Carwyn Jones denounced the funding offer as a "vague promise" but Mr Crabb said it was a response to specific Welsh government demands.
Tory MP Mr Crabb told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme that the UK government had "moved mountains".
"We've broken down Whitehall and Treasury intransigence, and it's a bit bizarre for the Welsh government and Carwyn Jones to say, hang on, this doesn't change a thing, when they know how far we've moved, and we've moved in the direction they themselves exactly were looking for," he said.
