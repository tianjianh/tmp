Barbara King and her husband Tommy, who died in 1992, committed multiple offences against both girls in the 1970s and 1980s.
Police said the victims, who were seven and 12 at the time, did not know each but both reported being sexually abused by the couple.
King, who denied all charges, was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court.
She was found guilty of six counts of gross indecency of a child under 14 and three counts of indecent assault on a female.
Police arrested King in January last year after the first victim, now in her 40s, came forward.
The second victim, who is in her 50s, contacted police the following month when she heard about King's arrest.
In victim statements read out in court, they both spoke about the damaging effect of the abuse, said police.
One said, although she did not like what was going on, she thought at the time it was "normal".
"It was only when I got older, I realised the full extent of what they had done to me."
The second victim said the couple had "ruined my life from an early age" and resulted in her self-harming.
Det Con Trish Lacey said after sentencing: "The Kings took advantage of their victims' vulnerabilities by pretending to be offering a sanctuary in their home and gaining their trust through kindness.
"It was only years later that they were able to comprehend the crimes that had been committed against them and the damaging effect these terrible experiences had had on them."
