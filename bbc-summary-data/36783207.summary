T in the Park organisers 'must get on top of indiscipline'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An improved T in the Park campsite set-up with a more visible police presence is needed to allay public fears over safety, it has been claimed.

Strathallan councillor Tom Gray said the campsite could be an "ongoing success" if festival organisers could "get on top of indiscipline".
Witnesses reported fights and illicit drug use in the campsite area.
DF Concerts said it cared about "each and every music fan that passes through our gates."
Two teenagers died at this year's event and police are investigating the rape of an 18-year-old.
Police Scotland said 429 crimes were reported at the Perthshire festival, compared with 414 last year.
Officers made 54 arrests, compared with 57 in 2015.
Commentators on social media sites, including Tintheparktruth on Facebook, have raised concerns over anti-social behaviour, with reports of first-aid volunteers and stewards being threatened.
DF Concerts has previously denied claims that posts critical of the festival have been deleted from the T in the Park Facebook page.
Mr Gray, who is convener of Perth and Kinross Council's development management committee, said:  "Some sort of organised set-up in the campsites seems to be required, or certainly more visible policing of them might help.
"At the same time, when you have a gang of youths who decide to throw things at a police van, then there is another problem, a general problem of misbehaviour, that seems to be drawn into T in the Park.
"Somebody who can look after the campsites and can put their finger on what makes them function well, rather than badly, would help.
"If they could do that and get on top of the indiscipline, then there's no reason why the site can't be an ongoing success."
Mr Gray praised improvements made to the festival's transport plan, which was heavily criticised in 2015.
He said: "This year it really was night and day, it was so different.
"The bus park was a great success. I even went along on Saturday night to try it myself and it was wonderful."
A DF Concerts and Events spokeswoman said its priority over the last 23 years had been "to bring the best musical acts from around the world" in a "fun and safe setting" for fans.
She added: "We care about each and every music fan that passes through our gates and the entire festival team is devastated by the tragedies that took place on Thursday night.
"We aim to do everything we can to ensure fan safety by working closely in partnership with Police Scotland and the event stewarding companies to ensure a proactive approach is taken to identifying and dealing with crime.
"This will be at the forefront of our debrief process for this year's event."
