Mr Kimishima has been a managing director at the firm since June 2013, and joined in 2000.
The company said several new appointments were part of a "large-scale revision" of Nintendo's organisational structure.
The changes will come into effect on Wednesday.
Mr Kimishima was a managing director of the company in charge of corporate analysis, general affairs and human resources divisions.
He has been at Nintendo since 2000 when he was appointed director of its Pokemon business.
A new title of "Creative Fellow" was announced for game designer and senior managing director Shigeru Miyamoto.
Another senior executive, Genyo Takeda, was given the title "Technology Fellow."
Nintendo said the titles were meant to convey his roles in providing advice and guidance.
Mr Iwata, who was president from 2002, was highly revered on the Japanese gaming scene.
He was considered the leading figure behind some of Nintendo's most popular devices from 2000, when he joined the company.
He led Nintendo into the rapidly growing mobile gaming sector.
