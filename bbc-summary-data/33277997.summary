A plaque marking the meeting between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards is to be replaced after The Rolling Stones' former bassist Bill Wyman objected.

The blue plaque, unveiled at Dartford station in February, says the pair "went on to form The Rolling Stones".
But Wyman complained, saying guitarist Brian Jones created The Rolling Stones and enlisted the other members.
"I've never upset a Rolling Stone before but we are going to put it right," said councillor Jeremy Kite.
Jagger and Richards both went to Wentworth Primary School but met up again on platform two of Dartford station in Kent on 17 October 1961.
They bonded over a love of the blues and formed a musical friendship that still endures.
Wyman, who left the band in 1993, told BBC Radio 5 live the plaque was disgusting.
"Mick Jagger and Keith Richards didn't create the Rolling Stones - they were part of The Rolling Stones like all of us," he said.
"Brian Jones wanted to form a blues band and he enlisted each member one by one.
"He gave the name The Rolling Stones, he chose the music and he was the leader."
Guitarist Jones drowned in the swimming pool of his home at Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, East Sussex in 1969 after taking a cocktail of drink and drugs.
Dartford council leader Mr Kite said the plaque was intended to commemorate the meeting of the two Dartford sons, not the formation of The Rolling Stones.
But he said it would be taken down and replaced by another with new wording.
"Accuracy in history is really, really important and we want it to be right," he said.
"We will create a new plaque which makes it clear that this is where Mick met Keith and went on to be part of The Rolling Stones."
