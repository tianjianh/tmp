The 26-year-old played 43 times for the Welsh side last season, scoring his only goal against Oxford in April.
The ex-Colchester, Dagenham and England Under-19 man has made 217 appearances in English football and also had a season with Dutch side VVV-Venlo.
"I'm pretty sure we'll be in and around (promotion places) because I know what this squad's capable of," said Elito.
He added to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: "(Manager) Shaun Derry is very inspirational, just from the talks I've had with him and what he wants from his team. He wants them to work hard and be fit.
"He's been at the top level playing for QPR and Crystal Palace and having a manager who's been there and done that, you couldn't ask for any more because he knows what he's talking about."
Meanwhile, 22-year-old Danny Carr has left the U's after mutually agreeing to cancel his contract having only made six appearances for them since joining last summer.
