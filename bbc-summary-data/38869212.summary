The 35-year-old was a free agent after leaving League One side Fleetwood Town at the end of last term.
"It's a great honour to join a club like this, one of the founder members of the Football League," he said.
Ameobi, a former team-mate of Notts boss Kevin Nolan at St James' Park, was named on the bench for Saturday's League Two game at Accrington.
