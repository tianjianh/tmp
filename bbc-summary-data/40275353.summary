Centre Davies had a head injury assessment after the Lions' win over the Crusaders.
Fellow Welshman Moriarty, meanwhile, has not played since straining his back in the opening tour victory against the Provincial Barbarians.
"Both are back in training," said Lions assistant coach Neil Jenkins.
"Jonathan is still going through protocols from his head injury assessment stuff from last week.
"Ross has been back in training. He's done a little bit of running.
"Hopefully, fingers crossed, they'll both be available for Saturday."
If fit, Davies could be in contention to start in the Lions' first Test against New Zealand on 24 June.
The 29-year-old has impressed on the tour so far, and finished the domestic season strongly with Scarlets.
Moriarty, meanwhile, faces competition from the likes of CJ Stander, James Haskell and Peter O'Mahony for a starting place as blind-side flanker.
Both he and Davies could further their cases for inclusion when the Lions face Maori All Blacks on Saturday, aiming for a third win from their first five tour matches.
"Obviously the All Blacks are an outstanding side, but so are the Super Rugby sides as well," said Jenkins.
"I've no doubt the Maoris won't be too dissimilar on Saturday, bringing a bit of physicality to it as well.
"They've got some pretty talented players in that backline, and that's not being disrespectful to the forwards.
"We're expecting a tough, physical, fast game of rugby on Saturday, like another Test match."
