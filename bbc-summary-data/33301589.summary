The Olympic bronze medallist beat the Polish pair Malgorzata Bialecka and Zofia Noceti-Klepacka to take the gold.
The 32-year-old made the most of ideal conditions at Mondello beach to triumph in the winner-takes-all medal race.
"I am really happy - it is something that has always eluded me," said Shaw, who won bronze at the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
"I have finished second a number of times and now all the hard physical and technical work has really paid off."
The RS:X European Championships is the second most important Olympic windsurfing regatta staged by the RS:X class.
Shaw has previously won bronze and silver in the competition.
