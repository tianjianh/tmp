[SN]TITLE[SN]
Thomas Moley: Crossmaglen man sentenced for fuel waste offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Armagh man has been handed a Â£2,500 fine and given a suspended sentence for fuel laundering waste offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Thomas Moley, 49, of Cullaville Road in Crossmaglen, pleaded guilty to the charges at Newry Magistrates' Court.
He was given two three-month sentences, suspended for 18 months.
Approximately four tonnes of fuel laundering waste was found alongside a laundering plant during an inspection at premises he owned with his wife.
The Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the PSNI carried out the inspection on 15 July 2014, along with HM Revenue and Customs, which removed the majority of the material.
But a quantity of mixed controlled waste had also been left there, despite the site having no licence or authorisation to store, keep or treat waste.
Mr Moley was ordered to remove the waste from the premises in accordance with legislation, but failed to do so.
The judge ordered him to pay costs of Â£393.60 and his suspended sentences will run concurrently.
