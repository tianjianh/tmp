[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oldham boosted their League One survival hopes with victory over play-off chasing Peterborough.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Green and Ryan McLaughlin scored their first goals for the Latics, who completed back-to-back home victories under recently returned boss John Sheridan to move to within three points of safety.
Oldham gave free admission to all fans in a bid to arrest their decline in attendances.
And the majority of a 7,224 crowd were almost celebrating the breakthrough in the 19th minute, only for McLaughlin's shot to be deflected inches wide.
Oldham threatened again when Green pulled back a right-wing cross and Peter Clarke fired over from 10 yards.
The hosts also made a bright start to the second half, with Green testing Posh goalkeeper Luke McGee and Clarke seeing his header cleared off the line by Michael Smith.
Oldham struck after 69 minutes when Dominic Ball hauled down McLaughlin and Green slotted in the penalty, sending McGee the wrong way.
The lead was doubled eight minutes from time as McLaughlin tapped in a six-yard volley after fine build-up play by Anthony Gerrard and Aaron Amadi-Holloway.
Peterborough were well below par and did not go close to scoring until injury time when Marcus Maddison clipped the bar from distance.
