Vicky McClure played Lol in the Channel 4 drama This is England '86.
Ms McClure, who has only recently left her office job, beat Anna Maxwell Martin, Natalie Press and Juliet Stevenson to the award.
She said: "There was always a chance [of winning] but never in a million years did I expect that to happen."
"This is all so new to me," added Ms McClure. "I just hope it brings some really interesting and fun work. I think it opens a few more doors."
Vicky McClure was born in Nottingham in 1983.
She was a student at Nottingham's Television Workshop where Hollywood actress Samantha Morton started her career.
Ian Smith, the workshop's director, met Ms McClure when she was 12 years old.
"Vicky was a vibrant and focussed youngster from the early days," said Mr Smith.
"Vicky has an instinct for performance, she always had. She absorbs the role and connects with it 100%."
Director Shane Meadows first cast Ms McClure as Lol in his film This Is England, in 2006.
Her part was small as the film focussed on the character of Shaun, played by Thomas Turgoose.
However, when the TV spin-off, This is England '86, was commissioned, Meadows gave Ms McClure the drama's major storyline.
As Lol, she dealt with issues such as incest, rape and murder.
"It's been such a journey for me," said the actress. "It's not come easy. I've worked hard for it.
"Everybody has been so supportive and they've believed in me."
Despite winning such a prestigious award, Ms McClure said she was determined not to forget the city she was born in.
"I'm not moving from Nottingham, it's where I'm born and bred," she said. "It's a city I'm very proud of."
