The northbound carriageway of the A249 between Key Street and Bobbing roundabouts, near Sittingbourne in Kent, has been closed for a week.
More than 1,000 homes and three schools on the Isle of Sheppey were affected by the burst main, with some without water for two days.
Highways England said it was assessing the damage caused by the sinkhole.
Spokesman Andrew Broughton said it was not known when the road would reopen as engineers were awaiting the results of detailed geo-technical surveys on the sinkhole, which is up to 15ft (4.5m) deep.
"We're continuing to assess the damage that's happened underneath the road before we can actually plan any repairs," he said.
Diversions are in place for drivers heading towards Sheppey.
