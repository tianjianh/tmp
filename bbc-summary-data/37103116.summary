Max Gradel gave the much-changed Cherries the lead with a low drive that went in off the base of the post.
But the League Two side were level when Cole Stockton controlled a long throw and swept in at the near post.
Wilson - who had two loan spells with Bournemouth in 2007 - won it from 25 yards with a low shot.
Bournemouth will host Championship side Preston in the next round.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe:
"The result was the most important thing.
"It was a tough night. Morecambe are a very direct, physical team and they put us under pressure at times. But thankfully we stood up to that.
"I think it was important that we won. We wanted to get through, and that hopefully gives us a platform for Saturday."
Morecambe boss Jim Bentley:
"I'm proud of the team.
"They've given it everything and come off the pitch with no regrets.
"It was a proper game, a great game to be involved in. I'm disappointed but I'm massively proud of the players' efforts.
"Unfortunately we just came up a bit short and go out of the cup but we've got to take confidence from that."
