Dumfries school overhaul costs rise by £21m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Revised plans for an education overhaul in Dumfries mean the costs of its first phase could rise by more than £21m.

Nearly £45m was allocated to a learning hub, north west Dumfries campus and an upgrade of St Joseph's College.
However, it has now emerged that "due to a range of factors" they could actually cost more than £66m.
Councillors will be told they can try to reduce funding to other schemes, use additional borrowing or reassess the schools project itself.
The Dumfries Learning Town project was formulated after plans for a "super school" for all the town's S4 to S6 pupils were dropped.
It will see new schools built at Maxwelltown High and Dumfries High and the refurbishment of St Joseph's College and Dumfries Academy.
It also involves the creation of a "learning hub" offering specialist higher academic and vocational studies.
The costs of its first phase have now been revealed to have risen significantly over previously agreed budgets.
A report to councillors shows the anticipated costs of the "learning hub" have actually dropped slightly.
However, the north west Dumfries campus and St Joseph's College plans have seen forecast spending rise by around £11m each.
Council leader Ronnie Nicholson said that following consultation it had been clear aspects planned for phase two of the project should be brought forward.
"The sheer scale of what we now want to achieve requires more investment but it is still modest given that in phase one alone we are replacing three schools and transforming another," he said.
"In the long term, the number of school sites will be reduced as primary schools move onto shared campuses.
"This will provide significant savings. More importantly we will see schools fit for the 21st century in Dumfries and beyond."
