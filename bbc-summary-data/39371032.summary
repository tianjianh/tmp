Mingzi Yang murder 'not preventable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The murder of a woman by her ex-husband could not have been predicted, a safeguarding report has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Chinese student Mingzi Yang, 29, was found at her house in Sincil Bank, Lincoln, in June, 2014.
She had been battered to death by Wai Hong Tsang, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder.
A Lincolnshire Community Safety Partnership review found "it would have been difficult for any organisation to have taken steps to prevent it".
Tsang, from Scartho, near Grimsby, was originally interviewed by police as a witness.

He was jailed for life in January 2015 after being convicted of his ex-wife's murder.
During his trial, Tsang was described as a "cold and calculating man".
On the day of the murder, he claimed he left his home in Grimsby early in the morning and drove to Sherwood Forest where he went mountain biking.
But police were able to prove he had travelled via Lincoln, stopping off for more than two hours in a secluded lay-by on the edge of the city - giving him enough time to cycle to Ms Yang's home, kill her and cycle back to his car.
The report found that although there was a history of domestic abuse, the couple had divorced in 2012, and were in new relationships when she was murdered.
However, it found evidence of domestic abuse dating back to when the couple married in 2007.
There were three reported incidents in Humberside in November 2009, November 2011 and December 2011.
Tony McGinty, Independent Chair of the Review Panel, said part of the review looked at how organisations responded to previous incidents involving the couple.
He said that although procedures were followed, agencies were sometimes limited because "the nature of the abuse suffered was often coercive control".
