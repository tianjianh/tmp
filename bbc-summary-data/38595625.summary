Homes were evacuated when the fire broke out at the former Lord's Tavern in Barrow, Cumbria, on Wednesday night.
More than 70 firefighters tackled the blaze at its height. The cause is being jointly investigated by police and fire officers.
The three-storey building in Abbey Road was built in 1871 and was one of the area's first workingmen's clubs.
The former pub - known locally as the House of Lords - has also been used as a library. It was given Grade II listed status in 1976 and now faces being demolished.
A spokesman for Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service said: "Initially two engines were dispatched, but on arrival crews were faced with a severe fire that had already engulfed most of the building.
"The building has suffered partial collapse. This was a large and complex fire that required a significant and sustained response from us and colleagues from Lancashire.
"Thankfully it appears no-one has been hurt and we will now begin investigation work to determine the cause."
