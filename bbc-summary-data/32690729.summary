The funeral of BBC Radio Derby presenter Colin Bloomfield, who died of cancer aged 33, has taken place in his hometown of Shrewsbury.

The service was held at St Chad's Church, followed by a reception at Shrewsbury Town Football Club.
Bloomfield was diagnosed with stage four melanoma, a type of skin cancer, in 2013 and died at a hospice in April.
The Colin Bloomfield Melanoma Appeal has raised more than Â£100,000 to help educate children about sun exposure.
The funeral featured music from Edward Elgar, as well as tributes from Mr Bloomfield's family and radio colleagues.
Radio Derby news editor Rachael Gilchrist gave a reading during the service looking back over his broadcasting career.
He worked at the radio station for more than 10 years as a news reporter, Derby County commentator and breakfast show presenter.
Four lifelong friends of Colin carried his coffin into St Chad's Church in Shrewsbury. It was draped in a flag for his beloved Shrewsbury Town and a scarf for his adopted Derby County.
Tributes were paid by family members and BBC Radio Derby colleagues. But he'd have been made up that there was also a reading by Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon. How apt that Micky's side were promoted on the day Colin died.
And he loved celebrity spotting, so he'd have been delighted to see Rams legend Roger Davies and Olympic swimmer Ross Davenport among the mourners.
On the coffin, the flowers included sunflowers - very apt for a man who has done so much to warn of the dangers of too much sun, but who also had a truly sunny disposition.
RIP Bloomers, so many people are going to miss you.
Thousands of messages in tribute have been posted on social media or passed to the BBC.
Friend and former Olympic swimmer Ross Davenport said after his death: "Colin was someone you could open up to and trust wholeheartedly."
