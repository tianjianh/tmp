Denbighshire school taxis row to get High Court hearing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents have won the right to seek judicial review of a decision to cut free school transport in rural Denbighshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The legal bid was launched after free taxis for pupils living 12 miles (19km) from Ysgol Brynhyfryd were stopped.
A High Court judge granted their application for a full hearing, saying it was "arguably bizarre" if there was no entitlement to transport.
Denbighshire council said it agreed the policy after "extensive consultation".
Parents launched the legal action amid claims their children's route to a bus stop 2.5 miles (4km) away from home was too dangerous to walk.
Welsh government guidance urges local authorities to make suitable travel arrangements for pupils to attend school if no other safe route is "available", even if their journey is less than 3 miles (4.8km).
"If, therefore, the claimants were attending school at the pick-up point now designated they would be entitled to transport," said Judge Seys Llewellyn QC, after considering the case on the papers.
"It is arguably bizarre if the claimants here are not entitled to transport."
He granted permission for a full High Court judicial review hearing, which will take place in late February or early March.
The council has previously said the new policy went through the proper "democratic process" and it would thoroughly investigate any complaints.
