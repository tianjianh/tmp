A dilapidated scout hut where George Michael played his first gig will "last another 60 years" after being restored.

Michael's family moved to Bushey in Hertfordshire when he was a teenager.
He revealed that he performed in front of 400-500 people at the building during his pre-Wham! days, though the exact date is unknown.
Local scout chairman, Michael Duffy, described the hut as a "music history landmark" and hopes a commemorative plaque can be installed.
He said: "Interestingly, the stage is still pretty much as it was when George performed on it and we want to keep it just as it is.
"The building is 60 years old and we've already invested £15,000 to make sure it lasts another 60 years.
"We need a further £5,000 to do more work on its grounds."
Mr Duffy is also the owner of The Three Crowns pub in Bushey where the four members of Wham! met and formed the group in 1981.
George Michael and Andrew Ridgley met at Bushey Meads School and discovered a mutual interest in music.
The pair - with backing singers, Pepsi and Shirlie - had a string of hits, which won them thousands of fans.
Michael went on to have a total of seven UK number one singles as a solo artist - including A Different Corner and Jesus to a Child - and the same number of chart-topping albums.
Michael died of natural causes at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on Christmas Day, aged 53. His funeral took place on Wednesday.
The coroner's verdict on his death only came three weeks ago. Tests were ordered because an initial post-mortem examination was "inconclusive".
Darren Salter, senior coroner for Oxfordshire, said the star had heart and liver disease.
