Election 2015: UKIP Wales appoints new national organiser

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP Wales has appointed a new national organiser, three days into the general election campaign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Haigh replaces John Atkinson, who said he was standing down as the workload had increased alongside the party's "success and profile".
UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said the change would have no impact on the party as Mr Haigh had already been the deputy national organiser.
Both Mr Haigh and Mr Atkinson are standing for UKIP at the poll in May.
Mr Atkinson is fighting Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire alongside Delyth Evans (Labour), Simon Hart (Conservative), Selwyn Runnett (Liberal Democrat), Gary Tapley (Green Party) and Elwyn Williams (Plaid Cymru).
Mr Haigh will contest Aberconwy with Victor Babu (Liberal Democrat), Guto Bebb (Conservative), Petra Haig (Green Party), Dafydd Meurig (Plaid Cymru) and Mary Wimbury (Labour).
