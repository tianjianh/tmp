Cohen, 29, missed Forest's 2-0 win over Ipswich on Saturday after sustaining the problem in a training session.
He has had a number of fitness issues in recent years, including a knee injury suffered in September 2014 which kept him out for 15 months.
The former West Ham trainee joined Forest from Yeovil in 2007 and has made 292 appearances for the club.
