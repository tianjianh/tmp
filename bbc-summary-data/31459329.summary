Afridi and seven team-mates were punished after returning to their hotel in Sydney on Saturday 45 minutes late.
"There are restaurants that have clubs inside them - nothing happened, we went for food then came back," all-rounder Afridi told BBC Urdu.
The group, including Ahmed Shehzad, were reportedly fined Â£150.
"When you have no news to show, they spread these kind of rumours to get attention from people," added Afridi.
"Nothing happened that night. We went for dinner - we are in Australia, not in [Pakistani cities] Thatta or Larkana," the all-rounder continued.
Pakistan take on neighbours and arch rivals India in Adelaide on Sunday.

They are looking to break a run that has seen them fail to win a World Cup match against India in five attempts, since their first game at the 1992 tournament, also held in Australia and New Zealand.
Pakistan won their final warm-up game against England by four wickets and Afridi - who will retire from ODIs after this year's World Cup - says his team are still looking to improve.
"When you are playing in such a big event, where you are up against the best teams of the world, you always try to find the weaker points in yourself and you try to improve on them.
"I wouldn't say that we are 100% prepared, but we are as ready as we will ever be.
"Having said that, in such a big event you should be 100% ready, because cricket has become much more competitive than before. The other teams are all out to win.
"Whatever your weak points are, whether it's batting, fielding or bowling, you work on these as soon as possible."
