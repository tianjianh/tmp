It is the second time that the Mica Day Centre, in the Beechmount area, has been disrupted in the past year.
Last summer, it had to close temporarily for safety reasons after a large bonfire was built nearby.
Kate O'Halloran, the mother of one of the people who use the centre, said something needed to be done.
"The centre needs to be protected. It's vital for the people who use it," she said.
"The least we can ask for is that the people using the centre - and the staff - should feel safe."
The centre is attended by about 40 people with learning difficulties.
There has been a rise in anti-social behaviour in the area in recent weeks.
Police say fire damage to the gates at the weekend cost approximately £2,000 to £3,000.
Inspector Alan Swann said: "I would appeal to anyone who may have noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact police on the non-emergency number 101.
"Or, if someone would prefer to provide information without giving their details, they can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers and speak to them anonymously on 0800 555 111."
A spokesperson for Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said: "While there was some disruption, Mica continued with the usual day care provision.
"It would appear that the gates were out of commission on Monday. They were repaired by lunchtime yesterday."
