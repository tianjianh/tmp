British and Irish Lions gameplan 'in infancy' as tourists prepare for Blues encounter

The British and Irish Lions gameplan is still "in its infancy", according to attack coach Rob Howley, as the tourists prepare for Wednesday's game against the Blues (08:35 BST).

After a scrappy win over the Provincial Barbarians, the Lions play the first of five matches versus high-quality Super Rugby opposition.
"Clearly our game isn't fully in place yet, as you saw by the performance at the weekend, said Howley.
"We know we need to improve."
Head coach Warren Gatland has been in bullish mood this week, defending himself against criticism of his supposedly direct 'Warrenball' tactics.
And Howley said the Lions training had been focusing on bringing "southern hemisphere-style rugby chaos" to their game.
"That's how the majority of international sides play now, from chaos," Howley said.
"The players are enjoying the speed and intensity in training. We have to adapt and play what we see. The one thing the players have really enjoyed is rugby chaos, it's very unstructured."
Following the Auckland clash, the Lions face a Crusaders side - unbeaten in 2017 - in Christchurch on Saturday (08:35 BST).
Inevitably Gatland has picked a whole new starting XV, with Ken Owens given the honour of the captaincy, while there are familiar combinations in the second row, at half-back and in the midfield.
Kiwi-born Ulster back Jared Payne plays against former Blues teammates as he makes his Lions debut, six years after leaving New Zealand for Belfast.
The Blues come fully-loaded, with eight All Blacks in the starting XV.

Despite his reputation as a hard-nosed, no-nonsense character, Gatland has long been sensitive about suggestions his sides can only play in a certain way.
The Kiwi points to his trophy-laden spells at Waikato and Wasps as proof of his flexibility, while he believes his style with Wales has suited the players at his disposal.
But while a power-based game - with an onus on winning the physical battle - is likely to be the best way to take on New Zealand, a cutting edge will be required against teams certain to score points.

One game in, and the pressure has already been cranked up on Gatland, while his opposite number on Wednesday, Tana Umaga, has also had to field uncomfortable questions this week.
Umaga led the All Blacks to a sensational 3-0 whitewash of the Lions in 2005, but his involvement was mired in controversy after his dangerous tackle put Brian O'Driscoll out of the Test series; the Blues boss will hope the conversation come Wednesday evening will solely be focused on an historic victory for his side.
Lions coach Warren Gatland: "These players are being encouraged to demonstrate their level of skill. Hopefully we can show that on Wednesday, and the players can show what they are being encouraged by the coaches to do."
Blues boss Tana Umaga on 2005: "It's not about that time now, that was 12 years ago. If people can't put that behind them then I suppose they never will. It's about this group now, and their time against the Lions, and the memories they make. Hopefully they are positive ones."
