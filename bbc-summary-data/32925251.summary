McAleer and Rushe, based in Cookstown, is one of Northern Ireland's biggest property firms.
It intends to start construction this autumn with the developments being ready for the intake of students in summer 2017.
One of the schemes will also include a 206-bedroom 4-star hotel.
It will be located on McClintock Street and Blackstaff Square.
These are the latest in a series of plans for student flats in the city centre which have been sparked by the development of a new campus by Ulster University.
The first McAleer and Rushe scheme will involve demolishing the 1960s Belfast Metropolitan College building on McClintock Street.
The second scheme is planned for a site on College Avenue that has been vacant for more than a decade.
Property director of McAleer and Rushe, Stephen Surphlis, said they were "large scale developments and investment projects which underpin our confidence in Belfast".
He said the company had significant experience in the student accommodation sector elsewhere in the UK.
There are currently at least 3,600 student flats planned for Belfast city centre, mainly around the new university campus.
The majority of those do not yet have planning permission.
The first of the new purpose built student flats, a small scheme at Mark Royal House on Donegall Street, is due to completed by August.
