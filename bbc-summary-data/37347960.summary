The Candystripes were drawn to face Stephen Kenny's side at Oriel Park when the draw for the semi-finals was made on Tuesday morning.
The last four tie will be played on Sunday 2 October.
"It's a difficult draw for us and we're going to be up against it but we expect to give a good account of ourselves," said Derry manager Kenny Shiels.
"They have a massive squad but we have good players and will be up for the game," the Derry boss told BBC Radio Foyle.
Derry reached the semi-finals by beating Wexford Youths in the last eight on Friday night.
The Brandywell club have appeared in 10 finals to date, winning five of them.
St Patrick's Athletic will host Cork City in the other semi-final, with the final scheduled to be staged on Sunday 6 November.
Dundalk are 10 points clear at the top of the League of Ireland Premier Division and are taking part in the group stages of the Europa League.
Derry lie third in the league table, with 13 wins from the 26 matches they have played so far in the campaign.
Dean Shiels, son of Derry boss Kenny, is currently part of the Dundalk squad, having recently signed for the club.
