A photographer has set out to challenge "formulaic" depictions of the Peak District with an exhibit celebrating the area's limestone quarries.

Colin Shaw, 65, from Eyam, Derbyshire, has produced works focusing on the industrial side of the national park.
Rather than being a blight on the landscape, Mr Shaw said, quarries possess a "stark beauty" with "line and form" hidden within.
His work can be seen at Buxton Museum and Art Gallery from Saturday.
Mr Shaw, a former photojournalist, said the quarries are often seen as undesirable by visitors to the area, despite being viewable from public footpaths.
"People go to the Peak District to take pictures and there's usually a formula, there's no people, there's a nice golden light, it's a pristine landscape," he said.
"But the area has been worked in some way for thousands of years.
"I just think traditional landscape photographers miss something - the land is shaped and defined by human beings."
Mr Shaw argues that the working aspects of the national park are denied and viewed as unsightly.
"If you can get past thoughts of 'that looks ugly' you can find line and form," he said.
"I'm not advocating the destruction of the landscape. The landscape is what we made it. It doesn't negate having an emotional attachment.
"The [building] material has to come from somewhere."
Villager Jim, whose bucolic pictures of the Peak District, have been liked thousands of times on Facebook agrees with Mr Shaw.
"For me man-made stuff can fit in well with landscapes but so many people do overlook it," said the photographer, who prefers not to reveal his real name.
"The example that springs to mind is the cement factory in Hope; for me it's as though it should be part of the landscape, living and breathing just like the trees and the people, giving life to the area."
The Quarried exhibition will be shown at Buxton Museum and Art Gallery, until 10 April 2016.
