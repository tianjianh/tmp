The Bayern Munich player was not hurt but appeared shaken after the incident early in the second half, which forced play to be stopped for several minutes.
The match in Bucharest was also interrupted for a minute at the end of the first half after fans threw flares and firecrackers on to the pitch.
Poland won the Group E match 3-0.
Rennes forward Kamil Grosicki's fine solo goal put the group leaders in front after 11 minutes.
The two delays followed as the home crowd grew restless before Lewandowski made sure of the win late on, scoring with a composed finish in the 82nd minute before adding a third from the penalty spot in injury time.
Unbeaten Poland top the group on 10 points after four matches. Montenegro, on seven points, remain in second place despite suffering their first defeat of the campaign in Armenia.
