Caroline Aherne, who has died at the age of 52, created some of the best-loved comedy characters in recent years. We take a look back at some of her memorable moments.

Among Aherne's first characters on the Manchester stand-up comedy circuit were country singer Mitzi Goldberg and a nun called Sister Mary Immaculate, whose ambition was to kiss the Pope's ring.
She found national fame with her spoof chat show The Mrs Merton Show in the mid 1990s.
The grey-haired, bespectacled Mrs Merton's seemingly innocent - but actually razor sharp - questions to celebrities of the day became the stuff of TV legend.

(To legendary footballer and long-time alcoholic George Best)
(To the daughter of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher)
(To sprinter Kris Akabusi)
(To Carry On and EastEnders actress Barbara Windsor)
One of her most famous characters on The Fast Show was Poula Fisch, a weather presenter for the fictional Channel 9 where the weather was only ever 45 degrees and:
She also starred as the checkout girl on the show, commenting on customers' purchases:
And as chatterbox Renee alongside John Thompson, who played her long-suffering husband Roy:
As Denise Royle, she spent much of her time engaged in bickering with - and talking about - the other members of the Royle family.
But there were also many touching moments, as well as the day-to-day of family life - such as mum Barbara frequently asking what everyone has had for dinner.
When she wasn't in character, Aherne spoke candidly about her life, and her struggles with depression and ill health.
At a speech at a conference to improve cancer care in Manchester, she said:
She was less forthcoming about her father, an alcoholic, but did tell the Independent newspaper in 1999 that he was in part the inspiration for the character of Jim Royle, the dad in The Royle Family:
In a behind-the-scenes documentary about The Royle Family, Aherne talked about her typical working day with co-writer Craig Cash.
