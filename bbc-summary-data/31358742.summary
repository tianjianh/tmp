The 33-year-old, capped seven times by England, has made 179 appearances during six years at Franklin's Gardens.
Warriors have also agreed a deal for another flanker Carl Kirwan to join from London Welsh in the summer.
"We are continuing to build a side which can progress season after season," said Warriors boss Dean Ryan.
"To be able to attract a player of Phil's calibre to be at the centre of that journey is a huge coup for the club. What we've done over the last couple of weeks is a significant step.
"Phil's leadership qualities have been a crucial component of the success Northampton have experienced in recent seasons and his presence at Sixways will be huge for the development of this young side. He is one of the best around at being able to influence successful environments."
The former Newcastle and England forward, said only last month that he had been "hopeful" of agreeing a new deal with Saints.
Kirwan, who used to combine his rugby with a job as a North Sea scaffolder, joined London Welsh from Rotherham in 2013. He scored eight tries in their successful promotion to the Premiership last season.
"We chased Carl last year," added Ryan. "But we weren't successful in getting him. We have others to come and we're really excited about the balance that we've got."
Worcester are top of the Championship table, one point ahead of Bristol, having won 13 of their 14 league matches so far this season  .
