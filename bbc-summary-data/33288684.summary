Saidy Janko: Celtic to sign Man Utd defender, subject to medical

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic have completed the signing of right-back Saidy Janko from Manchester United subject to a medical.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old Switzerland Under-19 international, who was out of contract with the English Premier League club, has agreed a four-year deal.
Celtic hope Janko, for whom they will pay United a compensation fee, will complete his medical on Thursday.
Janko spent the end of last season on loan at Bolton Wanderers with former Celtic boss Neil Lennon.
As well as right-back, he can also play as a central defender or a right-sided midfielder.
After joining United from FC Zurich in 2013, Janko made his senior debut in a League Cup defeat by MK Dons in August.
He subsequently made 10 appearances for Bolton, scoring on his debut in Wanderers' win over Fulham in February.
Janko becomes Celtic's second summer signing, central defender Dedryck Boyata having arrived from Manchester City.
Celtic have also had a bid for striker Nadir Ciftci rejected by Dundee United.
