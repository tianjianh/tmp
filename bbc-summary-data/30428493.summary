A charity in Bristol is hoping to inspire people to help make the city more wildlife-friendly.

Avon Wildlife Trust has published a series of maps which show the best places to create habitat-linking routes between gardens and other green spaces.
The map has been produced using aerial photography and more than 200 other sources of data including soil quality.
Bevis Watts, from the charity, hopes it will create a "nature-rich city" that attracts wildlife "to our doorsteps".
"By transforming Bristol into a nature reserve, we can give everyone the opportunity to experience wildlife every day, for their own health and wellbeing," he added.
The maps, which can be downloaded from the charity's website, can be zoomed into street level and a colour key identifies areas which can be adopted to help wildlife.
It also suggests ideas for gardens with little or no green space.
Broadcaster Simon King, who is also the trust's president, said the project would help Bristol's green credentials.
"By restoring nature to the city's gardens and green spaces, Bristol could lead the way in a groundswell of positive action that could be echoed in other towns and cities across the UK and the rest of the world," Mr King added.
