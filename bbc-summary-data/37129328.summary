A £500,000 fund has been set up to encourage people and businesses to move to Argyll and Bute.

The money will go to help businesses, young people and young families who are relocating or returning to the area.
It is one of four regions of Scotland to record a falling population in the last census.
A report by council officials said economically-active young people aged 18 and over could apply for a rent subsidy of up to £5,000.
Small and medium-sized businesses would be eligible for up to a total of £10,000, split between a grant and relocation package.
The report indicated economically-active young families relocating to the region would be in line for £5,000 made up of a relocation package and council tax subsidy.
Councillors approved the Rural Resettlement Fund (RRF) at a meeting on Thursday.
Councillor Aileen Morton said: "Argyll and Bute is recognised as being one of the most promising areas in Scotland, we want people to come here and by promoting the fund we are letting everyone know that there is help available to take up career opportunities or build a successful business here."
