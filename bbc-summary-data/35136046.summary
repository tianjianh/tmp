Officers spoke to 51-year-old Andy Hill at a police station in Hertfordshire.
Police, who did not name Mr Hill, said a man voluntarily attended an appointment and was "interviewed under caution but not arrested".
Mr Hill was performing aerobatics at the annual Shoreham show when the jet crashed and broke up.
An initial report after the incident found the jet showed "no abnormal indications" during its flight.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said cockpit footage showed the plane "responding to the pilot's control inputs".
The jet split into four parts and Mr Hill was thrown clear. It is not known whether Mr Hill initiated his ejection.
After the crash, the pilot's family issued a statement which said they were devastated and deeply saddened by the loss of life and sent their prayers and heartfelt condolences to the families of all those affected.
