[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Comic fans would have already been more than familiar with Black Panther ahead of Marvel announcing plans to release a big screen adaptation.

But what about the man who will bring the character to life?
Chadwick Boseman will first appear in Captain America: Civil War in 2016, before taking on the lead role in Black Panther the following year.
The 38-year-old's first major credit on screen was as a reporter called Reginald "Reggie" Porter Montgomery.
That was in long-running US soap opera All My Children in 2003.
From there, he went on to make appearances as an extra in a string of shows including Law & Order, CSI and - as many up and coming actors before him - ER.
The athleticism needed for his Marvel roles shouldn't be too much of an issue based on his experience in sport-based films The Express, Draft Day and 42.
His most recent role as James Brown in Get On Up also confirmed the man's got moves, as well as giving him a solid slab of critical acclaim and a taste of being on set with A-listers Dan Aykroyd and singer Jill Scott.
Taking on Black Panther will see him acting alongside Robert Downey Jr (Iron Man) and Chris Evans (Captain America).
Speaking at the Marvel launch in Hollywood, Boseman said: "I'm blessed to be a part of this Marvel Universe."
Although no details were given about the plot of Black Panther, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige suggested the character has the potential to become a large part of the Marvel franchise.
He said: "He's a bit of a prince, he may even become a bit of a king."
Real Name: T'Challa
Height: 6'
Weight: 200 lbs
Powers: T'Challa's senses and physical attributes have been enhanced to superhuman levels by the heart-shaped herb.
Abilities: Marvel describes Black Panther as "a brilliant tactician, strategist, scientist, tracker and a master of all forms of unarmed combat whose unique hybrid fighting style incorporates acrobatics and aspects of animal mimicry".
Back story: T'Challa is a royal descendent of a warrior race who "will go to extreme measures to achieve his goals and protect the kingdom of Wakanda".
