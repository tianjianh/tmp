[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ayr United and Dundee United fought out a goalless Scottish Championship draw that clinched the Tangerines a play-off place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Referee Crawford Allan was replaced by fourth official Grant Irvine after getting injured in the first half.
Gary Harkins threatened in both halves for the hosts, including a late effort deflected on to the crossbar.
Thomas Mikkelsen and William Edjenguele had chances for the visitors, with Mikkelsen having a goal chalked off.
The result leaves bottom side Ayr three points adrift of Dumbarton.
As for the third-placed Tangerines, they can finish no lower than fourth. The Tannadice side open up a two-point gap over Greenock Morton and remain a point behind Falkirk on the day leaders Hibernian secured the title and promotion to next season's Premiership.
Harkins raced away from his marker only to see his shot saved by Cammy Bell early on.
The match was then subject to a short delay after referee Allan came into collision with Ayr's Paul Cairney and was eventually replaced by Irvine.
Mikkelsen tested Greg Fleming in the home goal with a shot from eight yards and the Danish forward was then frustrated to have his header into the net disallowed for a foul.
Tony Andreu curled a shot past the Ayr post before Stewart Murdoch brought a good save from Fleming as the Tangerines continued to press.
Ayr started the second period well and Craig McGuffie's free-kick was saved by Bell, who also denied Nicky Devlin by tipping over on the hour mark.
Mikkelsen and Edjenguele nodded narrowly off target and, at the other end, Ross Docherty hit a 20-yard strike that Bell did well to punch away.
Harkins' 20-yard shot from a set piece took a nick before crashing on to the crossbar to end a frustrating evening for both sides.
Ayr United manager Ian McCall: "We are certainly still in it with another three clubs, but I felt we deserved three points.
"I am very pleased with how we played and the togetherness the whole club showed, but I am gutted we did not take three points.
"I'll have a look at the league after we play Morton next week, but for us it is two points lost. Dundee United are a good side and I wish them well in the play-offs because the Premier League is better with Dundee United in it.
"At this time of the season it does not matter who you play whether it is Hibs or Dundee United or Dumbarton or St Mirren, it is all about winning and getting the points and that is why I am frustrated."
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "I am a bit frustrated. We had chances in the first half, but took the wrong decision at times. However, the point got us the play-offs which was a target at the start of the season, so I am happy with that.
"Now we can focus on the last three games, try to win them and hopefully finish second. We have two good home games coming up so we can give ourselves a chance.
"Hibernian have a great depth in their squad and some serious good football players at their club, while we are just on the back of relegation, so over all we have done well to hang on to their coat tails for so long and congratulations to them.
"We are still trying to improve the squad at Tannadice but the depth in squad has been the key factor in Hibs winning the title."
