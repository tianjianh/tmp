[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Injured scrum-half Rhys Webb is to have ankle surgery and will be out of action until the New Year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old has been released from the Wales squad to Ospreys.
He was taken off after turning his right ankle during the 32-8 defeat by Australia.
The Ospreys player missed much of the 2015-16 season after damaging ankle and knee ligaments playing for Wales against Italy in a pre-World Cup match.
A Welsh Rugby Union statement read: "It is expected that Webb will undertake a period of rehabilitation of at least 12 weeks."
In Webb's absence, Scarlets' Gareth Davies starts against Argentina on Saturday.
Scarlets scrum-half Davies is one of six Wales changes for the match at Principality Stadium.
In addition to Argentina, Wales face Japan and South Africa in Cardiff before the end of November.
