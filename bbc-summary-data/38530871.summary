Rebecca Williams, 24, remains in a serious condition after being injured in the Milngavie fire that killed 23-year-old Cameron Logan on 1 January.
Police are treating the case as murder and attempted murder.
Phillip Williams thanked well-wishers for their support but said there had been no change in Rebecca's condition.
In a Facebook posting Mr Williams wrote: "Thanks for all the thoughts and wishes. No real change yet but I will try to put up news when I can. She's fighting hard."
Ms Williams, a broadcast journalist with Global Radio, was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow following the fire at the property in Achray Place.
A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow said: "Rebecca's condition remains serious but stable."
Police Scotland are continuing their investigations into the fire, which killed Cameron Logan and also resulted in his parents being treated for smoke inhalation.
The family dog also died.
Officers were seen searching woodland and waterways near the semi-detached property on Friday.
Det Ch Insp Paul Livingstone said officers were still attempting to trace people who were seen in the area around the time of the incident.
He said: "We would like to thank those individuals who have come forward and provided police with information.
"We continue to seek information on the dark-coloured car that reportedly had its engine running at the layby on Craigton Road and we would continue to ask anyone with information to come forward.
"A number of local residents have now come forward with the belief that they may have been the dog walkers previously described. We do know that there were a number of individuals walking dogs around the time of the incident, so please continue to contact us if you believe you have information which may help our inquiry."
Officers have also received a report of a man walking on the West Highland Way near the area around the time of the fire. He is described as wearing Army combat clothing.
It is believed the man routinely walks from Maryhill to the West Highland Way at Craigton Road, often passing through the Milngavie area. Police said it was possible that he may also have information which may assist the ongoing inquiry.
Ms Williams and Mr Logan had been celebrating Hogmanay and walked home in the early hours of the morning.
Detectives said the fire had been set deliberately, resulting in the death of psychology student Mr Logan.
Since then, officers have also been carrying out door-to-door inquires, checking CCTV footage and interviewing people from the party which the couple attended.
