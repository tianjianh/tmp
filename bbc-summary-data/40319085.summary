Saturday was the hottest day of the year so far, with the mercury peaking at 30.2C (86.36F) in Teddington, south-west London, the Met Office said.
Forecaster Charles Powell said Sunday and Monday would be the same.
He said there would be a lot of "dry, sunny, warm, humid weather with high UV, high pollen".
The high temperatures are due to warm, humid air originating from the tropical Atlantic, with the south and south-east of England and Greater London predicted to experience highs of 32C (89.6F) on Sunday and 33C (91.4F) on Monday, about 10C (18F) above the usual average for this time of year.
However, some northern parts of Scotland saw some rain on Sunday and were due to have more on Monday.
The Met Office said "a wedge of really hot air" would blow over from France on Thursday, with temperatures in eastern and southern England predicted to climb as high as 34C.
The strength of the UV in some spots has been recorded as being as high as that in Cyprus and Gibraltar.
"All throughout this period we will have some pretty mild uncomfortable nights - a lot of places in the mid to high teens for night-time temperatures," Mr Powell said.
The weather is expected to remain dry in the lead-up to the Glastonbury Festival next weekend with a 20% chance of "isolated showers" on Wednesday and Thursday.
"It is mainly going to be dry, looking at the whole event," the Met Office said.
"Wednesday, Thursday and Friday look dry with good spells of sunshine.
However, the Met Office predicts "cooler and fresher" temperatures on Saturday and Sunday with a mixture of sunny spells and showers.
Public Health England (PHE) has issued a heat health warning.
Spokesman Dr Thomas Waite said: "For some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, the summer heat can bring real health risks.
"That's why we're urging everyone to keep an eye on those you know who may be at risk this summer."
