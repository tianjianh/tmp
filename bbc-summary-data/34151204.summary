A trader placed his market tent around a car after it was illegally parked in the middle of his plot.

The incongruous sight greeted shoppers at Ringwood Market in Hampshire.
Passerby Brian Case said: "I actually passed it and saw a car in a market stall. It was only when I walked to the post box and walked back that I realised what I'd seen."
One of the town's traffic wardens presented the beleaguered car with a parking ticket.
Mr Case said: "At one point there was an elderly lady looking at the clothes and not even looking at the car."
He added that none of the clothes rails were touching the car, which appeared to be completely unscathed.
The car was still in situ after the stall came down at about 15:00 BST on Wednesday.
Market organiser Edward Morant told the Bournemouth Echo the car was a "nuisance".
"The trader was not in the least bit happy," he added.
