South Korea's outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is "large and complex" and more cases are expected, World Health Organization experts say.

But while it was premature to declare the outbreak over, the WHO said it had "found no evidence" of the Mers virus spreading wider in the community.
About 140 people have been infected since the start of the outbreak last month. Fourteen are known to have died.
Experts also urged the South Korean government to stay vigilant.

How South Korea is coping with outbreak
Speaking in Seoul after a week-long investigation, the WHO's Keiji Fukuda said: "Because the outbreak has been large and is complex, more cases should be anticipated."
He added: "At present the mission has found no evidence that there is ongoing transmission within the community."
All of South Korea's cases have been linked to health facilities, but the WHO urged the government to continue to maintain strong control measures, thoroughly tracing infected people's contacts and preventing suspected patients from travelling.
A number of factors may have contributed to the spread of the disease in South Korea so far, the WHO said, including:
About 2,900 schools were closed and 3,680 people were isolated as of Friday after possible contacts with those infected.
Earlier this week, South Korea's central bank cut interest rates to a record low in a move seen as an attempt to stem the economic fallout from the outbreak  in Asia's fourth largest economy, which was first reported last last month.
The outbreak is the largest outside Saudi Arabia, where the disease was first identified in humans in 2012.
