One Direction, Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith and Ella Henderson will all be performing.
Four awards will be handed out; British Artist of the Year; International Artist of The Year; Song of The Year; and BBC Introducing Act of the Year.
But with the Brits and the Grammys fast approaching, where does this new event fit in?
We asked the man in charge of it all, Bob Shennan, Director of Music at the BBC.
"It's an opportunity for the BBC to reflect on the sheer volume, range, diversity and amount of music content that we do on radio and television every single year.
"It's also an opportunity for us to reflect on 2014 - which has been a phenomenal year across all our outlets and celebrate the year in music.
"A little bit like Sports Personality of the Year is a reflection of the year through the prism of the BBC sport, that's what we want to do in music and it's another chance for us to get top class popular music on BBC1."
"Well I think the Brits is a great show and I hope this will compliment it. I hope there is room for two big events in the musical calendar.
"This is about the year through the eyes of the BBC and the ears of BBC, so there are going to be particular things to do with the BBC Music Awards that frankly no other broadcaster is going to be able to offer to the public."
"Well like BBC Introducing. There will be an award for a BBC Introducing act.
We will be showcasing BBC Introducing, Catfish and The Bottlemen will be performing on the night and sharing the stage on BBC One, in peak time, with the likes of One Direction and Coldplay.
"So it is a big opportunity for them. I think it's really important that we give ourselves the opportunity to reflect on that and to reflect on all the amazing output, live and otherwise the BBC's offered to audiences this year."
"This is as much about reflecting on the year, as it is about handing out gongs.
"We think British Artist, International Artist, Song of the Year are the big ones.
Clean Bandit - Rather Be
Coldplay - A Sky Full of Stars
Ed Sheeran - Sing
Ella Henderson - Ghost
George Ezra - Budapest
Kiesza - Hideaway
Lorde - Royals
Nico & Vinz - Am I Wrong
Pharrell - Happy
Sam Smith - Money On My Mind
"In a way I don't think it really matters, I think what matters is the overall story of the night, I think we're going to get a fantastic range (of performances), we're going to get incredible quality (of music) and we're going to get a show that is on the two biggest radio stations in Europe."
"The long list, for the shortlist, was compiled according to the airplay on BBC services during the course of the past twelve months.
Then it was given to a very considerable number of BBC presenters, music decision makers, plus some external experts, who we asked to join us in the voting process.
"Then there was a straightforward vote.
"So there wasn't a sort of carve up around the table, the six who were nominated were the six who got the most number of votes from people who we consider to be the experts.
"I mean equally in the international (category) it's 50/50 split between men and women.
But I think when you look at the calibre and the range of artists - you get a really impressive shortlist."
"It's the way the voting has fallen, I mean there are some incredible, brilliant artists who are going to be performing on the night, so where we've been able to select from the broad range of artists available to the BBC, we've made sure there is a proper representation that reflects the interests of all the audience.
"It is the way it is, we're not fixing anything, we're not distorting anything, we're not sitting around a table saying we need to have this person in order to make it look balanced, we're just offering to the audience what our experts say should be the shortlist."
"I think to begin with we want to put on a really good, high quality show that we know people have an appetite for and we hope that they come to it and really enjoy it.
"If that then means we can develop an annual event where the BBC reflects on the year in music and joins up across all of our big channels and stations then I think that will be wonderful."
"It would be lovely if there were but they have got to work for the audiences and they have got to work for the channels.
"We're giving everything to this show to try and make it a success but it's not easy in television terms to just conjure up successes.
"If this is something that proves to be of appeal to the audience and then maybe there'll be something else we can develop but everything has got to earn it's right, it's an incredibly competitive environment and music has no divine right, we will need to earn it."
The full coverage of the BBC Music Awards will be broadcast across BBC One, Radio 1 and Radio 2 on Thursday 11 December
