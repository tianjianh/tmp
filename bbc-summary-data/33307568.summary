James "Geordie" Chance, from Northern Ireland, was killed when the bus carrying 34 Brentwood School pupils crashed on a motorway on Sunday.
Two boys remain in hospital in Belgium. One of them, aged 13, is in intensive care with a head injury.
Several pupils travelled back to the UK late on Sunday night on a coach arranged by the school.
"The coach returning the remaining pupils and staff has just arrived at school safely," tweeted Brentwood School head Ian Davies.
"Thoughts and prayers still with two pupils in hospital," he added.
The Belgian authorities are working to establish details of the accident, which happened on the A18 (E40) at Middelkerke, West Flanders. Eyewitnesses said the bus crashed into a motorway bridge pillar.
One of the injured boys, 12, is being treated for a broken leg at a hospital in Bruges.
Other students, a number of whom were treated for cuts, bruising and swelling, were picked up by their parents who travelled to Belgium.
Mr Chance was believed to have been sitting in the coach's courier seat when the vehicle crashed at 09:45 local time (08:45 BST).
The BBC has been told he was a grandfather of five.
It is understood a second man from Northern Ireland was seriously injured.
