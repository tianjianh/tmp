[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shaun Byrne's late winner extended Livingston's lead in Scottish League One to nine points as Peterhead lost 3-2 at Balmoor.

Declan Gallagher, making his first start in his second spell at Livi following a prison term, opened the scoring with a thumping 50th-minute header but Peterhead equalised immediately when Nicky Riley timed his run perfectly to nod home.
The league leaders responded straight away with Liam Buchanan slotting in from an angle.
Danny Mullen then struck a post and the visitors were pegged back once again by Rory McAllister's close-range finish.
Buchanan, who had a first-half penalty saved, got on the end of a terrible back-pass and netted but was controversially flagged offside before Byrne had the last word with his 79th-minute strike.
Alloa Athletic moved up to second after coming from behind to beat Stranraer 2-1, Iain Flannigan and Jon Robertson scoring after Craig Thomson had headed the hosts ahead.
Albion Rovers and East Fife each claimed 1-0 home wins with Michael Dunlop scoring for Rovers against Brechin City, who dropped a place to fourth, and Scott Robinson netting for the Fifers in their meeting with Stenhousemuir.
At Hampden, Airdrieonians lost to Queen's Park and slipped to third with Ryan McGeever firing the winner for the Spiders in their 2-1 win. Gregor Fotheringham's shot had put them ahead before Airdrie levelled through Iain Russell's header.
Queen's Park are now a point below the play-off zone, while at the bottom Stenny remain two points adrift of Stranraer and four behind Peterhead.
