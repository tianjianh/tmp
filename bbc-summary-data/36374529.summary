Victories against Belgium and Germany had turned Cardiff into a fortress but Wales needed to beat a talented Romanian side to qualify for USA '94.
Gheorghe Hagi opened the scoring after an uncharacteristic Neville Southall fumble in the Wales goal but Dean Saunders equalised for Wales.
As Wales poured forward, Romania conceded a penalty but designated taker Paul Bodin will be remembered in Welsh footballing folklore for all the wrong reasons as he hit his spot-kick against the bar with glory beckoning.
The home side never recovered from the crushing blow and Florin Raducioiu's late winner for Romania sealed a 2-1 win and shattered Welsh dreams once again.
