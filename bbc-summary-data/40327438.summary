A man who robbed and racially abused a shop worker before punching a police officer in the face has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Henderson walked into the Dundee store on 1 January and began destroying the shop displays.
He made off with a bag full of tobacco and scratchcards but was restrained by a passer-by and then arrested.
The 25-year-old, a prisoner at HMP Perth, admitted a range of charges and was jailed for one year and nine months.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard Henderson had pulled down a lottery scratchcard stand and a till in the Mauchline Avenue store before throwing groceries at shop worker Abdul Khaliq.
He racially abused Mr Khaliq and threatened to kill him, the court was told.
When the police arrived to arrest him he punched police officer Richard Price in the face and threatened to kill the children of three other officers.
Henderson pled guilty on indictment to charges of assault, robbery, behaving in a threatening and abusive manner and police assault.
The offences were committed while he was on two separate bail orders.
Defence solicitor Paul Parker Smith said: "There is a package available of sentences in the community - but he is under no illusions.
"He said he was 'pure disgusted' with himself when I spoke to him.
"He doesn't have an extensive or a particularly serious criminal record - but he appreciates these crimes merit a custodial sentence."
Sheriff Alastair Brown jailed Henderson and ordered that he be supervised for a year after his release.
He said: "The court will not tolerate threats and attacks on people at their work.
"It will not tolerate threats made against the families of police officers.
"I find no reason to depart from the obvious sentence - a prison sentence."
