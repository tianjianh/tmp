Loose Women cleared over Katie Price's son swearing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Loose Women has been cleared by Ofcom over an incident which saw Katie Price's disabled son, Harvey, swear live on air.

In a segment highlighting cyber-bullying in May, the 14-year-old swore in response to being asked what he said to people who were mean to him.
Ofcom said airing the swearword before the watershed was a breach of rules.
However as ITV followed compliance guidelines and immediately apologised, it considered the matter resolved.
ITV said it had protocols in place regarding language used on the lunchtime programme and guests are briefed before going on air.
The broadcaster added it considered "very carefully" whether Harvey - who is visually impaired, autistic and suffers from Prader-Willi syndrome - should appear in a pre-recorded interview, and production staff decided he could be interviewed live.
It said Price, who is also a panellist on the show, had told Harvey not to swear and rehearsed the questions prior to broadcast.
As he did not swear in rehearsal, the editorial team were therefore "satisfied that Harvey would deal with the interview well and did not anticipate the use of offensive language".
Ofcom noted the steps ITV had taken before transmission and said it took into account the programme was aimed at adults and aired during term time when the majority of children would be at school.
It said: "In light of all of these factors, Ofcom considered the matter resolved."
