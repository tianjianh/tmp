[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rezgar Zengana posed as a taxi driver to pick up his 25-year-old victim in Argyle Street before raping her at a flat in Cessnock on 10 December 2006.
The 33-year-old Iraqi national fled after being convicted of the attack.
Zengana features in a most-wanted list of nine UK suspects who are thought to be in the Netherlands.
The list has been put published by the UK charity Crimestoppers and the National Crime Agency (NCA).
Dave Allen, from the NCA, said: "Those who believe they can use the Netherlands to evade capture or continue illegal activities soon find out that it is not a safe haven."
