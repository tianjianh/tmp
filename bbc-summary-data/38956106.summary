British Transport Police and the ambulance service attended Kidwelly Railway Station after receiving a call at about 11:35 GMT on Monday.
They said the man died at the scene and the death is not believed to be suspicious.
The train line has since reopened, but Arriva Trains Wales warned its services may be delayed.
