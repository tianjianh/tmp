John Swift's free-kick gave the Royals a second-minute lead but the visitors levelled when Joey van den Berg headed a corner into his own net.
Anthony Knockaert's low drive put the Seagulls ahead straight after the break and Paul McShane made it 2-2 by converting Garath McCleary's pull-back.
Van den Berg was sent off late on for a second bookable offence.
Swift's opener, an inswinging ball which evaded everyone from a wide position on the left, was the first goal Brighton have conceded this season.
McCleary and Yann Kermorgant were constant threats as Jaap Stam's Royals dominated the opening period, with the Frenchman having a shot cleared off the line by Lewis Dunk and dragging another effort wide.
Brighton improved after the break but goalkeeper David Stockdale made a reflex save to tip an overhead kick from Kermorgant behind and keep the scoreline at 2-2.
The visitors could not take advantage when Van den Berg, who had picked up a caution for dissent in the first half, was dismissed by referee Mike Jones with one minute remaining for pulling back Tomer Hemed.
Albion, who finished third last season, remain unbeaten but slipped to second after Huddersfield secured a late win over Barnsley.
Reading manager Jaap Stam: "In terms of energy and creating chances, I think we did very well. We controlled the game in the first half.
"After we came back to 2-2, we tried to go for the third goal. We tried to win the game, which is now in our nature. That's how we want to play.
"My philosophy of playing is that we want to play attractive and attacking football with a lot of possession. And that's what we did today. But we do make mistakes and that's what we need to get out of our system."
Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "I was especially disappointed with our first-half performance. For the levels that we've been at recently, I don't think we reached those levels in the first half.
"There's no particular reason for that. We've made a couple of changes and perhaps that rhythm wasn't there.
"Periods in the game became very open and I thought Reading did it better than us. At times, they looked more of a goal threat than us."
