Organisers want more police presence in Levenshulme, Manchester, following the attack on the 31-year-old at Cringle Park shortly before midday on Monday.
The march followed a similar event in the area after a 12-year-old girl was raped in a nearby park in September.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it had "increased patrols in the area" and was "doing everything in our power" to find Monday's attacker.
However Pauline Johnston, from the Love Levenshulme community group, said: "I don't think what they've done has been sufficient at all."
"We want patrols to be stepped up day in and day out, not just reactively."
One marcher said: "We work really hard to make it a beautiful place for everybody to share and we won't have people frightened out of it."
Another participant commented: "I don't think anyone should be scared to walk through their own park, especially in broad daylight."
