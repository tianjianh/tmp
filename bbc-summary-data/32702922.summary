The councillor in the local authority's Cromarty Firth ward was elected to head the council's SNP group at a meeting on Monday night.
She has to be confirmed as council leader at a full meeting of Highland Council in June.
Mr Hendry will continue as council leader until Monday but resigned as SNP group leader following his election as an SNP MP last week.
He was elected as the new MP for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, the seat previously held by Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander.
The SNP are the largest party in Highland Council's ruling administration which also involves the Lib Dems and Labour.
