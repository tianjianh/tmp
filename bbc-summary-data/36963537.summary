The Easyjet service from Edinburgh was bound for Funchal in Madeira on Monday but had to make an emergency landing in Lisbon.
The flight was met by police in the Portuguese capital and then made its way to Madeira.
It was delayed by about two hours. The passenger was found not to have a gun.
The airline has apologised for any inconvenience caused to passengers but stressed it takes such incidents seriously.
An Easyjet spokeswoman said: "Easyjet can confirm that flight EZY6957 from Edinburgh to Funchal on 1 August diverted to Lisbon and was met by police due to a passenger behaving disruptively.
"Easyjet's cabin crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time.
"Whilst such incidents are rare we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board and always push for prosecution.
"We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused."
