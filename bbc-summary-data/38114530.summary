[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol City 2-0 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol City ended a three-game losing run in the Championship with an impressive win over Ipswich Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Tomlin's penalty lit up a quiet first period after Tammy Abraham was brought down in the box by Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski.
David McGoldrick almost levelled the scores soon after half-time, but his low shot was pushed on to the post by Ipswich goalkeeper Frank Fielding.
Luke Freeman sealed the win with a spectacular volley from 25 yards.
The victory was just a second in eight league games for City and lifted the Robins up to 11th in the table, while Town drop to 16th.
Aden Flint felt he should have had a second penalty for City as he went down in the box five minutes after the first spot-kick, but referee Stuart Attwell waved away his protests.
Abraham had a chance to double the lead just before the break, but the 12-goal Chelsea loanee headed over the impressive Tomlin's cross.
After McGoldrick hit the post, Freeman came up with a goal of the season contender as he smashed home a left-foot volley from far outside the box into the bottom corner for his first goal at Ashton Gate.
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson:
"It was a sensational goal. It is a really difficult skill to get the ball to dip from the position Luke struck it.
"It was a really steady and professional team display, almost like an away performance. We have had to come from behind so often, but today we got ourselves in front and looked really solid.
"We haven't got what we deserved from recent games. Now we are three points off the play-offs and looking up the table again."
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"The difference between the teams was a penalty and a worldie. They started well, but we got to grips with that.
"We were on top when an unbelievable flying bomb hit the top corner of our net for the second goal. It was absolutely unstoppable.
"I have no complaints about our display. We need to be more effective in the final third, but other than that I felt we competed well against a good side."
