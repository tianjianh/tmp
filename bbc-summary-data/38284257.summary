[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hoffenheim 2-2 Borussia Dortmund

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Borussia Dortmund overcame the first-half dismissal of Marco Reus to draw at Hoffenheim, whose unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season extended to 15 games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Uth put Hoffenheim ahead inside three minutes, slotting in after Roman Weidenfeller rashly came off his line.
Mario Gotze equalised nine minutes later after Ousmane Dembele's run.
Sandro Wagner put the home side back in front before he struck the post in a passage of play that ended with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's dinked leveller.
Aubameyang's finish - coolly lifted over the goalkeeper, again from Dembele's pass - was his 16th goal in 15 Bundesliga games this season.
Reus' dismissal - the first of his career - came after two yellow cards, the second for a tug on Hoffenheim winger Nadiem Amiri in the 41st minute.
French striker Dembele was later taken off on a stretcher after a collision with Benjamin Hubner.
The point moves Hoffenheim up to third, while Dortmund are fifth.
Bayern Munich lead on goal difference from newly-promoted RB Leipzig. Bayern play at Darmstadt on Sunday, while Leipzig are at home to Hertha BSC on Saturday.
