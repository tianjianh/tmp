England v Australia: Teimana Harrison starts in third Test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton flanker Teimana Harrison will start for England in Saturday's third Test against Australia as Eddie Jones' men aim for a whitewash.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harrison, 23, who made his debut against Wales in May, replaces the injured James Haskell in Sydney.
The rest of the England 23 is unchanged with wing Jack Nowell fit to start after passing concussion protocols.
England beat Australia in both Brisbane and Melbourne to secure their first ever series win down under.
Wasps back-row Haskell performed impressively in those historic victories, but the Wasps player has failed to recover in time from a foot injury sustained in Saturday's 23-7 win in Melbourne.
England head coach Eddie Jones said: "You have to work extremely hard to earn an England cap so there was no temptation to make changes for the sake of change.
"Teimana has trained well throughout the tour and deserves his spot. He's an excellent defender and his robustness will be important to us at the start of the game."
England are unbeaten under Jones' tenure, winning all eight of their matches in 2016, sealing a first Grand Slam since 2003 and moving from eighth in the world rankings to second.

Meanwhile, Australia have made three changes to their starting line-up.
Leicester-bound Matt Toomua replaces Samu Kerevi at inside centre, while Will Skelton partners Rob Simmons in the second row, meaning locks Rory Arnold and Sam Carter drop out.
Australia head coach Michael Cheika said the fit-again Toomua could have played in the second "but he needed more running in his legs".
Cheika added: "There's a long way to go yet in this season so I didn't want to burn him early. He's an experienced player, he plays in that role as second playmaker for us, so it was a logical choice."
