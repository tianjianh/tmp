[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Demand for knitted Tour de France bunting as souvenirs of the event in Cambridge has been so great, organisers have decided to "sell" it for charity.

Rad Wagon organised the knitting of 2,000 miniature jerseys which were hung in the streets for Monday's race.
"We've had requests for them from as far away as the USA so we've asked people to donate to charities. It'll be another great Tour legacy," he said.
Funds will go to Jimmy's, You Can Bike Too and Marie Curie.
Cycling instructor and non-knitter Mr Wagon was inspired to create the knitted bunting after seeing a similar project in Yorkshire.
More than 400 people took up their needles to knit over 2,000 miniature jerseys in Tour de France colours.
In addition, primary school pupils helped decorate some of the 40 wool-covered bicycle wheels hung along the route in Cambridge.
The bunting was taken down on Wednesday, and Mr Wagon and friends have been busy dealing with requests from individuals and organisations keen to have some.
"Almost everyone used their own materials, lots of wool was donated and everyone gave their time for free so of course we said they could have their jerseys back," Mr Wagon said.
"Then we started getting requests from people who had seen the bunting on television and the internet and wanted some as souvenirs because it looked so great.
"We picked our charities and have asked people if they would like to donate something. We're not selling it as such, just asking people if they'd like to help these causes."
Since publicising that on his CamBunting website, Mr Wagon said many of those who knitted the bunting had pledged donations as well.
"I'm humbled by the enthusiasm and fun exuded by everyone," he added.
