Among them is a dietician, physiologist, doctor, running partner, coaches, and logistical support.
The Welsh triathlete, who hopes to win a medal at the Olympics in Rio, said their help is vital.
"Any medal is not an individual victory, it is definitely a team medal," said Stanford, 27, who now lives in Leeds.
The former World triathlon champion added: "You are the person who has to go out and deliver the performance, but there is a whole team behind you that make it happen, from coaching and cooking to being there and being great friends.
"The hard work of a lot of people is transferred into my performance on the day."
