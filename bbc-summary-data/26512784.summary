Guernsey kerbside recycling suffers 'teething problems'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Despite some "teething problems" Guernsey's recycling officer was very pleased with the first day of kerbside collections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two-year scheme, introduced in a bid to increase household recycling, involves fortnightly collections.
Some residents have complained they have not received the information packs and bags needed.
Recycling officer Tina Norman-Ross said the problems would be looked at, but overall she was "very, very pleased".
She said they had hoped to reach all of the island's homes, about 26,000, but those who had been missed could email recycle@gov.gg to receive bags or information.
In response to complaints the bags were not strong enough Mrs Norman-Ross said they were slightly stronger than the industry standard in the UK.
She said the States had "only bought a year's worth" and it was one area they would review.
Under the scheme recycling is collected on the same day as rubbish bags, with paper and cardboard alternating with tins, cans, aerosols, plastic packaging, tin foil, aluminium takeaway containers and cartons.
It works slightly differently in the parishes of St Sampson and St Peter Port as both previously had two weekly rubbish collections.
In St Peter Port, the recyclables are collected along with one of the bin pick ups while in St Sampson the first rubbish collection has become for recycling only.
Glass is not being collected during the interim two-year scheme, but can be left at one of the bring bank sites.
Mrs Norman-Ross said: "We expect that islanders will adjust to the new routine with relative ease.
"We're hoping that those who have struggled to get to the bring banks in the past will welcome it.
"We are confident that we will see a real impact on Guernsey's overall recycling rate."
