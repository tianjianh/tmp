[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lilac Sky, based in Chelmsford, Essex, will manage academies to be built in Hailsham and Newhaven.
East Sussex County Council successfully applied to the government's Education Funding Agency for extra funding for the academies.
The new schools are scheduled to open in September 2015 and each will create 210 primary places.
The Lilac Sky Academy Trust already runs several academies and has worked with over 70 schools on projects with teachers and pupils.
Councillor Nick Bennett said: "We already commission Lilac Sky to provide support at some of our schools.
"Lilac Sky has a track record of offering outstanding provision, securing good outcomes for students and working closely with local communities."
