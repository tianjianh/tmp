[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arulchelvam Prasanna, 34, from Watford, was found with head injuries at a Costco store car park in the town last May and died 11 days later.
Patrick O'Driscoll, 33, of Purkiss Road, Hertford, has been charged with murder and James O' Driscoll, 45 of Hamlet Hill, Roydon, with manslaughter.
The pair were due to appear at Hatfield Remand Court earlier.
They have also been charged with two counts of conspiracy to steal from another.
Detectives believe the white Peugeot Partner van Mr Prasanna fell out of was being used in a crime.
They said it appeared Mr Prasanna got into the van after stopping at the Costco in his own silver Ford Transit van to buy cigarettes for his shops.
He later fell from the white van and was found unconscious by passers-by.
A third man arrested in connection with the case - Michael McInerney, 32, of no fixed address - is being sought by police after failing to return on police bail.
Three further men arrested as part of the investigation are due to answer bail on 18 May.
