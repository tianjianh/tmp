The animal was found in Bonnyrigg by dog walker John Stevenson on Saturday.
Stephanie McCrossan, of the Scottish SPCA, said: "Mr Stevenson had tried to make a ramp with lots of branches to enable the badger to free herself, but the drop was too steep.
"We eventually got a ladder to reach her."
She added: "I was able to catch her very easily and she managed to survive her ordeal unscathed.
"Due to her being so fit and healthy, I was able to release her straight back into the wild, where she can roam freely."
