Jane Bell got into difficulty at the Dalmeny Hotel in St Annes, Lancashire, in August 2014.
No trained lifeguard was on duty when the Scottish girl drowned while on holiday, her inquest was told.
The hotel's owners pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court to a health and safety offence and were ordered to pay costs of £19,715.
They admitted failing to protect the safety of guests under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.
The child, from Galashiels in the Scottish Borders, had been on holiday with her parents and six-year-old sister.
She was swimming in the hotel's main pool when she got into difficulty in the 7ft (2m) deep end.
Jane had been in the water for almost two minutes when former lifeguard and hotel guest Carole Greenwood dived in and brought her onto the poolside.
She later died in Royal Manchester Children's Hospital.
At the inquest into her death in March, the coroner Alan Wilson said he had concerns about the "risk of future deaths" and called for greater safety measures at the hotel.
The hearing was told that emergency response training for hotel staff began two months after the drowning.
The hotel said staff had "always sought guidance and advice from health and safety experts".
