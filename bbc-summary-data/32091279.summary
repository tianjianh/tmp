A police inquiry into the deaths of a Lithuanian couple found on the A47 in Norfolk has been closed.

Officers said they were "puzzled" by the deaths of Tadas Zaleskas, 26, and Nonita Karajevaite, 24, who died near Terrington St John on 20 July.
Ms Karajevaite's death was treated as suspicious following allegations she was forcibly pushed into the traffic.
A Norfolk police spokesman said: "Our inquiries are complete at this time."
He added: "The case has been passed to the coroner."
Both died when they were hit by a silver Kia car as they walked along the eastbound carriageway near Terrington St John at 14:15 BST.
At 13:20 they had both separately spoken to an assistant at Worzals Farm Shop and asked the staff member to call the police, but they left soon afterwards with no explanation. The police were not called.
The couple, originally from Lithuania, were engaged and lived in nearby Emneth.
