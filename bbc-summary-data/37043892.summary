East Midlands Airport closed by 'screw', report concludes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An incorrectly-fitted screw caused the closure of an international airport, an accident report has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flights from East Midlands Airport were temporarily suspended after problems with a light aircraft on 14 January.
Faults with the private plane's landing gear while it was on the runway also caused some flights to be redirected.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) stated the source of the problem was the "incorrect fitment of a set screw."
The pilot was being taught how to fly the Cessna G-MAPP aircraft.
When it landed at the airport, at Castle Donington, Leicestershire, the left wing began to sink.
The plane was forced off the runway and onto the grass.
None of the three people on board were injured.
"The cause of the landing gear collapse was most probably the incorrect fitment of a set screw in the downlock link," the AAIB's report said.
The AAIB recommended the aircraft's manufacturer tells operators how to ensure the set screw is properly installed.
It also said the aircraft's maintenance manuals are adjusted to include this information.
