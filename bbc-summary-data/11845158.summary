The state of Western Australia introduced the strictest anti-smoking laws in the country in September 2010, with bans in cars carrying children, on sections of beaches and within 10m (32ft) of playground equipment.
Australia also plans to force tobacco companies to use plain packaging carrying graphic health warnings from July 2012.
Across the country, smoking is already banned inside all airports, government offices, health clinics and workplaces.
New Zealand has announced a ban on smoking throughout prisons from July 2011.
Officials said high levels of smoking were a risk to staff and prisoners, and they dismissed concerns that the ban would spark violence. It is believed that two-thirds of the New Zealand's prison population are smokers.
New Zealand already bans smoking in bars, clubs, restaurants, offices, workplaces and shops, and on public transport.
Canada's strict anti-smoking laws have been credited with cutting hospital admissions for heart and respiratory problems by about a third.
A study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in April 2010 monitored admissions in the city of Toronto since smoking bans were introduced in 2001.
Smoking levels in Canada have long been among the lowest in the world, with about 21% of Canadians over the age of 15 reported to be smokers in 2002, according to government statistics.
In addition to bans on smoking in workplaces and many public places, cigarette packets bear graphic images of the damage done to internal organs by smoking.
China banned smoking in hospitals in May 2010 but activists say there have seen no signs of the government introducing a promised national ban on smoking in public places.
Many Chinese cities have their own regulations on where people can light up, but enforcement is varied.
A government survey in August showed that only a quarter of the adult population believed that smoking increased the risk of cancer. Anti-smoking campaigns are failing to influence them, state news agency Xinhua reported.
In May 2008, in the run-up to the Olympic Games, a smoking ban for most public buildings came into force in the Chinese capital, Beijing. The country has an estimated 350 million smokers. For every three cigarettes lit worldwide, one is smoked in China.
In April 2010 Syria become the first Arab state to ban smoking in public places including restaurants and cafes.
The law also prohibits smoking in educational institutions, health centres, sports halls, cinemas and theatres, and on public transport.

Egypt took its first steps in introducing a smoking ban earlier this year.
In July, the city of Alexandria began enforcing an existing law - usually flouted - that banned smoking in government buildings. Officials said they aimed to extend the ban to the city's cafes within two years.
Egypt is the biggest consumer of cigarettes in the Arab world, puffing its way through some 19 billion cigarettes every year.
Greece has long been regarded as Europe's biggest smoking nation and has struggled to make its citizens kick the habit. In September 2010 a fresh attempt was made with a law banning tobacco advertising and smoking in enclosed public spaces.
In 2009 smoking was prohibited in hospitals and schools, vehicles and all public spaces but it was largely ignored in many areas.
Previous attempts to introduce a ban in 2002 and 2003 also failed.
Spain already has anti-smoking laws but tougher rules were announced in October which will give the country some of the strictest legislation in Europe. Lighting up will be banned in bars, cafes and restaurants and extend to open areas near hospitals, schools and children's playground. The new rules are due to come into effect in January.
Poland brought in anti-smoking laws in November 2010. The ban covers schools, museums, theatres, airports and railway and bus stations, public transport, stadiums, hospitals and playgrounds. Smoking is also banned in one-room restaurants and bars.

France took a major step towards a total public ban when it announced it would prevent smoking in workplaces and other public buildings from 1 February 2007.
The law was extended in 2008 to include cafes, restaurants and bars.
Its first serious move to cut smoking levels came in October 2003, when it raised the price of cigarettes by 20%.
Correspondents say attitudes to smoking have changed dramatically in France since the 2007 ban, and any fears that people would generally ignore the laws have proved false.
In Germany, eight states, including Berlin, ushered in 2008 declaring their pubs and restaurants smoke-free.
German restaurants and pubs have strongly resisted the bans, not only because of the potential loss of income but partly because of an earlier crackdown on smoking initiated by Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime.
The sensitivity of the issue has prompted the authorities to allow special rooms to be set up purely for smokers.
The toughest rules in Germany have been brought in by Bavaria, where no smoking rooms have been allowed. Lighting up was recently banned at the Oktoberfest Munich beer festival for the first time.

The Netherlands: The Dutch government banned smoking for hotels, restaurants and the catering industry in 2008, but in November 2010 announced that it plans to exempt bars smaller than 70sq m (753sq ft), with no staff other than the owner.

Smoking in Sweden was prohibited in all bars and restaurants from midnight in May 2005.

The government also plans to ask tobacco firms to put only basic information and health or picture warnings on their packets. Making packets a plain colour would also protect children from taking up smoking in the first place, it suggests.

The Russian government has announced plans to ban advertising and promotion of cigarettes from 2011 and to introduce a complete ban on smoking in enclosed spaces by 2015.

The country's draconian law gives police sweeping powers to enter homes and search for tobacco products. In addition, it gives them the power to jail shopkeepers for selling tobacco and to arrest smokers if they fail to provide customs receipts for imported cigarettes - which are only permitted in very small quantities.
Smokers can legally import only up to 200 cigarettes or 150g (5.3oz) of other tobacco products a month - but a 100% tax is charged on such products. People found in possession of tobacco must provide a customs receipt when challenged by police, and can face jail for smuggling if they fail to provide their receipts.
There is a cash fine for breaking the ban, and shops also stand to lose their licence.
