[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England could play home matches away from Wembley from next year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The national team played at grounds across the country from 2000-2007 while Wembley was being rebuilt for £757m.
Last year it was reported that paying off the costs of the national stadium would mean staging England games at Wembley for up to nine more years.
But last week the FA agreed a £300m package to refinance their loan, which they say will allow "significant annual interest savings."
