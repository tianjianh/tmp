With three days of campaigning until polling day, parties are concentrating on key seats.
High profile campaigning was put on hold on Sunday by all the main parties, except UKIP, following the London Bridge terror attack.
Both the First Minister Carwyn Jones and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood will be in north Wales.
The Welsh Labour leader will start the day in the Ynys Mon constituency, where his party faces a stiff challenge from Plaid Cymru and the Conservatives, and will finish in Wrexham.
Ms Wood is also campaigning on Anglesey.
For the Conservatives, both Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies have visited the constituency of Gower.
