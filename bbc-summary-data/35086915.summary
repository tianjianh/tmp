One staff member is thought to have suffered a broken jaw while another suffered injuries to his head, back and ribs during the disorder at Swinfen Hall, Staffordshire.
Up to 25 inmates at the prison, near Lichfield, are thought to have armed themselves with chairs and table legs.
A prison service spokesman said the disorder was quickly resolved.
According to a prison service report staff were attacked on Thursday morning with five inmates then barricading themselves into a cell.
The prison services spokesman said police were investigating.
"A number of offenders at Swinfen Hall prison were involved in a disturbance on Thursday," the spokesman said.
"This was quickly resolved by staff, the offenders involved have since been moved to other establishments and the police are investigating.
"We do not tolerate violence against our hardworking and dedicated prison officers.
"Those responsible for violence face spending longer behind bars."
In August ,Swinfen Hall, a prison and young offenders institution which houses more than 600 inmates, was put on lockdown after inmates reportedly took over a wing and tried to flood it.
Peter Dawson, deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the situation was worrying and it would be interesting to see what the investigation into it will find.
But he said Swinfen Hall was not a prison in crisis.
"It has had a good inspection report and has an outstanding governor," he said.
He said the prison housed mainly young inmates who were serving long sentences and the prison was much bigger than it used to be.
"The difficulty for the prison service is that it, like a lot of other public services, has had to make significant staffing reductions over the last three years," he said.
