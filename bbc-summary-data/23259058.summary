[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The soldier, from the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed in Woolwich, south-east London in May.
Drummers escorted the cortege to Bury Parish Church, with onlookers applauding as it passed.
A service then took place for the family ahead of a full military funeral and private committal on Friday.
The father of one had served in Afghanistan and was a drummer for the regiment.
Ahead of the cortege, soldiers from his regiment marched and veterans carried regimental flags.
Floral tributes carrying the words "brother", "son" and "husband" accompanied his coffin draped in the Union flag.
An honour guard of soldiers from his regiment will remain with Fusilier Rigby's body overnight inside the church.
Police and councils have urged people to line the route once his body leaves the church on its way to Middleton Cemetery on Friday.
Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons on Wednesday, David Cameron said: "We should all pay tribute to drummer Lee Rigby for his service to our country.
"We should also pay tribute to his family, to all the pain and difficulty that they are going through, and I am sure it will be a very fitting service, a very moving service on Friday and the whole country will be mourning with them."
Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, east London, and Michael Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich, south-east London, are accused of Fusilier Rigby's murder.
Mr Adebolajo is also accused of the attempted murder of two police officers and possession of a firearm with intent to cause others to believe that violence would be used.
