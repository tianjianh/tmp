Arayeb Saqib, 18, admitted three counts of death by dangerous driving and one of causing serious injury.
Manchester Crown Court heard he had no licence, was uninsured and had smoked cannabis before losing control of an Audi S5 in Manchester, in April.
The judge told Saqib, "Driving like yours ends lives."
Saqib, of Wisner Court, Glasgow, who was 17 at the time, had agreed to meet up with his friends who had been attending a wedding and accepted an invitation to drive the car.
The court heard he drove through the suburb of Fallowfield at speeds of up to 100mph at about 03:15 BST on 27 April.
He was chased by a police patrol which spotted him driving at speed but he drove even faster to get away.
Hamzaa Jacob Iqbal, 24, from Burnage, Mohammad Hamza 21, of Bramhall and Munib Afzal Karim, 20, of Heald Green were all killed in the crash.
A fourth friend was seriously injured.
Sentencing Saqib, Judge David Stockdale, the Honorary Recorder of Manchester, said it was the worst case of causing death by dangerous driving that he had encountered and he "changed the lives of many people close to those young men".
Police Constable Paul Joynson of Greater Manchester Police said: "Arayeb Saqib was 17 at the time of the collision and was in no way experienced enough to drive such a high powered car.
"Saqib's attempts to show off to his friends in a high powered car directly resulted in their death and he will have to live with that on his conscience for the rest of his life."
