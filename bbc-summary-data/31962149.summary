The 18th-Century philosopher, whose work on ethics and metaphysics, heavily influenced Western thought, spent his life in what was then Koenigsberg.
Now the phrase "Kant's a sucker" has been sprayed on a ruined house in green paint, along with a heart and flower.
It is not the first time that Kant's philosophy has provoked hostility.
A man was reportedly shot and wounded in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-don two years ago, when a conversation in a shop about the philosopher turned to violence.
The authorities in the Russian Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad have promised to remove the latest insult.
But mystery surrounds the vandal's identity and what might have led the person responsible to deface the dilapidated house, which has been given historic status, in the village of Vesolovka.
Memorials to Kant, one of Koenigsberg's most illustrious sons, can be found in the present-day city of Kaliningrad, but not in Vesolovka some distance to the east.
Kant is believed to have lived in the village for three years from 1748, when it was known as Yudshen. He went on to live in Koenigsberg, then the capital of Prussia.
The ruined house that stands on the site dates back to the 19th Century, but the foundations of the original building still exist, according to local journalists from the Noviy Kaliningrad website who discovered the graffiti.
