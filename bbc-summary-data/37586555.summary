Since it began in 1965, the event has raised about Â£400,000 for blind and visually impaired charities.
Ms Clarke, a digital marketing manager said: "Its amazing.  The trick was skill, accuracy and a little bit of luck.  My colleagues will laugh but will be very impressed."
Mr Dryden, who is a Cub Scout assistant, said: "I never thought I'd win the first time I entered.  The cubs will be over the moon."
A new conker is used for every round. StJohn Burkett said preparations had been tough this year because of a shortage of decent conkers.
He said: "We collect a couple of thousand and we have to get the proper Championship-sized conkers. They're quite rare.
"We usually rely on two secret trees but even they haven't produced this year so we've had the whole committee out collecting."
