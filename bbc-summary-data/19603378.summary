Cambridge's empty £23m fire control centre seeks tenant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A multi-million pound building which was meant to house a regional emergency control centre for the fire service has been put on the market.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Department for Communities and Local Government has hired a property adviser to find a tenant for the Zenith building at a rent of £500,000 a year.
The building cost about £23m and was one of nine regional centres intended to replace 46 local control rooms.
The building at Cambridge would have covered the eastern region.
The plan, conceived by the last Labour government, was scrapped at a cost of £469m leaving the nine purpose-designed buildings empty.
The building in Cambridge has been lying empty for several years.
Property adviser GVA is marketing the building and said: "The large control room could be used for dedicated emergency response, as an operations room, call/control centre or for hi-tech teaching."
