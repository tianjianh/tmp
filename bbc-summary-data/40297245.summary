Robshaw has recovered from an ankle knock that saw him miss the first Test.
In the third change from the team that beat the Pumas 38-34 last weekend, Northampton-bound Piers Francis starts at inside centre.
"Chris has worked hard to be ready for this weekend," said England boss Eddie Jones.

"It will also be exciting to see Sam make his debut too having been unfortunate not to play last week because of injury."
Newcastle's Mark Wilson and Saracens' Alex Lozowski move to the bench.
"Despite missing 30 players on this tour, we set out to win the series 2-0," added Jones.
"It would be a fantastic achievement for this young and talented squad to do that. On Saturday we want to finish the season, and the halfway point of a four-year World Cup programme, on a real high."
