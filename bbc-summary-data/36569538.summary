[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jane Ross's equaliser maintained Women's Super League One leaders Manchester City's unbeaten start to the season as they drew with Liverpool.

The Scottish striker scored from close range as City stretched their lead over second-placed Chelsea to five points.
Rosie White silenced the home crowd in the fourth minute when she beat two defenders to fire past Karen Bardsley.
That was the first time the City keeper had been beaten in the league this season, but her side responded well.
City's Toni Duggan and Daphne Corboz were both inches away from converting Kosovare Asllani's low cross.
The hosts' second-half pressure paid off when Ross tapped home on 66 minutes from a driven Nikita Parris cross.
Reds keeper Siobhan Chamberlain pulled off the save of the game to keep out Jill Scott's header before a flurry of chances in injury time.
The home side had a penalty appeal turned down, before Liverpool's Niamh Charles was denied by Bardsley and then Ross was thwarted by Chamberlain.
A second successive draw for Liverpool, the 2014 champions, keeps them in fifth place.
Manchester City Women midfielder Jill Scott:
"We know if we play well, we can beat most teams at home. It's frustrating but it's not a loss, it's another point on the board and we're still unbeaten in the league,
"In the second half we played a lot better. We created a lot of chances. We just needed that bit of luck to go our way.
"We piled the pressure on late on and we thought we'd be able to nick the win. When the five additional minutes were signalled, I believed that we would go on to get the three points."
Liverpool Ladies keeper Siobhan Chamberlain:
"We played really well. We stuck to the game plan and we could have come into half time having scored two, maybe even three goal.
"They were on top in parts of the second half but a draw is probably a fair result.
"It was always going to be difficult coming to a place like this. They're a fantastic side and they're up at the top of the league for a reason."
