The latest estimate of the repairs cost of severe flooding in the Scottish Borders over the winter has put the figure at above £5.5m.

The details were revealed in a response by the local authority to a Freedom of Information request.
Storms Desmond, Eva, Frank and Gertrude all caused major issues in the area, as did poor weather on 27 January.
Previous estimates put the costs at above £3.5m but that figure has now risen by another £2m at least.
The figure includes £3.5m in revenue and £900,000 in capital repairs to roads, bridges and embankments.
In addition, £1,500 flat-rate compensation payments, underwritten by the Scottish government, have been made to 165 householders and 117 businesses at a cost of £422,500.
Further discretionary payments to 51 flood-affected homes and 126 businesses have totalled £817,000 while £114,000 has been disbursed in "loss of trade" payments to businesses.
The final tally of the costs will not be known until next month.
