Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger could miss the European Championship finals through injury, according to Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal.

The midfielder, 31, injured a knee during training with Germany before the 3-2 friendly defeat by England.
"The expectations are not so good in relation to the Euros," said the United manager.
Van Gaal also revealed that United and England full-back Luke Shaw will resume training "on the pitch" next week.

Full-back Shaw, 20, suffered a double leg fracture in United's Champions League group stage defeat by PSV Eindhoven in September.
Van Gaal said: "Luke shall start the first training sessions on the pitch next week. Now he can train with his bodyweight."
However, he added it was unlikely that Shaw would regain match fitness in time to play in the FA Cup final, should United get there.
West Ham host the 11-time FA Cup winners in a quarter-final replay on Wednesday, 13 April.
The Dutchman also provided an update on the fitness of United captain Wayne Rooney, who has been sidelined since mid-February with a knee problem.
"Wayne is doing great," he said. "You cannot say he can play next week. He has strength and a lot of skills with the ball for the first time since the injury. That is very important."
Before Sunday's home match against Everton, Old Trafford's South Stand will be renamed in honour of the club's record goalscorer, Sir Bobby Charlton.
Van Gaal acknowledged Charlton's importance to the club and said he was grateful for his support.
"He is always backing me, so I am very happy with him," he said.
"I met him on my first day as manager, and was guided through the stadium by him," he added. "He was also my idol when I was young, so I have known him in my mind for a lot of years."
"I'm proud he can get such an honour because not many clubs are doing that."
