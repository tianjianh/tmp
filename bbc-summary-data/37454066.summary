The boat was carrying between 450 and 600 migrants when it sank eight miles (12km) off the port city of Rosetta.
It was transporting Egyptian, Syrian, Sudanese, Eritrean and Somali migrants.
Authorities said at least 163 people have been rescued but survivors told the BBC that hundreds more may have drowned.
Speaking to the BBC's Orla Guerin in Rosetta, survivors said smugglers forced anyone who wanted a lifejacket to pay extra.
Four crew members have been arrested on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter and human trafficking, Egyptian officials said.
The boat, which was kept off the coast for five days as more migrants were brought on board, is said to have capsized after a final group of some 150 people were crammed onto the vessel.
The incident came as the EU's border agency warned that increasing numbers of Europe-bound migrants are using Egypt as a departure point.
More than 10,000 people have died crossing the Mediterranean towards Europe since 2014, according to the UN.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
