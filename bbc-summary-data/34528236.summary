[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DUP MLA Jonathan Bell travelled abroad this week, on what is being described as private business, before resigning as enterprise minister.

Mr Bell travelled to China in his capacity as honorary vice president of the Confucius Institute at the  Ulster University, the party said.
A DUP spokesperson said that the trip had nothing to do with Mr Bell's role as enterprise minister.
The party said the trip is not being funded out of the public purse.
Under the DUP's "no business as usual policy", the Strangford MLA resumed his role as enterprise minister on Friday.
He remained in post until one minute past midnight on Wednesday.
The DUP said Mr Bell was in Beijing and is currently in Hubei Province visiting the institute's partner university.
It added that Mr Bell was not travelling on departmental business and his flights were not paid for from public money.
The DUP's other so-called revolving ministers - Simon Hamilton, Mervyn Storey and Michelle McIlveen - were re-appointed again on Wednesday and will remain in post until further notice.
On Tuesday, the Sinn FÃ©in MLA, Daithi McKay, told the Assembly that, while Mr Bell had been in post officially for four days, the Health Minister had not.
He added: "I do not know what the priorities are within the DUP, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the Department of Health is not a number one priority.
"There seem to be concerns that the Enterprise Minister needs to be in post to do his job and to sign off on certain things, but it is not as important that the Health Minister be in post."
