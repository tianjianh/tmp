[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 0-1 Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford continued their pursuit of a League One play-off place with a victory at Charlton that left their hosts even further behind the top six.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A hopeful first-half strike from on-loan Everton man Conor McAleny, once of Charlton, took Oxford to within six points of sixth place with two games in hand.
The Addicks, whose disappointment was increased by Chris Solly's red card, remain 13th, three places behind their visitors and 10 points behind the top six.
The hosts almost took the lead with their first attack. Gifted space in the third minute on the edge of the area, Nathan Byrne sent a right-footed shot against the crossbar, but the ball bounced back and away from danger.
Stephy Mavididi also threatened with a run down the left wing and shot that Simon Eastwood saved, but it was as Charlton were appearing to settle that their visitors took the lead.
McAleny found himself with space and few options in midfield and his ambitious, low shot went beyond Declan Rudd's reach and in off the left post.
The Addicks began to respond during the second half with the introduction of substitutes Tony Watt and Joe Aribo, and appealed for a penalty when Ricky Holmes was brought down in the area after the former's cut-back.
In the 59th minute, Mavididi cut in from the left wing and struck against the post, but after the equalising goal they needed continued to elude them, Solly was given a straight red card in the 70th minute for a late challenge on John Lundstram.
