He died suddenly aged 57, leaving behind a back catalogue spanning rock, pop, funk and jazz and millions of devoted admirers.
Purple street art in his memory has popped up in Belfast's Cathedral Quarter and in the window of an art gallery in Stranmillis.
Fans of Prince in the PSNI, Castlereagh, also posted their own creative salute to the pop icon on Facebook on Thursday night.
US rapper, Macklemore, celebrated the iconic musician during his performance at the SSE Arena.
He told fans on Thursday night that Prince was a "musical genius" and said he had taught him "it was all about the love".
There was no Purple Rain in Northern Ireland, but one Prince fan managed to snap purple skies over Belfast.
Brian Mullholland told BBC News NI he thought it was "quite appropriate" that the parma-violet sky covered the city on the night of the musician's death.
