Slovenia visit Hampden on 26 March, with Gordon Strachan's team desperately in need of victory after picking up four points in the opening four games to sit fifth in Group F.
The warm-up against Canada will take place four days earlier at Easter Road.
Canada were last in Scotland in 2002, again at the Edinburgh home of Hibernian, losing a friendly 3-1.
"This match will give us a chance to see up-close some of the players who have been in such excellent form over the winter months," said Strachan.
"There are a number of players who may not have been involved in the recent games but who have been pushing hard for a place, so this will allow them to stake their claim.
"It's important we have a match before the second half of the qualification programme begins.
"We know that a win against Slovenia at Hampden will take us to just one point behind them in second place and put us right back in contention, so the players involved in the Canada game can take this opportunity to show they should be involved."
This will be the sixth meeting with Canada, with Scotland winning all of the previous games.
