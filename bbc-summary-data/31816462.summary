[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new website has been set up to help people record their sightings of red squirrels in Scotland.

Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels said the site would help its work to conserve the mammals.
People have been asked to upload sightings using mobile phones because the GPS function on the devices give an accurate location of the squirrel.
Since 1952, 95% of red squirrels have been wiped out in England and Wales. Scotland has 75% of the UK's reds.
It has been estimated that Scotland has about 120,000 red squirrels.
Disease, habitat loss and competition for food from non-native grey squirrels have been blamed for the decline in reds.
So far this year 107 sightings of reds and 59 greys have been recorded by Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels.
The organisation involves the Scottish Wildlife Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish Land and Estates and the Red Squirrel Survival Trust.
