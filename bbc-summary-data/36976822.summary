County Championship: Eckersley hits unbeaten 73 for Leicestershire against Derbyshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ned Eckersley hit an unbeaten 73 as Leicestershire enjoyed a decent opening day with the bat against Derbyshire at Grace Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But a number of Leicestershire batsmen got starts and then got out as they lost wickets at regular intervals.
Debutant Callum Parkinson took 3-64 as four Leicestershire men were out in the 40s, before Eckersley's patient innings helped them rebuild.
He hit seven fours as Leicestershire ended the first day on 300-7.
