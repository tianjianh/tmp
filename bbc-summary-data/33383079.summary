[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old was attacked after being approached by a man in the town at about 03:45 last Sunday.
She had left a bus on Lauder Road and was forced into a wooded area between Lauder Road and Wester Kippielaw Drive.
It is thought the man was earlier thrown out of a local nightclub.
Officers will also be carrying out additional patrols in and around the town.
The attacker was described as being white, aged about 20, about 5ft 7in and of a very slim build. He had short dark hair and was wearing tight fitting jeans and a shiny black hooded top.
Ch Insp Kenny Simpson, of Police Scotland, said: "I want to reassure the local community that we are using all resources available to track down this suspect and ensure he is brought to justice.
"As part of our approach, we will continue to run additional patrols in the area and officers are also planning to speak with people who are going out in the town this weekend.
"Sexual attacks of this nature are thankfully very rare and I would ask people to engage with officers if they remember any unusual behaviour in the early hours of last Sunday in the area of Lauder Road."
