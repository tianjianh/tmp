Lancashire County Council confirms cuts to job and services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to cut hundreds of jobs and close museums and libraries have been confirmed by Lancashire County Council's cabinet as it looks to save £65m over the next two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors agreed to cut 367 full-time jobs and reduce the number of libraries from 74 to 34.
The moves are part of the council's bid to save £262m by April 2020 following government cuts.
Since January 2014, 1100 people have taken voluntary redundancy.
Among the measures approved are removing funding for subsidised bus services, ending free transport for faith schools and ending the funding of five museums - Queen Street Mill, Helmshore, Museum of Lancashire, Judges' Lodgings and Fleetwood Museum.
Jennifer Mein, the Labour leader of Lancashire County Council, said: "The decisions we have taken today are heartbreaking but reflect the unprecedented financial situation we face."
