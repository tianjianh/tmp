Al Hasawi, who took control of the Reds in the summer of 2012, would not reveal the identity of the buyers.
However, BBC Sport understands that a United States consortium, led by millionaire John Jay Moores, is on the verge of securing a Â£50m deal.
The takeover would see the former San Diego Padres owner take an 80% stake in the Championship club.
Moores' consortium were previously interested in buying Premier League side Everton, and the potential new owners met club staff last week.
