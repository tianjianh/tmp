[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe took 6-35 to give Australia control of the first Test against India in Pune.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All O'Keefe's scalps came as India lost seven wickets for 11 runs to be 105 all out - captain Virat Kohli making his first Test duck in 45 innings.
Australia, bowled out for 260 in their first innings, then moved to 143-4 to lead by 298 runs.
Captain Steve Smith, dropped three times, was unbeaten on 59 at the end of day on which 15 wickets fell.
O'Keefe claimed three wickets in one over, first dismissing top-scorer KL Rahul (64) before Ajinkya Rahane and Wriddhiman Saha fell for ducks.
All of his six wickets came in the space of 24 deliveries as the 32-year-old claimed career-best figures in his fifth Test.
Despite Ravichandran Ashwin dismissing David Warner (10) and Shaun Marsh for a duck, Smith and Matt Renshaw (31) steadied the innings to put Australia on top.
Only one team has chased more than 300 to win a Test in India - India scored 387 to beat England by six wickets in 2008.
