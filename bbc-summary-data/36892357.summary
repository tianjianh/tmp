The 37-year-old Spaniard scored 73 goals in 255 appearances for the Glasgow giants between 2004 and 2010.
He has been in talks with the Oval club in recent days and is a stellar signing for manager Alan Kernaghan.
Novo won three league titles at Ibrox and also played for Sporting Gijon, Legia Warsaw and spent the last two seasons with the Carolina Railhawks.
The NASL outfit are managed by former Northern Ireland international Colin Clarke.
Novo's arrival is another welcome boost for the Irish Premiership.
Three Northern Ireland internationals have already joined Irish League clubs over the summer, with Roy Carroll and Sammy Clingan moving to Linfield and former Celtic winger Paddy McCourt signing for Glenavon.
Novo will make his competitive debut for the east Belfast outfit in the league opener against Dungannon Swifts on August 6 at the Oval.
