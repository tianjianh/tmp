Whitlock, 23, gained Britain's first-ever Olympic gymnastics gold with victory in the men's floor and won his second gold on the men's pommel horse.
The gymnast, coach Scott Hann and team mate Brinn Bevan were met by crowds at South Essex Gymnastics Club, Basildon.
Whitlock said he was proud to be supported by an "incredible" club and hoped to inspire more gymnasts.
The gymnast now has five Olympic medals, earning bronze in the all-around to add to bronze in both the team event and pommel horse at London 2012.
Whitlock said it was not until he flew into UK with the rest of Team GB on Tuesday that he realised quite how much of an impact their achievements had made at home.
"It was like we were in a bubble in Rio - you could feel it slightly on social media, but it was literally when we stepped forth off that plane that we realised what an impact we'd made," he said.
"The whole of Team GB have done so well."
Mr Hann said: "All the guys have trained so hard but... it's phenomenal and an honour to be part of Team GB and this historic result."
