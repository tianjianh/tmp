[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Jackson, 51, was serving part of his life sentence at HMP Sudbury when he was reported missing on Tuesday.
Jackson killed Gill Ellis in Burnley in 1984, when he was a teenager, by stamping on her stomach and tearing a main blood vessel to her heart.
He was jailed in March 1986, went on the run in 1997 and was later freed but then recalled to Sudbury Prison.
Ms Ellis, from Burnley, was mugged as she walked across Hargher Clough Recreation Ground on her way home from a Christmas party in 1984, the Lancashire Telegraph reported.
As she lay unconscious, Jackson, also from Burnley, stamped on her stomach - splitting her pancreas and fracturing her ribs, the trial at Manchester Crown Court heard.
The prosecutor said Ms Ellis's liver had "virtually exploded".
Jackson was found guilty of murder and jailed for life.
In 1997, he escaped from HMP Ranby, in Nottinghamshire, and went on the run for three days before giving himself up after he was spotted.
He was released in 2007 - after serving 21 years of his sentence - but was later recalled to Sudbury Prison.
Police have described him as white, 6ft 4ins tall, slim, with short cropped grey hair and a tattoo on his wrist. His last known addresses was in Oldham and Burnley.
