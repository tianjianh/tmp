The mammal, thought to be a minke whale, was discovered at Ynyslas beach, near Aberystwyth, Ceredigion on Friday.
A coastguard spokesman said a marine expert would take samples before the whale was removed.
Walker Shirley Tunley said: "Over 40 years of Christmas morning visits by the Tunley family but this is a first."
