George Ford is set to be rewarded for his performance off the bench in Brisbane with a place in the starting XV for Saturday's second Test against Australia in Melbourne.

The Bath fly-half was an early replacement for Luther Burrell, setting up two tries in England's 39-28 win.
Owen Farrell is expected to move from fly-half to inside centre.
"It's great to have someone else who has the same mindset out there at 12," Ford told BBC Sport.
"We think about the game quite similarly, and he helps in terms of communication in attack while his energy in defence is unbelievable."
The pair played 10 and 12 for the England Under-20 side several years ago and re-formed that partnership in this year's Six Nations as England won the Grand Slam.
England are set to name their side on Thursday at 10:00 BST.
England coach Eddie Jones says England's treatment at the hands of the Australian media has been "disgusting, demeaning and disrespectful", with former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer the latest to cause a storm with comments made about the England scrum.
But Ford insists the players are ignoring any noise from outside the camp.
"We don't really take any notice of it to be honest," he added. "All we are bothered about is the environment we have here - all that matters it's what is going on inside our camp."
Meanwhile, Ford says he is staying at his club side Bath, despite admitting he was disappointed by the sacking of his father Mike as head coach.
"It upsets you because you don't necessarily think it's the right decision," Ford continued.
"But it's happened now, the decision has been made, and it's England time now.
"I've just signed two years at the club so I'll be there for the next two years."
