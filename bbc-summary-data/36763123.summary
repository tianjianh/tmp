Maria Sharapova: Banned tennis player to miss Rio Olympics

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova will miss the Rio Olympics after her doping appeal was postponed until September by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).

She was given a two-year suspension in June after testing positive for the banned substance meldonium.
Sharapova appealed to Cas but both the 29-year-old Russian and the International Tennis Federation need more time to prepare their cases.
The Rio Olympics start on 5 August.
"Maria Sharapova and the International Tennis Federation (ITF) have agreed to defer the Cas decision until September 2016," said a statement.
"A decision is expected to be issued by 19 September 2016."
Sharapova tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open in January.
Also known as mildronate, it became a banned substance on 1 January, but Sharapova claimed she had been using it since 2006 for health issues.
