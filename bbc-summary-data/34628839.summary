On Friday, Mourinho had warned his relationship with the media would be changing after phone camera footage of him in west London was published.
"You don't get good and funny headlines from me now," Mourinho said.
Gary Cahill was the only Chelsea player to speak after the game, saying: "We are not feeling sorry for ourselves."
Cahill had levelled after Mauro Zarate put West Ham ahead, but Andy Carroll's late header gave the Hammers the points.

The derby defeat was Chelsea's fifth in their opening 10 league matches this season, and came after Mourinho, assistant first team coach Silvino Louro and midfielder Nemanja Matic were all sent off.
Louro was dismissed for his reaction to Matic's second booking before half-time, while Mourinho was shown a red card for comments he made to referee Jon Moss during the interval.
Mourinho watched most of the second half from the directors' box at Upton Park, but disappeared shortly after Carroll headed home West Ham's winner.
West Ham manager Slaven Bilic said that he had spoken to Mourinho after the match.
"I feel for him," Bilic said. "Decisions from his point of view have gone against him. I would moan if it was against us. But they are not mistakes; they are matters of opinion."
Mourinho has been caught up in controversy numerous times this season, including banishing team doctor Eva Carneiro from the bench and being handed a Â£50,000 Football Association fine and suspended stadium ban for saying officials were "afraid" to award his side penalties.
