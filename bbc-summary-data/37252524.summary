Spaniard Martinez, 43, was appointed on 3 August, less than three months after being sacked by Everton.
Elsewhere, 17-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made his debut for Italy as they lost 3-1 to France.
European champions Portugal, minus Cristiano Ronaldo, beat Gibraltar 5-0 and Greece saw off the Netherlands 2-1.
Belgium were booed off by sections of the home crowd after managing just one shot on target against Spain - from Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne.
City club-mate Silva opened the scoring after 34 minutes in Brussels and added a second-half penalty to give Julen Lopetegui a winning start in his first match as Spain coach, after replacing Vicente del Bosque.
"You can't expect major change in just three days and this result has no real meaning," said Martinez. "What I do want to see, though, is passion and pride in wearing the national team jersey."
Former Wigan and Swansea manager Martinez succeeded Marc Wilmots and made former Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry one of his assistants.
Martinez left Everton striker Romelu Lukaku on the bench against Spain and started with Liverpool's Divock Origi.
Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard was made captain.
Manchester United forward Anthony Martial, Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud and Paris St-Germain full-back Layvin Kurzawa gave Euro 2016 finalists France the win in Bari, with ex-Southampton striker Graziano Pelle replying for the hosts.
It was Giampiero Ventura's first match in charge of Italy, after replacing new Chelsea boss Antonio Conte.
The half-time substitution of Italy's legendary goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, 38, was the game's biggest talking point.
The Juventus World Cup winner was replaced by AC Milan teenager Donnarumma, who become Italy's youngest ever keeper.
The teenager, born 484 days after Buffon's international debut on 29 October 1997, also became the youngest player to be picked by Italy for 105 years.
The Italy match was also notable for being the first international match to use video assistant referees.
Fifa president Gianni Infantino was at the game and said "football history" had been made when officials consulted video over a potential penalty decision.
Infantino says he hoped the technology will be used at the 2018 World Cup.
Trials have already taken place in the United Soccer League - the third tier of US football - and the system will also be tested in six other countries in the next two years, including Germany and Italy.
Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum scored for the Dutch but they lost their fifth consecutive home game for the first time since 1993.
Danny Blind's side also failed to qualify for Euro 2016.
Meanwhile, Nani scored twice and Pepe also got on the score sheet as European champions Portugal beat Gibraltar.
