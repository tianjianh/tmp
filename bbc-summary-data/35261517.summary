[SN]TITLE[SN]
Piazza project for National Museum of Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Edinburgh street is to be overhauled in a Â£700,000 renovation project to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the National Museum of Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work in Chambers Street, which will see the creation of a piazza, will start on Sunday.
Part of the plans will see the relocation of the existing statue of 19th Century Lord Provost William Chambers.
There will also be the removal of 40 car park spaces that line the street.
The removal of the parking bays will make way for a pedestrianised area, which will double as a performance space during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
The street will be closed on Sunday all day to allow the existing statue of William Chambers to be moved temporarily in preparation for the works.
Dr Gordon Rintoul, director of National Museums Scotland, said the project would be completed in the summer.
He said: "All major cities have a quality public realm and the plans to redefine the use of the public space in Chambers Street will provide just that - an appropriate setting in keeping with the prominence of the buildings and a much enhanced public space for people to meet and enjoy events.
"This space will create a new focus for cultural activity in association with the museum and our many partners."
The project will be funded by Edinburgh city council, National Museums Scotland Charitable Trust, Edinburgh University and a group of private donors.
