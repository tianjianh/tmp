Glasgow starts work on major streetlight projects

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two major projects are due to start in Glasgow to replace street lights with more energy-efficient lamps and to trial the use of smart technology.

One scheme will see 10,000 old sodium lamps replaced with LED lights along major routes in the city.
These will generate savings by cutting carbon emissions and using less energy.
Another scheme will see smart LED lights in some areas that will be able to increase in brightness when people approach or noise levels rise.
Glasgow City Council aims to replace about 72,000 old sodium street lights in the city.
The first phase will see 10,000 new LED lights installed at a cost of just under £9m between April this year and March 2017.
The scheme is being backed by the UK government-funded Green Investment Bank.
The resulting savings on energy costs, carbon tax reductions and maintenance, are expected to see the project pay for itself over an 18-year period.
Council leader Gordon Matheson said: "It currently costs around £8.5m a year to power and repair the city's 72,000 street lights.
"The longer life cycle of LED lamps means we can reduce future maintenance and running costs as well as cutting our carbon emissions.
"These lights are another key element of our commitment to make Glasgow one of Europe's most sustainable cities."
WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said the investment was "great news for Glasgow taxpayers as well as the planet".
"Some councils have estimated that street lighting makes up 10% of the their carbon footprint," he said.
"Therefore, a nationwide shift to more energy-efficient lighting such as LEDs would make a significant dent in council-related carbon emissions.
"Pound for pound, improved energy efficiency is the most cost-effective way to cut energy demand and the associated climate pollution."
Another scheme being developed by the council will see the use of sensor-fitted LED street lights trialled on a stretch of cycle route on the Clyde Walkway.
The sensors will be able to detect approaching cyclists and pedestrians and increase in brightness.
They will also count footfall and the number of cyclists, as well as collecting information on air pollution.
The information will be freely available to view on Glasgow's new City Data Hub.
