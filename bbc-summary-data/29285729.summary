Beaumaris lifeboat alert fails to stop wedding tribute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lifeboat crew's plan to give a colleague a guard of honour at his wedding was almost scuppered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Volunteers from Beaumaris RNLI on Anglesey were all set to mark Leighton Jones's wedding when they were alerted to an incident in the Menai Strait.
A motor boat had caught its propeller on some rope off Friars Bay but the lifeboat towed it to safety.
The crew was back on shore within half an hour of the alert on Friday in time to greet the happy couple.
The volunteers had to abandon their oars in the guard of honour at 11:47 BST but were back at the station at 12:12 BST.
The RNLI said Mr Jones would normally have taken part in the rescue but was excused due to a prior engagement - his marriage to fiancÃ©e Kerry Kirkham.
Matt Crofts, RNLI Divisional Operations Manager, said: "Even the most important day can be disturbed by the sound of the pagers - but today just goes to show how the volunteers are ready every time of day or night to help those in trouble at sea."
