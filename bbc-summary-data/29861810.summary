The 51-year-old, from Westcliff, was questioned in connection with the death of Angela Millington, 33, of Southend.
Her remains were found on Foulness Island in June by a group of ramblers, but have only recently been identified using DNA tests.
The man has been bailed pending further inquiries until 17 November.
Det Ch Insp Simon Werrett said some of Ms Millington's remains were found on part of Foulness Island known as New Burwood Head.
There had been no definitive sighting of her since November 2013 when she visited a housing officer and withdrew money from her bank account, but there have been reports of possible sightings in Southend in January and mid-February this year, Essex Police said.
Mr Werrett added: "We continue to receive valuable information from the public and we are currently looking into the possibility of her living or associating with someone in February this year.
"We are keen to trace this person so urge them to get in touch."
