Super League Magic Weekend: Catalans Dragons 10-18 Huddersfield Giants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Late Sam Rapira and Adam O'Brien tries helped Huddersfield overcome Catalans Dragons in a low-quality affair to begin the second day of Magic Weekend.

Richie Myler's converted try for Dragons was cancelled out by Lee Gaskell's four-pointer and Martyn Ridyard's penalty before half-time.
Iain Thornley dummied his way over for Catalans's second try after the break before Greg Bird had one disallowed.
Rapira stormed through to edge Giants ahead before O'Brien ensured victory.
Those two scores in three minutes at the end of an error-strewn contest made for a dramatic climax to an otherwise dull match at Newcastle's St James' Park.
Huddersfield's fourth league win of the season moves them to within two points of Warrington in eighth spot after 14 games.
Catalans are just once point ahead of the Giants after suffering their fifth straight defeat in all competitions.
Until the 72nd minute, when Rapira muscled his way through three tackles to go over for Huddersfield, the Perpignan side looked set to end their miserable recent run.
Bird's disallowed try - their second of the day chalked off by the television match official - kept Huddersfield in the contest, a fact they ruthlessly exploited.
Catalans Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous:  "We let the two points slip and that's disappointing. Our game management in the last 10 minutes was not good, it's as simple as that.
"Last week we were missing 12 players, this week we were missing eight players, and Ben Garcia hurt his calf again so I assume he'll miss a bit more.
"To turn the luck we need to have some good, fit players on the field."
Huddersfield Giants boss Rick Stone: "That's massive for us, absolutely. In the context of the competition it was a pretty important game for us. Every game we play is really important at the moment.
"Catalans are probably tootling around similar to us. We weren't great, I think both teams weren't great. There were six or seven errors from both teams in the first half.
"In the end it was good to see the boys get a win. The game opened up a little bit for us right at the death and we were patient enough and hung in there and stayed close enough to give ourselves a chance, and that was important for us in the end."
