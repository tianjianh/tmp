Craig Palmer admitted a string of child sex offences and was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday.
Palmer, 33, of Blakesley Grove, Stechford, Birmingham, admitted eight counts of sexual assault, which took place when the baby girl was aged between five and 12 months.
All of the offences took place between December 2014 and February 2016, West Midlands Police said.

Police said they discovered Palmer's crimes after a tip-off from the National Crime Agency linked him to indecent images of children posted online.
He was arrested at his then home in Fairfax Road, Sutton Coldfield, in February 2016, where they seized his phone.
Full forensic analysis revealed he had more than 1,000 abusive images of young children on the phone, including some showing him sexually assaulting the baby.
Palmer also pleaded guilty to a further 14 offences including making, possessing and distributing indecent photographs of children and one count of inciting or causing child prostitution and pornography.
He pleaded guilty to all charges in December, police said.
Det Insp Jim Foy said it had been a "disturbing" case for officers to pursue.
