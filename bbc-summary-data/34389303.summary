Original stars Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewan Bremner and Robert Carlyle are all returning for the new film.
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Boyle confirmed that the shoot was planned for "May/June".
The film, loosely based on Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting follow-up Porno, could be released later next year.
Boyle said filming of the sequel might be as tight as the first, which was shot in less than two months.
Miller and Carlyle both star in US TV shows -  CBS's Elementary and ABC's Once Upon a Time respectively.
"They only get this little window off, so either you wait for the contract to run down, which could be as late as three years, or you kind of try and do it in this window," Boyle said.
"But all four lads are back in."
The original Trainspotting was made on a shoestring budget of just Â£1.5m.
The sequel's budget will be bigger but still relatively modest.
"We're doing it for less than $20m, and that'll give us control of the film so we can make the film we want to make," Boyle told the Hollywood Reporter.
"That's as much as you can get without being answerable to anybody. You can sort of get on with it without much interference. Although we could have raised a lot more money for this, we didn't, so we're trying to keep some sense like we kept the original."
Boyle is hoping Film4, who produced the original, will get on board.
He admitted there were reservations among the cast about making a sequel.
"The actors were understandably worried about its reputation and not wanting to let people down or to just be cashing in," he said.
"So actually the script, which John (Hodge) has written, has been put under a very fierce spotlight by everyone, and it's a good one.
"Everyone's attitude is that it'll be an honourable addition and an interesting addition to the original film. We're very positive that we believe it can happen and it's coming true."
