The Penygroes-based Express Motors bus went into a ditch on the A39 motorway at Lons-le-Saunier, near the Swiss border.
It was carrying pupils from Bournside School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
There were 42 students, six staff and two drivers on board.
Two of the pupils were airlifted to hospital, one in a life-threatening condition and the other in a serious condition, the school said.
A further 10 students, one member of staff and the drivers were treated for minor injuries nearer the scene.
Most on board were aged 14 to 17.
In a statement, Express Motors said it was "in the process of doing everything they can to contact their drivers and designated tour leaders".
It added: "Once contact is made they will do everything they can do to help accident teams with their investigations and inquiries."
French police said no other vehicles were involved and the road has been closed.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are providing support to a group of British nationals following a coach crash in France. We are in contact with the relevant local authorities."
