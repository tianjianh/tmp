[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The group, aged between 43 and 76, were detained on Tuesday after raids were carried out on 12 properties in the London and Kent areas.
Brian Reader has been named as the 76-year-old. He was arrested in Dartford.
The contents of 56 safe deposit boxes were taken during the raid in London's jewellery district over the Easter weekend.
All nine suspects, described as white British men, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle.
Four, aged between 48 and 74, were arrested in Enfield, north London.
A 59-year-old was detained in north London while Mr Reader was held alongside a 50-year-old in Dartford, Kent.
The two remaining men were also arrested in North London.
Officers have continued to search a number of addresses in connection with the arrests.
Det Supt Craig Turner, head of the Met Police Flying Squad, appealed for information about a white Transit van seen at the time of the raid.
He said the vehicle, registration DU53 VNG, had been captured on CCTV near Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd on 2 April.
The footage had been in police hands for "quite a period of time", Det Supt Turner said, but it had not been released for operational reasons.
The Flying Squad also apologised after confirming alarm response procedures had not been followed, but rejected the suggestion they were bungling "Keystone Kops".
There has been no official detail of what was stolen but it is believed jewellery worth up to Â£200m was taken during the raid.
