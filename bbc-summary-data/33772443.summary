[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of police officers in Scotland has fallen slightly to 17,272, down by 46 compared to a year ago.

But the total has maintained the Scottish government's pledge before the 2007 Holyrood elections to appoint an additional 1,000 officers.
The government said increased police strength had come as crime levels were at an historic low.
Critics have said it is unrealistic to maintain such staffing levels given the funding cuts faced by Police Scotland.
The current total is 1,038 higher than 16,234 police officers recorded in March 2007.
