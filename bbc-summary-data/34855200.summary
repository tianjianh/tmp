Nerves returned to global stock markets as worries about international security increased.
On Tuesday, a football match between Germany and the Netherlands was cancelled, while two Air France planes heading to Paris from the US were diverted because of security threats.

On the currency markets, the pound spiked briefly after Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent said markets should look at how the UK's economy was performing, rather than "focus obsessively" on the Bank's forecasts.
The recent Inflation Report from the Bank was interpreted as pushing the prospect of a rate rise back to late 2016 or even early 2017.
However, Mr Broadbent's comments were seen as suggesting a rise could come earlier, and the pound jumped half a cent against the dollar in response.
However, the gains did not last, with the pound unchanged against the dollar at $1.5208, and up very slightly against the euro at â‚¬1.4304, in late afternoon.
