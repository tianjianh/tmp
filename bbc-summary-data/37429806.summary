The 22-year-old suffered the injury in scoring a try for Warrington in Friday's 35-28 loss at home to Wigan.
Currie's form meant he was widely expected to be included in the England squad for the upcoming Four Nations tournament at the end of the season.
"Our worst fears have come to fruition. He's torn his ACL off the bone," said Wolves head coach Tony Smith.
"He's on his way to London as we speak for repair. I believe that will involve a graft back onto the bone.
"The minimum recovery would be six months but I reckon he will be close to nine months. It's a big blow for the young man."
