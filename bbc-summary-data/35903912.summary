[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Downs classical stone bridge plans resubmitted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a classical stone bridge across the Downs in Bristol have been resubmitted, after the council asked for them to be withdrawn while it awaited the findings of another report.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed bridge over Bridge Valley Road would complete a missing link in the circular route around the Downs and offer a "safer" crossing.
Engineer Dr Adrienn Tomor, from the University of the West of England, said it would "bring unique benefits".
The council is due to decide on 2 May.
Dr Tomor originally submitted the plans last March, but withdrew them at the council's request because it wanted to see the results of a report commissioned by the Downs Committee.
She said they had now carried out "further traffic analysis".
Dr Tomor said: "For example, a zebra crossing or traffic lights would create long queues on Bridge Valley Road and increased risk for serious accidents for the upcoming traffic.
"A proposed stone bridge would make the junction accessible, complement the classical architecture in Clifton, create a new landmark and bring a large number of benefits to Bristol.
"This is a visionary project that would create something inspirational for young people and future generations".
Jack Penrose, from the Friends of the Downs and Avon Gorge group, said: "The proposed bridge will not only cater for able pedestrians but school children, the disabled, the elderly, the disadvantaged and others, who find the current busy and complex crossing very difficult and dangerous to negotiate."
If permission were granted Dr Tomor said they would need to raise about Â£2m.
