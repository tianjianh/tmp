Acid find after 'attack' on Scottish Sun journalist

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A court has heard traces of sulphuric acid were found at the scene of an alleged attack on a journalist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Det Sgt Craig Warren told a jury at the High Court in Glasgow he was sent to the Glasgow home of Scottish Sun journalist Russell Findlay.
He saw a jar on the floor of the hallway and splash marks on a dado rail and wall mirror.
William Burns, 56, and Alexander Porter, 48, deny throwing acid in the face of Mr Findlay on 23 December 2015.
They also deny a charge of attempted murder in connection with the shooting of a man near an East Dunbartonshire primary school.
Det Sgt Warren said he arrived at Mr Findlay's home about an hour after the alleged attack.
One of the accused, William Burns, had already been detained and taken away from the scene.
The substance he found in the hallway, he told the court, was found to be sulphuric acid.
He also described items he found in the driveway of Mr Findlay's home.
They were "what appeared to be two layers of false teeth, a beanie hat, a snood and a knife".
The knife was found near the threshold of the front door.
Mr Warren said that his focus then turned to how Mr Burns might have got to the scene, and how he might have got away.
He confirmed to the Advocate Depute Richard Goddard that officers searched CCTV footage from the day of the alleged attack, and also preceding days, to try to establish if the accused had carried out a reconnaissance of the area.
Footage from cameras in Crow Rd, and next to Jordanhill school on Chamberlain Rd was shown to the jury.
On three separate dates, Mr Warren said a Volvo was seen near Mr Findlay's home - including driving away from the crime scene on the day of the alleged attack, two minutes after Mr Burns had been detained.
The detective described it in court as "yellow or gold".
The jury had already heard that Alexander Porter had a gold-coloured Volvo S40 in 2015.
On the 28th January Police Scotland executed a search warrant at the home of Alexander Porter, and detained him. During subsequent questioning, the accused replied "no comment" to all questions put to him.
Under cross-examination by Susan Duff, defence counsel for Mr Porter, Mr Warren said that 16.5 hours of CCTV footage was examined. But neither the registration number or actual colour of the Volvo was identifiable, nor was the number of occupants in the car.
Susan Duff also queried the officer's assertion that he knew the Jordanhill area of the city well, pointing out he had called Woodend Drive "Woodend Road".
During the search of Mr Porter's flat, Mr Warren said 16 items were retrieved from kitchen drawers - none of which was a knife.
The case continues.
