Father-of-two Greg Gilbert, 39, from Southampton, has been diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer which has spread to his lungs.
His fiancée Stacey Heale said he needs to travel overseas to undergo urgent treatment which she claims is not available to him on the NHS.
The family's crowdfunding page is hoping to raise £100,000.
Writing on the funding page, Ms Heale said: "We have had the terrible news that Greg is genetically incompatible with the only free immunotherapy drug available on the NHS.
"Greg has begun his chemotherapy but we need money to be able to move quickly when this finishes in mid-March."
Mr Gilbert and Ms Heale have two daughters aged three and one.
Ms Heale said the cancer was discovered after he suffered severe abdomen pains and vomiting which saw him admitted to hospital in October.
An X-ray revealed a cancerous blockage in his bowel.
She said he had previously been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.
More than 2,300 people have donated more than £75,000 in the four days since the campaign started.
Mr Gilbert said he felt "overwhelming love and positivity" following the appeal.
"I still haven't absorbed it - the word 'cancer' has such an aura of fear around it... in one instant it happens and I find myself living in the moment."
The appeal has attracted donations from celebrities including Ellie Goulding.
A fundraising gig has also been organised on 5 January at the Southampton venue, the Joiners, where Delays have played many times during their career.
Delays were formed in Southampton in 2001 by brothers Greg and Aaron Gilbert with Colin Fox and Rowly.
