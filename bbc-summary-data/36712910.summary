Liverpool accept Norwich City bid for winger Sergi Canos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City have had a £2.5m bid accepted by Liverpool for winger Sergi Canos, reports BBC Radio Norfolk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old former Barcelona youth player spent last season on loan in the Championship with Brentford, where he scored seven goals in 39 appearances.
The Spain Under-19 international, who joined Liverpool in 2013, made his first-team debut on the final day of the 2015-16 Premier League season.
He could come in following Nathan Redmond's departure to Southampton.
England Under-21 international Redmond moved back to the Premier League for a fee believed to be in the region of £10m in June following the Canaries' relegation to the Championship.
Canos would become Norwich's first signing of the summer if the deal goes through.
