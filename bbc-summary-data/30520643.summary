Why the Queen won't abdicate (probably)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bookmakers have suspended bets on the Queen announcing her abdication during her Christmas message this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They say an "unusual amount" of people online have put money on Her Majesty giving up the throne and handing it down to a younger generation.
Six people - within 10 minutes - waged a bet on it today.
There have been similar bets placed before but it's the fact these recent ones were made in "quick succession" which "set alarm bells ringing".
Buckingham Palace told Newsbeat: "We would not directly comment on a bookmaker's work."
But Newsbeat has been told the chances of a Christmas day abdication are unlikely - here's why:
The Palace suggested that we take a look at some of the speeches the Queen has given.
On her 21st birthday when she was still a princess she gave a radio broadcast to the Commonwealth.
She said: "I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong."
Then during the Coronation in 1953 she made a promise to God to govern the countries she's head of state for - a promise which she said she would "perform and keep. So help me God."
Sorry to spoil it for you but the Queen's Christmas speech isn't live and will have been recorded in front of other people.
It's unlikely that the Royal Household would risk including something as big as an abdication within the speech for fear that the information may be leaked before it is officially announced to the public.
Grant Harold, former butler to Prince Charles and the Royal Household, doesn't believe she'll do it.
Speaking to Newsbeat he says: "She's very much the old school - she's taken on this responsibility and I think she means what she's said in her speeches.
"I wouldn't have thought she would change her mind. She's got no reason to change. She's still got the support of the Duke of Edinburgh backing her all the way.
"I know she's cutting back in duties but I think she'll stay until the sad day when her life comes to an end. She sees it as her duty to carry on to the day she dies."
There's only been one occasion that a British monarch has abdicated and that was the Queen's uncle in 1936.
He wanted to marry Wallis Simpson but because she was a divorcee he wasn't allowed.
As the British monarch he was also head of the Church of England and they didn't permit the remarriage of divorced people until 2002.
He chose love over being King Edward VIII. The throne then passed to his younger brother, the Queen's dad, King George VI.
It caused a lot of controversy at the time and the country went into a state of panic.
Other monarchies in Europe have abdicated the throne without much of a fuss.
Earlier this year, King Juan Carlos of Spain stood down for personal reasons. He's been suffering ill-health for the past couple of years.
His son, the now King Felipe, took over his duties. It was the third time in 18 months that a king or queen in Europe stepped down.
It's become a bit of a tradition in the Netherlands to abdicate when you feel you've had enough.
The past three Dutch monarchs - all queens - have all chosen to step down from the job.
Last year Queen Beatrix handed over the ceremonial power to her son - Willem-Alexander.
Her mother Juliana resigned the throne in 1980 on her 71st birthday, and her grandmother Wilhelmina abdicated in 1948 at the age of 68.
