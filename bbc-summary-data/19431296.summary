The 40-year-old victim, who was named by his employer as Piotr Mikiewicz, was stabbed in the chest in Rylett Road, Shepherd's Bush, on Wednesday.
He died from his injuries at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on Thursday.
A 30-year-old man was held on suspicion of murder and five others on suspicion of assisting an offender.
Mr Mikiewicz has not yet been formally identified.
The 30-year-old remains in police custody. The five others are two men and three women.
Hammersmith and Fulham Council's deputy leader, Greg Smith, said: "Everyone at the council is deeply saddened by the tragic news that Piotr Mikiewicz, who was one of the borough's dedicated street cleaners, has died after being stabbed.
"Piotr was a hard-working man, who was a friendly face to all who knew him on his regular beat.
"Although this is an isolated incident, it is deeply shocking that Piotr's genuine act of bravery should end in such brutal violence."
Mr Mikiewicz, who worked for private contractor Serco, was described by the firm as a "colourful and friendly personality".
The company's director Director Mike Boult said: "Anyone who knew Piotr knew he was a truly good and honest person. He had a strong sense of what was right and wrong.
"He wasn't just a road sweeper, he was a part of the community he worked within, genuinely caring about the residents and his beat."
BBC London reporter Sarah Harris said residents had left bunches of flowers at the scene of the attack.
She said: "Neighbours have written messages describing Mr Mikiewicz as a very hard-working and friendly man. One man called Alan wrote that he was 'a gentleman'.
"Everyone I've spoken to seems to have known him and spoken very highly of him."
A post-mortem examination is being carried out on Friday.
The local authority has opened a book of condolence and is flying the flag at Hammersmith Town Hall at half mast.
