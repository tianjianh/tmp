[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sunderland v Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland have been rocked by the news that Jan Kirchhoff has been ruled out for at least another four weeks.

Darron Gibson is expected to overcome a minor niggle but fellow midfielder Steven Pienaar is still a doubt because of a calf problem.
Burnley's Steven Defour could be involved for the first time since suffering a hamstring strain at the end of January.
Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Dean Marney remain sidelined by knee injuries.
Guy Mowbray: "It has to be better than last time. Even David Moyes described January's Stadium of Light FA Cup meeting between these teams as 'a slog for everybody'.
"This, though, has the added 'big chance' factor.
"Sunderland surely have to go into the international break with the boost of a win.
"Anything else against a team that's only taken two points on the road all season will have many declaring that another escape from relegation will be beyond them. Most outside onlookers already have.
"Burnley are desperate to break what Sean Dyche describes as 'an anomaly' in their season - failure to win away. Here's their big chance, in a game that could prove a big deal."

Sunderland manager David Moyes on Jermain Defoe's England call-up: "I think it's a boost to Jermain and hopefully it gives the whole club a lift because we need his goals and we need more goals.
"It's less and less likely that older players get call-ups when they've been out of the team for a while. You get players like Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney who play right through to their mid-thirties, but when you've been out of the squad, it shows your professionalism in never giving up on it."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche: "A lot of performances away from home were way off the mark earlier in the season, but that's not been the case in the main recently.
"The performance against Liverpool was a marker, the sight of Liverpool kicking it in the corners and wasting time, and bringing Lucas on for a striker, which you don't see them do often, was a backhanded mark of respect.
"If we keep delivering performances and get on top of the fine details, we're not a million miles away."
Sunderland are six points adrift of safety now, and although this is not quite their last throw of the dice, it is not far off it.
I am going to tip Burnley to win. The way they are playing, they surely cannot go the whole season without an away win.
