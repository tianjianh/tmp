The BBC understands Richard Glanville, 59, was questioned on suspicion of the murder of Ricci Gallagher, who was found injured at a farmhouse in Little Burstead, Essex.
The 46-year-old died in hospital a week later, on 6 August.
A 53-year-old man from Basildon was also arrested. Both have been bailed.
Mr Gallagher, from Billericay, had reported a fire at his home in Blind Lane, Little Burstead, minutes before police received a call that he was hurt at the nearby farmhouse on Sudburys Farm Road.
Police said they were investigating why Mr Gallagher was at the farmhouse.
The East of England Air Ambulance confirmed the Duke of Cambridge was the co-pilot when Mr Gallagher was airlifted to hospital.
Mr Glanville worked for Aurora Fashions, a holding company which owned Oasis, Coast, Warehouse and Karen Millen until 2013.
