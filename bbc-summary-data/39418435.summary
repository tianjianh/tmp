Wales table tennis clash with Kosovo called off after visa issues

A Wales table-tennis international has been postponed for a second time after opponents Kosovo had problems getting visas to enter the UK.

The Women's European Championship qualifier was scheduled for Cardiff's Sport Wales National Centre.
The fixture was first called off in early March after the Kosovan team had their visa applications denied.
"It is disappointing," said chairman of Table Tennis Wales, Bernard Carter.
Mr Carter said this time the visas had been approved, but delays with travel documents meant the Kosovan team had not been able to travel.
It has proved a frustrating and costly situation for the sport in Wales with number one Charlotte Carey having flown in from Sweden for the clash and protégée, 10-year-old Anna Hursey, set to make her senior international debut.
Mr Carter added: "It's frustrating, a real mess-up to be honest, it's difficult to rearrange these fixtures, but we are determined it will go ahead in the future."
