A mural to celebrate the return of trains to Galashiels has been granted permission to remain in place.

Energise Galashiels commissioned artist Chris Rutterford to complete a design for wall space at Douglas Bridge.
It was unveiled by Lord Steel of Aikwood amid celebrations during the Creative Coathanger arts festival.
Nobody had applied for planning permission for the mural but a retrospective application has now been successful.
Planning officer Carlos Clarke said: "The colouring is relatively dark, so the image is not conspicuous.
"It is not for me to comment on the quality of the artwork but the image appears to be very high quality and worthy of both distant and close public exposure."
A third section of the colourful mural, featuring even more recognisable faces from the Galashiels area, is due to be unveiled next spring.
