Holland, who won bronze for England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, sat out the first three races of the season.
But the 29-year-old clocked one hour 49 minutes 51 seconds to finish ahead of American Katie Zaferes and Switzerland's Nicola Spirig.
Fellow Briton Helen Jenkins, also making her season debut, was fifth and Emma Pallant 10th.
Zaferes now leads the overall women's rankings ahead of fellow American Gwen Jorgensen, who sat out the race in Cape Town after three consecutive victories this season.
The men's race is on Sunday at 14:00 BST, and Britain's Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee is set to make his return from injury.
His brother Jonny finished top of the podium in the Gold Coast and Auckland.
