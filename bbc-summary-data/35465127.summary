It is the fourth time he will have joined the club after two loan spells and a permanent move - between July 2010 and July 2011 - with the Cherries.
The 28-year-old has signed a two-and-a-half-year deal for a fee understood to be Â£200,000.
"I was surprised by the interest. But Eddie Howe's a good manager and knows what I'm capable of," said Wiggins.
Wiggins, who made only nine appearances for the Owls this season, did not endear himself to Bournemouth fans when he handed in a transfer request and left for Charlton in 2011.
"It's not nice to be getting some stick from the fans," he added, speaking to BBC Radio Solent.
"But hopefully I can go back out there and put in some good performances and show that I'm dying to be out there again.
"A lot of people have their opinions, but if you're doing the business out on the pitch, people will support you."
