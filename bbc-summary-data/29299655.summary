What the Scottish papers say

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The fallout from the independence referendum still dominates the newspapers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scotland on Sunday says the path is being cleared for Nicola Sturgeon to replace Alex Salmond as SNP leader as other potential candidates rule themselves out.
The Scottish Mail on Sunday reports on a poll which predicts Scotland will back the SNP at the next election but only if it abandons the fight for independence.
The Sunday Herald has Alex Salmond saying Scots were tricked into voting "No", as well as a story on the Conservative "threat" to Gordon Brown's devolution timetable.
The Sunday Mail pays tribute to the people of Scotland with a headline which says, "Campaigning, fierce debating, energising, just inspiring, record-breaking, decision-taking, celebrating or heart aching, history-making, country-shaking Scotland, Wow!"
The Sunday Post has David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg insisting further powers for Holyrood will be delivered.
The Scottish Sun on Sunday goes with Gordon Brown putting pressure on Westminster to deliver more devolution powers.
