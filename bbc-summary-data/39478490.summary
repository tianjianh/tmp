The incident happened at about 20:45 on Saturday on the B7015 Stoneyburn to Livingston road in West Calder, near its junction with Happy Valley Road.
The 24-year-old woman was walking home with her boyfriend when she was hit by the small white car.
The woman was taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh for treatment to a number of injuries.
The road was closed for about two and a half hours for a police investigation.
Insp Richard Latto, of Police Scotland, said: "Fortunately, the woman was not left with any life-threatening injuries and we are now eager to trace the driver, who may not even be aware they were involved in a collision.
"If you are the driver of a small white car which was on the B7015 at about 20:45 on Saturday evening then please contact police immediately.
"In addition, anyone with any further information relevant to this inquiry should also get in touch."
