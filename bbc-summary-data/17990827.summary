Two teams of players, the officials, the mascots and a doctor, all called Bungay, were involved in the match at Bungay Town's ground in Bungay.
Players ranged in age from four to 68 and the match finished level, at 6-6.
Organiser Shaun Cole said: "Keiran Bungay scored two penalties to complete his hat-trick and make it a draw."
Mr Cole, part of the Bungay Town FC committee, said: "The pitch was full of Bungays and the stand was full of Bungays.
"One chap came from Queensland, Australia, to play."
The game was overseen by qualified referee John Bungay, who had to send off the Australian Chris Bungay for swearing.
About 200 people were in the stands, including several other Bungays who had responded to the club's online appeal.
The match was raising money for the Jack and Ada Beattie Foundation.
