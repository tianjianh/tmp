The 29-year-old, who has 35 international caps, joined from French side Bordeaux and had a $4.45 million release clause in his contract.
"I would like to thank Bordeaux for allowing me to make the move and Werder Bremen for having faith in me," Sane told the club website.
"I am excited to play in the Bundesliga, because I have followed it for many years.
"To play in these stadiums and with this atmosphere, especially at Werder, is something I am really relishing. I want to make my contribution to a successful season as quickly as possible."
He could come up against his younger brother Salif Sane, who plays for Hannover in the second division in Germany.
Also on the move in Germany is Nigeria international forward Victor Obinna, who has penned a one-year contract with Bundesliga outfit SV Darmstadt.
He joins after a successful trial but will miss his new club's first four matches of the new season through suspension.
The 29-year-old was sent off in his last match for second division side MSV Duisburg in their relegation play-off against WÃ¼rzburger Kickers.
The striker has 46 caps and 11 goals for Nigeria as well as being part of the Super Eagles squad at the 2010 World Cup as well as the 2006, 2008 and 2010 African Cup of Nations.
The former Inter Milan, Chievo Verona, West Ham, Malaga and Lokomotiv Moscow player was an integral part of the Nigeria squad that won silver at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in China.
His compatriot Chinedu Obasi has signed a short-term deal with Swedish topflight club AIK.
The 30-year-old Nigeria international was released by Bundesliga club Schalke last summer after making just 10 league starts in three years.
"It's a great opportunity and also a great honour for me to be part of this fantastic club," he told AIK website.
Like Obinna he has a silver medal from the 2008 Beijing Games, and was at 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
He is the only Nigerian to have appeared in all Fifa World Cups [Under-17, Under-20 and Senior] as well as the Olympics.
