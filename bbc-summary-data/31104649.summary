Norwich City have signed Hamilton Academical midfielder Tony Andreu for an undisclosed fee, while Canaries striker Kyle Lafferty has joined Turkish side Caykur Rizespor on loan.

Frenchman Andreu, 26, follows former Accies boss Alex Neil to Carrow Roa on a three-and-a-half-year deal.
Lafferty, 27, will be with Caykur Rizespor until the end of the season.
The Canaries failed to sign Graham Dorrans from West Brom but kept left-back Martin Olsson at the club.
Norwich and West Brom had agreed a deal for the players to switch clubs, but the move broke down with Albion claiming that Olsson and his advisors were too late to arrive for a medical.
Lafferty arrived at Carrow Road from Palermo in the summer, and has one goal in 18 Championship games.
He started his career at Burnley, and on top of his spell in Italy with Palermo, has played in Scotland with Rangers and Switzerland with FC Sion.
Caykur Rizespor are a top-flight Turkish side.
Meanwhile, also exiting Hamilton is French striker Mickael Antoine-Curier, with Accies saying the 31-year-old's contract was terminated by mutual consent.
Antoine-Curier scored 34 goals in 103 appearances during three spells at New Douglas Park, returning to Accies in 2013 after a spell with Atyrau in Kazakhstan.
The striker began his senior career with Preston North End and also had spells with Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Oldham Athletic, Kidderminister harriers, Rochdale, Sheffield Wednesday, Notts County, Grimsby Town, Vard Haugesund, Hibernian, Dundee, Ermis Aradippou, Ethnikos Achnas and Felda United.
