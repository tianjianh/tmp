[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sutton United 2-2 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roarie Deacon scored a last-minute equaliser to earn Sutton a 2-2 draw and push Southport closer to relegation from the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Back-to-back home defeats by Guiseley and Macclesfield had left Southport on the verge of the drop and they are now 10 points from safety with only four games left.
Sutton hit the front after 25 minutes when Kieron Cadogan back-heeled Deacon's shot beyond goalkeeper Chris Cheetham but they gifted Southport a route back into the game through Dan Spence's own goal midway through the second half.
Neil Ashton's 74th-minute free-kick appeared to have given Southport only their second win in 14 games but Deacon levelled in the dying seconds to deny the visitors.
