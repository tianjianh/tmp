Val Shannon, voluntary services manager at Alder Hey, said: "Christmas should always be special for children and our staff will do everything possible to make Christmas Day as magical as possible for our patients, many of whom are very poorly.
"Father Christmas will visit our wards on Christmas morning and every child in the hospital will receive a sack full of presents.
