Stoke City 2-2 Leicester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Champions Leicester City recovered from Jamie Vardy's red card and a two-goal deficit to claim an incredible draw at Stoke City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vardy was contentiously dismissed by referee Craig Pawson for a two-footed tackle on Mame Diouf.
Stoke took advantage to score twice before half-time, with Bojan Krkic converting a penalty after Danny Simpson's handball, and Joe Allen tapping in.
But the Foxes mounted a remarkable comeback in the final 15 minutes, with substitute Leonardo Ulloa and Daniel Amartey heading home to snatch a point.
It leaves Leicester three points above the relegation zone in 15th, while Stoke are 11th.
A draw never looked likely from the moment Vardy was sent off in the 28th minute.
The England striker went in two-footed and off the ground on Diouf, but won the ball.
Pawson deemed it reckless, though, and showed Vardy his second red card of 2016.

Leicester fell apart immediately, as Simpson gave away the penalty by putting his hand in the air while sliding to block a cross, and Allen tapped in after Giannelli Imbula's shot came back off the post and hit the hapless Kasper Schmeichel on the back of the head.
The Foxes' discipline vanished - boss Claudio Ranieri had to be held back by his goalkeeper from remonstrating with Pawson at the break, and six of his players were booked in a 10-minute spell either side of half-time.
But the finale was incredible, with substitutes Demarai Gray and Ulloa combining with their first touches of the match to make it 2-1 - Gray crossing for Ulloa to head home a goal given by goalline technology despite Ryan Shawcross' effort to clear.
Stoke were pinned into their own half in the closing moments, and Christian Fuchs crossed from the right for Amartey to head in the equaliser.
Going by the rulebook, Pawson was within his rights to send off Vardy, as the tackle looked out of control, particularly in real time.
But his inconsistency will frustrate many, with Pawson only showing Manchester United's Marcos Rojo a yellow card for a similar challenge against Crystal Palace in midweek.
Indeed, perhaps the criticism for that decision was in his mind when he produced the red card for Vardy.
It means the spotlight will shine brighter on the rest of his decisions and, though Foxes fans made their thoughts on his performance clear, the penalty award was spot on and he had little choice with most of the eight bookings.
Ranieri and Stoke counterpart Mark Hughes had contrasting opinions on the red card.
Ranieri said: "One manager says yes, one says no. If you listen to me I say 'no', if you listen to Mark Hughes he says 'yes'."
Hughes said: "It was a two-footed challenge. The lad left the floor and I don't know what Leicester are complaining about. From my point of view it was clear."
Ex-Chelsea winger Pat Nevin on BBC Radio 5 live: "When he goes with his two feet - they were off the ground - he didn't seem to hurt Diouf but that didn't matter in the referee's eyes. I wouldn't have quibbled had they shown Vardy a yellow."
Former Leicester striker Dion Dublin on Final Score: "Rubbish. The referee has got that completely wrong. Vardy makes the tackle. He has no intention of making the tackle with two feet at all. It is 100% wrong."
Ex-Tottenham striker Garth Crooks on Final Score: "Craig Pawson has fundamentally misunderstood what has gone on. Vardy left the ground with two feet but he has done that in order to get to the ball.
"He won the ball and Diouf gets out of the way. Vardy makes no contact. He has been anything but reckless. Referees are making big decisions with the little teams because it seems to be easier."
Amid Leicester's heroics, there will be concern from Stoke boss Mark Hughes at how easily his team let three points escape from their grip.
With a one-man advantage and a two-goal lead, the Potters looked to be coasting toward a third win in five games.
They forced three good saves from Schmeichel, who put in an impressive performance on his return to the Leicester side after a broken hand.
But the hosts dropped deeper and deeper in the second half and, after some slick passing play in the first period, resorted to hitting hopeful balls into the channels.
It meant Leicester could keep coming back at them and ultimately Stoke, who had kept three clean sheets in their past four games, looked tired and flimsy at the back.

Stoke City manager Mark Hughes said: "Leading 2-0 it was well deserved, we were good value for that lead and were in good shape. You have to get the job done and we didn't do that.
"You think it should be a straightforward second half, but we made it difficult and allowed them to get back into the game.
"We are in decent shape, but this game should have been won."

Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri said: "It was a fantastic spirit and we wanted to fight until the end so it was important for us to play well.
"During half-time we spoke a lot and had to believe something good was possible. I am always positive.
"It could be a turning point today, but we have to wait and see the next matches.
"I was angry at the referee because I saw my players fight and there were so many yellow cards, but it was a normal battle in the Premier League."
There's a nine-day rest for Leicester as they host Everton on Boxing Day (26 December), while Stoke are in action a day later when they travel to Liverpool on Tuesday, 27 December.
