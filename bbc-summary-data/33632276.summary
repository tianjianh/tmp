Jessica Lawson, from Wolfreton School, near Hull, fell into a lake near Meymac in the Massif Central region on Tuesday.
French radio reports have said Jessica was among a group jumping from a pontoon which had overturned.
It had then trapped some children beneath it.
Jessica was one of 24 students who were on a five-day trip to an activity resort.
Head teacher Dave McCready said it was a "dreadful shock" to the whole school.
"As a parent myself I only begin to imagine the pain felt by her parents and family at her death at such a young age."
Jessica and the rest of the group had left for France on 18 July and had been due to return home on Thursday.
Steve Scott, managing director of trip organiser Activ4, said the group were swimming after activities scheduled by adventure camp staff had concluded.
The adventure centre, according to its website, has been operating for about 25 years and specialises in activities such as kayaking, canoeing, sailing and boarding as well as climbing, mountain biking and orienteering.
A criminal investigation has been opened to establish whether the resort was negligent.
