Prize money in sport - BBC Sport study

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport has carried out a study into prize money in sport. We contacted the governing bodies of 56 sports of which 51 provided information set out in the table below.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The study found 35 sports pay prize money at world level, 25 pay equal prize money, 10 do not. Cycling pays equal prize money in some events but not others. Men and women compete together in horse racing and equestrian.  The research was carried out by Jo Gunston and the prize money was converted to Â£ sterling on 15 October 2014.
