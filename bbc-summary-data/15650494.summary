[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lleucu Siencyn named Literature Wales chief executive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The new chief executive of Literature Wales has been appointed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lleucu Siencyn had been acting chief executive of the organisation responsible for developing and promoting literature in Wales.
Ms Siencyn, from Talgarreg, Ceredigion, who studied English at Oxford University, has started several new projects, including setting up the Young People's Laureate for Wales.
She was formerly a literature officer for the Arts Council of Wales (ACW).
"The oldest art form in Wales has just got itself a new face," said John Pikoulis, Literature Wales joint chair.
It is one of the resident organisations at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, where it runs the Glyn Jones Centre.
It is made up of Yr Academi Gymreig / The Welsh Academy, the Society for Writers of Wales, and TÅ· Newydd Writers' Centre.
Mr Pikoulis said: "The appointment of Lleucu Siencyn will be widely welcomed in the literary community.
"It signals the beginning of a new programme of activity, built on the achievement of Academi and TÅ·  Newydd but greatly expanding on it, to heighten the public's awareness and enjoyment of literature and to reach all parts of Wales in a manner befitting a national company."
Ms Siencyn worked as a researcher and scriptwriter with various television companies before taking up the ACW post.
She was Academi's deputy chief executive between 2002-2011.
