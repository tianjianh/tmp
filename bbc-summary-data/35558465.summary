World number one Van Gerwen, 26, beat reigning PDC world champion Gary Anderson 7-3, while 55-year-old Taylor eased past James Wade 7-1.
Both players posted three-dart averages above 111 in their victories.
Meanwhile, England's Adrian Lewis and Scotland's Peter Wright maintained their 100% starts to the event.
Lewis beat Dave Chisnall 7-4, while Wright edged to a 7-5 victory over Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld.
Wade, who overcame Van Gerwen in the opening round of the tournament in Leeds seven days earlier, played twice in Newcastle as Robert Thornton was unable to compete because of illness.
Left-hander Wade inflicted a 7-4 defeat on Premier League debutant Michael Smith, who has lost all three of his matches in the round-robin stage so far.
James Wade 7-4 Michael Smith
Raymond van Barneveld 5-7 Peter Wright
Adrian Lewis 7-4 Dave Chisnall
Gary Anderson 3-7 Michael van Gerwen
James Wade 1-7 Phil Taylor
