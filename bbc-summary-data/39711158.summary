The world's longest ocean race over 40,000 nautical miles features 700 participants over its eight stages.
Crews of amateurs on 70ft yachts each led by a professional skipper will set sail from Albert Dock on 20 August.
Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, said it is "a huge coup" for the city, which "thrives on maritime spectacles".
Liverpool has previously hosted the biennial race three times in its eleven editions.
Founder of the race, Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, said he was "thrilled" it was returning to the "historic city" and has fond memories of the welcome they received in 2007.
"We are looking forward to putting on an even bigger show in the city this time," he said.
Mayor Anderson, said Liverpool's "affinity with the river is always much-celebrated" and the impact on the local economy will be huge but "the pride it will engender in the people of Liverpool is priceless".
"It really feels like we are the home of the Clipper Race," he added.
After travelling to South America, the yachts will go to Cape Town in South Africa, then to Sydney and Hobart in Australia.
From there, participants will sail to Sanya and Qingdao in China and Seattle in the USA, then continue to New York via Panama.
The final leg will see them go through Northern Ireland and back to Albert Dock in summer 2018.
