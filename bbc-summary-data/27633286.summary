Portsmouth plan to curb university student home shortage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Portsmouth university student accommodation shortage is being tackled with plans for a new 830-bed building in the city centre.

Developer Unite Students bought the site at Greetham Street from Portsmouth City Council and will be submitting plans for studio and shared flats.
The university provides about 2,800 purpose-built student homes and had 18,300 undergraduates in 2013.
Unite Students said the plans would relieve pressure on private housing.
The firm already provides half of the university's purpose-built student homes across three properties.
University of Portsmouth spokeswoman Anne Stanford said: "Unite have been keeping us updated about their proposals to submit a planning application for this significant new development of student accommodation in the heart of the city.
"We look forward to seeing the final designs and will continue to remain in dialogue with Unite as the application progresses."
