Glasgow landslip causes week-long rail disruption

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
ScotRail is warning that a landslip in Glasgow will lead to week-long disruption on some rail services.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows the partial collapse of a railway embankment between Ashfield and Gilshochill.
The rail operator said tonnes of mud and stone had washed onto the track at Lambhill, weakening a footbridge over the track.
Services from Glasgow Queen Street to Anniesland and Crianlarich have been cancelled for seven days as a result.
ScotRail said work was under way to stabilise the slope and assess the damage to the footbridge, which will need to be temporarily removed and reconstructed before the line can be reopened.
The company said a full bus replacement service would be in place for the half hourly service to Anniesland until 12 April, but warned commuters that the journey was likely to take longer.
A bus service will also operate from Glasgow Queen Street to Crianlarich.
Rail services for the West Highland line will begin at Crianlarich and continue to all intermediate stations for Oban, Fort William and Mallaig.
The rail operator said the plan would be under daily review and could change.
A ScotRail Alliance spokesman said: "Our team has been on site since Tuesday morning assessing the damage and making plans to repair the line.
"We will be working around the clock to get the railway open as soon as possible, but extensive structural repairs will be needed to fix the significant damage caused to the footbridge."
Customers affected by the disruption can use ScotRail's Delay Repay compensation scheme, which applies to services that are delayed for 30 minutes or longer.
The cause of the landslip is currently under investigation.
