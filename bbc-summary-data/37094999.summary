Police Ombudsman: Gun and ammunition found in filing cabinet of investigator

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigator with the Police Ombudsman resigned from his job days after an internal inquiry was launched following the discovery of a gun and ammunition in his office.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood that member of staff was Steve Skerritt.
The items had been examined as part of an investigation into a shooting incident involving police officers.
The Ombudsman said that not returning them to an evidence store was a breach of procedures. Mr Skerritt denies this.
The Police Ombudsman has also confirmed that an investigation began after the weapon and ammunition were "found in the filing cabinet of a member of staff".
Mr Skerritt worked as an investigator for the office of the Ombudsman since shortly after it opened in November 2000.
The BBC understands that the items were discovered by a colleague of the investigator in June while he was on holiday.
They are believed to have been in the filing cabinet for the past nine years.
In a statement, the Police Ombudsman's office said the gun and ammunition were among items seized as part of an investigation into an incident in 2007 when a police officer fired shots at a car they believed to have been stolen.
The police weapon recovered from the filing cabinet was not fired during the incident in the Dundonald area of Belfast, in which a man lost an eye.
"Police Ombudsman staff became aware of the breach in June this year and immediately initiated an investigation, which is continuing," the statement added.
"The person in question no longer works for the office."
It is understood Mr Skerritt resigned from his position shortly after being informed that an internal investigation had begun.
Reacting to the news on Tuesday evening, the Police Federation for Northern Ireland (PFNI) called for an inquiry into the Police Ombudsman's Office.
PFNI Chairman Mark Lindsay described the office as "a law unto itself" and said the episode pointed to "sloppy and careless internal procedures" within the organisation.
Calling for the creation of an independent oversight body to govern the operation and internal workings of the office, Mr Lindsay said: "The Ombudsman's office is quick to criticise our officers for what, on most occasions, are relatively minor issues.
"The bottom line is the gun and ammunition shouldn't have been in its possession - they should have been handed over to the police.
"We simply cannot have an office that is meant to be above board in every respect behaving in this careless and sloppy manner."
The incident is highly embarrassing for the Police Ombudsman, who conducts investigations into complaints and allegations of wrong doing by police officers.
Whatever the outcome of the investigation, the ombudsman cannot take any action against Mr Skerritt as he no longer works for the office.
When contacted by the BBC, Mr Skerritt said he had not breached any procedures, and that the handgun and ammunition had been stored in a secure cabinet.
He also said he had been planning to retire for some time and that his decision to leave his job at the time was not connected to the discovery of the items, or the fact that an investigation had been launched.
