The Gulls, who are fighting relegation, have been hit by financial problems this season after millionaire owner Thea Bristow left the club and a group of local businessmen took over.
The club has been donated a minibus by a local firm to travel to away matches.
"It's come in handy because with the financial constraints we've had to use it for a few away games," he said.
"There's only myself and Robbie (Herrera, Torquay's assistant manager) who can drive it and I'm a better driver than I am a passenger, so we decided to go for it," Nicholson told BBC Sport.
The 35-year-old has been behind the wheel for the trips to Boreham Wood and Macclesfield, as well as the FA Trophy game at Bognor Regis Town.
Torquay won both both their away league games after Nicholson's stint at the wheel, and are now on a season's-best run of three successive wins as they try to fight their way out of the relegation places.
The club have been forced into a number of cost-saving measures this season as their new financial circumstances start to bite.
They were forced to close the youth academy, former boss Paul Cox quit over issues about his pay and Nicholson claimed that a number of his players 'earned less than minimum wage'.
"It's not going to happen regularly, that's just where we are at the moment," said Nicholson of his role behind the wheel.
"It's a phase that we're working hard to come out of and you've got to do what you've got to do.
"It wasn't in the job description, but it's not a big thing, it's just doing what you need to do to get your team there, and if they do the business it's a very pleasurable drive back."
