The 28-year-old DR Congo international was released by the Baggies at the end of the season.
Mulumbu made 211 appearances in six years with Albion, having joined them from Paris St-Germain in 2009, initially on loan.
Fellow midfielder Graham Dorrans also made the move from The Hawthorns to the Premier League newcomers this summer.
Norwich are yet to officially comment on the reports of Mulumbu's move.
