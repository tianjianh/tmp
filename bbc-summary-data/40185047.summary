[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nottington homes plan agreed at second attempt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Revised plans to build 340 homes on farmland that separates Weymouth from a nearby village have been agreed by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Outline planning permission for the development in Nottington, Dorset, was initially refused last July but developer CG Fry appealed against it.
The new decision means a public inquiry, due to take place next month, will no longer go ahead.
More than 70 objections had been lodged against the resubmitted plans.
The land, between Nottington village and the north western fringe of Weymouth, had been earmarked by the local authority in its local plan.
The initial application for the 16.25ha of agricultural land was refused on the grounds there was insufficient evidence about the effects of traffic and the potential for flooding.
In the resubmitted plans, the developer responded to "key issues" including the impact on wildlife, flooding traffic and landscape and the impact on existing residents.
Jean Marshall, head of planning at Weymouth & Portland Borough Council, said: "Once completed this development will deliver a large proportion of much needed open market housing in the area and will provide a large proportion of affordable housing to meet local need."
Ahead of the decision, resident Philip Wakefield said: "We are not against the idea of development per se, what we object to is the running over the people of Nottington and their opinions."
