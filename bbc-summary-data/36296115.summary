The victim was found with stab wounds to the neck and stomach injuries at 17:15 BST on Thursday in Moss Side, Manchester.
He underwent surgery in hospital but died on Saturday, Greater Manchester Police said.
A 17-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of attempted murder has been bailed pending further enquiries.
Police believe the victim was chased near to Greenheys Lane in Moss Side by a group of men.
A short time later, he was hit by a blue Vauxhall Corsa on Moss Lane East, before being stabbed.
The car was later recovered on a small road in Whalley Range, police said.
Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said an investigation was ongoing and appealed for witnesses to the attack.
