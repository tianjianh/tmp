Educating is back for a fourth series aiming to show real life in schools using a fly on the wall format.
The last three series have been praised for showing an insight into what education is like in Britain.
But there's also been criticism they focussed too much on bullying, bad language and teen pregnancies.
As someone who was once a teacher (all be it a substitute) I can tell you there is just as much bad language in a staff room as there is in the common room.
But try not offending someone in 2014.
With that in mind the producers have planned a fourth series and to tick another regional box they've decided to head to Wales for the first time.
The location will be Willows High School in Cardiff where the head teacher has said she's simply "delighted" that the programme will be showing off their high standards.
Over the last few years the school has become one of the most improving schools in Wales.
Head teacher Joy Ballard said: "Willows has been on an incredible journey over the past three years and has been transformed from one of the worst performing schools in the country to a school that we are very proud of."
The nine-episode series will air in autumn.
Executive producer at Channel 4 David Clews said: "You can really feel the charm and character of the place as soon as you walk through the gates and start talking to the students.
"We really are excited about making Educating in Wales."
Channel 4 has been pumping millions of pounds into it's documentary making in the last few years and the Educating series has certainly been a success.
Commissioning editor, David Brindley, said the series "promises to unearth more inspirational, humorous and moving stories from the corridors of this characterful Cardiff school".
