Virginia Hanlon Grohl has interviewed several other famous musicians' mothers as part of the project.
She spoke to Dr Dre's mother Verna Griffin, Amy Winehouse's mother Janis, and the mother of the Haim sisters, Donna Haim.
The book will include a foreword by Dave Grohl, plus childhood photos of the Foo Fighters singer.
Other mothers interviewed for the book include Marianne Stipe, whose son is former REM singer Michael Stipe, as well as Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine's mother Patsy Noah.
According to the book's blurb, Hanlon Grohl will explore whether other musicians' mothers "worried about their children's livelihood and wellbeing in an industry fraught with drugs and other dangers".
She also asked other mothers whether they "encouraged their children's passions despite the odds against success, or attempted to dissuade them from their grandiose dreams".
From Cradle To Stage: Stories From the Mothers who Rocked and Raised Rock Stars will be released in the US in April.
A UK publication date has yet to be confirmed.
