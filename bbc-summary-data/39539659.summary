Leaders Livi had needed just a point to go up and did enough thanks to Scott Pittman and Jackson Longridge goals.
Meanwhile, Airdrieonians leapfrogged Brechin City into third with a 3-1 win.
Stenhousemuir saw off East Fife by the same scoreline, and there were wins for Albion Rovers over Stranraer and Queen's Park over Peterhead.
Iain Russell's double helped Airdrie strengthen their play-off push against Brechin, as he scored the first and last goals at the Excelsior Stadium.
The captain was teed up by Kyle Hutton to open the scoring after 20 minutes, before Kieran MacDonald doubled the advantage just three minutes later.
Jack Leitch's own goal in first-half injury time put the visitors back in contention, but Russell made it 3-1 11 minutes into the second period.
Bottom side Stenhousemuir boosted their survival hopes with a home win over East Fife, as Willie Furtado scored twice.
He gave the hosts the lead just before half-time but Chris Kane drew the Fifers level early in the second period.
Colin McMenamin's penalty just after the hour mark put Stenhousemuir back in front and Furtado got his second with 11 minutes to go to complete the scoring.
Elsewhere, Paul Willis, Ryan Wallace and a Morgyn Neill own-goal gave Albion a 3-0 home win over Stranraer.
And Queen's Park defeated Peterhead 2-0 with goals from on-loan Hearts forward Dario Zanatta and Ryan McGeever.
