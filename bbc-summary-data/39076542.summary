M25 killer Kenneth Noye wins open prison appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Road rage killer Kenneth Noye has won a High Court battle to be moved to an open prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Noye, 69, was convicted of murdering 21-year Stephen Cameron in an attack on the M25 in Kent in 1996.
Afterwards Noye went on the run and was arrested in Spain two years later.
In September 2015 the parole board refused to order his release but recommended he be transferred to an open prison, which was rejected by the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove.
Noye had argued Mr Gove's decision was "unlawful and irrational".
The challenge had been contested by the current Justice Secretary Liz Truss who said there was "nothing irrational" about Mr Gove's decision.
Mr Justice Lavender over-ruled the former justice secretary saying: "It will be for the current Secretary of State to take a fresh decision whether or not to transfer the claimant to an open prison."
