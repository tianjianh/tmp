Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth says he "feels for" Bristol Rovers boss Darrell Clarke before the two meet on Saturday.

Rovers travel to Adams Park seventh in the table a week after being taken over over by the Jordanian Al-Qadi family.
"This season they've done us twice convincingly, Darrell Clarke has done a good job," said Ainsworth.
"I know he's under pressure because it's a big club, they're expected to be around the top and they've had this big takeover, so I do feel for Darrell."
Ainsworth continued to BBC Three Counties Radio: "But he's doing a fantastic job and I'm sure we'll have a tough game on Saturday - we'll be setting up to make sure we will be competitive in the game."
Clarke suffered relegation from League Two with Rovers in 2013-14 while Wycombe stayed up - despite beating the Chairboys with one game to go - and won promotion straight back to the Football League last term.
He says he feels no pressure following the takeover, but last season's losing League Two play-off finalists Wycombe will leapfrog Rovers if they win on Saturday, having dropped from fourth to ninth in the table.
"It's always nice to be the chaser until there's no more games left because it puts that added pressure on those teams above you," said Ainsworth.
"There's some teams coming from nowhere, like Wimbledon, and there's some big clubs around us like Portsmouth, Leyton Orient and Cambridge with their cup money from last year.
"It's going to be a real tasty end to the season. We're going to do our best to be amongst it but at the foreground is our 61-point total, and four wins would do that."
