Home goalkeeper Chris Kirkland expertly denied Wood's looping header as the visitors started brightly.
With ten minutes remaining, Kirkland clumsily brought down Luke Murphy and Chris Wood happily smashed home the resulting penalty.
Deep into stoppage time Hugill slotted home as the game ended in a draw.
With neither side having anything to play for except pride, this game struggled to ignite with few clear-cut chances being created in a somewhat drab first half.
Despite this, the 18,000 fans in attendance saw the game burst into life in a frantic final 10 minutes as Wood put Leeds ahead before Hugill stole a last-gasp point for the home side.
Preston, who were one of the favourites to go down at the start of the season having come up from League One, performed admirably to finish in 11th place.
This season has been chaotic off the field for Leeds, who finish in 13th position, and it still remains to be seen if manager Steve Evans will be in charge next year.
Preston manager Simon Grayson: "I think we deserved at least a point. We played well, the performance epitomised what we are this season, Leeds didn't really look like scoring.
"We showed that character again to get the late goal. A lot of teams would have accepted that they're going to lose the last game of the season 1-0 but not my players.
"We know our strengths and we know our weaknesses but to finish where we have, above lots of more experienced teams, speaks volumes for the players."
Leeds head coach Steve Evans: "I had tears in my eyes because the supporters were fantastic. I thought I knew my future but I don't. It's just the feeling you get.
"I hope it's not the end, I really hope it's not. But if the decision is made for the benefit of the football club then I will endorse it.
"If they've got (Jose) Mourinho parked in the corner then I'd be the first to applaud him onto the pitch.
"I'm going to go home and wait to see what the president decides. I would've loved to have been in on Monday planning pre-season and maybe that will still happen, but who knows?"
