Yorkshire seamer Ryan Sidebottom is not rethinking his plan to retire at the end of the season despite his strong start to the campaign.

The 39-year-old took eight wickets in the County Championship win over Somerset last week.
"I'm totally happy with retiring," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
"To play 20 years and have the career I've had, I'm very lucky. I've always wanted to go out on a high and hopefully I can go away with a trophy."
Sidebottom has taken 16 wickets at an average of 15.18 in his three Championship matches so far this summer.
Andrew Gale's side are second in the County Championship but were beaten by Surrey in the quarter-finals of the One-Day Cup on Tuesday.
Despite the disappointment, Sidebottom feels the side will have benefitted from the experience.
"We've got a lot of young, talented players in the team who got us to that position and I think they will gain from the experience of playing stronger teams," he said.
"We have put our heart and soul into doing better in one-day cricket because we've not been good enough in recent years. Hopefully the younger lads will learn from it.
"Guys like Ben Coad, Matthew Fisher and Matthew Waite have all come through the academy and done brilliantly."
