A Portuguese police investigation which ran until July 2008, and a continuing high-profile international campaign run by her parents Kate and Gerry, have failed to locate her.
Scotland Yard announced it was launching an investigation into Madeleine's disappearance in July 2013 - after spending two years reviewing the case.
On 24 October 2013 it was announced that the Portuguese police had reopened their inquiry into the disappearance, citing "new lines of inquiry". The Scotland Yard inquiry will run alongside the Portuguese investigation.
Madeleine McCann, from Rothley, Leicestershire, went missing from her family's holiday apartment at the Ocean Club, in Praia da Luz, on 3 May, 2007.
Her parents had gone for dinner with a group of seven friends at a tapas restaurant 100 yards from the apartment, but when her mother, Kate, went to check on Madeleine and her younger brother and sister later in the evening, Madeleine was gone.
Police were called and about 60 staff and guests at the complex searched until daybreak for the little girl, while police notified border police, Spanish police and airports.
Hundreds of volunteers joined in the search for Madeleine in the days after.
2007
5 May: The McCanns issue a statement saying they "cannot describe the anguish and despair" they are feeling. Portuguese police say they have a suspect in mind. They believe Madeleine was abducted but is still alive and in Portugal.
12 May: The couple make a fresh appeal for help on their daughter's fourth birthday.
15 May: British-born Robert Murat is made an official suspect - or "arguido" - following a search of his mother's villa. Casa Liliana is 150 yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment.
26 May: Police issue a description of a man seen on the night Madeleine went missing "carrying a child or an object that could have been taken as a child".
17 June: Chief Inspector Olegario Sousa admits vital forensic clues may have been destroyed in the hours after Madeleine's disappearance as the scene was not protected properly.
Late July: British sniffer dogs flown out to Portugal. Keela, who can detect minute quantities of blood, and Eddie, who is trained to detect bodies, work in the apartment and several cars, including the hire car the McCanns had rented 25 days after Madeleine disappeared.
11 August: One hundred days after Madeleine disappeared, investigating officers publicly acknowledge she could be dead. Police say Mr and Mrs McCann are not being considered as suspects following newspaper speculation that they are under suspicion.
31 August: The McCanns launch a libel action against Portuguese newspaper Tal & Qual which claimed "police believe" they killed their daughter. The McCanns say they are "deeply hurt" by the allegations.
6 September: Portuguese police interview Kate McCann for 11 hours as a witness in the presence of her lawyer.
7 September: During further questioning of Mr and Mrs McCann, detectives make them both "arguidos". Later, a family representative says officers believe they have found traces of Madeleine's blood in the McCanns' hire car.

11 September: Portuguese police play down reports that DNA evidence with a 100% match to Madeleine was found in her parents' hire car.

7 April: Portuguese police fly to the UK to sit in on interviews conducted by Leicestershire Police of the so-called "tapas seven".
