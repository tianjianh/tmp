Flintshire public space dog ban plan to cut fouling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dogs could be banned from some public spaces in Flintshire in a bid to tackle fouling and pets running loose.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed Dog Control Public Spaces Protection Order would exclude dogs from sports pitches and children's play areas.
Owners could also be required to put their pets on leads in areas including cemeteries and to carry dog waste bags at all times.
If passed, anyone found breaching the order would be fined.
The proposals include:
The order, which would last for three years, would replace the council's current Dog Control Order.
Chris Bithell, cabinet member for planning and public protection, said: "Of course, it's important to exercise our pets, but we also need to make sure that other members of the public can use our public spaces safely and free from dog waste."
A consultation on the plans runs from 1 to 29 June.
