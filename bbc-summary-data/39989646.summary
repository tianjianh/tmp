Amar Mehraj, 29, was one of four men who gang raped a 17-year-old girl while she was unconscious in July 2009 in Oldbury, West Midlands.
He then left the country but was caught at Birmingham Airport in November.
Police said Mehraj had been jailed for nine years and nine months after admitting taking part in the attack. Three other men were jailed in 2010.
Det Con Mark Timmins of West Midlands Police said: "This was a sickening crime against a vulnerable young girl, who was plied with alcohol and drugs before being sexually abused.
"Protecting young people from harm is a priority for West Midlands Police and partner agencies and we take reports of sexual offences extremely seriously.
"This case just goes to show that we will never give up on bringing offenders to justice.
"Thankfully, justice has finally caught up with Mehraj."
Mehraj, of Giles Road, Oldbury, was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday, having admitted his role in the attack at an earlier hearing.
