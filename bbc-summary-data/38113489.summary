Burton Albion 2-1 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham's winless run stretched to 15 matches as caretaker boss Paul Warne's first game in change ended in defeat at Burton Albion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Brewers hit the front when Chris O'Grady's blocked shot fell to Jackson Irvine, who struck from 10 yards for his seventh goal of the season.
Matty Palmer doubled the lead when he collected a weak clearance and fired a 20-yard shot into the top corner.
Tom Adeyemi converted Joe Mattock's cross for a late Millers consolation.
The Millers began well under Warne, who took charge on an interim basis following Kenny Jackett's resignation on Monday, with Jon Taylor having two shots blocked and Izzy Brown glancing a header wide from six yards.
Warne had threatened to substitute anyone not pulling their weight after 20 minutes, but his side were again sunk by their defensive frailties - they have conceded the most goals in the Football League, including 30 in 10 away matches - with Irvine wasting a clear chance when he shot over with the goal at his mercy.
The match had to be stopped when two flares were thrown on the pitch as away fans vented their frustration, with angry chants directed against former manager Alan Stubbs.
Burton, who have conceded just four goals in their past eight games at the Pirelli Stadium, moved up a place to 19th, while Rotherham's 11th defeat in 12 matches left them bottom and 13 points adrift of safety.
Burton boss Nigel Clough:
"It was hard going at times; they were very spirited and put us on the back foot. That was as badly as we have started for a while.
"It was important to get the goal and wear them down and break their spirit. I am disappointed we conceded, but it doesn't detract from the three points.
"I don't think we play as fluently at home. We will take the three points."
Caretaker manager Paul Warne:
"It's difficult, I gave everything I could today, and I am sorry that it's not enough, it's hard to take.
"I honestly believed if there was a soccer god we would have won today. I am not religious but I believe in fate. I tried to put that into the lads and they gave everything.
"There is no more for me to give. I thought stupidly that would be enough to win the game, but I was wrong.
"No-one is more devastated than me. I wanted to win for the fans, for myself, for my family and for the lads, and I just thought that today would be that day."
