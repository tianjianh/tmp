[SN]TITLE[SN]
BBC county cricket Team of the Season 2014

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This summer, BBC Sport has again broadcast live commentary on every day's play of every match in the county season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was a summer that saw Yorkshire win the County Championship for the first time since 2001, Durham lift the new One-Day Cup trophy and Warwickshire - or rather, their alter ego Birmingham Bears - triumph at Edgbaston in the T20 Blast final.
We asked BBC local radio commentators to nominate players for the 2014 county Team of the Season.
Middlesex skipper Chris Rogers, Lancashire all-rounder Tom Smith, Notts wicketkeeper Chris Read, Durham seam bowler Chris Rushworth, Derbyshire paceman Mark Footitt and Hampshire batsman James Vince were among those unlucky to miss out, but here is the final XI.
"Yorkshire have built their season's success on imposing first-innings scores and Adam Lyth has led the way.
"With more than 1,500 first-class runs - and an average of only a touch under 75 - he has been the stand-out opener of the campaign
"Calm and assured, at the age of 26 he is in his prime, and full England honours cannot be too far away."
By BBC Radio Leeds sports reporter Dave Fletcher
"Worcestershire's success in being promoted for the fifth time in 12 years undoubtedly owed an enormous amount to Saeed Ajmal's 63 wickets in nine matches.
"But it was still an outstanding achievement to do it with such a young team so soon after the loss of their talisman Alan Richardson - now bowling coach at Warwickshire - and without Moeen Ali for much of the season.
"The figurehead was their skipper, Worcestershire-born Daryl Mitchell, who marshalled his inexperienced troops, while leading by example at the crease.
"Despite an end of season slump, three centuries in his first six innings helped him plunder a career-best best summer's haul of Championship runs."
By BBC Midland Sport's Ged Scott
"Injuries have meant that Ed Joyce has needed to bat in every position in the Sussex top five this season, making his achievement in scoring eight first-class hundreds even more remarkable.
"A century in each innings ensured Sussex ended a 30-year drought at Edgbaston, and scoring 103 out of a total of 214 against Somerset at Taunton was a true captain's display.
"The duel against Lancashire at Hove also stands out, with Jimmy Anderson straining every sinew from the Cromwell Road End, and Joyce courageous, defiant, and ultimately victorious.
"A vintage summer from one of the most likeable players on the county circuit, and if he carries this form into the World Cup, Ireland could cause a few surprises."
By BBC Sussex's Adrian Harms
"Wessels has enjoyed the most consistent season of his career in 2014, comfortably passing 1,000 first-class runs for the first time.
"Few would have expected him to be the leading six-hitter in the country, but bowlers were slow to learn, pitch it up and he will hit in the 'V', driving crisply; drop it short and he will put it 20 rows back.
"As befits a fully-paid up member of the wicketkeeper's union, he also has exceptional hands and while waiting for Chris Read to sit out the odd session, he has claimed 22 catches, most of them stunners.
"Often the unsung hero, in a team full of internationals, Riki's form this year should certainly bring him into consideration for an England Lions call-up."
By BBC Radio Nottingham's Dave Bracegirdle
"The emergence of teenage batsman Hain has been one of the highlights of a very good season for Warwickshire.
"Hain was born in Hong Kong and brought up in Australia by English parents, who are regular listeners to the BBC local radio internet commentaries from down under.
"He has declared his allegiance to England and even at this early stage he looks like a Test player in the making, while comparisons with Jonathan Trott are unavoidable because of his mannerisms at the crease.
"The good news for Warwickshire is that because he played youth cricket for Australia, Hain does not qualify for England for another year, so all being well he should be a regular in the Bears team in 2015."
By BBC Coventry & Warwickshire's Clive Eakin
"Rashid has had another impressive season. He is now bowling really well again and his wickets have been crucial towards the end of the season.
"He has registered two centuries and established himself at number six in the order. Rashid is back on England's radar- hence his selection for the winter Performance Programme.
"He is also a splendid fielder and a good all-round team player who could play a key role for England in 2015 if given the opportunity."
By BBC Radio Leeds' Dave Callaghan
"Sam Billings has made astonishing progress in his first full season as Kent wicketkeeper, improving game on game with the gloves, while his batting has been maturing even faster.
"His array of attacking shots include an extravagant sweep with which he can drag balls from almost anywhere into the stands, and he has also proved himself capable of being a 'gun' batsman truly feared by opposition attacks.
"His four-day batting shows every sign that it will soon match his white-ball prowess, while his athleticism behind the stumps is as good as any on the county circuit."
By BBC Radio Kent's Matt Cole
"The New Zealand spinner does not have the world renown of Allan Donald and Brian Lara, but he must be challenging the pair for the title of Warwickshire's best overseas signing.
"This has been the third season in a row he has taken over 50 Championship wickets and has passed 100 wickets in all competitions this summer.
"He came close to turning the One-Day Cup final Warwickshire's way with an outstanding spell of bowling at Lord's.
"His value to Warwickshire increased when he reportedly turned down the opportunity to join New Zealand on their tour of West Indies. Whether he can resist further approaches from his country, which must surely come, remains to be seen."
By BBC Coventry & Warwickshire's Clive Eakin
"Michael Hogan has again been Glamorgan's outstanding bowler, in sight of taking 100 wickets in all competitions for the second successive season.
"Before the final game against Hampshire, he had taken 96 wickets - this despite missing three Championship games at the start of the season.
"Allied to his skill as a bowler is his ability to stay fit and his willingness to play in every game. Had he not started his first-class career until his late 20s, he would most certainly have played for Australia - indeed there are many who say he should have been given the opportunity last year.
"Glamorgan would have been relieved to have seen him agree a long-term contract last season, as he is an invaluable member of the team and a model professional cricketer."
By BBC Radio Wales' Edward Bevan
"It's probably true to say that Steve Magoffin's debut for Sussex against Lancashire in 2012 went largely unnoticed by the cricket media.
"However those of us at Liverpool who witnessed his match figures of 9-55 in cold April conditions realised that Sussex had stumbled across a rare gem.
"With international call-ups and injuries decimating the Sussex seam attack this season, he has at times carried it almost single-handed.
"Bowling over 500 overs so far this season is a fantastic testament to the fitness of a man who will turn 35 in December. Remarkably, he remains uncapped by Australia."
By BBC Sussex's Adrian Harms
"Jack Brooks has gone from Minor Counties cricket with Oxfordshire to becoming the go-to strike bowler for the county champions in the space of six years.
"He has the pace to trouble any batsman in the country, as his 64 Championship wickets prove.
"His new-ball partnership with veteran Ryan Sidebottom, who he admits he once watched from afar in admiration, has to be the most potent in the county game."
