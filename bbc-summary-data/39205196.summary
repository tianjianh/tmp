Chloe Gilbert, 15, from Seend, Wiltshire, died in Southgate shopping centre in Bath, on Sunday 5 March.
Her family described her as "beautiful and talented".
"The cause of Chloe's death has yet to be ascertained, however we believe it may have been as a result [of] something she had eaten," they said in a statement.
"Chloe was diagnosed from an early age with an allergy to dairy products.
"Our whole family and so many of Chloe's friends have been left devastated at this sudden and tragic event.
"We urge anyone who has an allergy to seek immediate medical assistance if they believe they are suffering any form of reaction."

Investigations into the cause of death are ongoing.
