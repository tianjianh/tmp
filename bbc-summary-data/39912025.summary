Defender Laurent Koscielny could again miss out because of a calf problem, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is sidelined by a hamstring injury.
Everton manager Ronald Koeman has no new injury concerns ahead of the game.
It remains to be seen whether the match will mark the last Everton appearance for Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley, whose futures at the club are in doubt.
John Motson: "Arsenal have not allowed Manchester City or Liverpool to shake them off in the pursuit of a top-four finish but they know that even a seventh win in eight games might not be enough this time.
"The Gunners may yet earn an additional shot at qualifying for the Champions League for a 21st consecutive season by forcing a play-off. For that to happen, they need to finish level on points, goal difference and goals scored with either City or Liverpool.
"A sub-plot to the game is the personal battle for the Premier League's Golden Boot between Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, who have 24 and 23 goals respectively.
"Both have now been usurped by Tottenham's Harry Kane but the Belgian or the Chilean would strengthen their summer bargaining position if they can overhaul him."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger on his side's prospects of a top-four finish: "I am not a betting man. It doesn't matter about chances. We are professional and we want to win.
"We just want everyone to play 100% in their last game, that is usually the way in England. We just have to focus on our game."
Everton manager Ronald Koeman: "You work hard to get to the highest position in the table, you know if you are seventh then you have to play Europa League football.
"The Champions League is the next step. If we can do our business this summer then the team for next season will be really strong.
"If we have a stronger team the expectation will be higher, that's okay. I know I can deal with the pressure."
Everton will finish seventh whatever happens and they will make a game of it, but the Gunners are on a good run and I think they will come out on top.
However, even if Arsenal do win, I think it will be too little, too late as far as making the Champions League places goes.
