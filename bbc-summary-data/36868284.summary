The 23-year-old Spaniard joined Villa from Valencia for Â£3.2m in January 2015 on a four-and-a-half year contract.
Gil scored two goals in 28 appearances for Villa last season as they were relegated from the top flight for the first time since 1987.
Deportivo finished 15th in the Spanish top flight last term.
Gil's departure comes after new Villa boss Roberto Di Matteo promised to trim his playing squad ahead of the new season.
