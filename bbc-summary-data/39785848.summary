Politicians woo voters ahead of 4 May poll

Political parties will be taking to the streets in the last day of campaigning ahead of Thursday's local elections.

A total of 4,851 council seats are up for grabs across England, Wales and Scotland on 4 May.
The poll will give voters a chance to deliver verdicts on the major parties before the general election, which is being held on 8 June.
There are also eight mayoral elections, including elections in six new "combined local authorities".
The Manchester Gorton parliamentary by-election triggered by the death of Labour MP Gerald Kaufman was also due to take place, but has now been delayed until the day of the general election.
Theresa May stunned the political establishment by calling a snap general election last month, saying she wanted a stronger mandate as she heads into negotiations on taking Britain out of the European Union.
It means that, unusually, the local elections are taking place in the middle of a general election campaign.
Mrs May will be hoping her "strong and stable" government mantra will help the Conservatives gain council seats and take outright control of a slew of councils that are currently hung.
Conservative Party Chairman Patrick McLoughlin said voters on 4 May have a "clear choice" between "the competence of strong Conservative councils and elected mayors who will keep local taxes down with quality local services, versus the disarray of the rest".
"Conservative councils and mayors deliver more for less, improving local services and standing up for local people," he said.
Jeremy Corbyn will be hoping to confound the polls and show Labour is moving forward under his leadership - while UKIP faces a tough battle to hold on to the seats it won in England in 2013.
The Labour leader accused the Conservatives of "running our country down in every way", adding: "Labour councils are making a difference... stepping up where the government fails to act."
UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said his party's councillors have a track record of fighting to keep costs down, opposition to increases in councillor allowances and always "put local needs above party affiliation".
The elections will also indicate whether the Liberal Democrats are beginning to rebuild support after taking a hit in these seats four years ago, and at the 2015 general election.
Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who is heading to Oxford to rally activists ahead of the local elections, said his party was "going into these local elections bigger than ever before, with a clear message and a growing sense of momentum".
The party reached 101,832 members on Tuesday afternoon, eclipsing the previous watermark of 101,768 set in 1994. Mr Farron added: "You don't need to agree with us on everything to agree that Britain needs a strong opposition to fight for you and your communities against Tory cuts to our schools, our NHS and our social care services."
In Scotland, the Conservatives want to repeat the 2016 Holyrood election which saw them replace Labour as the second largest party.
However, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has urged voters to back her party in the local elections to protest against both Conservative "austerity" and SNP plans for a second independence referendum.
But Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the local government elections "are not about independence". Describing them as "vitally important", she added that "a vote for the SNP in this election is a vote to protect local services".
The Scottish Greens are fielding a record 218 candidates and say they are building on existing councillor numbers in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeenshire, Midlothian and Stirling, and making breakthroughs in many other local authorities.
All 32 Scottish councils (1,227 seats) have elections. In 2012, the SNP won the most seats, but Labour was not far behind.
Apart from Anglesey, the Welsh councils (22 councils, 1,254 seats) were last contested in 2012, That was a very strong year for Labour, which made over 200 net gains at the expense of all the other parties.
In England, (34 councils, 2,370 seats) this is a year of county council elections - a traditional area of strength for the Conservatives.
For the first time voters in Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City region, the West Midlands, Tees Valley, the West of England and Cambridge and Peterborough will elect new metro mayors.
These mayors will mostly be responsible for economic development in their regions, but some will have powers over transport and housing.
Doncaster and North Tyneside are also voting for local authority mayors, who are elected leaders of their respective councils.
BBC senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes urged caution over reading too much into the results of the local elections "to project the outcome of the general election"
"People vote differently in council elections - even in cases when they're held on the same day as a general election," he said.
"For example, the Liberal Democrats tend to do better at the local level. And there are still five weeks to go until 8 June. So while the results that are announced on Thursday night and Friday will give us some indications about how the general election might go, they won't tell us with any certainty what the outcome will be."
