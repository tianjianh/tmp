[SN]TITLE[SN]
Church 'colluded' with sex abuse bishop Peter Ball

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior figures in the Church of England "colluded" with a former bishop who abused young men, an independent review has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Ball, who is now 85, was jailed for 32 months in October 2015 after admitting sex offences against 18 teenagers and young men.
The former bishop of Lewes and bishop of Gloucester carried out the abuse between the 1970s and 1990s
Dame Moira Gibb's review criticises ex-Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey.
He has been asked to step down from his position as an honorary assistant bishop by the current archbishop, Justin Welby.
Dame Moira, a former senior social worker, said there was a failure of the Church to respond appropriately to misconduct over a period of many years.
Ball was released from jail in February after serving 16 months.
In her report, "An Abuse of Faith", Dame Moira said: "Ball's priority was to protect and promote himself and he maligned the abused.
"The church colluded with that rather than seeking to help those he had harmed, or assuring itself of the safety of others."
Her review found that Lord Carey received seven letters following the arrest and cautioning of Ball in 1992, and failed to pass them to the police.
Ball was not listed on the Church of England's "Lambeth List", which names clergymen about whom questions of suitability for ministry have been raised.
Ball was given funds authorised by Lord Carey to support him.
Lord Carey also wrote to Ball's brother, Michael Ball - another bishop - in 1993 saying: "I believed him to be basically innocent".
