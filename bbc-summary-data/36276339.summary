The Edinburgh-based start-up attracted high-profile investors such as Skyscanner founder Gareth Williams and Macklin Enterprise Partnerships founder Marie Macklin.
The investment will help the firm target international markets.
Appointedd said its suite of tools allowed small firms to manage their business entirely online.
Its online booking software is designed to assist businesses that "sell time", such as photographers, salon owners, physiotherapists, personal trainers and consultants.
The Scottish Investment Bank was involved in the investment round, which was led by business angel syndicate Equity Gap.
Last month Appointedd announced it had been selected as one of 12 integrated software systems in an app platform curated by National Australia Bank. The deal will see Appointedd's software being offered to 700,000 small and medium sized firms across Australia.
Appointedd founder and chief executive Leah Hutcheon, who is an ambassador for Women's Enterprise Scotland and Entrepreneurial Scotland, said: "It has been fantastic to get such a positive reaction from investors at this round.
"We have felt extremely honoured to attract investment from the founder of one of Scotland's unicorn companies and experienced entrepreneurs like Marie Macklin CBE.
"We look forward to using their expertise to help expand our software globally.
"We are already seeing some amazing traction, and it's exciting to be working with partners like National Australia Bank."
Gareth Williams said: "It's been a pleasure to watch the Appointedd product hone over time and I'm excited to be involved in the next stage of their growth.
"The software has the potential to be the leader in a huge market and I look forward to watching their international expansion."
