Inspectors question Powys home care plans' schedule

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inspectors have questioned Powys council's prospects of improving social services after a failed reorganisation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were complaints of neglect after the council cut its list of almost 30 home care providers to four in 2014.
Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW) said the authority faced difficulties modernising services.
Brecon and Radnorshire AM Kirsty Williams said her "grave concerns" had been realised but the council said the report was a "positive" step.
The inspectorate said it would monitor Powys's improvement plans.
CSSIW noted that the quality of care had improved since April and, while people were likely to complain in the past, they were now likely to be "very happy" with services.
In 2013, inspectors highlighted what they called an "increasingly urgent need" to modernise delivery of adult social services.
BBC Wales revealed in April that Powys had terminated the contract of Alpha Home Care - one of its largest suppliers - following critical inspections.
Contracts with three other providers have ended and another withdrawn.
The report said the council's commissioning approach in 2013-14 was "flawed in concept, design, and delivery", and that senior managers were not experienced in this area.
Despite reports of improved satisfaction for some families, it added: "Powys faces a very demanding and ambitious schedule to modernise social services and the failure of the commissioning framework for domiciliary care has made this more difficult.
"The prospects therefore are uncertain and questions remain about the future arrangements."
The council said the report recognised that "significant progress" had been made.
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said she expressed "grave concerns" about the council's "ill-conceived plans" in 2013.
"I take absolutely no pleasure in reading this report which confirms those concerns were realised," she said.
"Whilst the report says things are improving I continue to receive complaints that there is still a lack of staff available, people remain trapped in hospital and there is still a great uncertainty for staff.
"So clearly there is a way to go before people in Powys have the service they need and deserve."
