[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dive boat Sabre Two got into difficulty on Sunday afternoon.
Kyle Lifeboat was launched at 14:30 and its volunteer crew went to the aid of the three people with the boat.
The boat was later refloated on a high tide but within minutes it sank. The RNLI crew believed the grounding had damaged the underside of the vessel.
