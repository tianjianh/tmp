Sport NI: Minister to meet remaining board members

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland's Sports Minister Carál Ní Chuilín is due to meet the board of Sport NI later to discuss the way forward for the troubled organisation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nine out of 14 board members resigned on Monday.
They have not yet explained why they stood down.
Ms Ní Chuilín has said she was "disappointed" about the resignations, but said the board would continue to function in the immediate future.
Later on Wednesday, she is due to meet the five remaining board members, although some of them are on holiday.
It is a complex situation, complicated further by concerns about working practices within Sport NI.
At least 10 employees have made complaints.
The minister is due to appear before a Stormont committee on Thursday to explain how she plans to sort out the problems with the board and the staff.
