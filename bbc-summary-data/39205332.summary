The incident happened at about 15:30 on Tuesday near Blackburn.
The farmer was assaulted by three people who then stole the keys to his green Honda 420cc quad bike and drove off with it.
The farmer was not seriously injured but police described it as a "despicable attack".
The thieves are male, white and about 18 or 19, with local accents.
One was about 6ft, he was thin and wearing a dark hooded top and bottoms with the hood pulled tight around his face.
The second man was about 5ft 10in, of stocky build and tanned.
He was wearing a black tracksuit with a hood up and around his face.
The third attacker was about 5ft 11in and thin.
He was wearing a light grey tracksuit and had a balaclava covering his nose and mouth.
All three were said to be covered in mud.
Officers are appealing for anyone with information to contact them.
PC Craig Ireland, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a despicable attack on a farmer going about his business for the purpose of stealing his quad bike.
"Thankfully, he was not seriously injured in this robbery but he has been deprived of a vehicle he needs to do the day-to-day work on the farm.
"We are keen to speak to anyone with information that can assist us with this investigation."
