The drone carried a box of bread and milk and reached its destination 500 metres away in about four minutes.
In another test flight, the drone successfully delivered boiled eggs without any of the shells cracking.
The drone flew 30 metres away from people, to ensure it wasn't breaking air safety rules in Japan.
Japan hopes to put the service into use by 2018. It's hope it will help people living in unpopulated, rural areas.
Before launching the service, more studies are planned to see how the drones will work in bad weather and to address any safety concerns of residents.
