Norburn, 24, had been offered a new deal by the Silkmen after scoring five goals in 24 league games in 2016-17.
However, he has decided to join National League rivals Tranmere, whom he scored against in both legs of the FA Trophy semi-final in March.
The former Bristol Rovers and Guiseley player's deal until the end of the 2018-19 season is subject to a medical.
"Ollie is a player we watched closely last season and I'm pleased we are able to bring him to the club," Tranmere manager Micky Mellon told the club website.
"He fits into the type of player that we want to bring to Tranmere: he's young, hungry and ambitious."
Meanwhile, midfielder Lois Maynard has left Tranmere to join Salford City after scoring five goals in 68 appearances for Rovers.
Tranmere had been expected to offer new terms to Maynard after losing the League Two play-off final to Forest Green Rovers, but the 28-year-old decided instead to drop down a division and play for Salford, who finished fourth in National League North.
