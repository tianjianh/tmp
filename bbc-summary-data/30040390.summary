[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland head coach Vern Cotter has opted for the same starting line-up that beat Argentina for Saturday's autumn Test against New Zealand.

Scotland ran in five tries in the 41-31 win, with brothers Jonny and Richie Gray, Stuart Hogg, Sean Maitland and Tommy Seymour all crossing.
Cotter said: "I really enjoyed watching the players play for each other against Argentina.
"It was fantastic, as was our ability to get over the line and score."
The New Zealander added: "The XV who started last weekend played very well and, since we only have a short time together, it's good to be able to reinforce these combinations and the team cohesion."
Saturday's man of the match, Greig Laidlaw, will once again orchestrate the Scots' back division alongside stand-off Finn Russell and a young midfield partnership of Alex Dunbar and Mark Bennett.
Packing down with the second-row Gray brothers is the experienced front-row trio of Alasdair Dickinson, Ross Ford and Euan Murray - and the back-row combination of Rob Harley, Blair Cowan and Adam Ashe.
Cotter has made changes to Scotland's replacements' bench.
Glasgow Warriors forwards Fraser Brown (hooker) and Tim Swinson (lock) replace Scott Lawson and Jim Hamilton, while Johnnie Beattie and Chris Cusiter come in for Alasdair Strokosch and the injured Henry Pyrgos.
The head coach was also forced into a late change after second row Tim Swinson injured his back in training. He has been replaced by back row forward David Denton
And, while Cotter knows earning a first-ever win over the world champion All Blacks is a tall order, he insists Scotland have a chance of making history at Murrayfield.
"We showed last weekend that we're developing an attack that can cause opposition teams problems," he added.
"If we can force the All Blacks into making errors then we can give ourselves a chance.
"But we do know that we're coming up against a very aggressive defence and a very strong attack.
"They are relentless and probably improve during the game."
Scotland team to play New Zealand: Stuart Hogg; Sean Maitland, Mark Bennett, Alex Dunbar, Tommy Seymour; Finn Russell, Greig Laidlaw; Alasdair Dickinson, Ross Ford, Euan Murray, Richie Gray, Jonny Gray, Rob Harley, Blair Cowan, Adam Ashe.
Replacements: Fraser Brown, Gordon Reid, Geoff Cross, Dave Denton, Johnnie Beattie, Chris Cusiter, Duncan Weir, Sean Lamont.
