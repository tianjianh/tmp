Goals by Lucy Bronze, Izzy Christiansen, Jill Scott and World Player of the Year, Carli Lloyd, sealed their victory in front of a record crowd at Wembley Stadium.
The win means Manchester City now hold all three domestic titles - the Women's FA Cup, the Women's Super League and the Continental Cup.
They're the first team to do so since Arsenal Ladies in 2011.
