Dog owners are being urged to take selfies with their pets as part of a campaign to mark a year since a dogs' home was destroyed by fire.

Sixty animals died in the arson attack on Manchester Dogs' Home last September. More than 100 dogs were rescued from the fire by volunteers.
Staff have asked dog owners to post photos online using the hashtag #hugyourhound.
A spokeswoman said the idea was intended to be "a show of solidarity".
"It's celebrating the bond between people and dogs, because that's what moved so many people to help," she said.
Hundreds of volunteers helped the home's residents, arriving at the scene of the fire with blankets, toys and food.
Steve Mapley, the home's manager, said: "During our darkest time, we were buoyed and hugely encouraged by the incredible wave of love and support we received."
Well-wishers went on to raise more than Â£2m to help rebuild the facility, in Moss Brook Road, Harpurhey, which will partially reopen later this month.
A three-year-rebuild project is continuing at the site, where a small block will reopen for adoptions "imminently".
Greater Manchester Police has also issued a new appeal for information.
Ch Insp Neil Jones said: "On the first anniversary, we are hoping that the memories of that night may prompt people's thoughts.
"I am appealing to members of the community to search their consciences, and if they have any information about who was behind this deliberate attack, then please do the right thing and call us."
Two teenagers were held on suspicion of arson but released without charge.
