Some 130 secondary school students were in the lorry when it crashed on Sunday night as it travelled from Gitega city southwards to Rutana province.
A local mayor told AFP news agency 13 students had died on the spot, along with adults accompanying them.
The final death toll could be as high as 27, she added.
Injured survivors were evacuated to hospitals nearby.
The mayor of Musongati district told the BBC Great Lakes service that 15 members of a school choir had died on the way back from a visit to another school.
She said the students would be buried together because they died while they were on a "gospel mission".
The cause of the accident is not yet known.
