City's 2-1 EFL Cup win at The Liberty on Wednesday was their ninth consecutive win since Guardiola's appointment.
Spaniard Rangel is impressed with the way his compatriot has adapted to English football.
"He's a maestro at what he does," Rangel told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
The former Barcelona and FC Bayern manager has made City the team to beat in the Premier League, according to Rangel.
"He's shown everywhere that he's been that he's a top manager," he said.
"At the moment Man City are looking like the best team in the UK."
Rangel says he is relishing the prospect of trying to stop Sergio Aguero.
The City striker missed Wednesday's match with the Swans as he sat out the last game of a a three match suspension.
"We've played against him a few times now and we know what he's capable of," added Rangel.
"He's scored a few goals against us. At the end of the day you're in this league to play against the best. And you have to challenge yourself against the best."
Rangel says Swansea must "go back to basics" if they are to start winning games.
The Swans have lost three and drawn one of their last four and the pressure is mounting on boss Francesco Guidolin.
"There were are a lot of positives to take from the [Man City] game. We showed a bit of character and we looked more compact. We defended well until their first goal," Rangel explained.
"But at this level it's about winning and losing. It's as simple as that.
"It's about being honest with each other and working on the simple things. In a difficult time you have to go back to basics.
"There was better communication on the pitch [on Wednesday]. We looked solid and we kept them quiet for a long time.
"We have to do the same in the league [on Saturday]. It isn't going to be easy.
"Going back to basics doesn't mean that we'll start winning games again. But we know that we need to improve."
