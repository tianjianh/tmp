Braintree Town 1-1 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers' hopes of automatic promotion from the National League were dented as they were held to a draw by play-off hopefuls Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Braintree took the lead through Kenny Davis' penalty after Chez Isaac was brought down by James Jennings.
The visitors equalised shortly after through Darren Carter's driven effort into the bottom left-hand corner.
Mitch Brundle nearly won it for Braintree but his firm header struck the bar as the game ended all square.
Forest Green have now drawn their last five games meaning they sit six points behind leaders Cheltenham with just three games remaining, whilst Braintree are one place outside the play-offs in sixth.
Forest Green boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"I thought we dominated the game, especially the first half - the penalty was disappointing to concede and from there you're chasing your tail a little bit.
"We scored a good goal and played well first half; the pitch was very bumpy and lively. We're frustrated but we move on.
"Fair play to Cheltenham - they've been consistent enough but I think they've got one hand on the trophy - we've got to keep playing well and make sure we go in to the play-offs in good form."
