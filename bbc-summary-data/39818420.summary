Relegated Port Vale have received an offer from a Burslem-based IT company to buy the League One club.

Following owner Norman Smurthwaite's decision to stand down as chairman, Synectics Solutions have made an offer of £1.25m, reports BBC Radio Stoke.
That is the same figure Smurthwaite and his former business partner Paul Wildes paid when they bought Port Vale out of administration in November 2012.
Synectics Solutions is owned by Kevin and Carol Shanahan, from Stafford.
They moved the business from Newcastle-under-Lyme to Hamil Road, Burslem, close to Vale Park, two years ago.
They say they would not have to borrow money to buy the club and have the funds to run it.
Smurthwaite has previously said that he has put £3.7m worth of loans into Port Vale since he has been the owner.
Vale, who confirmed the appointment of Michael Brown as their manager on Wednesday, were relegated last Sunday after four seasons in League One.
Port Vale have agreed one-year contracts with three of their young players - midfielder Billy Reeves, 20, goalkeeper Ryan Boot, 22, and striker Dan Turner, 18.
Welshman Reeves, who has an option to extend the deal when it expires in June 2018, follows the lead set by Danny Pugh on Thursday.
He has made 12 appearances, eight of them as substitute, since making his debut at Southend in early March.
Boot, who made his first Vale appearance in the 2-2 home draw with Bury in January, has previously been out on loan in non-league with Worcester City (twice) and Macclesfield Town.
Turner, who spent two months out on loan at Worcester, has made 19 appearances, mostly as substitute, but is yet to score his first goal.
