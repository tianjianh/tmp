Ms Rigney started working at Tacoma General Hospital in Washington state in 1946. It was her lifelong dream since she was a girl, local media reported.
A video from the hospital shows Ms Rigney crying as she receives gifts from co-workers.
She works two days a week at Tacoma General, though in a lesser capacity than she used to.
Washington Governor Jay Inslee, had a special message for Ms Rigney, read out to her by a colleague in the video uploaded to YouTube by a fellow nurse.
"Our nation's oldest working registered nurse... still runs circles around colleagues half her age after six decades of service," Mr Inslee said.
"She has built a tremendous legacy of service over the years and her continued engagement in nursing is a testament to her unceasing energy and compassion for those in need."
Ms Rigney thanked her co-workers and said she was grateful to be 90 years old and still working at the hospital.
"I know I'm a pain in the you-know-what," she said. "Thank you all."
