The visitors went ahead through a Forrester half-volley, before Miller made it 2-0 with a powerful finish.
The hosts attempted a comeback when Mark O'Hara punished poor marking from a corner to head home on 44 minutes.
Having been in command, Rangers then spent the second half defending shakily at Dens Park.
Rangers drew at home with Hamilton Academical on the opening day of the season, and despite picking up three points at Dundee on Saturday, manager Mark Warburton was faced again with the best and worst of his side - swift and clever attacking play, but defending that lacked authority.
Forrester, booked in the second half and not punished for two further late challenges, was an elusive figure, carrying his attacking threat into menacing areas with casual, drifting runs that Dundee struggled to contain.
But the midfielder was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card after a couple of hefty and untidy challenges. He was quickly replaced by striker Michael O'Halloran.
As well as creative play, he was also capable of aggressive determination, and that quality was evident with the opening goal of the game.
Barrie McKay lifted the ball to Forrester inside the penalty area and he used his strength to lash a half-volley past Dundee goalkeeper Scott Bain.
Rangers began to perform with composure and momentum and some of the passes were almost instinctive. McKay and Lee Wallace linked up well to set up Miller who powered home.
Jordan Rossiter's understated authority in the holding role was the basis of much of Rangers' play, which brought an additional element to their game.
Some familiar failings remain, though, and Dundee took full advantage. When Danny Williams slung a corner into the area, O'Hara rose to nod past Rangers goalkeeper Wes Foderingham.
Dundee, who have lost forwards Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart following moves south, had been unable to disrupt Rangers' control of the first half and Rory Loy was isolated up front for the home side.
O'Hara's goal from a set piece provided an opportunity to alter the flow of the game. With the defender's rangy runs from midfield providing impetus, Dundee sought an equaliser and Michael Duffy steered one effort wide and substitute Yordi Teijsse hit a shot straight at Foderingham.
Rangers should have been further ahead if Miller had been more decisive with two clear opportunities.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton said: "There was resilience, but we shouldn't have to show resilience. I thought we were very, very good in the first half. We controlled the game and our movement was good. We created chance after chance and Lee Wallace was excellent on the left-hand side.
"We should have been more clinical, and then in the second half we shouldn't have to show resilience. First half, it should have been game over. It could have been four or five with the chances we had."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley said: "I felt O'Hara was absolutely outstanding today. He showed what he can do at 20 years of age. His running power was superb. That was the pleasing thing for me, he gets his goal but his marking was excellent and he dominated the game second half.
"As soon as I spoke to him I wanted him playing central midfield pushing forward. I wasn't interested in him playing right-back or in defence. We just changed his position a little bit and it just showed you. At 20 he can only get better. He has great energy, a great engine and he scores goals."
