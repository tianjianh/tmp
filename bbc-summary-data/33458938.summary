Denbighshire school music service saved from axe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A school music service has been taken over by a new group after it was threatened with closure due to cash cuts by Denbighshire council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parents raised a near 4,000-name petition calling on the council to save the service which provides music lessons in schools and runs ensembles.
The new Denbighshire Music Co-Operative will teach over 2,200 pupils each week from September, said the council.
The not-for-profit organisation has also protected the jobs of 34 teachers.
"We have offered a long term loan of the council's musical instruments to the new co-operative, which means that our children and young people can continue to use their instruments," said Councillor Eryl Williams, the council cabinet's lead member for education.
