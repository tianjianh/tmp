More than 20 staff have left Holliers Walk in Hinckley, Leicestershire, after a new management team was put in place two-and-a-half years ago.
One ex-teacher said they ended up taking an overdose due to the treatment they received.
The school said the allegations were "concerning" and said it was taking immediate action.
Last year, the school was rated good by Ofsted, and praised for its strong leadership.
However, Greg Jones, from the National Union of Teachers, said there was a climate of "harassment and bullying" at the school.
Former teacher Laura Moore said she lost her confidence and was at breaking point due to her treatment by some members of the senior management team.
She said: "It was an atmosphere of fear.
"It wasn't just one-off things, it was constant - telling you to do something, then telling you it was wrong."
Another ex-teacher, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC: "I just couldn't sleep, I was so upset I ended up taking an overdose of tablets - that was the lowest point and that's when I knew I had to leave."
Jane Cook, deputy head of the school, said "Firstly, it is important to stress that all types of bullying are totally unacceptable at our school and will not be tolerated.
"We take any allegation very seriously and once we are made aware of the specific details of these claims, we will take swift action to investigate."
A spokesperson for Leicestershire County Council said: "We will be investigating the facts and gathering more information, before deciding whether any further action is required."
The authority said many of the 25 staff who had left moved to other jobs or retired.
