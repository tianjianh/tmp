The crewman is believed to have fallen from the Southampton-based ship in the early morning, Cunard said.
The company said an emergency search was under way off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.
A spokeswoman said the cruise liner had been turned around to retrace its route to search for the man.
She said: "We have clearly established that the crew member went overboard earlier this morning.
"The ship is off the coast of Newfoundland and has now retraced its route to search for the crew member.
"We are working closely with local authorities."
The ship, which left Southampton on Tuesday, is scheduled to arrive in Halifax on Monday.
