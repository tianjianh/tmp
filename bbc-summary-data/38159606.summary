[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Publication of a report into the Shoreham air disaster in which 11 men were killed has been delayed, the BBC has learned.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) had hoped to publish its findings later this year.
But the BBC was told the report has been put back following a request for more time to respond by one of the parties involved.
A vintage jet crashed on to the A27 at the Shoreham air show in August 2015.
The pilot, Andrew Hill, 51, survived the crash and is being investigated for manslaughter.
Plans were put in place for an inquest to begin in March, but neither Sussex Police's investigation nor the full AAIB report have yet been published.
The police report is not expected until the new year at the earliest.
West Sussex senior coroner Penelope Schofield said this month she was anxious to ensure the inquests are dealt with in a timely manner, but it was anticipated little progress could be made without the police and AAIB reports.
