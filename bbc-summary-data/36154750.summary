Tour de Romandie: Geraint Thomas into third as Marcel Kittel wins stage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Geraint Thomas moved into third overall as Marcel Kittel won the first stage of the six-day Tour de Romandie in Switzerland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Germany's Kittel won a sprint finish ahead of Niccolo Bonifazio of Italy.
Tour de France winner Chris Froome, targeting a third Romandie victory, finished in the peloton.
Spaniard Jon Izagirre, who won Tuesday's prologue, kept his overall lead as Welshman Thomas moved up from fourth to third.
The stage was shortened to 100km because of overnight snow and slippery roads, and the threat of ice and hail.
