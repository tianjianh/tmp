The 35-year-old Dutchman has joined the Scottish Premiership champions from Nottingham Forest on a two-year deal.
Scotland international Craig Gordon has been first choice over the past two seasons and keepers Leo Fasan and Logan Bailly are also at the club.
"If you've got no self belief, you've got no place in being there and playing for a big club like this," said De Vries.
"Craig has it, Logan has it, I'm sure Fasan has it as well and myself, I've got it. It will be an interesting battle.
"It's up to the manager's [Brendan Rodgers'] decision. I played well last year at Forest.
"I just hope to bring that momentum towards this season and bring that positive attitude that I had last year.
"I respect the goalkeepers who are here. Craig Gordon's a great goalkeeper, Logan Bailly the same and with young Leonardo Fasan coming through the ranks as well, there's good competition going on."
De Vries first played in Scotland with Dunfermline Athletic in 2006, moving to Swansea the following year before subsequent moves to Wolves and Forest.
He was at Swansea when Rodgers took over at the Welsh club and also revealed: "A couple of years ago when Brendan Rodgers was the manager at Liverpool, he tried to sign me. That deal never happened, unfortunately.
"I'm glad that even at this stage of my career that I can have a move like this. I'm glad to be here. There's a lot to play for."
Celtic host Hapoel Beer Sheva in Wednesday's Champions League play-off first leg but De Vries is recovering from an ankle injury.
"It's great to have those opportunities to play in Europe and just compete with the best in Europe," he added.
"They've earned the right to be in this play-off to reach the group stage of the Champions League.
"My first goal is just to get fit in the next couple of days. Hopefully, I'll be training on Thursday."
