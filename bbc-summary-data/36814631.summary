Left-back Shaw has been out since suffering a double fracture of his right leg last September and played the first half against the Latics.
New United signings Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Eric Bailly also started as they made their debuts at the DW Stadium.
Goals from Will Keane and Andreas Pereira gave United a 2-0 win.
Mourinho's other summer signing, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, was absent, as the Swedish forward is on holiday having played at Euro 2016.
England players Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford and Chris Smalling were also unavailable following their international commitments. Mourinho confirmed the trio will go on the club's pre-season tour of China but will not play against Borussia Dortmund or Manchester City.
The Wigan game was goalless at half-time but Mourinho made seven changes at the break, with Keane and Juan Mata among those coming on.
United then took the lead when Latics keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen's mistake allowed Mata to square for Keane to sidefoot home.
Just before the hour Pereira made it 2-0, firing home after Ander Herrera's shot was blocked.
"When I found Luke Shaw in the training ground, it was a surprise for me because I thought he cannot be ready," said Mourinho.
"But he did fantastic in the summer, sacrificed his holiday, staying in the city and training every day. He is trying hard and was mad to play more than 45 minutes but for me, it's better 45 safe than more, so let's go step by step."
