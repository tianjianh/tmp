A ferry which crashed into a pier on the Isle of Man as the captain tried to dock in strong winds has returned to service between the island and the UK.

Services were disrupted after the Ben-my-Chree, which sailed from Heysham, Lancashire, struck the pier on Sunday. No passengers or crew were injured.
The ferry returned to action earlier and four trips across the Irish Sea are scheduled.
A number of crossings were cancelled following the the collision.
The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's chief executive Mark Woodward apologised to passengers and said it had been an "unfortunate incident".
