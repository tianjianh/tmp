The Englishman, 40, announced on Friday he will be out for four months with arthritic problems in his right foot.
Poulter said he was "truly honoured",  adding: "Everyone who knows me knows how much the Ryder Cup means."
Thomas Bjorn, Paul Lawrie and Padraig Harrington have already been named as vice-captains by skipper Darren Clarke.
This year's Ryder Cup takes place at Hazeltine National in Minnesota, USA, from 30 September-2 October.
Poulter has competed for Europe at the past five Ryder Cups, taking 14 points from 18 matches.
"The best moments of my career have come when I have been wearing the blue and gold crest of Europe on my chest, knowing at the same time that the contest means so much to every player and fan," he added.
"We have a tremendous record in the Ryder Cup in recent times, having played with passion, desire and commitment," he said.
"It is something we should be proud of and I will do everything in my power to maintain that intensity and help Europe's quest to retain the trophy."
