The Grangetown man was quizzed on Wednesday over claims of assisting in the preparation of an act of terrorism.
South Wales Police confirmed it was investigating a possible connection.
The North West Counter Terrorism Unit and the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit took the teenager in.
His arrest under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 was assisted by officers from Greater Manchester Police.
It comes as a man believed to be one of three people from Cardiff who have joined jihadist group Isis in Syria told BBC Wales he is prepared to die for the cause.
Aseel Muthana, 17, left Britain in February to join his older brother Nasser in the country and says he has no plans to return.
In an online conversation with a reporter from BBC Wales' Week In Week Out programme, he described seeing "martyrs" to militant group Isis's cause and said he would be "willing to die" for the cause.
He said: "Jihad is obligatory."
The video, thought to be filmed in Syria, showed Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan, both 20 and from Cardiff, appeared online two weeks ago.
The pair, who appeared along with a man from Aberdeen, urged others to join the Isis (Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant) fight in the country.
Aseel told Week in Week Out about life on the front line.
Asked if he had any regrets, he replied: "Nope, I can say I am willing to die but Allah knows the truth behind the words."
Aseel said there were "loads" of other men from Britain who have also joined up.
Asked how he could defend the brutality of Isis killings in Syria, he said he stood by Sharia law and was glad to be out there.
And when asked if he was concerned about what people in the UK might think of him, he replied: "Not really."
He was then asked whether he realised he would be arrested if he returned to the UK, and he replied: "Yes, most probably."
