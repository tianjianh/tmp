An emergency rescue helicopter lifted him to safety from the storm drain he was sheltering in as flames burned all around him.
Pilots had to fly through thick smoke to swoop in and pick him up.
Captain Scott Dettorre, from Ventura County Fire, said: "What made this challenging was we had the brush fire going... Visually it was a challenge for these pilots to locate and get this patient out."
