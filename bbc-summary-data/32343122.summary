Vietnam War: 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
April 30 marks the 40th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. War dominated 30 years of Vietnam's history during the last century. The conflict which left Vietnam in ruins still divides many people in and outside of the country.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vietnam's infrastructure was destroyed, millions of its people were killed and even more displaced, and its farmland was polluted by American chemical warfare.
The war also took it's toll on the US. Fifty-eight thousand Americans died in the conflict, while it is estimated the 700,000 veterans suffered psychological after-effects.
