Appeal after stray iguana found wandering down a street

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RSPCA is trying to trace the owners of an iguana found wandering down a street in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The juvenile male reptile was picked up by a member of the public and taken to a veterinary surgery after it was spotted in Birchgrove Road.
Posters have been put up in the area in the hope of tracking down its owners.
The RSPCA said aside from the dangers of dog attacks and cars the most serious implication for a reptile being outside in the UK was the cool weather.
Charity animal welfare officer Sian Burton said: "It must've been a funny sight to see the iguana wandering down the pavement, but the bottom line is this reptile could've escaped and we would very much like to get him home."
She added: "As it is not very warm outside at the moment he would have been unable to warm up and it's unlikely he would have survived very long had he not been found."
Ms Burton said reptiles relied on their environment to regulate their body temperature.
The iguana was found on 16 May.
