The Briton and his Brazilian partner won 6-3 6-4 to top their group at London's O2 Arena.
Murray and Soares must wait for the result of the evening match to see if they have qualified with one round-robin match remaining.
Treat Huey and Max Mirnyi play Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo at 18:00 GMT.
Any result other than a two-set win for Dodig and Melo will ensure Murray and Soares reach the last four.
Murray and Soares have won Grand Slam titles at the Australian and US Open this year, and could end 2016 as the world number one pairing.
"We both really enjoy being out here, playing in front of a lot of people, on a great court in the biggest tournament of the year," said the Scot.
The victory over the Bryans moves them within 175 points of France's Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut at the top of the standings.
Soares added: "We came here happy to be here but we want to win the tournament, and I think number one is going to come with that.
"So don't think about number one, think about winning the tournament and see how it goes."
