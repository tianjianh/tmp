Called Throw Up 20.18 and led by Highland Print Studio, it will involve artists working with players, club volunteers and fans.
The clubs taking part are Beauly, Fort William, Newtonmore and Skye.
The finished artworks are to be produced as prints and will be exhibited at shinty events next year.
The first of these event will be the Camanachd Cup Final followed by the Shinty/Hurling International before the prints are taken on tour.
The four professional artists appointed are:
Steven Mackenzie, of the Camanachd Association and Beauly club secretary, said: "The Camanachd Association is very happy to be involved with this project and to hear that the four artists have been appointed.
"There is a lot of interest from the four clubs involved.
"From Beauly's perspective, we're looking forward to working with Tom Smith - even though he has connections with our traditional rivals, Lovat Shinty Club."
