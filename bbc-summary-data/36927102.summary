Lee, 25, made a course-record 10-under-par 62 in the first round, and is ahead of China's Shanshan Feng and Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn who are tied second.
Scotland's Catriona Matthew scored a stunning second-round 65 to go nine under par, two shots behind leader Lee.
England's Charley Hull is tied in 10th place on five under at Woburn.
Playing at her home event, Hull made five birdies between holes seven and 12, but was put on the clock from 13 to 16 because of slow play.
She told BBC Sport: "It was raining so I had to rush and bogeyed the 16th hole, it is stuff you have to deal with.
"I am usually a fast player but happy with the way I came through the middle part."
Meanwhile, England's Bronte Law - the leading amateur who has had to borrow her clubs - carded consecutive rounds of 70 for a place in tied-17th position on four under par.
New Zealand's world number one Lydia Ko made the cut on equal par after a round of 70.
