Ayeeshia Jane Smith's stepfather had reportedly threatened to torch the family home three weeks beforehand.
A text to arrange a home visit was sent an hour before Ayeeshia died at a flat in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire.
Her mother, Kathryn Smith, 23, and her partner Matthew Rigby, 22, both from Nottingham, deny murder.

Ayeeshia died on 1 May 2014 when her heart was ruptured by a forceful blow consistent with a stamp, Birmingham Crown Court was told.
In the early hours of 4 April, Ms Smith, formerly of Swadlincote, Derbyshire, called 999 to report Mr Rigby had threatened to burn the flat down.
Five days later, Stephen Crean, the senior Derbyshire County Council social worker responsible for Ayeeshia's case, met with his then manager, Alison O'Connor, to discuss options to place the girl in local authority care.
It was concluded the "happy, smiley little girl" would stay with her mother while they investigated further.
But they decided Smith should be asked to sign an agreement to stop seeing Mr Rigby.
Mr Crean told the jury: "The agreement was asking her to not let Mr Rigby in the flat because the concern was, according to the police, there was a threat to set fire to the flat, so the agreement was to not have any contact."
The next day, Mr Crean made an unannounced visit at 11:30 GMT when he found Ms Smith's front door ajar.
When he raised the subject of the non-contact agreement she got angry and started shouting and later texted him refusing to sign it, he said.
Ayeeshia appeared "completely calm" despite her mother's highly agitated state, said Mr Crean, who has taken early retirement.
In the month leading up to Ayeeshia's death, Mr Crean carried out five planned and unannounced home visits.
On 30 April, a multi-agency risk assessment meeting involving police and social services took place in Tamworth, Staffordshire, to discuss Ayeeshia's welfare.
It was decided to arrange for a domestic abuse support worker to visit Ms Smith, according to Mr Crean.
He sent a text to her that afternoon saying: "Hi Kat, I would like to visit you and AJ tomorrow at 10am, is that ok?"
Just over an hour later, Ayeeshia had collapsed at her flat with fatal injuries.
Ms Smith, of Sandfield Road, Nottingham and Mr Rigby, of Sloan Drive, Nottingham, also deny causing or allowing the death of a child and cruelty.
The trial continues.
