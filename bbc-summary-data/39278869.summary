[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former wrestler joins the WRU from Toulon in the summer after his stint as head of strength and conditioning on the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand.
Stridgeon has been a consultant with Wales since the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
"I have enjoyed my time with Wales since linking up in 2015 and I'm excited at the opportunity," he said.
Stridgeon previously worked with Wales coach Warren Gatland at Wasps, before moving on to England and Toulon.
Gatland is currently on a sabbatical from his Wales role as he coaches the Lions, but he welcomed Stridgeon's appointment.
"Paul's appointment is fantastic for Welsh rugby and I'm delighted that we have been able to secure his services," the New Zealander said.
"I have worked alongside him in a number of roles and his impact with Wales since 2015 has been noticeable."
