Crash for cash accused 'lost money' after accident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of being involved in a car insurance fraud ring said he had nothing to gain by lying about a crash.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seven people deny conspiracy to defraud at Cardiff Crown Court after six insurance claims worth Â£144,000 were made between 2009 and 2011.
Adam Fear, 27, of Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he financially lost out after a crash in October 2010.
He said his insurance payout did not cover his outstanding finance payments, leaving him hundred of pounds down.
When asked what he had to gain from this accident, he replied: "Nothing at all, I'm at a loss."
Mr Fear's Volkswagen Polo was written off the in crash and he said he not only lost out financially, but also lost his no claims bonus as he was at fault for pulling out of a junction and into the path of a BMW.
When asked if he had ever been offered a "back-hander" to get involved in an accident, he said "no".
The case continues.
