[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dwight Gayle scored a hat-trick as Crystal Palace moved into the League Cup fourth round with a home win over Championship side Charlton Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fraizer Campbell put Palace ahead with a low finish just after the break.
Gayle then netted a penalty after Campbell was fouled by Alou Diarra, before Naby Sarr pulled one back.
Diarra was sent off after another foul in the box, with Gayle scoring again from the spot before completing his hat-trick with a header after a corner.
How Wednesday's League Cup drama unfolded
Palace had exited the League Cup to teams from the second or third tier in four of the past five seasons, but this was a potent performance from Alan Pardew's side against the team he managed between 2006 and 2008.
Gayle has not started a Premier League match all season, but this display underlined his value to Palace, who had not scored in either of their previous two games.
Charlton manager Guy Luzon rested key players Ahmed Kashi, Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Tony Watt as his side suffered a third consecutive defeat in all competitions.
The Addicks have not reached the fourth round of the League Cup since the 2006-07 season.

Crystal Palace assistant manager Keith Millen: "It's nice to have your forwards scoring. Dwight and Fraizer looked sharp all night.
"They both looked dangerous so that will give everyone a confidence boost and it's nice to have some competition for the weekend.
"It was a performance that we wanted from the whole team, we had players who needed game time. We want to go as far as we can, we are in the last 16 and it's been a while since we had a cup run."
Charlton manager Guy Luzon: "We organised well in the first half, especially with a young team.
"But the first penalty was harsh and then after the second, at 3-1 with 10 players, it's finished. I don't know about the sending-off, I was too far away from the situation.
"We have a lot of injuries and in our situation we had to use some young players. I wanted to pick my strongest team but I didn't have any choice."
