[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl, who was 17 at the time and cannot be identified, was attacked after waking up in a house in the city in December 2011, the trail has heard.
Mustafa Ahmed, 26, of Harrow Road, London, changed his plea to guilty at Oxford Crown Court earlier.
Two other men charged in connection with the assault have pleaded not guilty.
Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, of Palmer Road, Oxford, denies perverting the course of justice by threatening the girl.
His cousin Bilal Ahmed, 27, of Suffolk Road, Maidenhead, Berkshire, denies assault by penetration.
Bilal Ahmed took to the stand earlier to protest his innocence.
He repeatedly told the court: "All I know is that I didn't do it."
The trial previously heard the girl was told she would be shot if she did not stop talking to police about being sexually assaulted.
The girl and a friend were on a night out when she met Mustafa Ahmed who got into a taxi with them to a house in Cowley Road, the jury was told.
In a police interview played to the court, she said she woke to find a man, who the prosecution claimed was Mustafa Ahmed, sexually assaulting her.
The teenager said she was then assaulted by Bilal Ahmed.
The court heard the teenager's DNA was found on Bilal Ahmed's fingers and his DNA was found on her neck.
Mustafa Ahmed's DNA was found on the teenager's clothing, the jury was told.
The trial for Zeeshan Ahmed and Bilal Ahmed continues.
Mustafa Ahmed, originally from Palestine, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced next week.
