Carlisle Castle has been recreated in cake form by a team of volunteers armed with thousands of custard creams.

Staff from three local baking firms used 5,000 of the biscuits to help create the structure as part of the city's summer pageant celebrations.
It took the group three days to complete the castle, which measures about 1.2m (4ft) square.
Visitors can sample a piece of the creation during the pageant, which runs until Monday.
Volunteers came forward after a Facebook appeal from English Heritage, which runs the castle.
Ann Fiddler-Robbins, English Heritage site manager at Carlisle Castle, said: "This has been really fun to be involved in.
"How better could we celebrate the Carlisle Pageant than to create this city's great landmark from the region's beloved biscuit?
"We hope visitors will enjoy a visit to the castle as much as they will enjoy a bite from this impressive cake."
Carlisle Castle has dominated the city's landscape for nine centuries and is one of Cumbria's most visited attractions.
