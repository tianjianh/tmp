Fife man Andrew Ferguson jailed for nurses' residence rape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Fife man who raped a woman at a nurses' residence in Dundee has been jailed for eight years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Ferguson, 35, attacked his victim in the complex at Ninewells Hospital in 2000 before going on to rape another woman years later and assaulting a third.
Ferguson was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow.
He was earlier convicted at a trial in Edinburgh of eight charges including rape, indecent assault and assault.
The crimes, which Ferguson continues to deny, took place between 2000 and 2014.
Ferguson raped the woman at the nurses' residence before carrying out similar attacks on a second victim at houses in Cairneyhill and Inverkeithing, both in Fife.
A jury heard a third woman was then assaulted in Inverkeithing.
Brian McConnachie, defending, said Ferguson knew he would be jailed, but that he "maintained he did not commit the offences".
Mr McConnachie added: "His partner is standing by him. She is here in court to support him."
Judge Lord McEwan also placed Ferguson on the sex offenders' register.
Det Insp James Leeson, of Police Scotland, said:  "The suffering that these women endured and the subsequent trial as a result of Ferguson refusing to take responsibility for his horrific crimes was incredibly distressing.
"However, if it wasn't for the courage that they showed by coming forward then it wouldn't have been possible to bring him to justice, and we welcome this sentence.
"I would like to thank each of these women and our partner agencies for all of their assistance and support throughout our inquiries and the subsequent trial.
"I hope that this sentence will give these women some comfort and that they can now begin to move forward with their lives."
