Other animals like parrots have learnt how to talk but it's the first time a whale has been heard trying to mimic human speech.
This male Beluga whale made human-like sounds according to scientists.
Analysis of the sounds showed that they were much deeper than the calls whales normally use.
Have a listen and see what you think. Pretty good, but what is it saying?
