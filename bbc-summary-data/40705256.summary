Damage to the teak carriages, which date from 1930 to 1950, was extensive with windows smashed, furniture and fittings damaged.
The charity which runs the heritage railway said it was unable to estimate the cost of repairing the set of eight carriages but said it would "run into thousands".
It said it had been "overwhelmed" by support and had received almost Â£20,000 in donations in less than 24 hours.
The carriages are owned by several groups and individuals and were restored by the London and North Eastern Railway Coach Association, a volunteer-run, charitable organisation which restores heritage coaches.
They are used and maintained by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and have appeared in numerous television shows and films.
