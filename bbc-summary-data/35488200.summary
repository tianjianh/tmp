[SN]TITLE[SN]
Strauss-Kahn hired by Ukraine billionaire Viktor Pinchuk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former head of the International Fund (IMF), Dominique Strauss-Kahn is joining the board of a bank owned by Ukranian billionaire Viktor Pinchuk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Strauss-Kahn resigned as IMF managing director in 2011, after being accused of a rape at a New York hotel - allegations which were later dismissed.
He will join a newly-formed supervisory board at Bank Credit-Dnepr.
Mr Pinchuk is the son-in-law of former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and is reported to be worth $1.4bn (Â£1bn).
During the 1990s he built Interpipe into one of Ukraine's biggest industrial firms, making steel, pipes, wheels and axles.
Since then Mr Pinchuk has diversified into other industries, including banking.
Last month he settled a dispute with two other Ukrainian businessmen, over the 2004 purchase of a mining company in Ukraine.
The case, due to be heard in London, was expected to be one of the most expensive court cases in English legal history and promised to reveal details about the business dealings of some of Ukraine's wealthiest men.
It was settled just days before the trial was due to begin.
In 2012 Mr Strauss-Kahn faced allegations of pimping. The case became known as the Carlton Affair, named after the Lille hotel where sex parties took place.
Mr Strauss-Kahn acknowledged attending the parties, but always denied knowing that some of the women who took part were prostitutes.
He was acquitted in 2015.
