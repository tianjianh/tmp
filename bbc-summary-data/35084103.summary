About 25 people battled driving rain for the Santa Splash event, organised by the Canal and River Trust along the Leeds Liverpool Canal.
It marked the end of the first year of a project which aims to map a 150-mile stretch of canal from east to west.
A similar event is being staged in Burscough, Lancashire, on Sunday.
The Coast to Coast trail, which has been funded by a Â£1.3m charity grant, will stretch between Liverpool on the west and Goole on the east coast.
The Santa Splash canoeists tackled a two-mile stretch of the canal for the fun event.
Project manager Greg Brookes said: "I want to say a big thank you to everyone who joined a tremendous effort to bring some festive cheer to the canal."
