It happened outside the Tanz tanning salon on St John's Road in the Corstorphine area at about 12:35.
Police said the boy was involved in a collision with a black cab which stopped at the scene.
He suffered leg injuries and was taken to the city's Royal Infirmary. His injuries were not thought to be "life-threatening".
The road was closed in both directions between Corstorphine Bank Drive and the roundabout at Drumbrae South but has since been reopened.
Insp Davie Ferguson said: "The investigation to establish the full circumstances surrounding this collision is continuing and it is anticipated the road may remain closed for some time.
"Those planning to travel via St John's Road should look to seek alternative routes for the time being and we will provide further updates when the road re-opens.
"As part of our ongoing inquiries we are keen to hear from any motorists or members of the public who witnessed this incident and I would urge them to contact police immediately should they have any information."
