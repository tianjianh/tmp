Up to 40 youths poured petrol on the street and set it on fire to create a barricade in Leafair Gardens and Glencaw Park on Friday evening.
When police arrived they were attacked by youths throwing bricks and bottles at their vehicles.
The youths, aged 14 and 16, were later released on police bail pending further inquiries.
Ch Insp Tony Callaghan said: "Residents in this area have suffered again due to the reckless actions of these youths.
"Two males, aged 14 and 16, were arrested last night on suspicion of riotous behaviour.
"I will again reiterate the message to youths involved in this kind of activity - you run the very real risk of being arrested and getting a criminal record which could affect your life for a very long time.
"Police will continue to work closely with community representatives, local elected representatives and other statutory bodies to address the problem of anti-social behaviour in the area."
SDLP councillor Brian Tierney lives in Glencaw Park and witnessed the trouble.
"It was very bad," he said.
"Young people had filled empty washing up liquid bottles with petrol.
"The verbal abuse given to residents was totally uncalled for and totally unacceptable."
Mr Tierney said the majority of the young people who were involved in the trouble were not from the area.
"I would appeal to parents right across the city to know where their children are and what type of activities they are involved in," he said.
"The residents have had to put up with high levels of anti-social behaviour over a number of years, but I feel it has reached an all-time high."
