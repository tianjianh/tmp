A new exhibition of photographs by Charlie Clift celebrates the way football can bring communities together.  The pictures were taken to mark 10 years of the Premier Skills Programme, which uses football to encourage change in some of the poorest areas in the world.
The programme sees Premier League coaches travel to a range of countries where they provide face-to-face training for new coaches and teachers who can pass on this knowledge to those in their communities, creating a sustainable model for the future. So far Premier Skills has reached 29 countries including Afghanistan, Malaysia, Mexico, Sudan and Vietnam.
As well as photographing those taking part in football training and games Clift captured the football followers he encountered, the everyday people in their favourite team's kit.
Clift said: "Before embarking on the trip I expected to find passion, fun and a sense of community. What I did not expect is to find out that for many people football is not just a way of spending an afternoon, it is a second family, a support group and a driver of social change."
So far the programme has reached more than 1.2 million young people in places like Soweto and the slums of Kolkata in India.
