Actor Christopher Biggins has been removed from the Celebrity Big Brother house for making "a number of comments capable of causing great offence", the reality TV show has said.

Programme makers did not disclose the comments made by Biggins, who had been the bookmakers' favourite to win.
But they said the Channel 5 show "does not tolerate offensive language".
Biggins, 67, had sparked controversy four days earlier over comments that bisexual people were "the worst type".
Opening Friday's live show - which saw presenter Anthea Turner's ex-husband Grant Bovey voted out of the house - presenter Emma Willis made brief reference to Biggins' removal but gave no details.
A statement posted on the Celebrity Big Brother website said the show had "taken the decision to remove Christopher Biggins".
"Since entering Big Brother, he has made a number of comments capable of causing great offence to housemates and the viewing public," it said.
"Big Brother does not tolerate offensive language capable of causing widespread offence."
During a conversation about homosexuality earlier this week, the openly gay star said: "The worst type though is, I'm afraid to say, the bisexuals... what it is is people not wanting to admit they are gay."
He was then seen agreeing with fellow contestant Renee Graziano's comment that "You have to pick a team".
The programme's producers have not said whether these comments were among those that they considered before ordering Biggins to leave the house.
Two of the other housemates have received official warnings from Big Brother over their behaviour in the show's first week.
US singer Aubrey O'Day was warned for spitting in reality TV star Stephen Bear's sandwich.
Bear himself received a warning after throwing a mug, which smashed a glass window, following a row with Heavy D from the TV show Storage Hunters.
Biggins won ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2007.
The other contestants on this year's Celebrity Big Brother are: Renee Graziano of TV's Mob Wives; former X Factor contestants Chloe Khan and Katie Waissel; US actor Frankie Grande; reality TV stars Lewis Bloor and Marnie Simpson, former EastEnders actor Ricky Norwood; Loose Women presenter Saira Khan, and former model Samantha Fox.
