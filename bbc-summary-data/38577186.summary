[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester's hopes of reaching the Champions Cup quarter-finals ended with an error-strewn loss at Racing 92.

Racing, the 2016 runners-up, had been winless in this year's campaign but led through tries from Xavier Chauveau, Marc Andreu and Gerbrandt Grobler.
A penalty try and Andreu's second after the break, along with nine points from the boot of Dan Carter, consigned the Tigers to a fourth consecutive defeat.
Leicester's European season will conclude against Glasgow on Saturday.
The Scottish club could still progress from Pool 1 should they win at Welford Road, with Munster already assured of their place in the last eight.
Aaron Mauger has now lost both of his games in charge of Tigers since becoming interim director of rugby following Richard Cockerill's sacking.
And there were few positives to take from a careless performance against a team that are struggling in the bottom half of the French league.
Chauveau set Racing on their way with a finish after the hosts' pack had pinned Leicester on their own line and Andreu ran in under the posts when he picked up Matt Smith's stray pass.
Freddie Burns' penalty gave Tigers their only points of the match but the visitors' night was summed up when Mathew Tait fumbled Carter's missed penalty and knocked on behind his own posts - handing Racing a penalty scrum that allowed Grobler to sneak over.
Tigers continued to wither under the power of the Parisian club's pack and Will Evans conceded a penalty try when he tackled a driving maul - the flanker was sin-binned for his contribution.
With Racing losing Antonie Claassen to a yellow card, Dan Cole thought he had scored for Leicester, but the television match official was unable to determine if the ball had been touched down.
And the Premiership side's misery was compounded late on when Andreu finished a slick move in the corner.
Leicester director of rugby Aaron Mauger: "It was frustrating and disappointing. We just didn't front up.
"Everything we talked about in the week in terms of preparation we just didn't do.
"We talked about winning the collisions and getting quick ball but I thought Racing were very good in that area. We weren't very good there and in defence we let them open up channels.
"With guys like Dan Carter in the team, they're too good."
