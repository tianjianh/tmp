The Rev Andi Hofbauer, who led the service, said Raheem "loved life and was a bit of a joker, bit of a clown".
"They [his family] described him as fearless.
"He desperately wanted to be popular and was well-loved amongst his family and friends."
She said the service featured favourite songs chosen by his family and the hymns Amazing Grace and How Great Thou Art.
Following the service, during which his brother Malik delivered the eulogy, Raheem was buried at Killingbeck Cemetery.
