Mark Donnelly, 23, from Greencastle Road, Omagh, denies the manslaughter of Jason McGovern.
Mr McGovern, from Tydavnet, County Monaghan, died hours after being punched on New Year's Eve morning 2012.
The prosecution case in the trial has now ended. Mr Donnelly is set to testify on his own behalf on Wednesday.
In his interviews, while admitting being in the Weigh Inn car park in Omagh's Kevlin Avenue, where Mr McGovern was punched, Mr Donnelly continually denied being the attacker.
The court was previously told that as a result of the punch, Mr McGovern fractured his thinner than normal skull after hitting the ground. This lacerated an artery which then slowly bled, putting pressure on his brain, causing his death.
Mr Donnelly, the court heard, had two sets of interviews with police following Jason's death in the bedroom of a friend's home in Emyvale, County Monaghan.
The first was on 4 January, 2013, at the end of which police were handed a prepared signed statement, denying any involvement.
In the statement Mr Donnelly admitted he "observed an altercation involving the injured party.  I, in no way, assaulted the injured party, attempted to do so, nor did I encourage others to do so".
Mr Donnelly then claimed he went to the Weigh Inn car park looking for his cousin to give her a lift home, but unable to find her, returned to his girlfriend and collected their taxi.
The statement ended: "Whilst in Kevlin Avenue I did not see the injured party. I did not assault the injured party, nor did I incite others to do so".
Although released, Mr Donnelly was re-arrested again and questioned on 29 January, with detectives informing him that they had a witness who allegedly identified him as the car park attacker.
Mr Donnelly admitted that he "passed that area and went into the car park... I had to pass that area", but denied hitting anyone when asked directly by police.
"These are big accusations," police put it to the Tyrone man.
"I've already explained what I was doing down there," he replied.
Mr Donnelly later told detectives that as far as anyone identifying him as Mr McGovern's attacker: "All I can say is, that it is not true".
In his final interview the Tyrone man agreed there was "no justification or reason for striking" Mr McGovern, but added: "I didn't even know the lad. I didn't strike him, I didn't throw a punch down at the Weigh Inn car park.
"I didn't throw a punch either, either outside the Terrace Bar, or the Weigh Inn car park."
The case continues
