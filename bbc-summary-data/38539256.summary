[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 0-0 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Slocombe's penalty save helped preserve a 0-0 draw for Blackpool at Cambridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Slocombe denied U's top scorer Luke Berry 14 minutes from time, diving to his right to repel the spot-kick after Tom Aldred had been shown a straight red card for pulling back Conor Newton as he ran through.
The visiting stopper had twice denied George Maris in the first half, after defender Leon Legge had seen a header kept out by the post inside the first 10 minutes.
Blackpool could have taken the lead 13 minutes before the interval when Mark Cullen diverted Brad Potts' shot and forced Will Norris into a save, with the rebound hitting Cullen and going over the bar.
Norris twice saved from full-back Andy Taylor as Blackpool threatened before the red card, and the 10 men could even have stolen the win late on, but Brad Potts fired over when a loose ball fell to him inside the box.
Slocombe was called into more action late on, tipping over a James Dunne piledriver and keeping out a Berry free-kick.
