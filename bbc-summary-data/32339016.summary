Officers are carrying out "extensive inquiries" into the incident, which occurred between 21:45 and 22:05 on Sunday near a garage on Dundee Street.
They are keen to trace a slim white man in his 20s, who at the time was wearing a dark coloured long-sleeved top and blue jeans.
Officers have appealed to the public for information.
Det Insp Andy Patrick said: "This is a particularly distressing assault on a young girl and we are appealing for anyone who may have seen this man in the area of Dundee Street on Sunday to come forward and assist us with our investigation.
"We would reassure the public that we are using all available means of inquiry to identify the person responsible and we would urge anyone who has any information that may assist with our inquiries to contact us."
