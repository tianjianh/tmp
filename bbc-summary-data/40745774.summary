A selection of the best photos from across Africa and of Africans elsewhere in the world this week.
Rising Nigerian tennis star Adetayo Adetunji knocks India's Zeel Desai out of this year's Youth Commonwealth Games in the Bahamas on Friday. The 18-year-old went on to defeat her Ghanaian opponent, Miriam Ibrahim, in the next round but was later knocked out at the quarter-final stage.
A car workshop in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, proudly displays the various spare parts for sale on an outside wall, in this photo taken on Monday. Business has been booming in Mogadishu since African Union and government troops drove militant Islamists out of the city.
Fishermen on the River Nile in Egypt's capital, Cairo, make this modest catch on Friday. Fish is a popular staple among Egyptians but the country's health ministry issues a warning every year to stay away from feseekh, the country's traditionally salty - and smelly - fermented mullet fish which dates back thousands of years.
Also on Friday, an enthusiastic supporter of Kenya's ruling Jubilee Party sports a paper mask depicting President Uhuru Kenyatta's face at a campaign rally in the capital, Nairobi, ahead of the 8 August general election.
Many are anxious that the post-election violence witnessed almost a decade ago should not be repeated. This photo taken on Sunday in Nairobi's Kibera slum, a stronghold of opposition leader Raila Odinga, shows the work of street artist Solomon Muyundo, alias Solo7.
Congolese supporters sing their national anthem on Monday at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny stadium in Ivory Coast's main city, Abidjan. The former French colony is playing host to its third international athletics tournament, with this year's Jeux de la Francophonie.
On Tuesday, Guinean sculptor Kaba Abdoulaye crafts items in Abidjan which he hopes to sell to visiting sport fans.
Nigeria's ailing President Buhari poses with his wife Aisha Buhari (R), and Eunice Ortom, the wife of Benue state governor, in London on Wednesday. Mr Buhari has received a visiting delegation of Nigerian politicians to Abuja House in the British capital, where he has been receiving medial treatment for a second time this year for an unspecified illness.
