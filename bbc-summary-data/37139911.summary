[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gateshead 1-1 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Both Gateshead and Boreham Wood continued their progress in the top half of the National League after a draw in the north east.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors hit the front early when Angelo Balanta seized upon a misplaced pass and beat goalkeeper Sam Johnson with the aid of a deflection.
Gateshead rallied quickly and equalised within a couple of minutes. Toby Ajala swung in a corner and Ryan Bowman headed home.
Neil Aspin's hosts had much the better of a goalless second period. Danny Johnson hit a free-kick that Grant Smith saved and also planted an effort just wide.
Wes York almost enhanced his fine start to the season with a swift turn and strike at goal, but Smith was again in form.
