Devon and Cornwall Police said officers and the Royal Navy Bomb Disposal team were called to the beach in Dawlish Warren at about 09:10 GMT.
A 200m (655ft) cordon was put in place to keep people away from the area.
Petty Officer Mark Cocking from the Royal Navy Bomb Disposal team said it was better to be safe than sorry.
He said: "We always work along the lines 'Don't touch an item if you suspect it, contact police or coastguard'."
