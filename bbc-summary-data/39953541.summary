A new outlet will open in Sheffield later this year, while stores in Exeter and Greenwich will open in 2018, the firm said.
The jobs will increase Ikea's workforce in the UK and Ireland by 12.5% to about 11,700, the company said.
It joins firms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon in boosting its UK job numbers since last year's Brexit vote.
Ikea's UK and Ireland retail manager, Gillian Drakeford, said: "As we continue to expand, we're delighted to bring investment to new areas across the country and create new opportunities for local communities."
The firm said it would be recruiting managers and restaurant workers, as well as customer relations, sales, interior design, IT, sustainability and marketing personnel.
The new stores will take the number of Ikea outlets in the UK to 22, plus four "order and collection" shops.
