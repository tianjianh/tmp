Morocco coach Herve Renard says he is shocked by Hakim Ziyech's absence from the Atlas Lions camp.

They play the Netherlands in a friendly on Wednesday and Cameroon in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on 10 June.
The Ajax midfielder was handed a recall despite saying he would never play under Renard again.
"He deserved a call-up from Morocco based on his Europa League performances. But he's not here and I can't tell you why," Renard said.
"If you wish to know why he doesn't want to work with me, you will have to ask him directly. I am not going to talk about it in the media.
"I respect Hakim's decision to reject this latest call-up but I do believe he is making a very big mistake. The ball is now in his court."
The 24-year-old was surprisingly left out of Morocco's preliminary squad for this year's Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.
He then rejected a late inclusion as replacement for the injured Younes Belhanda.
However Renard believes Ziyech , who scored 12 goals in 42 appearances this season and reached the Europa League final deserves another chance.
Last month Ziyech said: "As long as Herve Renard is there, I will be with my head elsewhere.
"He remains in charge of picking players of his choice. And I accept it. I know that a coach does not usually stay long. I'm waiting quietly (maybe he's leaving)."
