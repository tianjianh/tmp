The Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames experienced problems and stopped turning at 19:21 BST and people were trapped until 22:40 BST.
A passenger in the pod called the fire brigade at about 21:53 but guests were able to leave without their help.
A statement from Merlin Entertainments said: "This was a technical issue and at no point was anyone at risk".
The ride reopened on Sunday morning.
One guest, Adil, tweeted a picture of the pod he was in where a person could be seen wearing a thermal blanket.
He tweeted: "Stranded in capsule 4 more than an hour. Emergency blankets out, no food or milk for babies!"
Merlin Entertainments, which owns the London Eye, said: "We obviously apologise to people on the London Eye yesterday evening and will make full refunds available to those affected.
"One of the guests made contact with the emergency services. Both the London Fire Brigade and the London Ambulance Service were dispatched but no action was required.
"The technical issue was resolved and we were able to safely disembark all guests in a calm fashion."
The company said it had followed its standard procedure with its technical team handling the issue and therefore did not call the fire brigade.
Every pod has a comfort pack for emergencies which includes thermal foil blankets, water and first aid kits, which the company said people were able to use.
London Fire Brigade said two fire engines and two fire rescue units with an aerial ladder were sent to the scene, but their help was not needed.
London Ambulance Service said it had sent a team but there were no injuries and no-one needed to be taken to hospital.
