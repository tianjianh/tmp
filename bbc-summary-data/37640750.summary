Alice Ruggles was found with serious injuries in Rawling Road at about 18:30 BST on Wednesday. The 24-year-old, originally from Leicestershire, was pronounced dead at the scene.
A 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Northumbria Police said the case had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because of previous contact with the victim.
A cordon remains in place at the scene.
A police spokesman said: "This is believed to be an isolated incident and those involved are known to each other. There is not believed to be any danger to the wider public."
Ms Ruggles' family released a statement paying tribute to her and said she "had an infectious personality and an incredible sense of humour".
"She was kind, clever and beautiful, we are struggling to come to terms with the fact that she is not with us anymore.
"She loved life, loved her friends and loved her job. She had so much to live for. Nothing, nothing can ever replace her."
