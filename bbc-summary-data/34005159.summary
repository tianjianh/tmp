[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 53-year-old man arrested in connection with the murder of former IRA member Kevin McGuigan has appeared in court on a firearms charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Fitzpatrick, who is believed to be from the Lagmore area of west Belfast, appeared at Lisburn Magistrate's Court on Thursday.
He has been charged with possessing a Glock pistol with intent to endanger life.
Mr Fitzpatrick was refused bail.
An argument for bail, made by his defence lawyer, was rejected by the judge after a detective said he remained a suspect in the investigation into Mr McGuigan's murder.
Mr McGuigan Sr, 53, was murdered at his home at Comber Court in the Short Strand area of east Belfast last week.
On Thursday evening, two men aged 26 and 49 arrested by police investigating Mr McGuigan's murder were released unconditionally.
