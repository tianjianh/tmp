[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liam Buchanan's strike was one of just four goals scored in the division on Saturday.
Two of those came late on at Hampden Park as Queen's Park drew 1-1 with Brechin.
Iain Russell's goal gave Airdrie a 1-0 win at home against Stenhousemuir, with Alloa held by East Fife while Albion Rovers and Peterhead was also goalless.
Buchanan's shot, with just six minutes left, extended Livingston's lead to nine points at the top of the table.
Stranraer sit two points above the relegation play-off position after their first loss in eight games.
Brechin City seemed set to move up to third after Andrew Jackson's 84th-minute strike put them in front at Hampden, but Ryan McGeever levelled for Queen's Park six minutes later.
David Marsh earned a straight red card for Stenhousemuir on 84 minutes for a foul on Aidrie goalscorer Russell.
The win saw Airdrie move level on points with Brechin and East Fife, but they remain outside the play-off places on goal difference.
Second-placed Alloa's four-match winning run came to an end as they were held to a goalless draw by third-placed East Fife.
