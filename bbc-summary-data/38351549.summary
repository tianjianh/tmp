Desmond O'Reilly, 53, died in hospital the day after he was found collapsed in Hulme, Manchester, on 5 December.
Detectives believe he was attacked before he was found by a passer-by in St Georges Avenue.
Greater Manchester Police said officers had "received very little information about what may have happened to him".
The reward is being offered to anyone with any information leading to the arrest and conviction of anybody connected to Mr O'Reilly's death.
Det Ch Insp Sarah Jones said: "We are particularly interested in speaking to anyone who may have seen Desmond on the evening of Monday 5 December.
"I hope this reward demonstrates our dedication to finding the truth about Desmond's death and I would encourage anyone with any information to come forward."
