Artefacts on display will chart the development of the town, including its cultural and agricultural significance.
The first exhibition on show will commemorate Lampeter's links with World War One.
The museum has been set up by local history group Hanes Llambed and University of Wales Trinity Saint David.
It is based in the former Porter's Lodge near the main gates of the university campus.
Selwyn Walters, Chair of Hanes Llambed, which has 90 members, said: "A town of the stature and importance of Lampeter has always needed a dedicated museum to celebrate its heritage and history, and we are delighted that this has at last come into being."
The project to make the alterations needed to house the museum was backed by Â£35,000 of European funds.
The museum will also house a display charting the history of the college from its inception in 1804.
Dr Jeremy Smith, Assistant Dean of the Faculty of Humanities, said: "Having been a part of the town since 1822 it's great that the University will now become home to a centre that celebrates Lampeter's history, its people and its heritage."
The museum is open between 10:00 BST and 16:00 BST every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
