Manager Manuel Pellegrini is confident Manchester City can keep up their title chase without midfielder Yaya Toure.

City have not won in the Premier League while Toure, 31, has been absent, winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast.
Toure will miss Wednesday's match at Stoke City and Pellegrini said: "He is a very important player and it is very important to have Yaya back.
"But we don't just depend on one player. We must win without him."
City lie seven points behind leaders Chelsea and are winless in their last five league outings but Pellegrini insists they can withstand the pressure.
"We have a lot of things to think about, more important than pressure. I don't feel any pressure inside the club or outside," said Pellegrini, who also spoke of Wednesday's opponents, his side's lack of goals and his use of Frank Lampard.
"They are a very good team, not only at this moment - they are always a very difficult team, especially playing at the Britannia.
"But we are going to go as we always do when we play away, to try and win the three points from the first minute."
"One thing is not linked with the other. We have Edin Dzeko, we have Jovetic, we have Kun Aguero, we have Silva. We have a lot of players that always score.
"Wilfried Bony will be a very important player for the squad also, but we are not just depending on what Bony can do."
"Frank is a very important player for us, either starting in the 11 or after as a substitute, so he will continue playing the way I think is useful for the team.
"I don't think he can't play 90 minutes. When the other teams have played 50 or 60 minutes, I think Frank makes more of a difference.
"His best moments of the season came as a substitute and he scores. I hope he continues in the same way."
