Ysgol Dewi Sant pupils to be relocated to Haverfordwest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pupils at a Pembrokeshire secondary school will be relocated to a school 16 miles (26km) away to make way for redevelopment work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Governors at Ysgol Dewi Sant in St Davids voted unanimously to move pupils to Tasker Milward in Haverfordwest for 12 months from September.
A meeting for parents will be held on Thursday.
The school was threatened with closure in 2015 but councillors made a u-turn following protests.
The school will open as a new three-16 school from September 2018 as part of education shake-ups.
