Shaun Klitzke jailed over 'appalling' child sex abuse images

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who possessed "appalling and loathsome" indecent images of children has been jailed for 16 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shaun Klitzke was reported to police by his estranged wife, who found the pictures on a memory card.
Scores of still and moving images were recovered from the card and a mobile phone that was also seized.
Klitzke, formerly of Aspatria, Cumbria, but now of Jesmond, Newcastle, admitted six counts of making indecent photographs of children.
He was sentenced at Carlisle Crown Court on Friday 1 July.
Sixty-eight of the images were classed in category A - the most serious. Some of the victims were aged as young as two-years-old.
Klitzke was also made subject to the terms of a sexual harm prevention order for 10 years.
