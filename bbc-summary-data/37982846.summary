[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 0-1 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late Sido Jombati free-kick ensured Wycombe ended Newport's seven-game unbeaten run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jombati's wonderful strike from just outside the box pushed the Blues to within a point of the League Two play-off places, while County dropped back into the bottom two.
Newport dominated large spells of the game but it was Wycombe who snatched the three points late on.
Rhys Healey, on-loan from Cardiff, beat two players in the box to cut inside, but saw his shot bounce off the post just before the break.
County winger Sean Rigg let fly from 30 yards which forced Wycombe goalkeeper Jamal Blackman into a good save shortly after the restart.
Newport continued to dominate the second half and had a penalty claim turned down in the 73rd minute when substitute Jennison Myrie-Williams looked to have been tripped in the box by Aaron Pierre.
But Jombati's stunning free-kick which went in off the woodwork won it for Wycombe.
