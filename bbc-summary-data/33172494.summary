Plans revised for Murray and Montgomerie sports centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Revised plans for a proposed golf and tennis centre near Dunblane are to be submitted to Stirling Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Park of Keir project is supported by golfer Colin Montgomerie and Judy Murray, mother of former Wimbledon champion Andy.
The council had voiced concerns about a previous version of the plan, which included 100 new houses.
The revised proposals cut this down to 19 houses, and add in the creation of a new 100-acre country park.
The Park of Keir partners said the "world class" tennis and golf facility would provide "state of the art recreational facilities", creating 150 new jobs and injecting Â£5m to the local economy yearly.
The proposals would also see a four star, 150-room hotel built, alongside the "Murray Tennis Museum", designed to celebrate and build on the legacy of Murray and his brother Jamie, a Wimbledon doubles champion.
The original plans were criticised for being sited on green belt land, with council planning officers stating that the housing - included in the plans to help finance the development - could "exacerbate affordability in the local area".
There was also criticism of the "significant detrimental impact" the development could have on a "sensitive landscape".
In response to this, the revised plans cut the number of houses to 19, and include a country park which would leave 85% of the site kept as accessible green space, under the stewardship of a charitable trust.
Announcing the revised proposals, Judy Murray said "careful consideration" had been given to the "extensive consultation" already held with locals.
She said: "I am passionate abut the future of tennis and I see this project bringing huge benefits for grass roots sport in Scotland.
"To have these world class facilities on our doorstop will provide our youngsters with the opportunity to enjoy tennis and golf and receive the very best in coaching."
Alston Birnie of Park of Keir Partners added: "We have listened to all of the concerns raised through the consultation process and we wanted to be able to respond positively to the feedback we received, including the long term protection of the green space between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.
"This is not a conventional commercial development as such; rather there are persuasive grounds for exceptional justification through what is a very small area of enabling development to create something very special for the future of Scottish sport and for the local communities."
Once the plans are received and validated by the local authority, further public consultations will take place before they can be considered by councillors.
