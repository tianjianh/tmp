A £250,000 programme to help cancer patients in Dundee become more active has been launched.

Move More Dundee includes walking groups, gardening, gentle movement and circuits-based activity classes.
Macmillan Cancer Support has invested the money to develop the programme in partnership with Leisure & Culture Dundee.
It was officially launched by Scotland's Health Secretary Shona Robison.
Ms Robison said: "We all know that keeping active after cancer treatment can have a hugely positive impact on a person's health and wellbeing.
"The work that Macmillan are doing through Move More supports the aim of our cancer strategy in helping people to live with and beyond cancer."
Macmillan said that the activities, which are free of charge, would help people cope with the side-effects of treatment and provide an opportunity to meet others in a similar situation.
Caroline Grant, one of the Move More participants, said: "My family have been commenting on my improved mood since I've been coming along to the classes.
"They feel I'm getting back closer to my old self. I have more energy now and do more activity in the week than I ever thought I would do."
Head of Macmillan in Scotland, Janice Preston, said: "Traditionally, people have been told that rest was best and while it is right to rest at certain times, it is also really beneficial to get moving too.
"Research shows that being active during and after treatment can not only help with the side-effects but also reduce the loneliness and isolation many people feel."
