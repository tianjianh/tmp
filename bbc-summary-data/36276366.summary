[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two side Notts County have confirmed they are under a transfer embargo because of unpaid bills.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chief executive Jason Turner said in a statement on the club's website they were "in the process of scheduling payments" so they can sign players.
Notts are currently up for sale and without a manager following Mark Cooper's departure after a short-term stint in charge.
The Magpies settled an outstanding debt to HM Revenue & Customs in April.
But Turner said: "Football League rules state that clubs failing to meet HMRC payments, or football creditor debts on time are automatically temporarily embargoed until such time as these payments are settled.
"We are currently in the process of scheduling due payments to ensure that the club can re-engage with out-of-contract players and enhance the squad when the new manager is appointed."
