The Conservatives are now the second largest party on 31, with Labour dropping to third place with 24 seats
The Scottish Greens are the fourth largest party with six seats, ahead of the Liberal Democrats who won five.
The SNP would have needed 65 seats to be a majority government. It managed this in 2011 despite Scotland's voting system being designed to prevent a single party having overall control.
