All teams should publish tests - Team Sky boss David Brailsford

Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford has told other teams to follow their example and release lead riders' performance data.

Sky's two-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome published physiological test results after being dogged by doping speculation during his 2015 win.
The results suggested he was capable of his performances without cheating.
Brailsford has written to the sport's governing body to suggest other teams go through the same process.
"It should be standardised," said Brailsford.
"If we all agreed as teams 'here is the disclosure model that we're all going to buy into', that takes away the discretionary decision."
Brailsford says that he has received cautious encouragement from Brian Cookson, head of governing body the UCI, who thinks it is "worth discussing".
Other riders, including Giant-Alpecin's Tom Dumoulin, have also voluntarily released data but Team Sky have come under the most scrutiny. At last year's Tour, Froome had urine thrown at him by a spectator and was apparently spat at after the legality of his performance was questioned on French television.
Brailsford insists that, while the results can be open to interpretation, independent testing has symbolic value as well.
"Forget the results for a moment: as a general action or thought, the intent to be as transparent as possible is a very good thing. I don't think anybody can criticise that," he told BBC Sport.
"The fact that it was independent from the team - so we could not influence the results - was very healthy too and I was fully supportive of that."
