Ospreys forwards coach Chris Gibbes has criticised Pro12 bottom side Treviso after the Welsh team's 47-10 home win.

Treviso have won only two of their 20 Pro12 matches in 2015-16 and Gibbes was unimpressed with their approach.
"I don't think they've come to play positive rugby," said Gibbes.
"I might get my hand slapped, but if you look at the amount of stoppages, ball-in-play time, even scrum platforms, I don't think they've turned up here ready to play a game."
The Italian side lost their only specialist hooker Ornel Gega, who was carried off with a head injury after 38 minutes, while back-rower Dean Budd had to come on after 10 minutes for injured lock Jeff Montauriol.
Budd was subsequently sent off for two yellow cards while Robert Barbieri was also sin-binned as the Ospreys scored seven tries to one.
"They've tried to muscle us, that hasn't quite worked, and they've resorted to trying to slow the game down - I don't think that's positive rugby," was Gibbes' verdict.
The poor performances of Treviso and Zebre have led to some pundits questioning their places in the Pro12, but Gibbes added it was not for him to say whether they should be in or out of the competition.
"From 55 minutes on (when the Ospreys scored their fifth try), I don't know what the spectators would have got out of that game," he said.
"That performance was pleasing for the most part, We allowed them to get opportunities they should not have had, but we are pretty happy."
Ospreys' remaining games are against fellow top-six contenders Cardiff Blues at Principality Stadium on Judgement Day, 30 April, followed by hosting Ulster at Liberty Stadium on Saturday, 7 May.
The Swansea-based team need to win both and hope that several of their rivals lose ground in the closing stages of the  season, if they are qualify for the 2016-17 European Champions Cup.
Failure would mean Ospreys not playing at that level in Europe for the first time.
"I think at the end of the day we have just got to focus on us and winning continually," said Gibbes.
