[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former policeman has been jailed for four years for child sex offences involving a young girl in Bedfordshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Saxon, 57, from Milton Keynes, attacked the girl in Leighton Buzzard over a two year period when she was aged between 10 and 12 years old.
Luton Crown Court was told the young girl told her mother in 2012 what had been going on and Saxon was arrested.
He was found guilty of seven offences of sexual assault on a girl under 13 following a trial.
Saxon, of Redding Grove, Crownhill, Milton Keynes, had spent 31 years with Bedfordshire Police.
The court heard he had massaged the girl and touched her bottom and breasts.
Toby Long, defending, said his client had always maintained he was an innocent man.
He told Judge Michael Kay QC: "In accordance with my client's instructions you will be sending an innocent man to prison.
"It's his case that he told the truth at his trial."
Judge Kay told Saxon he had groomed the girl.
"Your position is that I am sending an innocent man to prison, but that is not the verdict of the jury and I abide by the verdict of the jury."
He said his name would go on the sex offenders' register.
