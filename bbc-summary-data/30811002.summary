A 25-year-old man was shot near the BP petrol station in Burley at around 15:00 GMT on Wednesday 24 December.
West Yorkshire Police stressed officers were only interested in speaking to the men as witnesses and not as suspects.
Another two men, aged 24 and 27, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and have been released on bail.
The victim was treated in hospital for serious gunshot wounds to his abdomen, but has now been released.
Det Ch Insp Mark McManus, of West Yorkshire Police, said the witnesses were seen on CCTV on Thornville Road near the petrol station at the time of the shooting.
"I am appealing directly for the men themselves to contact us, or for anyone who recognises them to get in touch," he said.
A white Audi and a dark hatchback car met at the scene, close to the Thornville Road junction with Alexandra Road, just before the shooting.
