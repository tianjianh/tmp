[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oral health funding for elderly in Wales' care homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Older people living in care homes are to get better access to oral health care after the Welsh government set aside Â£700,000 in funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The money will also increase access to special dental care for people with disabilities and special needs.
As part of the plan, care homes must have a mouth care policy and staff responsible for promoting oral hygiene.
All residents will have an oral risk assessment within a week of moving in and regular check ups.
