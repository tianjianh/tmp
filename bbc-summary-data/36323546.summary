A teenager has admitted killing his back-seat passenger and injuring an elderly nun by dangerous driving when he was being chased by police.

The 17-year-old, who cannot be identified because of his age, admitted six charges against him on Wednesday.
He was charged over an October 2014 crash on Belfast's Saintfield Road.
He admitted causing the death of Conal Daly, 18, from north Belfast, and causing grievous bodily injury to 75-year-old Sister Josephine McAteer.
The teenager also pleaded guilty to driving dangerously on the Ormeau Road and Saintfield Road, two counts of assaulting police and one count of causing criminal damage to a police vehicle.
The Jaguar car the teenager was driving crashed into the vehicle being driven by Sister Josephine, who is believed to have suffered two broken legs.
Mr Daly, a former pupil at Edmund Rice College and who was in the back seat of the Jaguar, was fatally injured.
Paramedics had treated him at the scene and rushed him to the Royal Victoria Hospital but he died a short time later.
It was reported at the time the police had been in pursuit of the "runaround" Jaguar from the roundabout at the top of the Ormeau Road when the chase came to an end a few miles along the road.
In court on Wednesday, a defence solicitor said he would be giving a report on the defendant's mental health to the probation service to assist them with their report.
Remanding the teenager back into custody, the judge provisionally listed the sentencing hearing on 24 June, depending on whether reports are ready.
He added that while it "may be academic" the killer driver was now automatically banned from driving.
