French officials are investigating whether plane wreckage that washed up on an Indian Ocean island is from missing flight MH370.

The debris, apparently a wing flap, was found on French-owned Reunion.
An aviation security expert said it had "incredible similarities" to a flap from a Boeing 777, the type of plane that vanished in March 2014.
But the island is a huge distance from the plane's search area and there have been other crashes much closer.
No part of the Malaysian Airlines flight has ever been found. It disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.
Aviation expert Xavier Tytelman said a code on the plane would be examined, promising a "definitive answer" on whether there was a link in a few days.
Australian investigators, who are leading the hunt, are also reported to be in touch with manufacturers over the find.
But a member of the French Air Force cautioned it was "way too soon" to say if it was from the missing flight, according to CNN.
Search teams have been focusing on a 60,000 sq km (23,000 sq mile) area off the coast of Western Australia, where it is believed to have crashed.
Reunion lies some 6,000 km (3,730 miles) to the west, off the coast of Madagascar.
It remains a mystery what happened to the plane, which vanished after turning away from its north-bound route from Kuala Lumpur.
