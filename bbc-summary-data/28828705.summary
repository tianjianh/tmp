World and Welsh Open champion Ron Long narrowly beat 2013 winner Kevin Waltham at this year's contest on Windermere.
Mr Long skimmed 70m (230ft) against Mr Walton's 69m (226ft) in the All England Stone Skimming Championships.
Organiser Julius Barratt said windy conditions prevented record-breaking skims but it was a "thrilling finish with last year's winner Kevin Waltham battling it out with Ron Long".
The winner of the previous three championships finally managed the extra metre to win the medal, Mr Barrratt said.
The event, at Fell Foot Park, is run by South Cumbria Rivers Trust to raise funds for conservation.
The rules say stones no more than three inches wide must be sourced from the area and must bounce on the water a minimum of three times before sinking.
Last year Mr Waltham, from Newcastle, won the men's class with a skim of 77m (250ft) while Mr Long came second with 75m (245ft).
