Republic of Ireland Under-21 goalkeeper McLoughlin, 19, is currently on loan at League Two strugglers Stockport.
Defenders McKeown, 17, and Meekings, 18, have made appearances for the reserves this term.
"It's the worst part of a manager's job, telling young players that we will not be keeping them on," boss Paul Jewell told the club website.
"But the challenge for these boys now is to go and have a career in the game elsewhere.
"We will do everything we can to help them achieve that and we wish them all the best for the future."
