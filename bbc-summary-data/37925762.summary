A teenage valeter stole a customer's car before leading police on a city centre chase at speeds of up to 80mph, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry Dixon ignored several sets of red lights in what a sheriff described as "an appalling piece of driving over a significant distance".
Dixon, 19, of Perth was banned from driving for 32 months and ordered to carry out 175 hours of unpaid work.
He was also ordered to re-sit his extended driving test.
Depute fiscal Craig Donald told Perth Sheriff Court the Ford Fiesta was fitted with a tracker that enables it to be traced via computers and mobile phones.
He said: "It was put into Bookers car wash where the accused is employed as a car valeter.
"One of the employees of the car owning company noticed the tracker was giving information that the vehicle was being driven erratically."
The car was traced by police and stopped, but as they got out to approach the driver, Dixon sped off.
Dixon admitted driving a stolen Ford Fiesta dangerously and at speeds in excess of 80mph on various roads in and around Perth.
He also admitted failing to obey red traffic lights, ignoring no right turn signs, failing to give way at junctions and driving without insurance.
Sheriff Lindsay Foulis told Dixon: "This nonsense had very serious consequences.
"You may have thought it was fun at the time but you were a danger to other road users by acting in this manner."
