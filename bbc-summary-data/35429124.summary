The 33-year-old has been training with the League Two club for the last month.
The former Plymouth, Swindon and Swansea striker has not played a competitive match since scoring for Scunthorpe in a 1-1 draw against Colchester in October 2014.
Fallon has been capped 18 times by New Zealand, and represented his country at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
"He's a very experienced footballer and someone who I would call an old-fashioned striker," said Rovers manager Darrell Clarke.
