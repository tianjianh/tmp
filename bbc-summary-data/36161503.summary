[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ricci Gallagher, 46, died in hospital a week after suffering head injuries at the farmhouse in Little Burstead, Essex, in July.
The house belongs to Richard Glanville, 60, who was arrested along with a 54-year-old man from Basildon.
Essex Police said they had been released from their bail.
The force said the case against the men was dropped "due to insufficient evidence".
Mr Glanville worked for Aurora Fashions, a holding company that owned Oasis, Coast, Warehouse and Karen Millen until 2013.
Police were called to Mr Glanville's home minutes after Mr Gallagher had reported a fire at his property, about half a mile away in Blind Lane.
Part of the police inquiry was focusing on why Mr Gallagher had been at the farmhouse.
