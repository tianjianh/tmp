A 16-year-old boy has been detained for nine years for sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a 62-year-old woman in a public place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The court heard how the woman fought the boy off as he attacked her, pleading with him and screaming: "I'm an old woman."
The boy had sexually assaulted a 22-year-old woman just 15 minutes before.
The first attack was in an alley in the Lenton area of Nottingham and the second was in the Wollaton area.
The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, travelled between the two areas on his bike.
Police were able to prove he was responsible because semen containing his DNA was found on the second victim's clothes.
In a statement read to the court, the 62-year-old woman said she lives "in constant fear" of it happening again.
"Before the attack I was a strong independent woman," she said.
"It takes me 90 minutes to get out of the house because of panicking and feeling sick.
"I'm sleepless, crying and depressed.
"I used to look forward to retirement. Now I can't even think of going to work, let alone retiring."
She added: "I feel useless, ugly and in a dark hole. I wonder if I will ever get back to normal."
The attacks happened on the morning of 23 October.
The boy admitted two counts of sexual assault and two counts of attempted rape in relation to the older woman.
He also admitted one count of sexual assault in relation to the younger woman.
The 22-year-old said she feels anxious when she sees any youth who looks like the defendant.
"I've always been independent, now I always need someone with me when I go anywhere," she said.
"I have been made to feel that I won't be safe anywhere. I feel I've lost my freedom."
Sentencing the boy at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Gregory Dickinson QC said the attacks were "violent, sustained, brutal and degrading".
"These offences are shocking enough, but what makes it all the more extraordinary for the court and the public is that you are just 16 years of age, committing terrible crimes with very serious consequences for the victims."
