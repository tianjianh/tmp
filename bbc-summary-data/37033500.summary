Super League clubs chasing a play-off spot should all start on zero points again in the Super 8s competition, says Widnes chief executive James Rule.

Currently, teams in the Super 8s and third-tier Championship Shield carry over points from the regular season.
However, The Qualifiers, often referred to as the Middle 8s, start fresh on zero for their seven matches.
"I would change it. The interest in the Middle 8s is because of the jeopardy," Rule told BBC Radio Merseyside.
Defeat by Catalans Dragons in their Super 8s opener last week leaves Widnes Vikings 10 points adrift of the top four with just six games left in the Super 8s.
"I think after this weekend, realistically, if Saints beat Catalans and Wigan beat Castleford - I'm not saying they will or they won't - that is the top four done.
"So the Super League will be finished two rounds into the format.
"I think that you could create a League Leaders' Shield at the end of 23 rounds and then create a top eight road to Old Trafford, where everyone starts on zero points."
Only the top four teams in Super League after 30 rounds go into the play-offs for a chance to reach the Grand Final.
