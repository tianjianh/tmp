Flanagan, 23, has made 40 league appearances for Liverpool since his debut in 2010, including 23 in 2013-14 under Brendan Rodgers.
However, the Anfield youth product's progress stalled after after he had knee surgery in September 2014, and he has made just eight appearances since.
"It's a massive club with passionate fans, I can't wait," said Flanagan, who has played once for England.
Flanagan is Burnley's third summer signing, after Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Nick Pope both joined from Charlton Athletic.
