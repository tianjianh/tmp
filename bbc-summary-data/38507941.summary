Cameron Logan, 23, died in the blaze in Achray Place, Milngavie, on New Year's day. His girlfriend, Rebecca Williams, 24, remains in a critical condition.
Mr Logan's parents were also injured but have been released from hospital.
Police want to trace people who were running or walking dogs in the area when the deliberate blaze was set.
Det Ch Insp Paul Livingstone, from Police Scotland's Major Investigation Teams, said: "We are looking to trace a dog walker and two joggers that were seen after officers reviewed CCTV in the surrounding area around the time of the fire.
"It's crucial that we speak to these people seen on CCTV as they may have seen something important, even unwittingly, that could really help with this investigation.
"They may have seen the dark-coloured car that reportedly had its engine running in the lay-by on Craigton Road or they may have seen other people out walking, driving, cycling or running - anything that could help us find who is responsible for this fatal fire."
The detective said he wanted to trace two other dog walkers who were believed to have been in the surrounding area at the time of the fire.
He said: "One man was seen in the Craigton Wood area around the time the fire was discovered and is described as being 5ft 11in, of medium build and wearing a grey hooded top with black trousers. He was walking a brown Pitbull dog on a lead.
"Another man wearing a dark top was seen walking along Craigton Road on to the West Highland Way with two Springer Spaniels."
Det Ch Insp Livingstone said any contribution from potential witnesses "could be important to our investigation".
He added: "I would also appeal to any local residents with private CCTV cameras or motorists with dashcams who were in the area that morning to contact our inquiry team.
"It is absolutely crucial that we leave no stone unturned and view any footage that could potentially help us trace the person responsible for this despicable crime.
"A family is grieving for the son that they have lost and a young girl lies in critical condition in hospital. Please, if you have any information, no matter how small, please get in contact, as this person responsible must be caught."
The house on Achray Place is owned by Mr Logan's parents, David and Cathy, both 54.
Police said that Mr Logan and Ms Williams had been out celebrating Hogmanay and had returned to the house in the early hours of Sunday morning when the fire broke out.
Mr Logan snr and his wife both went back into the house with a neighbour to rescue Ms Williams.
Their son's body was discovered inside the house at about 07:30. The family dog, Gomez, also died in the fire.
Ms Williams, who is known as Bex, is a journalist with Global Radio. She remains in a critical condition in hospital.
Mr Logan's parents were treated for smoke inhalation and later released from hospital.
Officers are treating the case as murder and attempted murder.
