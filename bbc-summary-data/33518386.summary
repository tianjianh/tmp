The Paolos Pizzas van was hijacked in the Brandywell area and set on fire in the Bogside on Monday night.
A number of petrol bombs and other missiles were thrown at police during trouble.
Young people, some as young as 10, set barricades on fire.
Pallets and rubbish was set on fire at the Leckey Road and Westland Street.
The owner of Paolos Pizzas, Paul McShane, told BBC Radio Foyle that he feels "singled out in his own community".
"They took the van off the driver and he has been left pretty shook up," he said.
"This is the seventh van we have lost over the past few years. The public is going to suffer because of the lack of vans and it's really bad for business.
"It's deflating for me and the rest of the staff to be honest. I haven't spoken about it to anyone yet because I'm still quite numb about it and I just can't believe it.
"I haven't had much sleep. It's gone past the stage of anger.
"I was born and reared in the Bogside so it's shocking that people would do this. They need to wise up.
"This is a Â£14,000 van and it's only a year old. I won't let these people get to me."
A local resident said someone could have been killed or seriously injured after a petrol bomb was thrown through the window of her son's car.
"My son looked out the window and the police were at his car.
"The young people had smashed his window screen with a brick and threw petrol bombs into his car.
"The headrests in his car melted. The police took his car away then to make it safe.
"I am very angry. If it had ignited properly someone could have been injured or the house could have caught fire.
"We are used to it here which is sad to say."
