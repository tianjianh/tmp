Brown also confirmed that former Shrimpers striker Theo Robinson, 27, and 18-year-old ex-Rangers defender Tom Lang are on trial at Roots Hall.
Payne, 24, could come in after his namesake and fellow midfielder left Southend for Huddersfield this summer.
"I'm having a look at Jack Payne to replace Jack Payne, which is quite ironic," Brown told BBC Essex.
"I got a phone call from Peterborough and I think his services are no longer required there because of certain situations.
"They've brought in players, he's had a fall out with the management team and the hierarchy and this is a player they paid Â£600,000 for two years ago."
Meanwhile, Brown said striker Nile Ranger could be out for up to six weeks with an ankle injury.
