General election 2017: Welsh manifestos at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All of Wales' five main parties have published their Welsh general election manifestos.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The election on the 8 June is for the Westminster parliament, rather than the assembly, but parties are now in the habit of producing a distinct document for Wales.
They may include distinctive policies for Wales which can be implemented at Westminster, and may include proposal the parties for Wales' devolved policy areas.
You can find links here to detailed guides for each party - and we have listed the key pledges from each manifesto.

Skim-reading some of these manifestos, you might think that your vote will settle issues such as health and education in Wales.
But it will not.
Wales has a system of government where a number of things are in the hands of locally elected assembly members who sit in the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff Bay.
The last assembly election took place in 2016 and the next one is currently pegged for 2021.
Broadly, areas that are devolved include:
Things that are not devolved include foreign affairs, benefits, the armed forces, big energy projects, the Severn bridges and negotiations to leave the EU.
Having said this, the money that comes to Wales to fund locally controlled services still largely comes from Westminster.
So MPs can have an effect on the overall amount of cash that is spent at Cardiff, but it is up to ministers here to decide how to spend it.
