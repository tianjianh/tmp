Connaire McGreevy's sister Ciara died last month. He had changed his profile picture on Facebook to an image of her.
Mr Wells asked Mr McGreevy on Facebook: "Who is that drop dead gorgeous young women (sic) on your Facebook site?"
"Is she your daughter or a promotional model you have hired to advertise your company?"
He replied: "Eh, Jim Wells, that is my sister who passed away a month today."
Mr Wells, a former Northern Ireland health minister, responded to say he would delete the post. It has since been deleted.
A DUP spokesman said: "Jim has known Connaire a long time but was unaware that his sister had died.
"It was a light-hearted comment and when Connaire called him to explain he apologised.
"He didn't want to cause offence. It was certainly not what he set out to do."
