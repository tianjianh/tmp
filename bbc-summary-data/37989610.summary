The 30-year-old, who has scored five times in 16 international appearances, has struggled with injury this year but marked her return to action with two goals against Doncaster last month.
Liverpool captain Gemma Bonner, 25, has also been included.
Injured former captain Casey Stoney - who has 129 caps for England - and Fran Kirby have been left out of the squad.
The Lionesses will face the Euro 2017 hosts in Tilburg at 18:00 GMT in their final friendly of 2016.
England manager Mark Sampson said: "It's a unique chance to play at one of the stadiums where we will play in July and now that we know who we face at the Euros, the intensity and focus in our group will sharpen.
"We are nine games unbeaten and will be fighting to make that 10, but we are expecting a tough game against a fellow contender for the Euros."
The Euros begin on 16 July with Sampson's side opening their campaign against Scotland on 19 July before taking on Spain and Portugal in Group D.
