Plan for Aberdeen hotel at former E&Ms site withdrawn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to transform a famous Aberdeen city centre department store into a hotel and restaurant have been withdrawn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Esslemont and Macintosh - affectionately known simply as E&Ms - in Union Street closed in 2007.
Proposals could have seen the property converted into a 98-bedroom hotel, with a four-storey glass extension.
The store, established in 1873, closed with the loss of 100 jobs after receivers were called in.
