An hour-long edition of the BBC One soap begins at 20:45 GMT, the same time the final two-hour instalment of ITV's period drama begins.
When Downton Abbey went up against EastEnders on Christmas Day last year, the soap was watched by a consolidated audience of 8.6 million viewers.
Downton Abbey, in contrast, was seen by a total of 7.7 million.
That compares with the first Downton Abbey Christmas special in 2011, which drew a consolidated audience of 12.1 million.
Unlike overnight audience ratings, consolidated figures take catch-up services into account.
Set on New Year's Eve 1925, this year's Christmas edition of Downton Abbey will be the fans' last chance to spend time with Hugh Bonneville's Lord Grantham and the rest of the residents.
According to the Radio Times, "romance is in the air" in the final Downton Abbey episode - though "for some the year's end will prove bittersweet", it goes on.
Meanwhile, there has been speculation that EastEnders will seek to see off the ratings challenge by killing off one of Albert Square's residents.
Cab driver Charlie Slater, played by Derek Martin, is the bookmakers' favourite to be written out.
Fans of neither show have the option of watching Darcey Bussell pay homage to her Ballet Heroes on BBC Two or catching Alan Carr's Chatty Man on Channel Four.
Other offerings around the 20:45 time slot include a screening of James Bond film Quantum of Solace on ITV2 and a repeat of Chas and Dave's 1982 "Xmas Knees Up" on Channel 5.
Before Downton, ITV is putting its faith in extended, hour-long editions of Emmerdale and Coronation Street. The Downton finale will then be followed by a tribute to Cilla Black.
EastEnders, meanwhile, will follow festive specials of Doctor Who, Strictly Come Dancing and Call the Midwife on BBC One.
Following the soap will be the first of two festive episodes of Mrs Brown's Boys. The madcap comedy has topped the overall Christmas Day TV ratings for the last two years, pulling in 9.7 million viewers in 2014.
