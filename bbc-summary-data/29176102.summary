Richmond says no to Queen's Jubilee barge Gloriana base

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Richmond Council has thrown out plans to house the Queen's Jubilee barge after local objections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A public consultation was held on a proposal to give Gloriana a permanent home at Twickenham's former Orleans House boatyard on the river Thames.
But the council rejected the plans before the consultation finished, saying a "substantial majority of respondents" were against them.
In July some residents called the plans "dishonourable" which sparked a row.
Richmond councillor Pamela Fleming said there were "significant issues to address" on the proposed site, but added: "It is a pity that this beautiful craft, which was conceived on our river, will not find a home here."
The council said: "Though results of the consultation have not yet been fully analysed it is clear a substantial majority of respondents were opposed to Gloriana's permanent home at this site."
Lord Sterling, speaking for the Gloriana, acknowledged local opposition to the proposal and said "further locations along the river" would be explored.
The 94ft (28.6m) barge was presented to the Queen before a pageant of more than 1,000 boats sailed down the River Thames to mark the monarch's 60 years on the throne in 2012.
Gloriana is currently being housed temporarily at St Katharine Docks while a more permanent site is found.
Under the Orleans House plan, Richmond Council agreed to contribute "up to Â£1m" to the scheme which was due to include a new playground on the site. However, the council was unsure how much the project's final cost would be.
Some Richmond residents claimed the council's plans for Orleans Park were "dishonourable" and would damage the ecology of the park and pose a threat to a playground.
Mandie Adams McGuire, from Friends of Orleans Riverside, said: "We do not object to the beautiful Gloriana being housed in the borough of Richmond. Orleans Riverside is just fundamentally the wrong location.
"The nature and ecology of the area would be dramatically affected. The structure of the boathouse would be enormous - equivalent to 26 flats or seven houses."
