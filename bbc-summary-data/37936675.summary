They were on a shore excursion on the Caribbean island of Dominica on Wednesday when their tour bus was involved in a collision.
The P&O ship Azura sailed from Southampton on 28 October with more than 3,000 passengers on board.
P&O has confirmed that all those injured are British, and have been treated at a local hospital.
In a statement, the firm said: "P&O Cruises regrets to confirm that a bus operated by a shore excursion provider was involved in a collision in Dominica on Wednesday lunchtime.
"The bus was carrying 12 passengers, including 10 guests from Azura. The cause of the accident is not yet known."
The company said the majority of those injured had been discharged from hospital.
Senior vice-president Paul Ludlow said: "Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone touched by this tragic event.
"Our employees and crew are working to do everything we can to extend support and assistance to those affected and their loved ones."
The Foreign Office confirmed the deceased person and nine injured bus passengers were all British nationals.
It said: "Our staff are providing support and we will remain in close contact with P&O Cruises and the local authorities."
