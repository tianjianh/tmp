Valerie Armstrong was a mother of three young children.
The police have said she passed away peacefully in hospital on Wednesday night surrounded by her family.
A 17-year-old boy is due in Belfast Magistrate's Court on Thursday charged in connection with the incident.  A 15-year-old boy has been released on police bail.
The collision happened near Mila's Lake in Colin Glen Forest Park.
Mrs Armstrong was walking her dog along a pathway near the lake when she was struck by the scrambler.
Local priest Fr Vincent Cushnahan, who knew Valerie Armstrong, said: "It's the sudden arbitrary nature of this tragedy which is so shocking.
"It has wrenched a young mother, a young wife, from her children, her husband and the local community.
"What I understand, when Valerie was a younger person, she had an organ donation card.
"Her family are going to respect her wishes to donate her organs, in order to give life to other people, so out of this tragedy will come life.
"Three young children, the eldest son being nine years of age and two younger daughters who will find it very difficult to grow up without their mother in their lives," he added.
'Tragedy'
Local MLA Jennifer McCann said: "The whole tragedy of this set of circumstances is that there are three young children.
"Obviously children that young can't really take it in.
"The family know that people are there for them, we are trying to offer as much practical and emotional support as we can and that's all we can do at this time."
She added: "We had a series of meetings yesterday and we will be having more meetings tomorrow to try and look at the whole issue of scramblers and quads to try and get them off the streets because of the danger that they pose to people."
