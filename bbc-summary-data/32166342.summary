These are all things teachers have told Newsbeat happened to them on social media.
And the teaching union, NASUWT, says it's not unusual.
Their research suggests the number of staff facing sexist, racist and homophobic remarks - as well as personal attacks - has more than doubled in the last year.
Two teachers, who don't want to be named, told us how it happened to them:
A primary school teacher's story:
"A little boy had been naughty and I'd sent him to the head teacher for some time out from the classroom," she says.
"Then that evening the parents had a big rant on Facebook.
"And then the father of the child posted that I deserved a bullet through my head.
"The police took it very seriously and ran a background check on the father.
"It came up that they were members of a gun club and that was even more frightening.
"The school viewed it that they were just having a rant and that's probably correct, but you don't know who's reading those posts and what they might do."
It ended up affecting the teacher's work and the way she behaves in the classroom.
"I felt really intimidated. I felt like I needed a witness all the time with me to prove that everything was normal," she says.
"In the playground I felt intimidated by those parents."
A secondary school teacher's story:
"Myself and my colleagues have received numerous abuse online and on social media. Photos, name-calling, photos being taken without permission," he says.
"I've been accused of being a drug dealer. I've been abused online and been sworn at.
"It's extremely upsetting to read and see comments and posts on social media.
"It's very undermining when you teach in a large school and that is the gossip of the day."
He says he's very, very careful online after what's happened.
He's closed his Facebook account and has two Twitter accounts - a private one and a professional one.
"It does become quite difficult for you to take. Our role as a teacher is to educate and better the students," he says.
"We don't deserve this sort of abuse on a regular basis."
