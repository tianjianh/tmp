I'm quite upset but happy because maybe Zayn will do good on his own but I'm upset because now there are only 4 boys in 1D.

I never liked 1D in the first place so I think that Zayn is better off out of the band!

I actually loved One Direction when I was younger, but now I'm in love with 5SOS. It's really sad to see Zayn go. It just won't be the same.

Zayn Malik is the glue of the band. He is the one who holds 1D together. It will not be the same without poor Zayn.
Maisie, Kent, England
I think that we will hear more from Zayn as a solo artist but I am upset.
Martha, Sale, England
One Direction have a lovely voice but now Zayn's left the four might sound horrible.

I think One Direction should get Olly Murs to join them because they are amazing already and Olly would bring it up to a whole new level!

Although Zayn is not my favourite, it will not be the same without him. I will miss him.

I feel let down because Zayn said on The X Factor that the band were definitely going to stay together and it wasn't the last of One Direction.
Laurel, Tamworth, England
Zayn Malik was great in the band and he does a lot of singing in the songs. I don't know what One Direction will do without him. Liam is my favourite but it won't be the same without Zayn. Bye Zayn!
Bryony, Retford, England
I am really upset about Zayn leaving. I am a big fan of One Direction and I will miss him. Come back Zayn please!

I think that Zayn was an amazing member of the band and he had a future in singing. It's a shame to see Zayn go because they were my favourite band.
Mia, Omagh, Northern Ireland
One Direction will never be the same again because without Zayn they no longer make One Direction. I cried all last night but I will still support them as I have for the past 5 years.

I hate One Direction so I was really happy when I heard Zayn had left.
Alex, Wallington, England
I was really sad to hear about Zayn leaving but we all make our own decisions and that was Zayn's. Although he wasn't my favourite in 1D, I'll still miss him and it won't be the same.
Cerys, United Kingdom
I'm going to see One Direction in Cardiff in June and the concert won't be the same without him.
Lara, Port Talbot, Wales
I don't understand why people are upset.
Angely, London, England
I can't believe it! He was one of the best. Will One Direction turn into Wrong Direction?
Sophie, East Sussex, England
I think that One Direction are great as a full band. Even though Zayn is not my favourite in the band, it still won't be the same without him. It was always the 5, but now its the 4. Before you know it, it will be the 3, then the 2, then a solo artist.
Robyn, Essex, England
I think One Direction should stay together because they are a great band . Have a great future Zayn!

I am really upset that Zayn has left but I am excited for the band's future.
Ciara, Leeds, England
Good luck Zayn! I will miss you from 1D.

I think One Direction will carry on without him because they want to carry on. It's their choice and in this case no one's right or wrong.
Abbie, Nottinghamshire, England
I think that Zayn made the right decision to leave One Direction, even though I'll be very sad to see him leave!
