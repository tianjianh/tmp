Sue Pethnick, 55, was walking her red heeler at Gleesons Landing, a beach camping spot on the Yorke Peninsula.
She fell down a sandy embankment on Monday afternoon and broke her leg. The dog returned to the nearby campsite where her husband Michael was waiting.
"Abby the wonder dog, then led the man back to the cliff face several hundred metres away," SA Police said.
Paramedics and rescue crews arrived and the woman was flown by helicopter to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a stable condition.
"She's certainly a little hero now," Mr Pethnick told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
"I've just pulled a big bone out of the freezer so when that defrosts she'll get that."
