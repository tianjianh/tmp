The Spaniard, 23, started on pole but slipped to fifth place after an early technical issue.
He recovered and overtook Valentino Rossi with 12 laps to go, securing his fourth win of the season and taking his championship total to 248 points.
Rossi struggled to close down Marquez's lead and fell behind defending champion Jorge Lorenzo to finish in third.
Victory - the 28th of his career in the top category - gives Marquez a clear lead over second-placed Rossi, with four races remaining.
Earlier, Brad Binder became the first South African motorcycle grand prix world champion since 1980 as he won the Moto3 title.
