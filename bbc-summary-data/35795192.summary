[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British world champion Max Whitlock led throughout to win the gold medal at the Glasgow World Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old, the first British man to win a World Championships gold in Glasgow last year, finished with 89.299 points at the Emirates Arena.
Whitlock's compatriot Dan Purvis took bronze with 86.465, behind Brazil's Arthur Mariano (86.598).
Briton Claudia Fragapane (55.398) took bronze in the women's event, which USA's MyKayla Skinner won in 56.999.
Fragapane, who won four gold medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, was sixth after slipping during the bars.
But the 18-year-old recovered with a superb display on the beam and finished with a scintillating floor performance.
Whitlock was content with his victory in his first competition of the year and said: "My target coming in was to do clean routines and I'm happy to do that on all six pieces and come out with a good score and a gold medal.
"I'm starting to really enjoy competing in Glasgow, every time the atmosphere is amazing, they helped again today and if we can compete here again I'll be well happy."
