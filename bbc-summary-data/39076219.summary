[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prisoner accused of absconding from HMP Castle Huntly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prisoner has appeared in court accused of absconding from HMP Castle Huntly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Boyle, 24, is alleged to have gone on the run after being granted a period of home leave while serving eight years for the attempted murder of a former friend.
Prosecutors allege he repeatedly took steps to avoid being recaptured after failing to return to the open prison.
Boyle made a brief appearance in private at Perth Sheriff Court.
He was given a period of temporary home leave which was due to end with his return to the prison on 8 February.
The charge alleges that he failed to turn up at Buchanan Street bus station in Glasgow at 12:45 for pre-arranged transport back to the jail, in Longforgan, near Dundee.
It is also alleged that as a consequence of failing to adhere to the strict conditions of his temporary release, Boyle tried to defeat the ends of justice.
Boyle made no plea during a hearing before Sheriff Gillian Wade and was remanded in custody for further examination.
