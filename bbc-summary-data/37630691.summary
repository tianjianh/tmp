Neil Warnock: Cardiff face a difficult game against local rivals Bristol City

Getting a positive result against local rivals Bristol City will be a difficult task, according to new Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock.

Lee Johnson's side are fourth in the Championship and are on the back of a four-game winning streak in the league.
The game will be Warnock's first as the club's manager after he replaced Paul Trollope on 5 October.
"I think we can give them a game but we know how difficult it's going to be," Warnock said.
Warnock has not lost his first game in charge of a club since Oldham Athletic went down 2-1 to Bradford City in February 1997.
"You couldn't have a better derby than this. I'm sure the Bristol City fans will give me a good welcome," the former Rotherham, QPR and Sheffield United boss continued.
"Lee Johnson is showing what he can do and we're hoping that even in our position in the League, we can try and give him a good game.
"But I'm sure Fulham thought that and they got beaten 4-0 so we're hoping to do a bit better than that."
Cardiff won 2-0 away at Ashton Gate the last time the two sides met, but battled to a frustrating goalless draw against the Robins in their last meeting at the Cardiff City Stadium.
"The last time Bristol City played here, I was told they battered us. We can't allow that to happen but at the same time I realise we're playing against a good team," Warnock said.
"We've got some good players and we have to try and combat them and bring our strengths to the fore."
