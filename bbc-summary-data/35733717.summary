Clyde 1-0 Elgin City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clyde moved up to third in League Two after David Marsh's first-half strike handed them victory over Elgin City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Linton hit the bar before the hosts found themselves in front when Marsh fired in from the middle of the box.
Elgin had a great chance to level things up when they were awarded a spot-kick.
However, Craig Gunn's penalty was saved by Marc Waters, and Clyde held on to earn all three points.
