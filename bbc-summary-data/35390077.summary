[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Albion were awarded a penalty inside 30 seconds after Scott McBride was fouled by Scott Ross, and McBride stepped up to put the spot-kick past Graeme Smith.
James Redman headed Peterhead level, then they took the lead through McAllister's left-foot shot.
He made it three from the penalty spot before Sutherland scored twice inside five minutes.
