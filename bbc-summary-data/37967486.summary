A second prisoner who escaped from London's Pentonville prison on Monday has been recaptured by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Whitlock, 31, was arrested at an address in Homerton, east London, at about 16:30 GMT on Sunday.
Two men, aged 48 and 19, were also arrested at the address on suspicion of assisting an offender.
His fellow absconder, Matthew Baker, 28, was arrested at an address in Ilford, north-east London, on Wednesday.
Baker was taken to a north London police station, and then to hospital, where he remains, for treatment to a leg injury.
A 21-year-old woman and a 33-year-old man were also arrested. And a 24-year-old woman was arrested on Thursday.
Baker was awaiting sentencing for attempted murder. Whitlock was on remand charged with conspiracy to steal from 19 cash machines across south-east England between last December and August.
It is understood the pair used diamond-edged cutting equipment to break cell bars before scaling the perimeter wall of Pentonville.
Their escape was discovered when officers carrying out checks found two pillows made to look like bodies in the prisoners' beds on Monday morning.
