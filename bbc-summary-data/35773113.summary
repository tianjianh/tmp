[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sylvan Parry 'deeply ashamed' after attack on wife

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who attacked his wife in the street while walking their three children to school was "deeply ashamed" of what he had done, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sylvan Parry, 46, from Caernarfon, Gwynedd, denies attempting to murder Fiona Parry on 3 September.
Mr Parry's barrister told the jury at Mold Crown Court that he had "lost it" in a "moment of madness" but did not intend to kill her.
It comes as the jury have been sent to consider their verdict.
Mother-of-six Mrs Parry suffered life-changing injuries in the attack.
In his summing up for the defence, Dafydd Roberts said: "If he had been hell bent on killing his wife, he had every opportunity to do it and we would not be here today."
But the prosecution, in its closing speech, said witnesses had seen him kick her "like a footballer taking a penalty" and he was only stopped from stamping on her head when firefighters intervened.
Prosecutor Sion ap Mihangel told the jury Mr Parry might have "regretted" his actions but it was his intention that morning to kill her.
The court had heard the couple, who had been together for 16 years, had argued earlier that morning because she wanted amphetamine and they continued arguing on the school run.
Taking to the witness stand on Wednesday, Mr Parry said they had "a Bonnie and Clyde" relationship.
He said he had been on drugs at the time of the assault, agreed he had lost his temper but said he had not intended to kill her.
He said he felt so ashamed that he had tried to kill himself.
A Home Office pathologist had told the court that without the "fortuitous" intervention of the firefighters and the first aid they delivered, the outcome could have been much more serious.
The case continues.
