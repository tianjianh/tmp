The couple, who never married, spent 13 years together and have a son aged 11 and a daughter who is seven.
They first met when Burton, 56, directed Carter, 48, in 2001's Planet of the Apes.
A representative for Bonham Carter told People Magazine that they "separated amicably earlier this year and have continued to be friends and co-parent their children."
"We would ask that you respect their privacy and that of their children during this time."
Since working together on Planet of the Apes, the couple have teamed up on several blockbusters, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd, Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows.
They were pictured together earlier this week at Cats the Musical at London Palladium.
For years the film director and actress lived in separate homes right next door to each other, something Carter said worked well for them.
"It really is a great idea," she told The Guardian in 2010. "You never have to compromise emotionally or feel invaded."
Still, she added: "He always visits, which is really touching. He's always coming over."
