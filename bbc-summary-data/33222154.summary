An inquiry is underway after 40 people were treated for breathing problems following the leak at Wild Duck Holiday Park in Belton near Great Yarmouth.
The complex has been evacuated and the pool remains closed to the public.
Haven, who own the site, said new arrivals on Monday would be directed to one of three other nearby parks.
The Health and Safety Executive, Great Yarmouth Borough Council environment services and Norfolk Fire Service chemical leak unit are involved in an investigation of the cause of the leak.
Hospitals in Gorleston, Norwich and Ipswich treated 33 for the effects of breathing in fumes and seven of those were kept in for observation overnight.
It has emerged that there may have been problems at the swimming pool earlier in the week.
Lesley Burrows, from Thetford, was there with young children from her sister's family.
"On the night they had persistent coughs and were very wheezy. They complained about the smell at the swimming pool.
"I was not swimming so it did not affect me and we did not think much of it at the time.
"We thought it was just normal swimming pool smell but after the incident on Sunday we began to think differently.
"We were going to go swimming again but decided to go to the beach instead and I think we were lucky to have done that."
Haven has said the investigation would be looking at the amount of chlorine that the pool equipment provided or whether it was some other cause.
