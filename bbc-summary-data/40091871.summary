Leinster retain Leo Cullen and Stuart Lancaster in coaching roles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leo Cullen has been given a two-year contract extension as head coach of Leinster with Stuart Lancaster also retained in the role of senior coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leinster have not specified the length of Lancaster's deal, or that of assistant coaches Girvan Dempsey and John Fogarty, who also stay on.
Lancaster resigned after four years as England boss when the hosts failed to get out of their 2015 World Cup pool.
Leinster reached the semi-finals of the Champions Cup and Pro12 this season.
Cullen, who won 221 caps for Leinster and was captain of three Heineken Cup-winning squads, was appointed head coach at the start of the 2015/16 season.
He will now lead the province until the end of the 2018/19 season.
"I think Leo deserves enormous credit for the way he has stepped up to the mark over the last two seasons," said Leinster chief executive Mick Dawson.
"There have of course been challenges and disappointments but already in his short career as head coach he has led Leinster to a Guinness Pro12 final and to successive top two regular season finishes."
On Lancaster's contribution, Dawson stated: "Stuart has had a huge impact on this club since his arrival in early September and he brings with him a wealth of experience, both on and off the field, that has helped Leo and the other coaches and players massively".
"His dedication to the Leinster cause is there for all to see and he has been welcomed with open arms by everyone at the club."
Head analyst Emmet Farrell now also takes on the role of kicking coach for next season.
