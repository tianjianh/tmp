Jonah scored 37 tries for New Zealand between 1994 and 2002 and was capped 63 times for the All Blacks.
He became a star all around the world after scoring four tries against England in the 1995 World Cup in South Africa.
He had been diagnosed with a rare kidney condition by 1996 which forced him to quit rugby.
Jonah had a kidney transplant in 2004, but the organ stopped working fully in 2011.
"Jonah was a legend of our game and loved by his many fans both here and around the world," said New Zealand Rugby chief executive Steve Tew.
The New Zealand great will be remembered for "changing rugby union", says former England head coach Sir Clive Woodward.
