The hashtag #ShakeItOffJalene took off after 4-year-old Jalene Salinas's family said on Facebook she wanted to dance with her favourite singer and "shake off" cancer.
Although Taylor couldn't visit Jalene in Texas, they chatted on FaceTime.
Taylor spoke to Jalene for around twenty minutes, reports the New York Daily News. She was told Jalene was feeling too unwell to dance.
"I'm so sorry you're having a bad night," Taylor said, "I'm so happy to talk to you though and I'm so happy you like Shake It Off.
"You look beautiful tonight, you really do. You're just as pretty as your pictures."
Jalene's mother said that on Sunday her "princess" had "gained her beautiful angel wings".  Taylor sent flowers to the family.
Jennifer Arriaga - Jalene's mum - thanked Taylor Swift and posted pictures of her gifts on the Jalene's Journey Facebook page.
Many people have posted their condolences and there are lots of comments complimenting Taylor Swift on her generosity.
"Thank you Taylor Swift!! We know #PrincessJalene is dancing in Heaven to your song #ShakeItOff!" wrote one fan.
Another said: "That is what people in that industry should be doing and she is setting the bar really high for people to follow. Continue to be the role model you are Taylor so other kids like Jalene continue to feel special by creating moments like you did for this precious angel."
Jalene's mum Jennifer says: "This is not over because Jalene will live on in the hearts of everyone. We will continue to spread her kind hearted nature. Her ability to care for others."
Jalene's funeral is on Friday.
