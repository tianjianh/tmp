The Englishman, 38, was one of six men competing for five spots at Oakmont, Pennsylvania and emerged successful after the second play-off hole.
"Mission accomplished," he wrote on Instagram. "Can't wait to get to Oakmont next week for the US Open."
Donald has played in 10 of the last 11 US Opens, withdrawing from the other.
He added. "I've had to qualify the last two years for the US Open, haven't liked it, but somehow making it this way feels pretty damn rewarding."
Americans Patrick Rodgers, Jason Allred, Richard Schembechler II and Scottie Scheffler were the others to qualify from the play-off.
