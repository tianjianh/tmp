Organiser, Karen Rogers, whose maiden name was Liddiard, organised the event after researching her family tree for over 20 years.
The Liddiards married into the Seymour family, whose descendents included Jane Seymour the third wife of Henry VIII.
Parish records for Aldbourne, Wiltshire show from 1625 until 1925, more than 900 Liddiards had lived in the village.
Mrs Rogers has traced the origins of her family to Rockley near Marlborough in the 15th Century.
The family was concentrated in Ogbourne St Andrew and Aldbourne in the centuries that followed.
"The Liddiards were quite a wealthy family, they actually owned Rockley Manor for a time," she said.
"They're the family that we can trace without a broken line from 1453 till today and one of their descendents will be coming along," added Mrs Rogers.
From the 17th, 18th and 19th Centuries the family spread across England and its colonies.
Kelvin Derek Lydiard and his wife Jacqueline travelled from Perth, Australia for the event.
Mr Lydiard said: "It's a really mind-boggling experience just to meet other family members who have stayed in England and around the local area.
"Where we come from, there aren't many at all."
His wife Jacqueline added: "It's quite spooky as we walked on to the green and I thought Oh my God he looks like my husband. It's just amazing.
"Even one of the wives said, 'your husband looks like my husband'."
