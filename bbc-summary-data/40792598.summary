Kevin Lokko: Stevenage sign Maidstone United defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage have signed Maidstone United centre-back Kevin Lokko for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An offer made for the 21-year-old by the League Two side was enough to trigger a release clause in his contract with the National League club.
The ex-Norwich academy player featured 46 times for Maidstone last term.
Lokko, an England C international, is yet to play in the English Football League, despite spending a season with Colchester after leaving the Canaries.
