Czech Pliskova, who won the Aegon International at Eastbourne, was beaten 6-3 5-7 2-6 and is the highest-ranked player to exit the women's draw.
Top seed Angelique Kerber is through after beating Kirsten Flipkens 7-5 7-5.
"I am speechless right now," said Slovakia's Rybarikova, 28, who only returned to the tour in February after a seven-month lay-off with injuries.

Rybarikova, who reached a career-high ranking of 31 in 2013, had surgery on her left wrist and right knee in 2016 and missed the rest of the season after a first-round defeat at Wimbledon last year.
But victory over Pliskova, made it 15 wins out of 16 in grass-court matches this summer.
"It's special. It's amazing," she told the BBC. "It was very difficult to play Karolina Pliskova. I was not so confident.
"I had two surgeries and hadn't played for seven months. It was a difficult time for me and my coach told me that something good was going to happen.
"Could I win Wimbledon? I'm not thinking about it. It will be very difficult."

Pliskova, 25, who reached the French Open semi-finals, will still end the tournament as world number one unless Halep reaches the semi-final or Kerber reaches the final.
"Obviously it's disappointing," she said. "My expectations were a little bit different than to make one round here. That's tennis, you know. You still can play well and you don't have to win.
"That's my case today. I think it was a very tough round for a second round. Very tricky opponent. I was close definitely to winning but didn't play well enough today."
Germany's Kerber and Belgian Flipkens twice broke each other in the first set, before the world number one seized the initiative with a break at 6-5 and served for the set.
The 2016 runner-up led 5-3 in the second set and looked to be cruising to victory on Court One, but Flipkens broke again to level at 5-5.
Kerber broke back immediately and then negotiated a tricky final game to secure her place in the third round after one hour and 44 minutes.
"She played well, going to the net and playing old tennis serve and volley," said Kerber.
"I played some really good tennis and feel my rhythm is back and I am fighting for every single point."

Elsewhere, Polish ninth seed Agnieszka Radwanska came from a set down to beat American Christina McHale 5-7 7-6 (9-7) 6-3.

Russian seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova eased to a 6-0 7-5 victory over compatriot Ekaterina Makarova in 69 minutes.
American 24th seed Coco Vandeweghe progressed by beating Germany's Tatjana Maria in straight sets, while Caroline Wozniacki won 6-3 6-4 against Tsvetana Pironkova.
Spain's 14th seed Garbine Muguruza, Wimbledon runner-up in 2015 and a former French Open champion, won saw off Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer 6-2 6-4.
