The 22-year-old had to come from behind to claim a 15-14 win over Velikaya, 31, the silver medallist from London 2012.
Ukranian Olga Kharlan took bronze with a 15-10 win over France's Manon Brunet.
Fencing governing body the FIE cleared all 16 Russians to compete, after the International Olympic Committee rejected a blanket ban on the country.
The call had come from the World Anti-Doping Agency in the wake of an independent report into state-sponsored doping in the country.
The FIE said it had "re-examined the results from 197 tests taken by Russian athletes in 35 countries, including Russia, between 2014 and 2016" and all were negative.
