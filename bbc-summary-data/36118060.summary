Officers were called to the property on May Street just after 18:00 BST on Friday.
Humberside Police said the deaths "are still being treated as suspicious, but unexplained".
The men have not been formally identified and a post-mortem examination will take place later to establish the cause of death.
Det Supt Matt Hutchinson from the force's Major Crime Unit said: "Unsurprisingly this incident will be of great concern to the local community and as a result extra officers will be in the May Street area carrying out enquiries and reassuring the public.
"Significant enquiries are under way to establish how and when the men died.
"A large number of police resources are working on the investigation carrying out house to house, CCTV and forensic enquiries."
