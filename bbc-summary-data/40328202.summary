[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oil and gas industry technologies could aid nuclear work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The nuclear industry is looking at how it might use technologies being used in the decommissioning of North Sea oil and gas installations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) is overseeing the dismantling of several UK sites, including Dounreay near Thurso in Caithness.
Representatives from the NDA and oil and gas experts have met in Aberdeen to share information.
One of the areas covered was the decommissioning of oil pipelines.
The event was held at Aberdeen's Oil and Gas Technology Centre.
The NDA said it was actively looking outside its sector for technologies to use in the decommissioning of nuclear power sites.
Among major Scottish oil and gas installations being decommissioned are the Buchan Alpha floating production vessel off Aberdeen, and the Beatrice complex in the Moray Firth.
