Robin Hood has hailed the decision to award Nottingham Castle with £14m of lottery funding.

The money will go towards a £30m revamp of the castle which will showcase 1,000 years of Nottingham's history.
Tim Pollard, the city's official Robin Hood, read from a scroll delivered on horseback announcing the securing of the Heritage Lottery Fund money.
Nottingham City Council hope the project will attract 40,000 visitors in the first year.
In a special event at the castle, Mr Pollard, dressed as the famous outlaw, said: "A message has arrived from the Heritage Lottery Fund, my friends, I can now announce that we have been successful."
Nottingham City Council said the money will help transform the castle and make it a "source of pride" for the people of the city.
Many tourists say they are disappointed when they see the building, which was substantially demolished in the 17th Century.
While there will be an interactive Robin Hood gallery, displays will also be themed around industry and rebellion in Nottingham.
Jonathan Platt, head of Heritage Lottery Fund East Midlands, said while the castle will always be linked to Robin Hood there were many other stories linked to "political rebellion, riots and intrigue".
He said: "This extraordinary historic building will once more become a focal point for Nottingham."
As well as new galleries, works include restoration to the gatehouse and galleries, a remodelling of the grounds, a new visitor centre and better access to the caves.
About £5.5m of the total cost of the revamp will come from council taxpayers, the authority has confirmed.
The council expects to attract 40,000 visitors in the first year and claims the scheme would boost the local economy by more than £90m over 10 years.
