A man charged with murdering a US tourist and wounding five other people in a knife attack in central London has been deemed fit to stand trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zakaria Bulhan, of south-west London, is accused of murdering retired teacher Darlene Horton, 64, during the attack in Russell Square on 3 August.
His barrister, John Jones QC, confirmed on Thursday that Mr Bulhan was mentally fit to plead and stand trial.
The 19-year-old appeared via video link for the Old Bailey hearing.
At a previous hearing, the court heard there were psychiatric issues in the case to be looked into.
Mrs Horton was visiting London with her husband, Richard Wagner, a university professor from Florida who was teaching summer classes, and was due to return to their home in Tallahassee the following day.
Martin Hoenisch, Lillie Selletin, David Imber, Bernard Hepplewhite and Yovel Lewronski were all injured in the attack.
Judge Mr Justice Spencer remanded Mr Bulhan, a Norwegian national of Somali origin from Wandsworth, into custody and set a trial date of 6 February 2017.
The trial is expected to last about two weeks.
