James Beattie: Former Accrington manager appointed Leeds first-team coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Accrington Stanley manager James Beattie has been appointed first-team coach at Championship side Leeds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beattie was named Stanley boss in May 2013, before leaving the League Two club in September 2014, having won only 16 of his 58 games in charge.
The 38-year-old worked under Leeds boss Garry Monk at Swansea, but left in December following Monk's dismissal.
Meanwhile, defender Giuseppe Bellusci, 26, has joined Empoli on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent deal.
Bellusci made 61 appearances for Leeds after signing from Catania in August 2014, but has returned to Italy because of family reasons.
