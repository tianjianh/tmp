However, this celebration of Sunday night's surprise victory over hosts France wasn't on the streets of Lisbon, Porto or SetÃºbal.
This party was on the streets of Dungannon, County Tyrone.
Among those who took to the streets was 17-year-old Luciano Joao, who has been living in Dungannon since he was 10.
He watched the game at home, then made his way to the town centre where he estimated about 150 Portugal fans were enjoying the country's first ever European Championship.
"Once the match was over and Portugal got the trophy, we all just went out. I called a couple of friends and went up the town and once I was there, there were already all these people out partying," Luciano said.
"It was just completely different from anything else. Just full of delight really."
He said some local Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland fans joined in the celebrations, as did many members of Dungannon's East Timorese community.
Luciano said that while he was optimistic ahead of the game, Christiano Ronaldo's early exit through injury put serious doubts in his mind.
He also admitted that Portugal's indifferent start to the tournament was not inspiring.
"We didn't start off too well, but we got there in the end," he said.
"It was quite a bit of a surprise though."
The celebrations continuing into the early hours of Monday with some fans not getting to bed until about 05:00 BST.
One fan explained to the BBC why he was having trouble speaking the day after the victory.
"Last night I jumped like crazy, I run like crazy and today my voice is gone," he said.
"But no problem, it'll come back again."
Ulster Unionist councillor Walter Cuddy, who runs a newsagents shop  in the town, said it was great to see the Portuguese celebration.
"There were a lot of men and women going to work early in the morning that called into the shop and they were still on a high, they obviously were celebrating right through the night," he said.
"We probably have representatives from most countries in Europe here - we are an industrial town - but it's great to see people getting on and everybody was pleased for them."
