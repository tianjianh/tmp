The Montecito Award is given for an actor's "great contribution to film".
The festival's executive director Roger Durling praised Oscar-nominated Stallone for his comeback performance, in Creed, calling him a "true legend".
Previous recipients of the award include Daniel Day Lewis, Kate Winslet, Geoffrey Rush and Julianne Moore.
Stallone's performance as Rocky Balboa has already won him a Golden Globe and a Critics' Choice Award for best supporting actor earlier this month.
He was previously nominated for best actor and best original screenplay Oscars in 1977 for Rocky - making him the sixth person in the history of the Oscars to be nominated for playing the same character in different films.
Creed sees his character become a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, son of Rocky's old rival Apollo Creed.
Durling said: "Sylvester Stallone's performance in Creed has reminded us of what a true talent he is and what a joy it is to share in his successes as the many beloved characters he has created.
"Since he first hit the silver screen as Rocky Balboa nearly four decades ago, he has been a force in the industry both on film and behind the scenes.
"He is a true legend in our field, and it is our privilege to present him with the Montecito Award, and to continue to honour his legacy."
The SBIFF also paid tribute to Stallone as an "accomplished artist" who has had "impressive exhibitions" of his paintings and sculptures, some of which are inspired by his film roles, around the world.
Stallone, whose other work includes the Rambo films, Copland and Nighthawks, will receive the award at the Arlington Theatre in Santa Barbara on 9 February.
The festival runs from 3 to 13 February.
