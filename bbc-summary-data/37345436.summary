The spell of warm Autumn weather is forecast to continue across parts of England until Friday.
Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England have both warned that the weather can pose a risk to health.
Elsewhere, yellow warnings for rain are in place for some parts of northern England and southern Scotland.
As much as 30mm (one inch) of thundery, torrential rain could cause flash flooding and travel disruption in places during the afternoon and evening, the Met Office said.
The highest temperature of 2016 had previously been 34.1C, which was reached on 23 August at Faversham in Kent.
The all-time record for September of 35.6C (96.1F) was set in 1906, in Bawtry, South Yorkshire.
NHS England has declared a level-two heat alert, which means there is a high chance that an average temperature of 30C (86F) by day and 15C (59F) overnight will occur over the next two to three days.
These temperatures can have a "significant effect" on a person's health if they last for at least two days and the night in between, it said.
The East of England, the South East, and the East Midlands are expected to have some of the hottest weather.
Aberdeen and Glasgow will possibly see temperatures of 20C (68F) to 23C (73.4F), and there is a chance Aviemore could hit 24C (75.2F).

Heatwave myths and how to stay cool
Dr Thomas Waite, from the extreme events team at PHE, said: "Think today about what you can do, and for those around you, to stay cool during the daytime and particularly at night.
"Much of the advice on beating the heat is common sense and for most people there's nothing to really worry about.
"But for some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, summer heat can bring real health risks."
Jacob Cope, BBC Weather Centre Meteorologist
Hurricane Hermine, which hit Florida in early September, pushed large kinks into the jet stream - large atmospheric waves which lock our weather patterns in place. For Spain and Portugal, that meant temperatures rising to 10C above average last week.
A large area of high pressure centred over northern Europe has brought southerly winds, which have drawn this warm air northwards, reaching our shores today. And we have mainly clear skies across much of England, so we're topping it up ourselves.
We saw 31C in September in 1973, and in 1961, in Gatwick, the temperature recorded was 31.6C. It's very doubtful that we will break the all-time record though, as a 1906 heat wave brought September temperatures of 35.6C (96.08F).
The high temperatures predicted means that Britain could be as warm as Bangkok in Thailand, and hotter than forecasts for Madrid and Los Angeles.
Dr Waite added: "The hot weather won't make life difficult for all of us; indeed, many of us will make the most of it when the sun shines.
"But some people may not be able to adapt to the extra strain hot weather will put on their bodies and may feel the ill-effects.
"Each year we hear stories of people who have fallen seriously ill because, even though it's hotter, they may wear clothes which are too warm for hot weather, they may not drink enough or just try to do too much."
Dr Waite advised people to close curtains on windows that face the sun during the day, and to open windows once the sun is no longer on them to get a breeze.
He added that people should think about turning off electrical devices, as they can generate unwanted heat.
