Jordan Miers was reported missing on Sunday afternoon after failing to return home from a night out with work friends on Saturday night.
He was last seen Park Tawe retail park at about 10.30 GMT by a person who followed him for a time because they were concerned for his safety.
He had appeared "intoxicated" and crossed a river bridge onto a towpath.
CCTV footage shows Mr Miers leaving the retail park and police believe he may have planned to walk home to Bonymaen in the direction of the Liberty Stadium.
Ch Insp Chris Truscott said searches had taken place along routes the children's football coach may have used and specialist teams had joined the hunt.
"We have utilised the police helicopter and specialist teams and further specialist resources have been deployed today [Wednesday] to carry out a search of the river," he added.
Ch Insp Truscott appealed for anyone who saw Mr Miers after 22:00 GMT on Saturday to contact the police.
