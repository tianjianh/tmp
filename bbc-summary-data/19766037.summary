Christopher Davey, 51 and from Moulton, was one of the seven Britons killed when a plane heading for the Everest region crashed in Nepal's capital.
The Sita Air plane came down minutes after taking-off from Kathmandu for Lukla, killing 19 people.
Peter Glennon, from the Rotary Club of Nene Valley said: "It has come as a great shock to all of his friends."
Mr Davey was the club secretary for the Rotary Club.
Mr Glennon said: "There would be a lot of young people who would recognise him because he was the guy running around in the yellow tabard making sure that all the young people had a good time.
"One of Chris's pleasures was doing things like trekking. He had been telling us for many weeks about how he was planning to do this."
Andy Pickering, who had known Mr Davey since 1984 when they began working together at the Caswell Research Centre near Towcester, said he would remember his friend as being good company.
"He didn't have a family or kids," Mr Pickering said.
"He spent most of his time outside work working for charities and he was never flamboyant or extravagant.
"Perhaps his one indulgence was going on these treks around the world."
The other British victims of the crash in Kathmandu, identified by travel company Sherpa Adventures, were Raymond Eagle, aged 58, Vincent Kelly, 50, Darren Kelly, 45, Timothy Oakes, 57, Stephen Holding, 60, and Benjamin Ogden, 27.
The Britons' next of kin have been contacted by the Foreign office.
Officials said the aircraft crashed into a river bank and caught fire.
The group was due to complete its expedition in mid-October.
The cause of the crash has not yet been officially confirmed.
