[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He had powder paint smeared on his face as part of the festival of  Holi.
He was visiting Okhari, a village in the mountains, to see the Gurkha Welfare Trust's efforts to rebuild a school wrecked by an earthquake.
On his arrival Harry received a rapturous welcome by the villagers who decked him with garlands and scarves.
The prince had spent the previous night as the guest of Mangali Tamang, the 86-year-old widow of a former Gurkha rifleman.
He described the experience of sleeping under the same roof as the Nepalese family as "peaceful, actually. Lots of dogs barking, but it didn't seem to bother them."
The prince visited the Gauda Secondary School in the village, to see how the British-based Gurkha Welfare Trust is helping to fund the rebuilding after it was damaged during last year's earthquake.
The prince's trip is celebrating 200 years of relations between Nepal and Britain. His tour comes as the country is rebuilding after last year's devastating earthquake which killed more than 8,000 people.
