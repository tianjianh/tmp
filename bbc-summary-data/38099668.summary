Work 'extra hours' to finish Bristol roadworks, urges MP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An MP has urged contractors to "work extra hours" to finish roadworks which are causing rush hour congestion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Lopresti, MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke, said work to build a new public transport system near Bristol has "gone on too long".
In 2015 traffic lanes were closed at Bradley Stoke to construct the MetroBus project.
Commuters have since reported long delays to their journeys.
Mr Lopresti has held a meeting with councillors and contractors to discuss the daily "gridlock".
In a statement, the Conservative MP said he asked contractors Alun Griffiths "to consider working on the sites for more hours each day to get the work done as quickly as possible and to minimise the congestion at peak times".
A representative from Alun Griffths said they had worked extra hours and they were constrained by health and safety legislation.
The contractor added works were delayed by unexpected problems dealing with uncharted water and gas mains.
In a bid to alleviate the congestion problems an extra lane has been opened on Bradley Stoke Way.
A third lane from Bradley Stoke Way on to Aztec West will be open within two weeks.
Earlier this week Mr Lopresti met Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling to ask him to "put pressure" on the council to resolve the problem.
