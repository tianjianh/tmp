McIlroy said on Monday evening that an MRI scan had revealed "no new injury, rather a low grade response to the rib joint I injured earlier in the year".
"As of now I am still entered into the BMW PGA Championship," said McIlroy.
He said he would decide early next week whether he was "in a position to compete" at Wentworth.
The European Tour's flagship event takes place from 25-28 May.
The world number two revealed on Friday that he was feeling discomfort in his back and he went on to finish in a share of 35th place, 12 shots behind winner Kim Si-Woo of South Korea.
The Northern Irishman missed a number of events in the Middle East and the US earlier this year after being bothered by a rib stress fracture at the South African Open in January.
