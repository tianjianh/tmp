The 7,500 tonne warship, HMS Duncan, slipped into the water from BAE's shipyard at Govan.
The vessel will provide air defence cover, be able to carry up to 60 Royal Marine Commandos and operate a variety of helicopters from its flight deck.
It will enter service in 2014. The completed Type 45s are Daring, Diamond, Dauntless, Dragon and Defender.
The vessel is named after Admiral Adam Duncan, who led the Royal Navy's victory over the Dutch fleet in 1797.
It was built by BAE Systems with 2,800 tonnes of steel - more than used in Blackpool Tower.
The ship is equipped with the Sea Viper missile system, designed to tackle multiple airborne or sea-based targets.
Minister for Defence Equipment, Peter Luff, said: "The launch of HMS Duncan is the culmination of a huge effort by workers here on the Clyde, across the country throughout the supply chain, and in the MoD, completing this class of potent warfighters of which everyone involved can be very proud.
"Following on from HMS Daring being declared in service and the successful first firing of the Sea Viper missile system, this is another significant milestone in the delivery of a truly world-class air defence capability to the Royal Navy."
Commander-in-Chief Fleet Admiral Sir Trevor Soar added: "The Type 45 is world class. These ships are as versatile as they are powerful.
"Providing flexible global reach they will deliver broad utility, common to maritime forces, and give the UK military, diplomatic and political options, with their ability to exert effect on land from the sea.
"This ranges from deterrence and conflict prevention right up to high intensity war fighting and all points between."
