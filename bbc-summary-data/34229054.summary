Newcastle protest against asylum seeker dawn raids

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A protest against the "thieves in the night" removal of asylum seekers has been staged in Newcastle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened at the Home Office asylum support offices at Link House.
Abraham Eiluorior, of the campaigning and support group Beyond Borders Tyneside, said houses were being raided early in the morning.
The Home Office said the UK had a "proud history" of providing asylum, but those who did not need protection would be expected to leave.
Mr Eiluorior said: "They normally come like thieves in the night to raid asylum seekers and deport them to countries where they fear persecution and violence.
"The suddenness of these raids makes it very difficult for families to contact or access appropriate legal processes.
"It is very traumatic for both the family and for the community left behind."
He said the deportations happened "almost every day" and people were often taken straight to Heathrow airport.
The raids were usually conducted at about 04:30 or 05:00, he said.
He also claimed some were deported before they had finished the official process of making their case to stay.
"These dawn raids are carried out in secret - families with young children are being taken from their beds without anyone knowing."
The Home Office said in a statement: "The UK has a proud history of granting asylum to those who genuinely need it, but where someone is found not to need our protection, we expect them to leave the country voluntarily.
"This is important in ensuring that our help is directed to those who really need it.
"Assistance can be provided to people found not to have the right to remain in the UK in returning to their home country. If they refuse to engage with this process we will enforce their removal."
