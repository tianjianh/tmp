[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to replace Bristol Suspension Bridge's "unattractive" and "shabby" toll booths, have been brought forward.

The 1950s-built booths on the Clifton side and the 1970s-era additions on the Leigh Woods side are "no longer fit for purpose", trustees have said.
Architects are currently drawing up plans for "new attractive buildings" offering more up-to-date accommodation for the bridge's 12 attendants.
Subject to planning consent, they could be in place by late 2017.
Bridge Master David Anderson said they aimed to provide "good conditions and a workable layout" for staff.
"The current buildings do not fit well with the character of the bridge and appear rather shabby, especially when compared to the two original 1864 toll booths at the Leigh Woods end," he said.
"We intend to continue to preserve these buildings."
A consultation is due to get under way on 29 September, with the launch of an exhibition at the Bridge Visitor Centre.
