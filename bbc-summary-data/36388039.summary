[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 17-month-old boy had cocaine and cannabis in his system when he was murdered by his mother's boyfriend, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jurors at Cardiff Crown Court were told Finley Thomas had been exposed to drugs by his mother and her partner.
Sean Buckley, 28, denies murdering Finley at his home in Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taff.
Both Mr Buckley and Finley's mother, Chloe Thomas, 25, deny cruelty to a young person under 16.
The court heard Ms Thomas was hooked on illegal drugs and the tranquillizer diazepam during her "infatuation" with Mr Buckley.
Their trial was told on Thursday how a post mortem examination on Finley's body showed he had the same drugs in his system.
Roger Thomas QC, prosecuting, said: "Allowing him to suffer drug contamination is evidence of a lack of care and a lack of concern amounting to neglect."
Ms Thomas called 999 on 23 September 2014, saying her son had fallen down the stairs.
He was taken to hospital, but died the next day.
Mr Buckley's phone showed he had run up drug debts from buying and selling cannabis and cocaine.
Mr Thomas told the court the couple exchanged text messages to "get their story straight" about how Finley "fell down the stairs", as well as how he had got several other earlier injuries.
"It summarises her view of Buckley. She saw no wrong in him and she put the interest of her child second to that of Buckley and ignored what was plainly in front of her eyes," he said.
Previously, the court heard how a garden chair was used to kill Finley.
Mr Thomas said: "The death was caused by Buckley on a defenceless 17-month-old child, with what we claim was quite senseless violence, by shaking him and forcing him against a chair."
The trial continues.
