The six-time champion saw off his compatriot 7-5 6-3 at London's O2 Arena to reach the final for the 10th time.
Djokovic earlier beat Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-3 and remains on track for a fourth straight season-ending title.
Federer and Djokovic were due to play in last year's final but the Swiss pulled out with a back injury.
"Novak should be knocked out by now. No, I am joking," said Federer, who beat Djokovic in the group stage on Tuesday.
"He played a great match against Rafael Nadal earlier today and I'm sure it will be a fantastic meeting."
It might have ended with the same winner, but Federer's dismissal of Wawrinka was a far more straightforward affair than last year's semi-final.
Twelve months ago, there was drama on and off court as Wawrinka missed four match points and became embroiled in a row with Federer's wife, Mirka.
Once again, the O2 Arena was a Swiss outpost as the nation's tennis fans descended en masse in east London, but the actual contest was far tamer this time around.
Wawrinka grabbed an early break but could not hang on from 4-2 as a serve-volleying Federer moved forward at every opportunity to claim an emphatic win.
After levelling at 4-4, the 17-time Grand Slam champion clinched the set with a second break after two cross-court forehands and quickly moved 3-0 clear in the second.
Wawrinka had one fleeting chance to break but could not convert and Federer wrapped up in an impressive 70 minutes.
The world number one was at his clinical best to draw level at 23-23 in career meetings with Nadal and claim his eighth win in their last nine matches.
Nadal had been the story of the group stage as he racked up three impressive wins and talked about getting back to his best form, while Djokovic had played below his own very lofty standards.

The Serb set that right within five minutes on Saturday with a breathtaking return game, four clean winners helping him break Nadal's serve to love.
It was all Djokovic required to take the first set as Nadal failed to make any impression against the top seed's punishing accuracy.
Nadal, with 14 Grand Slam titles to Djokovic's 10, saved a break point at the start of the second set, but succumbed in a brutal 25-stroke rally in game five.
Djokovic had lost just 10 points on serve and finished in spectacular style with another break, two superb lobs, a deft drop volley and two searing backhand winners closing it out.
"It was a great performance from the very beginning," said Djokovic. "I was trying to be aggressive and dictate the play, and I managed to pull out my best game when it was needed the most."
Asked to pick out Djokovic's main strengths, Nadal said: "Everything. He's hitting amazing. The return was always amazing. This year he's serving great, I think.
"When somebody's doing like this, the only thing I can do is congratulate him and just wish him not the best of luck for the next year.
"I know I need to keep improving things if I want to have chances against Novak next year," he added.
