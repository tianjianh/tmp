Three days of funeral ceremonies for the BBC presenter Komla Dumor have ended in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.

The ceremonies concluded with a Thanksgiving Mass in the Holy Spirit Roman Catholic cathedral, where the broadcaster and his family worshipped.
The Ghanaian journalist died suddenly last month in London at the age of 41.
Ghanaian President John Mahama has said the nation lost one of its finest ambassadors with his death.
"He was very passionate about Africa, he was very passionate about Ghana. I think Komla is one of the gifts we gave to the world," Mr Mahama told the BBC.
Prayers were said for him, and in the address a story was told of how he was once told live on air that he was a fool - to which he said: "Thank you." His reply, the priest leading the Mass suggested, demonstrated a broader lesson - that retaliation, anger, violence were no answer.
Tributes to Komla Dumor
After his body had lain in state at the cathedral, his funeral was held in the grounds of State House in Accra on Saturday. Later he was buried in the compound where his mother was also buried five years ago.
Mr Dumor, who featured in New African magazine's November 2013 list of 100 most influential Africans, joined the BBC as a radio broadcaster in 2006 after a decade of journalism in Ghana.
He was presenter for the BBC World News Channel and its Focus on Africa programme.
Mr Dumor started out as traffic news reporter at the local Joy FM station whilst a university student, and within two years was hosting the station's breakfast show, becoming a household name.
He developed his reputation as a charismatic presence on radio and television on a global stage when he went on to join the BBC.
He first presented the BBC World Service African breakfast programme, Network Africa, before launching Africa Business Report on BBC World TV.
His death on 18 January after a heart attack at his London home prompted tributes from across the world.
He left a wife and three children.
Former UN chief Kofi Annan, who is Ghanaian, said Africa had lost one of its brightest young talents.
"Komla was an inspirational journalist, always determined to find the facts and report on the truth. I shall miss his smile and wonderful sense of humour," he said.
