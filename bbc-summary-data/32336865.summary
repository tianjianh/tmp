Work is to be carried out on Edinburgh Airport's main runway over the next three weekends between 23:00 and 05:30.
Areas affected include Bonnyrigg, Loanhead, Fairmilehead, Colinton, Sighthill, South Gyle, Oxgangs, Kirkliston and Bo'ness.
The work will resurface runway areas particularly the touchdown zones.
The airport said 16 flights would operate during the renovations, and the main runway would reopen before 06:00 each morning.
Gordon Dewar, chief executive of Edinburgh Airport, said: "As the airport continues to grow our runway is subjected to heavier loads and more frequent aircraft movements.
"These heavy forces can cause the runway surface to degrade over time.
"The work we're carrying out over the next few weeks will involve resurfacing a number of areas on the runway, particularly at the aircraft touchdown zones.
"As we'll be operating a different take-off and landing route, some areas around Edinburgh may notice a slight increase in the number aircraft operations between the hours of runway maintenance.
"Although this runway maintenance work may cause some minimal inconvenience in the short term, it is essential that we continue to invest in and improve our facilities."
