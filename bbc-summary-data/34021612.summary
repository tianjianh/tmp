Carlton Williams, 50, who now lives in Australia, beat his 2014 record by more than 340 reps.
He said he did it to "prove for once and for all that the Welsh people are physically, socially and spiritually superior".
Guinness World Records has now confirmed the new top score.
The construction worker said: "I didn't really feel that much pain, I got a shoulder injury - that was my biggest problem. After a while you just get used to it."
He completed the challenge at a gym in Margaret River, Western Australia, on 25 July, with the record ratified on 10 August.
A YouTube video captured the feat of Mr Williams, who is originally from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan.
The most push-ups completed in 24 hours is 46,001 - a record set by Charles Servizio, from the United States, in 1993.
