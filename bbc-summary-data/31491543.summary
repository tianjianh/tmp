[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paedophile Clive Hall 'too dangerous' to set free

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "sex obsessed" paedophile is too dangerous to be released, a High Court judge has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The parole board said Clive Hall, 44, who has served nine years in jail, was still a risk to underage girls.
Hall, from Roydon, Essex, was given an indeterminate sentence in 2006 for having unlawful consensual sexual activity with two girls.
Mrs Justice Simler said the parole board's focus was rightly on the risk posed by Hall's release.
The judge said a "considerable number of risk factors" had been identified, including Hall's "obsession with sex, feeling inadequate, lack of intimate relationships, believing men have a right to sex, and sexual interest in teenage girls".
Hall's case centred around a challenge to the legality of his ongoing detention under an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP).
Philip Rule, for Hall, argued it was unfair prisoners serving indefinite sentences might be held alongside inmates convicted more recently of the same offences.
IPP sentences were abolished in December 2012 under the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act.
Mrs Justice Simler ruled that IPP sentences remained lawful.
The court heard Hall, who groomed 14 and 15-year-old girls he met via the internet, was given an extended supervision order after serving a three-month sentence for possessing child pornography images.
At his trial he was ordered to remain in jail for at least three-and-a-half years, reduced on appeal to two-and-a-half, before he could be considered for parole.
The minimum term expired in December 2008, but Hall was still detained.
