The star is filming the newest instalment of the blockbuster series in County Kerry.
He took a break from the set to visit Scoil Fheirtearaigh National School in Ballyferriter on Monday.
The visit was arranged after some pupils sent impressive artwork to director Rian Johnson.
Principal Mairín Ní Chartúir said the school heard about the possible visit last Friday.
"We received a call from the production team asking could they pay a surprise visit to the kids on Monday.
"Of course, we said yes and were told to not let anyone know about the visit and the parents were told on Monday that the kids would be staying an hour later for the surprise.
"Chewbacca walked in with the production team and took photos with the children and watched them perform the Star Wars theme tune that the kids had learned, as we are quite a musical school."
The cast did not leave empty handed as some of the children had made replica figures for them and even taught them some Irish.
"Its not in the teaching manual when Star Wars visit so it was a great day for a small school," added Ms Ní Chartúir.
