Newport council officers were called to Gibbs Road in the Beechwood area of the city after a large sewer collapsed at 04:30 BST on Wednesday.
The road is closed and Welsh Water is investigating.
It said: "We're doing all we can so that the local highways authority can reopen the road as soon as possible."
The sewer is part of its network that takes waste water away from homes and local businesses.
"We are ensuring that this work is not impacting on the waste water service we provide but we apologise for the inconvenience and disruption caused by this essential repair work," a Welsh Water spokesman said.
