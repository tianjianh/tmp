[SN]TITLE[SN]
BBC presenter Julie Wadsworth 'performed sex act on boy', court hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who claims he was indecently assaulted as a child by two ex-BBC radio presenters says boys were invited to come into the trees "one at a time".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The alleged 14-year-old victim, now in his 30s, told Warwick Crown Court he was "convinced 100%" that a couple he saw having sex against a tree in 1992 were Julie and Tony Wadsworth.
He claimed Mrs Wadsworth, now 60, performed a sex act on him.
The couple deny indecently assaulting under-age boys between 1992 and 1996.
The witness claimed he was among a group of boys in the Atherstone area who saw Mrs Wadsworth wearing a "flasher's mac".
He said: "A lad came down to us and he said 'There is a man and a woman coming down here - I swear she has got no knickers on'."
The man said the couple moved into a wooded area and beckoned the boys towards them before engaging in sexual activity.
The witness said he and another youth took the Wadsworths to another wooded area, where they saw the pair having sex.
He stated: "They said 'If you come back next week we might let you have a play'."
The man added: "They went into the trees where we had been the week before and she said to come in one at a time.
"He (Mr Wadsworth) was leant against this tree with a camera around his neck."
The Wadsworths, of Broughton Astley, Leicestershire, who have worked for BBC Radio Leicester and BBC WM, deny five counts of outraging public decency.
Mr Wadsworth, now 69, who is not accused of touching the boys, "acted as lookout", the court has heard.
He denies 10 charges of indecent assault while Mrs Wadsworth denies 12 counts of the same offence.
A second witness, who gave evidence via video-link, said he had seen a couple engaging in sexual activity in a wooded area in 1992 when he was a teenager.
Questioned about a Facebook message he received in April last year informing him of charges brought against the Wadsworths, the man told the court: "It was mainly the female that I recognised rather than the male."
The trial continues.
