[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Durham teaching assistants call off three-day strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teaching assistants in County Durham have called off their latest round of industrial action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Unison and ATL unions were due to strike for three days from Tuesday as part of a protest over proposals to impose new contracts.
The new deals would pay them only during term time - resulting in cuts of up to 23%.
Talks are being held between the unions and Durham County Council in a bid to resolve the situation.
Last week the council said it would be suspending its plans to dismiss and re-employ the assistants on new contracts from January while it reviews the matter.
That review is due to be completed in September.
The authority fears it could face equal pay claims from other employees if it does not make the cuts.
