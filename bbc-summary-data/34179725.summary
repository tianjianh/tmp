[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives investigating a suspected telephone fraud - a recording of which was broadcast by BBC News on Saturday - have made an arrest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victim, 65-year-old Nargess Sadjady, from West London, told the BBC that she was tricked into transferring Â£12,000 from her bank account.
The recording - of three separate calls - was broadcast on Moneybox on Radio 4.
The BBC understands one suspect has been arrested and interviewed, although no charges have yet been made.
Further enquiries are now being conducted, but it is thought the enquiry may take some time.
Mrs Sadjady later received her money back, after both Santander and the Halifax admitted errors in the way they handled the matter.
Initially Mrs Sadjady was told that there was not enough evidence for the police to conduct an enquiry.
However, after the BBC handed the recordings over, detectives agreed to re-examine the case.
