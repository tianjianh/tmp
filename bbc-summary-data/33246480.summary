Shkendija qualified for the Europa League after finishing third in last season's Macedonian First League.
The club had a difficult beginning and in 1982 were disbanded by the then Yugoslavian government as they felt the strong Albanian influence within the club was a threat to a nationalist revival.

The first leg between Alashkert and St Johnstone will be played at the Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium, which is the home of the Armenia national team with a capacity of 14,403.
This will be the first venture into European football for Alashkert and the vast majority of their squad are home-grown players with a couple of exceptions being defender Sekou Mamadou Fofana from Mali and Darko Vui, a midfielder from Montenegro.

The club gained worldwide fame when their elaborate goal celebrations, including highly choreographed depictions of landing a fish, diving, a human toilet and a human bicycle were publicised online and on television.
