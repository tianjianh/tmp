Edinburgh-born Richard Noble is director of the Bloodhound SuperSonic Car (SSC) project.
One of his biggest inspirations was racing driver and speed record setter John Cobb.
Mr Noble saw Cobb's boat Crusader on Loch Ness ahead of an attempt on the world water speed record.
Cobb died while trying to set the record.
Mr Noble told BBC News Scotland online: "I saw John Cobb's jet boat Crusader on Temple Pier in Drumnadrochit in September 1952. I was six years old.
"The boat was truly beautiful and futuristic in design it would not look out of pace today.
"I studied John Cobb and realised he was a truly amazing man who was dedicated to innovation and achievement."
London-based Cobb had already set the land speed record when he attempted to gain the fastest speed on water on Loch Ness on 29 September 1952.
After travelling at 206mph (331.5km/h) his boat broke up and he was killed.
Mr Noble said: "His car the Railton Mobil Special was designed in 1936 and was the first car to exceed 400mph.
"The wheel driven record today is only 458mph so it shows how advanced his team was."
Mr Noble who, along with the Bloodhound SSC team, is preparing to make a record bid in South Africa in 2016, has close connections to the Highlands.
He said: "My Dad was in the Army based in Inverness and we lived in Inverness and later Nairn.
"I once flew the Great Glen in my aircraft and one day I hope to travel the Caledonian Canal in my boat, but we have to get Bloodhound completed first."
