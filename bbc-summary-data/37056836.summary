Santander Cycles, as they are officially known, will be free to use for journeys up to 30 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
Keen cyclists will be able to use a special code to hire the bikes.
TfL said more than 52 million journeys had been made on the cycles since their launch in July 2010.
The scheme has grown from 6,000 bikes to 11,500 bikes in the last six years and there are now more than 785 docking stations with 21,083 docking points across London, TfL added.
The sixth anniversary comes as TfL said the bikes saw both a record-breaking month for hires in July, with 1,188,428 used.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: "Our cycle hire scheme here in London has been a huge success, with record numbers now using the bikes.
"The scheme has played an important role in encouraging people of all ages and backgrounds to cycle and it has allowed Londoners and tourists to get around the Capital and see new parts of our great city."
