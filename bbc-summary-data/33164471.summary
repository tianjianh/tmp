There were 200 fatalities in 2014, an increase of 16% on the previous year. The number of people seriously injured also increased by 1% to 1,694.
The figures showed there were 1,040 child casualties, a fall of 2%.
Overall the total number of road casualties - 11,240 - was the lowest since records began in 1950.
The road casualty figures have been declining for almost four decades but for the first time for eight years the number of fatalities went up.
The official government figures showed that the 200 road deaths included 93 car users, 56 pedestrians, 31 motorcyclists and eight pedal cyclists
They showed seven children among the 200 deaths, two fewer than 2013.
There were 171 children seriously injured, up from 143 in 2013.
According to the statistics, there were five fewer pedal cyclists killed but 18 more pedestrian fatalities.
There were also eight more motorcyclists killed and four more car user fatalities.
The statistics showed:
Transport Minister Derek Mackay said: "The increase in fatalities and the number of people seriously injured in road accidents in 2014 is disappointing.
"However it also demonstrates the need for every one of us to take responsibility when using the road network. The longer term downward trends and the annual decline in the total number of casualties, to the lowest level since records began, are encouraging but more can, and must, be done."
The minister added: "Some of the more recent interventions such as the landmark change in Scotland's drink-drive legislation - which has seen us leading the way in the United Kingdom - will undoubtedly help prevent the tragic and unnecessary loss of lives on our roads.
"Other innovations such as the A9 average speed camera programme are already delivering benefits, and significant investment is improving safety for cyclists.
"We are also encouraging councils to cut speed in towns and cities through our revised 20mph limit guidance. I am confident that these developments will have a positive impact going forward."
