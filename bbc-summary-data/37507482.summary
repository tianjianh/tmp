[SN]TITLE[SN]
Boat's Irish name Banríon Uladh becomes Queen of Ulster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fisheries protection vessel had its Irish name replaced with its English translation because the executive department which owns it has a "single language policy".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Banríon Uladh has been renamed Queen of Ulster.
Agriculture Minister Michelle McIlveen said the boat had been renamed as her department had a "fresh identity".
A number of small inland fisheries protection vessels still carry Irish names.
The vessel was named Banríon Uladh by the then Sinn Féin agriculture minister Michelle Gildernew when it was bought in 2010.
Ms Gildernew's party colleague Catherine Seeley asked an assembly question of the DUP's Ms McIlveen seeking the cost and rationale for the change.
The minister told the assembly the change had been carried out "at a scheduled annual maintenance event involving repairs, repainting and anti-fouling" during a refit several weeks ago.
She said as her department was a new one there had "consequently been some necessary adaptations to assets transferring to the new department".
"DAERA (Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs) is a new department with a fresh identity and logo and adopts a single language policy," she said.
Irish language group Pobal said it "deplored" the name change.
"This is a sad and petty action, which brings no benefit or value to a society struggling to move away from inequality and discrimination," said Janet Muller, Pobal's director.
She said the Irish language "must be protected in strong, comprehensive legislation".
In 2010, the ship also attracted controversy when it was first named.
Then DUP MLA Stephen Moutray claimed the Irish name would make it difficult for the boat to be identified in emergency radio transmissions.
He also suggested it might not meet the requirement for a neutral working environment for crew.
Ms Gildernew said the name was cosmetic and the ship's call sign was the unique emergency identifier.
She quoted Equality Commission guidelines which said use of language other than English in workplaces did not "in general constitute an infringement of a good and harmonious working environment".
