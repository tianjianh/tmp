The 21-year old made his Swans debut in their stunning 2-1 win at Arsenal last season and featured regularly towards the end of the campaign.
Having impressed under Francesco Guidolin, Kingsley made his debut for Scotland in June in their friendly with France.
"It's great to get the new contract done," the signing from Falkirk said.
"I now have the next four years to look forward to and it is time for me to push on.
"I'll definitely not be getting carried away. It's been a long journey to get to this position and I know I still have a long way to go.
"I am not taking anything for granted - the hard work starts now for me."
After loan spells at Yeovil Town and Crewe, Kingsley made his Swansea debut as a substitute in the FA Cup defeat at Oxford back in January.
"The last six months have been a whirlwind," added Kingsley, who joins fellow Scot Adam King in signing a new deal at the Liberty Stadium.
"Everything has happened so quickly. But this is just the start for me. I am just looking forward to getting into the new season and trying to push on."
