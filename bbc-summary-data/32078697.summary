Emergency services are on the scene and say at least one person is critically injured.
Live footage showed flames and smoke pouring out of a five-floor building, and the fire brigade spraying the building.
The area in Manhattan's East Village - close to New York University - is being evacuated.
Emergency services started received calls reporting the fire around 15:15 local time (19:15 GMT).
Several callers reported hearing an explosion, and more than 100 fire fighters have been sent to the scene, the New York Times reported.
As many as six people have been injured, including one who is said to be in critical condition, local news station WABC reported.
Fire brigades began spraying the flames, but had to retreat after the flames became too intense, the local station reported.
The station said that there are fears that the other building could collapse as well, and it's not clear if anyone has been trapped in the building or rubble.
A year ago a gas explosion razed two buildings leaving eight people dead in nearby East Harlem.
