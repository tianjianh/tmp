Border alerts have been issued for Billy and Geoffrey Midmore, 22 and 26, from London, to prevent them fleeing the country.
They are wanted in connection with the attack on Carla Whitlock, 37, who says she fears she might "lose the sight in her right eye".
Ms Whitlock was attacked in Southampton at about 21:00 BST last Friday.
The mother-of-six was left with severe injuries to her face, eyes, neck and arms in the attack outside the Turtle Bay restaurant in Guildhall Square.
Acting Det Insp Will Whale, of Hampshire Constabulary, said the brothers had contacts in Southampton, Basingstoke, London and were considered "dangerous individuals".
"We have circulated these men nationally as wanted persons and the borders are closed to them," he said.
"We have every reason to believe they are still in the country and are still focusing on the south east of England.
"Our round the clock investigation will continue throughout the weekend and we would ask them to give themselves up."
Officers have raided properties in the Medway area of Kent, in connection with the inquiry.
Billy Midmore is white, stocky, 5ft 8in (1.7m), with blue eyes and a scar on his left arm.  He speaks with a London accent.
Geoffrey Midmore is white, stocky, 5ft 1ins (1.5m), with green eyes, a scar on the right side of his face, and a tattoo on his hand.
Speaking to the media on Thursday, Ms Whitlock described her injuries.
"It just feels like someone is stabbing me in the eyeball all the time," she said.
"I can pretty much see everything out of my left eye but I cannot see anything out of my right eye.
"It has changed my life completely.  I'm coping with it as best as I can."
