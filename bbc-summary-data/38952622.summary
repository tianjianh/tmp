An undercover reporter spent two months inside HMP Northumberland for the BBC's Panorama programme.
He discovered widespread drug use, a lack of control, door alarms that did not go off on one house block and a hole in an internal security fence.
The Ministry of Justice has said it will investigate the "extremely serious allegations".
Watch Panorama Behind Bars: Prison Undercover on Monday 13 February at 20:30 GMT on BBC One. Or catch up on iPlayer.
