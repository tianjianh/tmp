The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned people not to give in to fear after the attacks in Brussels, in his Easter Sunday sermon.

The Most Rev Justin Welby told worshippers at Canterbury Cathedral that the attacks risked "causing us to act fearfully, to see a world in which fear triumphs".
But he also said: "On Easter Day hope decisively overcame fear".
Tuesday's bombings in Brussels killed 28 people and injured dozens.
The archbishop said hope can seem far away and fear so close "in the shadow of this week's darkness".
"Fear is reasonable, a normal human reaction," he added.

"Easter proclaims to us in flesh and blood that fear and death and terror are not the last words.
"God has spoken life, hope and purpose.
"Terror speaks of a world at war with itself, of faiths at each others' throats.
"Jesus Christ reaches out not in exclusion but in embrace; this is the feast of the victory of God, and we celebrate in the midst of darkness, by our worship and praise shining an unquenchable light."
