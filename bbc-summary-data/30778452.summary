Stephen Jones has been ex-Wales captain Dai Young's assistant in the Aviva Premiership at Wasps.
But he will succeed former team-mate Mark Jones as Scarlets rejig their staff ahead of the 2015-16 season.
Stephen Jones joined Wasps as a player in 2012 and then moved into coaching.
Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac said: "Stephen brings with him a wealth of experience, maturity and commands respect and I'm looking forward to working with him."
Stephen Jones, 37, won 104 Wales and six British and Irish Lions Test caps, leaving the international scene at the end of the 2011 Rugby World Cup.
He also made more than 300 combined appearances for Llanelli RFC and Scarlets and joined French side Clermont Auvergne for two seasons in 2004 before he returned to  Scarlets in 2006.
He said: "After three very enjoyable years in London, the end of the season feels [like] the right time to return home, and going back to the Scarlets, where I enjoyed 14 years as a player, will be a fantastic opportunity for me and my family."
Young said: "Stephen has been fantastic for us as a fly-half, and since making the move from player to coach two seasons ago."
Mark Jones, 35, was forced to retire by injury in 2010 and joined Scarlets' coaching staff, having made more than 160 combined appearances for Llanelli RFC and Scarlets after joining them in 1997.
"The Scarlets has been the biggest part of my life but I feel that the time is right to further challenge myself, both personally and professionally," said Mark Jones, who has been capped 47 times.
"I'm excited by the future and looking forward to the next chapter."
Jones made his Wales debut against England in 2001, four years after leaving home club Builth Wells for Stradey Park and went on to captain them in his final playing season, 2009-10.
He added: "I'd like to thank the players that I've worked alongside over the years, as both a player and a coach and particularly owe my thanks to [former coaches]Gareth [Jenkins] and Nigel [Davies] who allowed me to play for, captain and coach the club."
