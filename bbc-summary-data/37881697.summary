[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 1-0 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dave Martin strike and a penalty save from Alan Julian helped Bromley see off Boreham Wood at Hayes Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A cagey National League encounter took until the stroke of half-time to liven up when Dan Johnson swung in a fine cross towards Martin, who unleashed a superb volley into the top corner to put the home side in front.
In-form Boreham Wood applied serious pressure after the break, and Bromley defender Rob Swaine had to block a close-range shot on the line from Morgan Ferrier.
Julian also saved his side just after the hour mark, tipping a Conor Clifford penalty on to the underside of the bar and away, dramatically rectifying an infringement made by Jack Holland.
