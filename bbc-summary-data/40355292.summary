The case has been adjourned until January, when Foster will stand trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
Det Insp Caroline Corfield, of West Midlands Police, said: "In the very early stages of this investigation Ashley Foster was charged with the offence of preventing a lawful burial.
"The investigation team has maintained close communication with the Crown Prosecution Service as the case has progressed and, following a recent review of the evidence, Foster has today been charged with the murder of Megan Bills."
