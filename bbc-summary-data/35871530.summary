[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twelve-year-old Arisara Miles, known as Zara, flew with her father from Exeter to Thailand in November.
Devon and Cornwall Police said she was "found safe and well" in Thailand two weeks ago and "discussions are ongoing with authorities about her welfare".
A High Court judge ordered the release of the girl's details earlier in March.
A spokesman for the force said he could not confirm any further information about the case.
