Halifax had two early goals disallowed for offside, with David Lynch's first-minute strike followed by Tom Denton's effort eight minutes later.
Steven Drench kept things level by tipping Corey Whitely's shot over the crossbar after 30 minutes.
There was no doubting the validity of Denton's goal 10 minutes before the break as he fired Liam King's half-cleared cross into the top corner from the edge of the box.
The officials' busy night continued in the 57th minute when referee Thomas Bramall accepted linesman Richard Watson's judgement that Oliver Hawkins' push on Alex Simmons was inside the box and worthy of a red card - but Mark Cousins went the right way to save Jordan Sinnott's resulting penalty.
The Daggers levelled the score in the 73rd minute despite their numerical disadvantage, with Whitely finding the bottom corner from Jordan Maguire-Drew's through-ball.
The Shaymen's best chance to prevent extra time seemed to come and go when Denton's header bounced inches wide of the post.
But Kosylo had other ideas, picking his spot from 25 yards in the final minute of normal time.
