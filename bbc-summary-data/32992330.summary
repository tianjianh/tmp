The Queen has attended hospital for her "routine" annual check-up, Buckingham Palace has said following social media speculation about her health.

The palace took the unusual step of confirming the "pre-scheduled" visit to London's King Edward VII's Hospital.
The BBC issued an apology after tweets were "mistakenly sent" from the Twitter account of a BBC journalist during a "technical rehearsal" for an obituary.
"The tweets were swiftly deleted and we apologise for any offence," it said.
"Tweets were mistakenly sent from the account of a BBC journalist saying that a member of the royal family had been taken ill," it added.
Screen grabs on social media showed that the same producer had later tweeted that the Queen had died.
The BBC said an investigation will take place as part of its disciplinary process.
