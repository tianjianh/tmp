S Club 7 Paul: 'Massive similarity' with David Brent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Many pop fans rejoiced at S Club 7's reunion during BBC's Children In Need.

The seven-piece, back together after 12 years, performed a medley of their biggest hits including S Club Party.
It was during that modern masterpiece there was one momentous moment, carried off by Paul Cattermole.
During his four seconds of 'Paul's getting down on the floor', he managed to throw some shapes that David Brent would have been proud of.
Inevitably, his dancing was soon being compared to the genius of Ricky Gervais' character.
During Newsbeat's chat with the band, we brought up the comparison and Paul gave a wide, cheeky smile.
"Fair play," he said. "I saw another Vine which had me and him side-by-side. There is a massive similarity between the two things. There is!"
To date, a Vine of the clip has had more than 300-thousand loops.
Tina chipped in: "Can I say that is my favourite bit from Friday. Paul's little 'Paul's getting down on the floor' dance."
Bradley too: "My mate called me up saying that Paul's bit was wicked too."
When we asked Paul whether he could actually carry out the action from S Club Party, he told us that in his "old, geriatric age" he "can't really get down anymore."
Following their TV reunion, the band announced a 2015 arena tour.
