A series of devastating floods in Peru have left 100 dead and tens of thousands homeless since the start of the year.
Entire roads and bridges have been swept away, towns have been engulfed and farmland has been turned to muddy swamp.
It has led to more than 800 towns and cities declaring states of emergency, and brought about a rise in the price of food. Police have been deployed to keep law and order in flood-ravaged areas.
Now, this series of satellite images - collected by the Amazon Monitoring Project (MAAP), involving the conservation groups ACA and ACCA Peru - show how the rising water changed the landscape in the north-west of the country between January and March.
