Wales' biggest solar farm planned for Llanbadrig, Anglesey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anglesey could become home to Wales' largest solar farm if plans are agreed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Countryside Renewables has submitted a planning application to develop 220 acres (89 hectares) of agricultural land at Llanbadrig.
Chartered surveyors ERW Consulting said the scheme could generate enough energy to power 15,500 houses a year, the equivalent of half of Anglesey's homes.
It said the carbon dioxide savings over 30 years would be equivalent to taking nearly 14,000 cars off the road.
The Welsh government has a target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 3% per year.
