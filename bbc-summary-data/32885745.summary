New watch identifies wearer from veins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watch technology that can identify a person by the veins inside their skin is being developed.

Biowatch contains a tiny camera that takes a photo of your wrist and stores a snapshot of your blood vessels.
The watch then checks that your veins match the photo every time you put it on.
That could stop imposters from accessing private information on a smartwatch if they put it on.
The Swiss company developing the device said it worked correctly 999 times out of 1,000 and are continuing to work on it.
Biowatch technology isn't available to buy yet but the company is working with smartwatch manufacturers to include the tech in future watches.
