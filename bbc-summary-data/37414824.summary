[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was a fairly evenly contested first half with Ollie Clarke shooting narrowly wide for the visitors from 20 yards after collecting a loose ball.
For the hosts, John Fleck put a shot just wide and Rovers keeper Kelle Roos saved Billy Sharp's effort with his legs. Sharp also fired wide and Stefan Scougall had an effort blocked.
Rovers threatened in the latter stages of the half with Chris Lines having a free-kick well saved by Simon Moore and Easter heading over.
Easter wasted a great chance after the re-start, firing wide after being put through by Ellis Harrison.
Ollie Clarke put a long-range effort straight at Moore and Harrison had a low shot saved.
The goal came when Daniel Lafferty's cross from the left was met by a Chapman header after 65 minutes.
The visitors were reduced to 10 men a minute later when Easter was sent-off after clashing with Jack O'Connell.
