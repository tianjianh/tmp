Matt Derbyshire put the Millers ahead when he collected Richard Wood's pass and lobbed keeper Richard O'Donnell.
Lee Camp saved brilliantly from Robins defender Aiden Flint's header to keep the scores level before the break.
Odemwingie levelled with a powerful left-footed shot, before Camp made another good save from Odemwingie's late header to secure his side a point.
The result leaves Bristol City 20th in the table, seven points clear of the relegation zone, with Rotherham one point further back in 21st after extending their unbeaten run to seven games.
The Millers had won three straight league matches against the Robins, and looked on course for a fourth when Derbyshire's fine finish put them ahead,
Lee Johnson's side controlled possession throughout, with Flint unlucky not to equalise before the break on his 100th consecutive league start.
But the hosts were rewarded for their pressure when Scott Golbourne's cross fell for Odemwingie to fire in his second goal in four games, having failed to score in the league since May 2014 before moving to Ashton Gate.
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson:
"The crowd were brilliant, I asked them for it and they delivered so I thank them for that,
"It was always going to be difficult, it was a bit edgy, the referee probably didn't help he had a poor 15 minutes.
"Our players were getting frustrated, I was getting frustrated and the fans were getting frustrated.
"But we kept our composure, kept our structure and we were the side that looked like going on and win it in my opinion."
