[SN]TITLE[SN]
Police Scotland call centre closures delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police Scotland is to further delay its plans to close control rooms in Aberdeen and Inverness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They had been expected to close early this year, with calls being transferred to a new control room in Dundee.
An inquiry into the deaths of two people in a car accident on the M9 in July last year delayed that move until later this year.
The force has now said that Aberdeen will close in March next year, with Inverness following three months later.
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland will oversee the process, Police Scotland said.
