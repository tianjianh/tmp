[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33 year old had been detained by Hertfordshire police officers on Sorbus Road, Turnford, just before 22:00 GMT on Wednesday.
The force said he then escaped and drove off in a police car.
He was eventually arrested on the A10 at Great Amwell, having driven the wrong way up the dual carriageway.
The man is currently being questioned on suspicion of harassment with fear of violence, aggravated taking of a motor vehicle without consent, escaping lawful custody, dangerous driving, failing to stop for police, driving without insurance and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence.
A number of police cars, including the one stolen, were damaged, and a helicopter was used to track him through Broxbourne, East Herts and Essex.
Supt Geoff Camp said: "The stolen marked car, which had blue lights flashing, was driven erratically and at one point was driven southbound on the northbound carriageway of the A10.
"One driver had to take action to avoid a collision and suffered a minor injury.
"A significant number of resources were deployed during the incident, with public safety being paramount for officers.
"Units on the ground were joined by the helicopter in an attempt to bring the vehicle to a safe stop.
"A full investigation to establish the circumstances of what happened is under way and as a matter of course the professional standards unit has been contacted."
