A beautician who was doused in acid has told a court she saw smoke coming from her body while standing at a bus stop.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adele Bellis was left with permanent "life-changing" scarring, lost an ear and is partially bald after the attack in Lowestoft last August.
She had already suffered a knife attack in the street four months earlier in which she was stabbed in the mouth.
Her former partner, Anthony Riley, 26 is accused of organising both the attacks on Miss Bellis, then 22.
In a video interview played at Ipswich Crown Court, she said she was talking on the phone when a man walked past with his face covered and carrying a bottle.
He then spilled the bottle all over her, she said.
"After two or three seconds my skin just burned and I knew it was acid," she said.
"I remember I was smoking, I was just crying and shouting 'I'm burning, I'm burning'."
As her clothes dissolved, people tried to help her.
In the knife attack earlier on 29 April, Miss Bellis said Mr Riley led her down an alleyway where she saw a masked man, allegedly co-defendant Leon Thompson, 39.
"The man jumped on Anthony and he didn't really do much," she said.
"I turned around to see what was happening and this guy stabbed me."
Andrew Jackson, prosecuting, said not content with the knife attack, Mr Riley had recruited another man to pour sulphuric acid over her.
It is alleged Riley forced Jason Harrison, who owed him money, to do it, and jurors were told Harrison has already admitted his part in the conspiracy.
Mr Riley, of Raglan Street, Lowestoft, denies false imprisonment, conspiracy to apply a corrosive liquid and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
Mr Thompson, of Alma Road, Lowestoft, denies wounding with intent, having a knife in public, conspiracy to apply a corrosive liquid and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
