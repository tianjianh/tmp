A support group has been set up and welcome hampers have been made to help two Syrian refugee families settle in Torfaen.

The welcome boxes contain food and toiletries, while the group will provide advice about the area.
Rev Richard Reardon, of All Saints Church in Cwmbran, said people wanted to offer "practical help" to those affected by the conflict in Syria.
About 50 refugees will arrive in Wales before Christmas.
About 30 volunteers came forward from Torfaen and neighbouring Monmouthshire to help after Rev Reardon sent out an email plea.
As well as sending clothes and other essential items to refugee camps in Syria, the group wanted to help those moving to the county settle into the community.
"We've put together these hampers to say 'welcome to Wales'," Rev Reardon said.
"I feel that I tapped into this seam of frustration and profound goodwill from people's hearts - that question 'I want to do something, but what do I do?'"
He said the group would also offer friendship, adding: "Whether that be through mother and toddler groups, whether it be with the need to find out where the bus route is, where the GP surgeries are, where's the best place to go shopping - I think that's how I see things unfolding."
Two families will be placed in privately rented accommodation within the next week and the group expects four more families to follow in early 2016.
The Home Office will meet the costs.
