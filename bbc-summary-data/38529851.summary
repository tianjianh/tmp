The incident at Neil McEvoy's office took place on Thursday morning. The AM said no valuables were taken but files had been "gone through".
He said metal bars had been cut to access the property at Cowbridge Road East.
South Wales Police said an investigation had been launched.
"For a long period, there has been a concerted campaign of political harassment against me," the South Wales Central AM claimed.
He said that less than 12 months ago his home had been "ransacked", with paperwork taken.
Mr McEvoy said that in the early hours of Thursday "the criminals involved went through two outside doors, down a lane, removed a screwed in hard wood cover on the back window, cut through a PVC window frame and cut through metal bars to get in the window".
"Once again, valuables were ignored in the office, but drawers were broken into and files gone through in the back office which wasn't alarmed.
"Thankfully, they couldn't gain access to the main part of the office without tripping the alarm."
"I put in place new safety procedures for staff at the end of last term, because I am aware of serious cages being rattled," he said.
"Some people would like to silence us, but this intimidation has just added to our motivation."
A South Wales Police spokesman said that the break-in was reported after 09:00 GMT on Thursday.
He said that investigations were ongoing and that no arrests had been made.
A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: "Neil McEvoy has now been the subject of two break-ins, one at home and one at his office.
"Plaid Cymru is supporting him and his staff at this time and is keen that the police establish whether these intrusions are linked.
"All elected representatives and their staff deserve to operate in a democratic way without fear of harassment or intimidation.
"The National Assembly is working with Neil and his staff to ensure their safety and security, and we strongly urge that this continues."â€Ž
