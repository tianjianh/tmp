Hundreds of jobs could be lost as a result of budget cuts at Leicestershire Police, according to the deputy chief constable.

The latest five-year plan calls for savings of up to 40% in a bid to reduce its budget by up to Â£28m.
The force has already had to reduce its spending by Â£36m since 2010.
Deputy Chief Constable Roger Bannister said the force hoped most of the savings could be achieved by voluntary redundancies and "natural wastage".
He said the exact amount of the budget cuts would not be known until the government's comprehensive spending review on 25 November.
Leicestershire Police has already shed 180 officers and 190 civilian staff since 2010, with most of the job losses achieved through natural wastage, including retirement.
"We will have to become smaller, more efficient and smarter in how we operate if the force is to be more cost-effective," he said.
Mr Bannister warned that "with 83% of our budget spent on salaries the force will inevitably need to operate with fewer officers and staff".
And he said the changes may include shutting down police buildings which are too big and expensive to run.
