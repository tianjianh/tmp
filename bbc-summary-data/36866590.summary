Captain William Colbeck and Alfred Cheetham, from Hull, were on the ship Morning that took part in the expeditions of 1902-1904.
The two men were welcomed by thousands at the city's Paragon station on their return home in 1904.
A plaque to the pair has been unveiled at the station.
The ceremony was attended by members of the two men's families and Labour councillor Mary Glew.
"We are proud of our city's rich maritime history and it is fitting that we are unveiling this mark of respect at the place where they were so triumphantly welcomed back to Hull by thousands of people," said Ms Glew.
Scott of the Antarctic, as he was nicknamed, was a naval officer and explorer who died in 1912 attempting to be the first to reach the South Pole. He was beaten to his goal by a Norwegian party led by Roald Amundsen.
Captain Colbeck got his master's ticket in 1894 and commanded the Morning, which was sent to relieve Scott's Discover Expedition. He died in 1930.
During his voyage Captain Scott named Cape Colbeck and Colbeck Bay after him.
Alfred Buchanan Cheetham was born in Liverpool but his family moved to Hull where he married.
He was also on on the Morning and in all spent about six years on Antarctic expeditions.
He died in 1918 when his ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat in the World War One.
The plaque is the 25th in a series to commemorate 100 people from Hull.
