Welsh election: Green Party confident of electing AMs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Green Party has a "strong chance" of getting its first ever AMs elected in May, MP Caroline Lucas has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party wanted to "shake up the Senedd", she said, at the start of a two-day campaign visit to Cardiff.
Ms Lucas said she was confident of seeing Green AMs elected via the regional lists due to proportional representation.
She said the party would speak for those who cared about social justice, the environment and jobs.
Wales was the one place in the whole of the UK where the Greens did not have any elected members or councillors, the Brighton Pavilion MP added.
"We really are on the cusp of getting elected this time around," she said.
"We're really confident that once we do get elected we can make a real difference to Wales."
