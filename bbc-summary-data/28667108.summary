Q&A: A-levels - expert advice 2014

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What do you do if your grades are different from what you were expecting? Continuing changes to the education system mean the situation can be confusing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With only a few days to secure a university place or take an alternative path, getting the right advice is key.
Experts Sonia Sodha of Which? University and Nick Davy, higher education manager at the Association of Colleges, are offering advice to readers with unexpected results.
Hi Louise,
Well done on your results. Don't worry - you have got your university place. Once a university accepts you, you have a contract in place with them. There are a record number of university places available this year and lots of students have still secured places even if they have even if they have missed their offer grades. If you are still feeling anxious though, phone the university admissions team directly to chat it through.

Hi Daniel
Well done. Maths is not easy! This is a pass!

Hi Kamrul,
If you have passed you can still enter Ucas Clearing and get a place. The Ucas website explains how to do it.
It's also worth contacting colleges and universities to find out if there are places in your chosen subject and location.
Remembering that accountancy is not a graduate only profession. There are routes to full professional status through working for an employer or on a part-time course at a college or through an apprenticeship.

Well done for your results Lucy. In fact you are in a strong position.
As you are having a gap year and the government's plan is to expand the number of places in higher education, there should be even more opportunities when you decide to start university with your grades. It might be sensible to re-take and achieve 3 A-level B grades as that would give you more choices - but do not re-take if you are not going to concentrate on the re-take; getting another D or E would not look that good on the application form.
Good Luck,
Nick
Hi Pearce,
Even if you might be feeling a little disappointed at your A-level grades at the moment, well done on getting the university place you wanted. If you are really not happy with an exam result and think it might be incorrect, it is important to talk first to your college and discuss this option with your tutors, as any queries to examining boards will need to go through them. You won't be able to do this directly.
You can read more about appealing grades on the Which? University website but think carefully about appealing an exam. You have to stick with your new grade however it comes back. It could be lower than your original mark and this could affect your university offer,
Results day can be a bit of an emotional rollercoaster and you might feel differently once you start looking ahead to your new university. Good luck.

Hi Sana,
All is not lost. It is possible to get into university with two A-levels, including via degree courses with a foundation year.
If both your firm and insurance choice offers have been declined in Track you can then enter Clearing to search for available courses for vacancies. Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of Salford and the University of Bolton are currently advertising courses in the areas you mention. Which? University offers advice on how to call universities.
You could consider retaking one or more of your A-levels and reapplying next year. Speak to tutors at your school or college to find out if you can retake there or will need to go elsewhere.
Take a deep breath and try not to worry
Calling the Exam Results Helpline on 0808 100 8000 should also help.

Rochelle,
Well done on a great set of results. As you have learned, medicine is very competitive, but you do still have options open to you with your results.
The first is to re-apply to study medicine next year. You could consider applying to a medicine course with a foundation year. For example, University of Manchester's course has a typical offer of AAB.
Gaining some valuable work experience in your gap year should put you in a stronger position when applying next year. It might also be worth doing some voluntary work in a health or care environment, for example, a hospital or care home.
If you want to apply this year you will find that medicine courses are very rarely, if ever, available through Clearing, but you could still apply for a 'medical science' degree, for example biomedical sciences, and transfer to a 'fast-track' medicine degree later. There are biomedical science vacancies currently available in Clearing. Check the Ucas website for details.

Hi Jack
I understand the frustration you have for your brother - but he still has three good A levels.
The marking and grading system has not fundamentally changed this year, nor have the boundaries. A*-A level grades are only down by 0.3%.
He has several options. He could retake now that he understands the exam system better.  He could ring around universities for degrees in the subject he is interested in. With those grades, unless he is looking at medicine, there should still be plenty of offers available. He could look at doing a gap year - if he does something interesting, many admissions tutors look favourably on this experience. Alternatively he could consider apprenticeships.
Good luck,
Nick
Hi Kev,
These are very good results. If she still wants to do nursing ask her to enter clearing as there still might be places available for nursing - but her experience at interviews does indicate the views of nursing admissions tutors, that they prefer candidates with experience, particularly in the caring professions.
If this option is not possible suggest to your daughter that she seeks a job volunteer work in the caring sector. A gap year abroad in the right environment could be useful for a career in nursing.
Nick
Ashlea,
Don't worry, contrary to what you might be feeling today, this is not the end of the world.
Many very, very successful people achieved poor grades at school.
Try to turn this setback to your advantage and have a really deep think about what you want to do over the next two, five or ten years. You still have several options:
Further education colleges often specialise in providing learning geared to those who might struggle at undergraduate level. Find out what higher education options your local colleges offer both full and part time. You could also look at apprenticeships.
Not everybody is suited to academic study, many prefer a more applied style of learning by doing and problem solving. You maybe one of those people? Have a think about that issue?
Nick
Hi Sophie,
It is true that the number of students universities in England can recruit is currently capped in order to control the cost of student loans and other support subsidised by the taxpayer.
Universities that over-recruit students with grades below ABB face financial penalties. But this will change next year, when the cap on numbers is abolished to allow universities to expand their numbers. These restrictions have been eased to some extent this year with the release of 30,000 extra places. So while there are more places available overall, it is down to individual universities to recruit the correct number of students.
You were right to speak to your first choice to see if it would still accept you. Commiserations that it doesn't sound like that's the case. However, there are still options that may allow you to go to university this autumn. You've not mentioned if you're holding an insurance offer from a university or not, so this may still be an alternative. If you are  not holding any other offers, you can enter Clearing to search for other suitable courses. While it's important to act quickly to secure a place, research courses carefully and try not to rush into a decision.
Sonia
