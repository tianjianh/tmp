Honda's Crutchlow, 30, is the first Briton since Barry Sheene in 1979 to win more than once race in a season.
"People think you can only ride in the rain when you win in it," Crutchlow said. "So it's nice to win in the dry."
He held off Italy's Valentino Rossi to win after Spanish world champion Marc Marquez crashed on lap 10.
Rossi, who started the race in 15th, finished second with Spain's Maverick Vinales taking third place.
