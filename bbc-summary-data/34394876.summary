Schools watchdog Estyn asks for views on inspection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The education watchdog Estyn is seeking opinions on how schools in Wales should be inspected.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The six-week consultation is looking for views from parents, teachers and children via an online questionnaire and focus groups.
A separate version for children is available.
Estyn wants people to look at all aspects of the process, including what is reported, judgements made and the views of parents and pupils.
Chief inspector Meilyr Rowlands said: "This is an opportunity to influence changes to inspections. I encourage everyone with an interest in education in Wales to take part in the consultation on how Estyn will inspect in the future."
Any changes would start in September 2017.
Schools, nurseries and training providers in Wales are currently inspected at least once during a six-year period and are usually given four weeks' notice.
