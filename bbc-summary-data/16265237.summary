Ofcom to investigate Jeremy Clarkson comments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ofcom has confirmed it will investigate Jeremy Clarkson's appearance on The One Show, in which he said that striking public sector workers should be shot.

The media watchdog will look at whether the programme was in breach of its codes on generally accepted standards.
The rule says broadcasters must ensure material that may cause offence is "justified by the context".
About 31,000 people complained to the BBC over Clarkson's comments last month. Ofcom received 736 complaints.
The Top Gear host said public sector workers should be "executed in front of their families".
He prefaced the remarks, however, by saying he supported the strike, because it meant London was free of traffic.
Adding that the BBC had to be balanced, he then made the execution comments, which led to the trade union Unison calling for him to be sacked.
Clarkson later apologised, saying: "I didn't for a moment intend these remarks to be taken seriously - as I believe is clear if they're seen in context.
"If the BBC and I have caused any offence, I'm quite happy to apologise for it alongside them."
Unison accepted his apology and invited him to spend a day with a healthcare assistant.
Ofcom said it would "make the outcome of the investigation known in due course".
The BBC declined to comment on Ofcom's investigation.
