Wood, 33, left the Cherry and Whites in June after 15 years, having joined the Premiership club's academy in 2001.
He said in a statement on Twitter: "I've been offered several fantastic opportunities, one of which allows me to stay involved in the game I love.
"While this was not how I saw my career ending, I am happy to have finished while still able to play at the top level, to have finished on a high."
Wood represented England at under-21 level and Saxons level and was called into the full England squad party to tour South Africa in 2008 but was then injured.
He was also named in England's squad for matches against the Barbarians and Argentina in 2009, but did not play.
