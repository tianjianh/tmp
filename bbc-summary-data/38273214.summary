[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greenock Morton 1-1 Hibernian

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Jason Cummings rescued a point for Scottish Championship leaders Hibernian away to Greenock Morton with a stunning curling free-kick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His 81st-minute strike came two minutes after after Gary Oliver had prodded the home side into the lead.
It means Hibs end the day still ahead of Dundee United on goal difference after the Taysiders drew with Raith Rovers.
Morton stay in front of the Kirkcaldy side on goal difference.
Oliver gave the Greenock side a second-half lead after the ball was twice rattled against the crossbar, forcing it home from a couple of yards out.
But within a minute Cummings, who had only just come on as a substitute, equalised with a superb curling free kick from 25 yards.
Kris Commons made his Hibernian debut with Cummings making way to accommodate the emergency loan Celtic player.
The goalless first half featured several meaty challenges, with few genuine chances, although Oliver came close for Morton, who were the better side in the opening 45 minutes.
But a disappointing crowd of 2,156 witnessed much more thrilling stuff after the break.
A draw was probably a fair result. Morton can point to a thrilling Jamie McDonagh solo run over 60 yards, while Hibs had two 90th minute opportunities for Cummings and his fellow sub Grant Holt but neither could find a winner.
Greenock Morton manager Jim Duffy: "Another injury to a forward player was the last thing we needed but I was very pleased with the way we played, particularly in the first half.
"We don't have the resources Hibs have and Jason Cummings as a substitute underlines that. Losing a goal so quickly after scoring is usually a worry, but it was a clever free kick. You have to give him credit.
"Neil Lennon got a reaction from his players in the second half.
"We are battling hard to be in the play off position. We are not a bad side and we are 100 per cent committed."
Hibernian manager Neil Lennon: "We didn't pass the ball well enough in the first half.
"Kris Commons got better as the match went on. He'll feel the benefit of this match but on the balance a draw was probably right.
"It's never a foregone conclusion coming here.
"I toyed with starting Jason Cummings and on reflection maybe I should have. He has a real chance of starting next week."
