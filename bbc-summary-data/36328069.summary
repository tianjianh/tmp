Legendary former hurdler Colin Jackson has earmarked Bundy-Davies as the likeliest Welsh track and field athlete to win a medal in Brazil.
Bundy-Davies, 21, hopes to run in the individual race and the 4x400m relay.
"It's nice to have people putting pressure and hope on you," she told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"It's nice when there's added pressure because most athletes perform well under pressure.
"I'm going out there to represent Wales and hopefully bring back a medal.
"It's exciting when people are talking about the Welsh prospects and the Olympic medal hopefuls."
Bundy-Davies won 4x400m relay bronze at last year's World Championships in Beijing and claimed individual bronze at the 2015 European Indoor Championships.
She missed March's World Indoor Championships as she focuses on qualifying for the Olympics.
