Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart has confirmed he will leave Torino after a season-long loan at the Italian club.

Hart, 29, joined the Serie A club in August after being told he was free to leave City by manager Pep Guardiola.
Torino head coach Sinisa Mihajlovic said last month he wanted to keep Hart but the club could not afford him.
"Thank you Torino, I am so proud to have played for your special football club," the England goalkeeper wrote on social media on Monday.
"I will come back to see you all one day so it is bye for now, enjoy an amazing summer."
He added: "The way you have treated me and my family is something that we will never forget.
"I will forever support Torino for the rest of my days. I have met so many special people and this has been one of the greatest experiences of my life."
Torino ended their season with a 5-3 victory over Sassuolo on Sunday to finish ninth in Serie A.
And president Urbano Cairo admitted earlier this month that he "didn't expect so many mistakes from Joe Hart".
Hart has said he is "surplus to requirements" at Manchester City and is expected to leave the club for good in the summer despite having two years left on his contract.
He has won 68 England caps and has been linked with various Premier League and European clubs.
But Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said last month he was not interested in signing Hart.
