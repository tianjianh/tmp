She had been wrapped in a duvet and the phones had been put out of her reach.
Assistant Devon coroner Luisa Nicholson concluded that Mrs McCartney was unlawfully killed by her husband who then killed himself.
She said "It is a double tragedy and heartbreaking and utterly incomprehensible, we will never know the full story that day."
Pathologist Dr Amanda Jeffery told the inquest that Mrs McCartney, 59, died from "the combined effect of the stab wounds to her chest and right arm and the carbon monoxide poisoning".
She concluded that Mr McCartney, 63, died from inhaling the fumes, and ruled out a suicide pact.
The inquest in Exeter heard evidence that Mrs McCartney, an accountant with Exeter University, was alive for 30 minutes after being stabbed.
Mr McCartney's son told the inquest his father had felt humiliated about the collapse of his marriage and hated the fact that people would know about the break-up.
Mr McCartney left his son a note reading, "I just cannot stand the humiliation anymore. Sorry, Dad."
