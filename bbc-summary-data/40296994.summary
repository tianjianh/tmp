A woman raped by an Uber driver in India is suing the company for allegedly invading her privacy, after reports that the firm obtained her medical records.

The lawsuit comes as the ride-hailing company is trying to restore its reputation amid a series of scandals.
Uber chief Travis Kalanick has said he will take leave from the firm after a review of management and practices.
Other top executives have also left and Uber has pledged other changes.
Uber: Travis Kalanick's rollercoaster reign
In December 2014, a 26-year-old Delhi woman, who has now moved to Texas and has filed the case anonymously, was raped by Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav.
Yadav was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. As well as the criminal case, the woman had sued Uber, settling out of court.
However, she filed a new suit in the US on Thursday after reports emerged that Uber had investigated the complaint, obtained her medical records and speculated that she made up the claims to hurt the firm's business.
She has alleged that Uber violated her privacy and defamed her character.
An Uber spokesperson said: "No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we're truly sorry that she's had to relive it over the last few weeks."
The lawsuit names Mr Kalanick, and former executives Emil Michael and Eric Alexander.
Mr Alexander left the company last week after US reporters asked questions about the incident.
