Four people are reportedly injured, and firefighters fear more people are buried under the rubble.
Eighteen people are registered as living at the building in the town of Swiebodzice, Radio Poland reports.
Two of the building's floors may have caved in due to a gas explosion, a spokesman for the fire department told AFP news agency.
