A third man from Portsmouth who went to fight in Syria for Islamic State (IS) has been killed, his mosque has said.

Mamunur Roshid, 24, travelled to the country with four friends in October 2013.
Iftekar Jaman - who left the UK separately in May last year - and Hamidur Rahman were previously killed in the fighting.
The Jami Mosque in Portsmouth said Mr Roshid's parents told them their son had been killed on Friday in Syria.
Abdul Jalil, chairman of the mosque, said "The parents are very upset. I went to visit them and they told me that he had been killed in Syria. This is very difficult for them."
The Foreign Office said it was aware of reports that a British national had been killed in Syria.
Mr Roshid's death comes as Britain's most senior police officer revealed at least five Britons are travelling to Iraq and Syria to join IS every week, with an estimated 500 already fighting with the group.
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said: "Those numbers are a minimum. There may be many more who set out to travel to another country and meandered over to Syria and Iraq in a way that is not always possible to spot when you have failed states and leaky borders."
He warned the return of these individuals to the streets of the UK was "a risk to our communities".
Sir Bernard added: "The drumbeat of terrorism in the UK has changed. It's faster and it's more intense."
Mr Roshid left the UK with Mr Rahman, Assad Uzzaman, Mehdi Hassan and Mashudur Choudhury.
Choudhury returned to UK after a few weeks and was arrested at Gatwick Airport.
In May, he became the first person in the UK to be convicted of terrorist offences in connection with the conflict in Syria.
The two other men, Mr Uzzaman and Mr Hassan, are still believed to be in Syria.
Ifthekar Jaman, from Southsea, Hampshire, told the BBC before his death he joined IS as he felt it was his "duty" because Muslims were "being slaughtered".
Mr Jaman's family told the BBC that he was killed while fighting forces loyal to the government.
