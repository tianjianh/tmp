[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crews had to withdraw from a huge mountain grass fire in Rhondda Cynon Taff because high winds made it too dangerous.

South Wales Fire and Rescue Service (SWFRS) was called to Cwmparc, near Treorchy, at 21:55 GMT on Saturday.
They worked through the night to tackle the 166 hectare (410 acres) blaze - the size of at least 200 football pitches.
Firefighters left the scene and the fire burnt itself out but the situation will continue to be monitored.
A separate incident on Penrhys mountain covering 20 hectares (50 acres) is now also over.
SWFRS said it had been called to 36 grass fires over a 24-hour period this weekend, and believed most were started deliberately.
Meanwhile Mid and West Wales Fire Service dealt with 27 separate grass fires in 24 hours, and the north Wales service did not provide figures but said it had tackled "a few".
