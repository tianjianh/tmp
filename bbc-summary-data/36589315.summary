[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two brothers have been jailed for an acid attack which left a woman scarred and blind in one eye.

Carla Whitlock was sprayed with drain cleaner containing sulphuric acid in Southampton on 18 September.
Billy Midmore, 23, who was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, was jailed for 15 years with a further five years on licence.
Geoffrey Midmore, 27, had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge and was jailed for nine years.
Southampton Crown Court heard the acid was thrown in the 37-year-old's face after a drug deal went wrong.
Sentencing the pair, Judge Peter Ralls QC said: "Your behaviour displays a level of medieval barbarism that is appalling.
"You used a weapon that was pernicious and evil. You planned for this, which adds to the culpability."
Billy Midmore, who denied any involvement in the attack, admitted sending Ms Whitlock threatening texts after his brother was robbed of drugs and cash worth Â£2,000.
Brothers jailed for Southampton acid attack - as it happened
Prosecutors said he held the mother-of-six responsible after she helped broker the deal between the brothers and a Southampton drug dealer.
Train CCTV showed him giving a high-five and fist-bumping a friend hours after the attack.
The brothers, from London, were arrested in Gillingham, Kent, on 29 September, following a two-week nationwide manhunt.
During his trial, Billy Midmore admitted coming to Southampton from London to sell crack cocaine and heroin.
The court also heard Geoffrey Midmore had sent a photograph of the drain cleaner on WhatsApp to an acquaintance, with the words: "This is one face melter."
The court heard Ms Whitlock needed surgery after the attack and remained in "significant pain".
A consultant said her right eye was prone to "breakdown and infection" and her eyesight was unlikely to return.
The judge told the brothers: "You bought the drain cleaner because you intended to pour it in her face.
"To describe it as the 'face melter' could only have one interpretation."
After sentencing, Ch Insp Debra Masson, of Hampshire Constabulary, described the brothers as "men of violence" who "made people's lives a misery".
"The evidence shown in court of their behaviour directly after the attack, coupled with their concerted efforts to evade capture, served to expose them as the dangerous criminals they are," she said.
"Although things will never be the same for Carla, we hope that the sentence handed to Geoffrey and Billy Midmore today goes some way to giving her closure and allows her to feel that justice has been delivered."
