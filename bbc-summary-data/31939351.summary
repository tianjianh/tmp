Judges said Winkleman, who took a full-time role on Strictly Come Dancing when Sir Bruce Forsyth stepped down, was "a genuinely individual performer".
Her win was something of a coup - as neither Sir Bruce nor Tess Daly had ever been nominated for the award.
The star said she was "ridiculously happy" to have been honoured.
Overall, the BBC took 18 of the 28 prizes at Tuesday night's ceremony.
Sarah Lancashire was named best female actor for her role in the drama series Happy Valley, while Tom Hollander won best actor for his portrayal of poet Dylan Thomas in BBC Two's A Poet In New York.
Graham Norton made up for his loss in the entertainment presenter category by winning best entertainment programme.
Judges called his chat show "effortlessly slick, brilliantly cast and continually fresh".
Medical drama Casualty was the surprise winner of best soap, beating both Coronation Street and EastEnders.
Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton shared the best comedy performance trophy for their comedy anthology Inside No. 9 - which tells a series of dark, twisted stories, each set behind a door marked "number nine".
Another comedy duo - Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse - picked up best scripted comedy show for their affectionate spoof of BBC Two's history, The Story of the Twos, which was commissioned to celebrate the channel's 50th anniversary.
ITV received just one award - as Billy Connolly was named best presenter for Billy Connolly's Big Send Off, a two-part documentary examining how different cultures deal with death.
Channel 4 received best daytime show, for Couples Come Dine With Me, and best popular factual show, for The Island with Bear Grylls - beating The Great British Bake-Off.
Arts broadcaster Melvyn Bragg was given the lifetime achievement award, marking his 52 years in television.
The South Bank show presenter was hailed was being "synonymous with the arts", and credited as a "great broadcaster and programme maker".
The BBC's controller of drama commissioning, Ben Stephenson, was presented with the judges' award.
The executive was described as having had "an extraordinary year", having been responsible for seven of the 10 most-watched dramas of the year.
His commissions included The Fall, The Missing and Line Of Duty - which picked up best drama series.
Stephens used his speech to ask the audience to rally behind the BBC as it approaches charter renewal.
"No more cuts at BBC, only programmes," he told the audience of industry professionals.
"Time for everyone to get behind the BBC," he added. "The BBC is always on the front pages for the wrong reasons and it's nonsense."
