Hartlepool councillors back allowance rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in Hartlepool have approved a 30% rise in their basic allowance, which they say will bring them into line with neighbouring authorities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will increase from £5,953 to £7,792 after the proposal was backed by 17 votes to 11 at a meeting on Thursday.
The authority said the figure was "historically low" and the increase would "broaden the range of people" who would consider becoming councillors.
The rise was described as "distasteful" by one opponent at the meeting.
Hartlepool had the lowest allowance of the five councils in the Tees Valley and the increase was recommended by an independent remuneration panel.
It will now be the second lowest, ahead of Middlesbrough which pays £6,130.
Redcar and Cleveland Council pays the highest, with a figure of £9,550.
