Knott made 24 appearances for the Gills last season after joining from Bradford in June 2016, but was placed on the transfer list in May.
The 24-year-old ended last season on loan with Lincoln, helping them win promotion from the National League.
"We had a great end to last season and it was only right to come back here," he told Lincoln's club website.
