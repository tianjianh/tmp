Hillsborough stories: John McBrien and David Steven Brown

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On 15 April 1989, two fans from north Wales went to a football match and never came home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John McBrien, from Flintshire, and David Steven Brown, from Wrexham, died along with 94 others at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough football stadium, Sheffield.
An inquest into the deaths of the 96 fans, killed as a result of a crush in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace that day, found they were unlawfully killed.
Jurors found police failures led to the deaths and the behaviour of Liverpool fans did not contribute to the dangerous situation at the turnstiles.
Police delayed declaring a major incident and the emergency response including the ambulance service was therefore delayed.
Jurors found there were defects at the stadium which caused the disaster. There was also an error in the safety certification of the Hillsborough stadium.
Eighteen-year-old student Mr McBrien, from Flint, had travelled to Sheffield on a coach organised by the Deeside Supporters' Club from Flint.
Machine operator Steven Brown, as he was known to family and friends, went to the match with his brother, Andrew Brown, who survived.
The inquest concluded both men died of compression asphyxia. Mr McBrien's time of death was between 15:00 BST and 16:35, while Mr Brown died was between 15:00 and 15:58.
