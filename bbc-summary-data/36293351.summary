[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chris Donald had 56 lots for sale including models, station clocks and metal signs.
His collection sold for £9,330 at Railton's auctioneers.
The most expensive item proved to be an oak-cased clock from Ilderton Station which fetched £850, more than double its £400 estimate.
The brass nameplate from the engine The Bramham Moor sold for £700, more than twice its estimate, while another clock from the London and North Eastern Railway reached £800.
The Chronicle had previously reported Mr Donald was selling his collection as he is downsizing his home in Northumberland.
Mr Donald founded Viz in Newcastle in 1979 with the help of his brother Simon and friend Jim Brownlow.
