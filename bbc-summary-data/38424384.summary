[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 1-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stoppage-time own goal from Josh Law ended Oldham's stubborn resistance as Fleetwood Town left it late to claim a narrow win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It took nearly half an hour for either keeper to be tested, a mistake from Fleetwood gifting the Latics their first opportunity.
Conor McLaughlin and Ash Hunter collided allowing Darius Osei space to break down the right, with Billy McKay firing into the arms of Alex Cairns from a tight angle.
Ryan Flynn then blazed just wide for the visitors who were barely troubled by the hosts before the break.
Fleetwood's first sight of goal came eight minutes into the second half, Hunter surging into space on the right of the box, his blast parried by Connor Ripley.
The introduction of Devante Cole lifted the home side's spirits, the former Manchester City man almost setting up an opener as he slipped past his man on the Fleetwood right but David Ball was unable to make contact as he raced to finish the move.
Cole's pace caused problems for the Latics and he could easily have put Fleetwood ahead on the hour, the striker showing a lack of composure in the final six yards as he sent the ball flying over the angle.
At the other end, a last-ditch Cian Bolger challenge denied Osei another chance to test Cairns.
A sloppy clearance from Nathan Pond then handed Lee Croft a chance to shoot from inside the box but his effort smashed into the side netting.
Chris Long might have settled it late on, cutting in from the left and forcing the save of the game from Ripley, the Latics keeper tipping over the bar.
But it was Cole who finally broke the visitors a minute into stoppage time, skipping in from the left, his cross from inside the six-yard box turned over the line by Law to leave the visitors stranded at the bottom of the table.
