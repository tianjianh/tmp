With eight minutes left, the U's captain finally beat excellent visiting keeper Mark Cousins after Joe Worrall brought down Robbie Simpson.
The visitors were unlucky not to be ahead early on, as Ashley Hemmings' cross was pushed out and Josh Coulson's follow-up was blocked on the line.
Ryan Ledson and Jimmy Spencer both went close for Cambridge before Berry kept a calm head to finally secure the points.
Cambridge manager Shaun Derry told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:
"It was a horrible game (because of the weather). I knew it was going to be like that as soon as I arrived today, but we found a way.
"But we keep going on to the boys about affecting games in different ways, and we sure did that today.
"I've always said it's not just a game of 11 people, the substitutes have to make a real impact, and Robbie has come on and won the penalty."
Dagenham manager John Still told BBC Radio London:

"We're making good progress now, I thought our back four was very, very good.
"I'm quite encouraged. I think we've built over the last three or four games, there's a resoluteness about us. It's hard to judge the game because of the conditions.
"The ingredients that we need to get away from the bottom two are showing weekly. I'm really, really pleased with the two centre halves we now have in, I'm really pleased with our organisation and work-rate and I thought it was a really strong display."
