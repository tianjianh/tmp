A mentally ill man was discharged from hospital with a "very flimsy" safety net of care before hacking his mother and sister to death, an inquest heard.

John Jenkin used an axe to kill sister Kathryn, 20, and Alice McMeekin, 58, during a schizophrenic episode at their home in Millom, Cumbria, in June 2013.
Jenkin was jailed for life in March 2014 for the pair's manslaughter.
Cumbria Coroner David Roberts recorded a verdict of unlawful killing and said no-one could have foreseen the attack.
The inquest heard Jenkin was marked as "zero" risk to himself and others hours after attempting to kill himself.
He was said to have cut his wrists and attempted to walk into the sea after taking a cocktail of whisky, painkillers, LSD and the cannabis substitute Spice.
Jenkin underwent a 90-minute assessment at Dane Garth mental health unit at Furness General Hospital.
Mental health nurse Garry Dixon told the hearing at Barrow Town Hall he was "very experienced" in assessing risk and "did everything that I was supposed to do".
An internal review by Mr Dixon's employers, Cumbria Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, ruled the nurse "acted in line with trust policy".
Jenkin killed his sister, who had been living in Aberdare, and mother less than 48 hours after being released from the mental health unit.
But, giving evidence to the hearing, consultant forensic psychiatrist Bob Peckitt said he had concerns about the nurse's approach.
He said it appeared that Mr Dixon had worked in isolation in making the decision not to keep Jenkin in the mental health unit.
Prof Peckitt said: "The problem was, I think, that Mr Jenkin had already demonstrated a number of quite worrying risk factors and although his mother was willing to have him home, it was certainly not clear on that assessment that it was a sensible idea.
"He went out with a very flimsy safety net of care... how did anybody know he was going to be OK? It was a big ask."
He said Mr Dixon could not have foreseen the "tragedy that would follow" and had acted in personal good faith throughout the assessment, but he criticised the lack of teamwork in his ultimate decision.
Prof Peckitt added that when Jenkin first entered the prison system that it was "immediately recognised" by psychiatric staff that he was unwell.
Jenkin was soon transferred to Ashworth high-security psychiatric hospital in Merseyside and experts later agreed he had been mentally ill in the months before the killings.
Jenkin, aged 24 at the time of the killings, was ordered to serve a minimum of 12 years in prison when he was jailed at Preston Crown Court.
Mr Roberts said: "There is undoubtedly a possibility that had his risk assessment been higher and had there been further contact with the mental health service the following day that the additional impact may have helped him.
"But those possible meetings never took place and that is a matter of speculation.
"I am still clear that whatever may have been concluded in working with this young man, no-one could have seen that he would bludgeon his mother and sister to death."
