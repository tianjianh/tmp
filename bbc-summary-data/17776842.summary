Manx National Heritage seek local views on £1m donation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manx National Heritage (MNH) has launched a public consultation on how to use its largest ever donation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colby resident John Donald Collister, 93, left his estate, valued at £1m, to the Manx nation following his death in 2007.
Director of MNH Edmund Southworth said: "This gift has the potential to make an enormous difference to heritage on the Isle of Man."
MNH first became aware it had been mentioned as a beneficiary in 2011.
Mr Southworth said it first heard the news in July when the administrator issued a claim in the High Court seeking the assistance of the court in the interpretation of Mr Collister's will.
He said: "In may ways he was an ordinary man but this is an extraordinary story."
Mr Collister, who worked as a painter, served in World War II with the Manx Regiment in Crete and north Africa and then returned to his trade in civilian life.
"History books are all about kings and queens and the ordinary man tends not to appear, but we now have an opportunity to change that, so that Mr Collister will be remembered for what he had done for this island," added Mr Southworth.
The Manx Museum and National Trust are now seeking views on how to best use the money.
Suggestions must focus on Manx heritage and must specifically benefit the people and visitors to the Isle of Man.
