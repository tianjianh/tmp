WBA world super bantamweight champion Rigondeaux, 35, boxes in the UK for the first time as he defends his title against Liverpool's Jazza Dickens.
He is widely considered to be one of the world's top pound-for-pound boxers.
"I know you guys are great boxing fans and I am ready to go for you," Rigondeaux told BBC Wales Sport.
Rigondeaux is undefeated in 16 bouts as a professional and recorded 475 victories in 487 contests as an amateur.
The Cuba-born fighter won gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and in 2004 in Athens.
He co-headlines a bill featuring WBO world lightweight champion Terry Flanagan's defence against former IBF world champion Mzonke Fana.
British and Commonwealth super welterweight champion Liam Williams, from Clydach Vale, also defends his titles against Gary Corcoran in front of his hometown fans.
Rigondeaux's coach Pedro Diaz, who also trained the now Miami-based boxer in his amateur career, says his fighter could well be the best in the world.
"If he is not the best he is the most complete," Diaz told BBC Wales Sport.
"It is difficult to speak about who is the best, there are a lot of good boxers.
"For us, he is in a class of his own, he is an extraordinary boxer. He is the only champion to only fight boxers with winning records."
