[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leading with an article about a 150,000 strong women's rights march, the Express accidentally used a male symbol instead of a female symbol.
Social media users were quick to spot the mistake.
The paper - a free daily newspaper published by the Washington Post - was quick to apologise on its Twitter account.
One commentator referred to the blunder as a "record for largest typo".
"We made a mistake on our cover this morning and we're very embarrassed," the statement from the Washington Post Express read.
"We erroneously used a male symbol instead of a female symbol."
It also released an image of how the cover should have appeared.
