[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hartlepool's Luke James fired the game's first chance wide, as they took the fight to the League Two leaders.
Northampton had to rely on committed defending to keep the hosts at bay, with James and Billy Paynter having efforts blocked.
Paynter went close to winning the game when his effort deflected wide but Northampton held on for a point.
Northampton Town manager Chris Wilder tells BBC Radio Northampton:

"You have to give Hartlepool a load of credit because we are there to be shot at.
"To win 10 games of football at any level is an unbelievable achievement.
"It was a tough afternoon and I thought a draw was a fair result and we move on to the next game.
"We've picked up four points from our last two games and everyone knows if you keep doing that you will go up and probably win the league."
