It picked up the honour at the British Guild of Travel Writers' awards ceremony.
The multi-million pound project linking the capital and the Scottish Borders was officially opened by the Queen last year.
It saw off an artificial surfing lake in north Wales and a cycling route in Devon to win the award.
"It is an amazing railway and unique to the area," said Ailsa Herd of VisitScotland on accepting the prize.
"You can visit so many different attractions over the journey so I would recommend you go now, especially since we won this amazing award.
"I think the team will be over the moon, there were so many different contenders in the category we are delighted to have won."
