Mr Trump's golf development on the Menie estate on the coast is nearing completion.
Work on the controversial Â£750m project, to also feature a hotel and homes, began a year ago.
The images show a single-story building made of granite, slate and glass, described as "second to none".
The clubhouse - designed by Acanthus Architects - forms part of the next phase of the development.
Sarah Malone, executive vice president of Trump International Scotland, said: "We've spent many months refining and perfecting the permanent clubhouse design and will submit our planning application to Aberdeenshire Council in the coming weeks.
"With luxurious Scottish interiors and a full range of services and facilities for golfers and visitors, this clubhouse will be second to none."
