[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A clubber found drowned after a night out "wandered off" when he was last seen alive, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deakon Wilkins, 24, from Weston-super-Mare, vanished after leaving Motion nightclub in Bristol in the early hours of 14 January.
His body was found on 5 February after a high-profile social media and leafleting campaign by his family.
The coroner returned a verdict of death by drowning but said it was not known how or why he entered the water.
There was no evidence that anyone else was involved in his death.
Mr Wilkins' friend, Matthew Cook, told the inquest at the Avon Coroners Court that Mr Wilkins had taken speed that night, although this did not show up in the toxicology report.
Mr Cook told the court he had received two unintelligible texts from Mr Wilkins on his phone in the early hours of the morning.
"I tried to find him after he wandered off in the club. He was supposed to be staying at mine," he added.
Mr Wilkins' body was found in the Floating Harbour at the beginning of February.
