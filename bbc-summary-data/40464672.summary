Uihlein carded a second consecutive four-under 67 at Le Golf National.
Otaegui set the early clubhouse target with a superb five-under 66, before an afternoon thunderstorm led to a delay of two hours and five minutes.
England's Tommy Fleetwood shares third with Alexander Bjork after completing a three-under 68 following the delay.
"It's always quite tricky when you have to go back out," said the 26-year-old, who finished fourth at the US Open. "It was a shame because I felt like I had a lovely rhythm again."
First-round leader Paul Waring could only add a one-over 72 to his opening 64 to finish six under par alongside fellow Englishman Nathan Kimsey, with Graeme Storm, Ross Fisher and Ryder Cup player Thomas Pieters a shot further back.
