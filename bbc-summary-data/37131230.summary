[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A West Lothian restaurant owner who served a prawn cocktail containing insects has been fined £650.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Lau admitted he had not washed the lettuce in his seafood starter at the Mei Hua Platform restaurant at West Calder railway station.
Lau, 65, claimed he had brought the salad leaves from a major retailer and believed they would be clean.
He told Livingston Sheriff Court he would normally wash lettuce he bought from a wholesaler.
He was charged after a couple found the insects, which were not identified.
They reported it to West Lothian Council's environmental health department.
Inspectors visited the restaurant on 27 March and Lau showed them the lettuce he had used - still infested with insects.
He was later charged with food safety and food hygiene offences.
Lau appeared for sentence on Friday after earlier pleading guilty to serving food "not of the quality demanded by the purchaser".
He also admitted failing to maintain a suitable decontamination process which he is supposed to follow under a food safety management system system called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP).
Sheriff Douglas Kinloch said he would have imposed a fine of £1,000 but for his guilty plea.
He allowed Lau three months to pay the fine.
