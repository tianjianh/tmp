Northampton nightclub crush: Police action 'appropriate'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The policing of a major incident at a nightclub in which two students were killed in a crush was "appropriate", the police watchdog has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nabila Nanfuka, 22, and Laurene-Danielle Jackson, 19, suffered fatal injuries while trying to leave the Lava and Ignite club in Northampton in 2011.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission looked into police actions.
An inquest found 14 DJ announcements in 30 minutes had been the most significant cause of overcrowding.
About 900 students travelled to the club from around the country and the DJs called for universities to leave one after the other, often with just a few minutes between them.
The IPCC investigation found it more than likely police had not been informed of the event and was only alerted when a large number of people began arriving at the club.
The report said there is "sufficient evidence to suggest the decisions and actions of the police during the incident were appropriate".
It added there was "no evidence of a criminal offence having been committed by any police officer".
The report concluded that "every officer involved made a significant contribution to the effective policing of the tragedy".
During an inquest last week, it was reported that a series of announcements reminding people not to miss their coaches had been made in the early hours of 19 October.
The inquest jury concluded the second most significant factor was the lack of overall management of the cloakroom.
The Crown Prosecution Service previously determined there would be no criminal charges brought against anyone following the incident.
Ms Nanfuka, of Neasden, north London, was studying a leisure and tourism degree at the University of Northampton. She died at Northampton General Hospital on 19 October.
Ms Jackson, of Wembley, was studying psychology at Kingston University and died at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital on 6 November.
