One bookmaker has suspended betting on the Republic of Ireland assistant taking over from outgoing Celtic boss Ronny Deila, although it is understood the club are still interviewing candidates and no decision is imminent.
"He's hard but fair. What you see is really is what you get," said Gordon.
"If he was appointed, I'm sure he would do well and he would be successful."
Gordon played under Keane at Sunderland having been signed by the Irishman from Hearts in a deal totalling Â£9m in 2007.
"I know how he liked things to run at Sunderland," Gordon added. "He was an aggressive player, he wanted to win every match and, from what I've seen, he is exactly the same as a manager."
Norwegian Deila announced on 20 April he would leave the club, before a fifth straight Scottish title was secured on Sunday.
Gordon is not surprised to see big names linked with the Celtic job and believes plenty of top-class managers would be interested in taking over the Scottish champions.
"It's a big job for anybody. It's a big club, a massive club," he said.
"There are a lot of good managers out there that would see Celtic as being a really good job and a good prospect to go on and do something pretty special, winning trophies and playing in European competitions.
"There's not that many clubs in Britain that are capable of doing that."
