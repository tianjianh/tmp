[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former New Zealand rugby player has spoken of his frustration over being taken to court on a sexual assault charge.

Mils Muliaina, 35, was alleged to have touched a woman "on the bottom over her trousers" in a busy Cardiff nightclub.
But on Monday, Cardiff Crown Court heard there was not enough evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and the case was dropped.
His defence said it was a case of mistaken identity.
He was arrested in April moments after a European Challenge Cup quarter-final match in Gloucester. TV cameras showed him being led away by police.
Outside court, an emotional Mr Muliaina said it had been a difficult time for him and his family.
"It's been incredibly frustrating not to be able to publicly comment about it," he said.
"While I understand the police have a job to do, the manner in which I was arrested I find difficult to understand.
"I can still hold my head up high and as the judge said this is no stain on my character. I have always known that I did not do anything wrong."
The 100-cap international, who has now signed for Italian Pro12 side Zebre, said he was looking forward to getting on with his life and plans to return home to New Zealand to see his son next week.
He added: "When I first found out the charges were going to be withdrawn I instantly thought of my son - he should have never have had to go through this.
"I'm looking forward to going back home and spending some time with him and wishing him a happy birthday."
Mr Muliaina retired from international duty in 2011.
The alleged incident was said to have taken place on 7 March while Mr Muliaina was in Cardiff for a league match against Cardiff Blues while playing for Irish side Connacht
Speaking on Monday, defending counsel John Charles Rees QC told the court the prosecution's case against his client had been "outrageous" and "wholly defective".
He said: "He is a professional athlete whose reputation has been reduced while the complainant remains anonymous.
"The allegation was that her bottom had been fleetingly touched on a busy nightclub dance floor.
"He has denied doing anything wrong from beginning to end."
His legal team said the mistaken identity case should never have come to court and that the defence would be applying for costs in the case.
