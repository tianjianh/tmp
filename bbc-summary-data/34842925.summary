Stormont deal: what are thorny issues for NI politicians?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They are negotiating - but what are the thorny issues on the table for Northern Ireland's parties and the British and Irish governments?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Talks aimed at resolving the political deadlock continue at Stormont.
The talks are focusing on welfare reform, finance, paramilitary activity and the legacy of the Troubles.
It is worth recalling that the Stormont House deal, agreed just under a year ago, fell apart over welfare reform.
Sinn Féin walked away from the deal saying mitigating measures for welfare recipients did not go far enough and were less than they understood had been agreed.
That interpretation is hotly disputed by the DUP.
The deal should have introduced changes already made across the rest of the UK:
The  Stormont House deal in essence agreed to introduce all of the above but with significant mitigating measures.
These were:
In total, all these measures would cost £564m over six years, the vast majority of that related to DLA/PIP.
Responsibility for the welfare system is devolved to Northern Ireland. However, in practice, Northern Ireland has always operated in parity with the rest of the United Kingdom.
In 2012, the UK coalition government under David Cameron and Nick Clegg agreed a series of welfare changes known as the Welfare Reform Act.
However, Stormont could not agree to implement those changes through its own Welfare Reform Bill.
It was really about the last of the five measures listed above.
Sinn Féin said they had been misled about how big the Supplementary Payment Scheme would need to be.
Martin McGuinness reckoned it would actually need another £200m to protect current and future claimants. Figures in Sinn Féin's Welfare Facts document suggest full compensation would require a "supplementary fund" of £346m over six years
The DUP said it would be "impossible" to offer the sort of protection that Sinn Féin were aiming for.
Have Sinn Féin got any more money for mitigating measures?
Recall the party's mantra of protecting "children with disabilities, adults with severe disabilities, the long-term sick" -  that is really about specific mitigation for the reduction of disability premiums under Universal Credit, the time limiting of contributory ESA and the household benefit cap.
Will there be anything specific they can point to on those benefits?
Will the party stick to the position that future as well as existing claimants must be protected?
And how will the Tax Credits issue play into any pledges on mitigation?
