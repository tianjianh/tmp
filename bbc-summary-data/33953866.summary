[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Siddall, 24, from Skellow in Doncaster, was found dead at his home at around 05:20 BST on Friday.
South Yorkshire Police said there were reports he had been assaulted in the VDKA bar in Silver Street, Doncaster, shortly after 23:00 BST on Thursday.
A post-mortem examination concluded that Mr Siddall died as a result of a head injury.
Police said the inquiry was in its very early stages and there were many more witnesses to speak to before they established what happened.
A spokesman said: "We believe there are a number of people who were at the bar in Silver Street, Doncaster, between 23:00 and 23:30 BST on Thursday 13 August who have not yet spoken to us who could potentially help with our inquiry.
"If you have not yet spoken to police, please call 101."
