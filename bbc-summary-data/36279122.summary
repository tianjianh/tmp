Celtic and Roy Keane a good fit - Martin O'Neill

Former Celtic manager Martin O'Neill says Roy Keane would be a good fit for the Scottish champions as they search for Ronny Deila's successor.

Keane, Republic of Ireland boss O'Neill's assistant, is the bookmakers' favourite to replace the Norwegian.
"Could he do the job? I would have no problem with that whatsoever," O'Neill told Irish broadcaster RTE.
But he added: "As Roy said, you still have to be asked to do it, I'm not so sure that's been the case."
O'Neill managed Celtic between 2000 and 2005, leading the club to three league titles, three Scottish Cups, one League Cup and a memorable run to the 2003 Uefa Cup final.

He believes the stature of both Celtic and Keane makes them a natural fit, with Deila having announced last month that he would be leaving Glasgow in the summer.
The Scottish Premiership champions will next season bid for a sixth straight top-flight title.
"Celtic is one of the great clubs in the world and Keane is one of the great players," said O'Neill. "That's not a bad fit for a start."
With Republic of Ireland competing at Euro 2016 in France next month, O'Neill does not think Keane would give up his position with the national side lightly.
He has, however, said more than once that Keane is ready to return to club management, after previous spells in charge of Sunderland, who he led to the Premier League, and Ipswich Town.
When asked if the former Manchester United captain was ready for a new challenge, O'Neill said: "Yeah, he could very well be."
