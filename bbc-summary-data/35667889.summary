Wigan Warriors head coach Shaun Wane has demanded an improvement in their performances despite their 100% start to the Super League season.

Dom Manfredi's late try enabled Wigan overcome Salford 20-16 on Thursday, their third league victory so far.
They are top of the table and the the only side with a perfect record to start the campaign.
"Another ugly win and I thought we didn't play well," 51-year-old Wane told BBC Radio Manchester.
"There were too many errors and our skill was off, but one thing my team has got is a lot of toughness in them and they're finding a way to win.
"I think we would've lost that game last year. After the World Club Challenge in 2015 we went to Hull KR and got butchered."
Wigan's only defeat this season came when Australian National Rugby League side Brisbane Broncos beat them 42-12 in the World Club Series.
"We did a lot of things for good periods against Salford, but at critical times in the last third of the pitch we just had poor skill and didn't finish our sets off," Wane added.
"We you consider everything we need to be happy with three out of three but we know we can improve - we've got three wins but we've not played well yet so I'm sure a team is going to get it soon."
