[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A taxi driver caught with more than 1.5 tonnes of illegal tobacco has been handed a suspended jail term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Clater, from Grantham in Lincolnshire, was found with hand-rolling and raw tobacco when he was stopped on the M4 near Swindon.
HM Revenue and Customs estimated it would have lost Â£260,000 in tax.
Clater was given two 18-month jail terms, suspended for two years, to run concurrently after he was found guilty of tax evasion last month.
The 62-year-old was also given a nine month supervision order, made to do 100 hours of unpaid work, pay Â£1,000 costs and the Â£100 victim surcharge at Swindon Crown Court.
Clater, of Hornsby Road in Grantham, was stopped on the motorway in a routine operation by Wiltshire police and HMRC.
Officers searched his hire van discovering boxes and bin liners filled with the illegal tobacco.
They found 404kg (890lbs) of hand-rolling tobacco and 1.2 tonnes of raw tobacco.
Insp Steve Cox, from Wiltshire police, said: "We cannot underestimate the impact of this sort of crime on the public purse and it is only right that this man was not able to get away with it."
The court ordered the destruction of the tobacco.
