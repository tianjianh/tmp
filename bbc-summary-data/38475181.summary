[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 1-5 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green closed the gap to second-placed Tranmere to just a point with a comfortable 5-1 National League win over 10-man Bromley at Hayes Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forest Green opened the scoring in the 28th minute when Rob Sinclair picked the ball up in midfield and set Elliott Frear in on goal down the left channel,and he made no mistake to fire past Alan Julian and into the bottom corner.
Sam Russell then produced a superb save to deny Blair Turgott and preserve the lead before Rovers doubled their advantage when Christian Doidge got on the end of Frear's low cross into the box.
Rob Swaine headed Bromley back into the game five minutes after the break but it did not take Rovers long to restore the two-goal advantage as Keanu Marsh-Brown picked up a loose ball on the right and fired home a minute later.
And just moments later Forest Green made it four when Frear's free-kick was headed into the net by Ethan Pinnock before Swaine was dismissed late on for a second caution.
Doidge then wrapped it up in stoppage time with his second of the afternoon after being set up smartly by Liam Noble.
