Liverpool's Ward, 23, won his third cap after Wayne Hennessy's late withdrawal before the Euro 2016 win over Slovakia.
He made his debut as a substitute in the friendly draw against Northern Ireland in March.
A product of Wrexham's academy, Ward was signed by Liverpool in January 2012.
The National League side also received £100,000 when Ward made his Liverpool debut against Bournemouth in April.
Fellow Welsh club Newport County will also benefit financially after former striker Conor Washington made his competitive debut for Northern Ireland.
Washington, now at Queens Park Rangers, came on as a substitute against Poland in Euro 2016.
