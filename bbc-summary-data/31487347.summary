Ashraf Amrani, 30, was found dead on the roof of a property on Westbourne Park Road, Paddington, on Friday.
When police went to inform his family, the bodies of his parents Hassan and Zohra Amrani were found at their home in Landor House on the same street.
A court official revealed Ashraf Amrani had been jailed for rape in 2010.
At Southwark Crown Court he was sentenced to seven years and two months in prison.
Days before his body was discovered, Amrani had been arrested on suspicion of affray, police said.
His death is being treated as unexplained.
His parents' deaths are being investigated as a double murder, although police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the killings, Scotland Yard confirmed.
A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said police had been called to Landor House on Thursday, and a man, believed to be the couple's son, had tried to block them from entering.
She said: "The last time I saw the wife was on Thursday and she didn't look happy. She looked a bit fed up and sad.
"She said her husband had called her and said there was some trouble in the house.
"On that same night when I went home my brother told me that police had been round. He got the impression he [the son] was in there and not letting them in.
"I'm just so shocked."
Scotland Yard said the case had been reported to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).
Post-mortem examinations are due to take place later.
