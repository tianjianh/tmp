[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Animal welfare experts will be among a review team investigating after police officers deliberately ran down and killed a dog running loose on the A55 in Conwy.

North Wales Police said the foxhound could not be brought under control and the "only safe option" was to destroy it in the early hours of Monday.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it would leave the review to the force.
The RSPCA will also be involved.
A roads policing specialist from a separate police force will sit on the panel along with a representative from the veterinary profession.
Police said the dog's owner had been left "devastated" but agreed officers had made the right decision.
Traffic police drove at the dog on the dual carriageway between Llanfairfechan roundabout and the Conwy tunnel.
North Wales Police said firearms officers were sent to the scene, but there was concern they would not be able to get a safe shot.
Ch Insp Darren Wareing, of the roads policing unit, said police had not taken the decision to kill the dog lightly and it came after an officer was bitten while trying to bring the animal under control.
He said the "potential for a serious collision was present throughout" and there was "no alternative way" for them to minimise risks to motorists.
IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: "I have been reassured by the deputy chief constable at North Wales Police that the matter is being treated very seriously."
