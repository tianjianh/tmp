Firefighters were called to Alastrean House in Tarland, near Aboyne, at about 15:50 on Saturday.
A total of 38 residents were evacuated by staff and rehoused in a separate wing of the building.
Nine fire crews attended the blaze which was described as "quite extensive". The flames were extinguished by 20:00.
No-one was injured.
A statement from the care home said all residents and seven members of staff were safely evacuated.
A spokeswoman for the Balhousie Care Group said the fire had spread internally through the flue to the roof space, causing damage to the walls and roof.
She said all relatives had been contacted and added: "We would like to thank the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and other emergency services for their fast response."
The home is owned by The MacRobert Trust and operated by Balhousie Care Group.
