Weybread murder investigation: Ali Qazimaj to be extradited

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man suspected of murdering a couple from Suffolk will be extradited from Luxembourg after his appeal to remain in the country was denied.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ali Qazimaj, 42, of Tilbury, Essex, was arrested over the murders of Peter and Sylvia Stuart, from Weybread, on 17 June.
The Court of Appeal in Luxembourg has upheld the decision by the District Court to extradite him to the UK.
He is expected to be surrendered to the British authorities on Thursday.
Mr Stuart's body was found in Weybread on 3 June. His wife has yet to be found, but police believe she has also been killed.
The couple were last seen alive at Goodies Farm Shop in Pulham Market, Norfolk, on 29 May. They were reported missing five days later.
Mr Stuart's body was discovered near their home with multiple stab wounds.
Mr Qazimaj was found in a hostel in Luxembourg City after being identified by a female member of staff who recognised him through photos on the internet.
In a statement, Suffolk Police said: "Suffolk and Norfolk Constabulary Joint Major Investigation Team is aware of the decision made in Luxembourg and are working with colleagues on the continent to bring him back to the UK in due course.
"He will then be subject to legal process in the UK."
