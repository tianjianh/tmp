[SN]TITLE[SN]
Australia's audacious prison breaks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It sounded like something out of a B-grade movie: a prison inmate had tied sheets together and swung them over a prison wall to make good his escape.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But it's a true story.
Stephen Jamieson, a maximum security prisoner at Goulburn Correctional Centre in New South Wales, made his daring escape during broad daylight on Tuesday, dressed in his regular prison greens.
The 28-year-old, who was serving 12 years in prison for armed robbery, is now back in custody after 20 police officers and a dog squad searched the local area for him.
Jamieson joins a small pantheon of Australian prisoners who have tried their hand at the Great Escape with varying degrees of success.
Perhaps the most daring was in 1999, when Lucy Dudko hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to land in the exercise yard at Sydney's Silverwater prison to pluck her lover, armed robber John Killick, to freedom.
The two went on the run only to be caught snoozing by authorities in a Sydney caravan park six weeks later.
Jailed separately, they kept in contact, exchanging 4,500 letters over six years. But their love finally died when Dudko rediscovered her Christian faith in 2005.
A more violent but shorter-lived break-out occurred in 1993 when prison guard Heather Parker smuggled explosives into the Melbourne Remand Centre for her lover, armed robber Peter Gibb.
Gibb and fellow inmate Archie Butterly blew their way out of the jail and escaped in a getaway car, and then a stolen motorcycle before being picked up by Parker in another car.
The trio headed for the bush in central Victoria where they were eventually caught after six days on the run, with Butterly dying in a police shoot-out.
Cupid also seems to have been involved in the story of convicted bank robber, Brenden James Abbott.
In 1989, Abbott and fellow inmate Aaron Reynolds escaped over the walls of West Australia's Fremantle Prison wearing guards' uniforms they had made themselves.
Abbott stayed on the run for five-and-a-half years and media reported he sent a series of photos of himself "on holiday" to detectives, earning him the nickname the Postcard Bandit.
In a second escape, from a Queensland jail in 1997, a girlfriend smuggled in wire, which Abbott and four accomplices used to cut their way out.
Using a high-powered rifle, an associate on the outside disabled a vehicle being driven by guards as Abbott and several other inmates escaped the prison grounds. He was captured six months later.
Australia's history of daring escapes goes back to convict times.
English convict William Buckley, transported to what is now Victoria for stealing a bolt of cloth, ran off in 1803 when he learnt he might be sent to a more notorious colony in Tasmania.
For the next 32 years, he lived with the Wathaurung Indigenous people until he re-appeared at a white settlers' camp.
After his story became known, he was granted a pardon.
Other stories of escape are more grizzly.
Alexander Pearce was an Irish convict transported to Tasmania for theft in 1819.
He escaped with seven other convicts, one of whom had an axe.
After 15 days, hunger drove the group to kill and eat one of their comrades. Three of the men bolted in fear, one died from a snake bite and Pearce ended up the last man standing, having dined on several of his companions.
He remained on the hoof for 113 days before being retaken, confessing several times and escaping again with fellow convict Thomas Cox. When the law caught up with him, parts of Cox's body were found in his pockets and he confessed to killing him.
Pearce was tried and executed for the murder of Cox, with the Hobart Town Gazette noting Pearce did not look like someone who had "banqueted on human flesh".
