Seafield car park in Westward Ho! previously cost Â£3 per day, but now Rob Braddick has taken over the facility from Torridge District Council.
The business he owns, Braddicks Leisure, includes a bar near the car park called the Pier House.
However, he said: "It's not all about taking money. It is nice to give something back to the community."
Mr Braddick would not say how much he paid for the lease.
His grandfather, Leslie Braddick, previously owned the land the car park was built on but he was bought out in the early 1960s.
Mr Braddick said: "I would like people to come in and have a drink, but it is also next to an amazing walking route. The car park is for anybody to use, completely free."
The 20-space car park was pay and display with charges all day, including bank holidays.
Villagers responded with delight to the news on Mr Braddick's Facebook page.
Lizzie Warrener described it as "a marvellous gesture", while Roger Pullen said he was "a fine example in the community".
