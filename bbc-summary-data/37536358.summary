The Frenchman, 32, overcame the wet conditions to win in France for the first time since 2013 by 46.4 seconds.
His Volkswagen team-mate Andreas Mikkelsen finished second, while Belgian Thierry Neuville came third.
Briton Kris Meeke won both stages on Sunday but finished 16th overall after hitting a tree on Saturday.
Ogier, who is 68 points ahead of Mikkelsen in the standings with three rounds to go, will secure the title with a win at the Rally of Catalunya, which begins on 13 October.
