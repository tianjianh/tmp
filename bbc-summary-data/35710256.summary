[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull KR forward George Lawler has signed a new four-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawler, 20, has been ever-present for the Super League side this season.
Head of rugby Jamie Peacock said: "George is a very popular member of the squad, level-headed and eager to learn, so we're delighted he sees at least the next four years of his career here.
"If this club is to develop and progress to where we want it to be, then it's vital we bring through more home-grown players."
