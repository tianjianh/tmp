"No-one doubts his quality. His goalscoring record is unbelievable," said his Reds team-mate James Milner, who will captain England on Tuesday.
Roy Hodgson is set to make changes from Saturday's 3-2 win in Germany, with keeper Fraser Forster to start.
The Three Lions manager refused to confirm whether Danny Drinkwater would start, saying the Leicester midfielder "might" make his debut.
