The city council has approved the plans for the former Jaguar Browns Lane site.
Opponents wanted the site used for manufacturing rather than goods "being shipped" from overseas.
The development covers an area equivalent to 18 football pitches. There will be places for 700 cars and 127 heavy goods vehicles.
The council received 106 letters of objection.
Paul Liggins, vice chairman of the local Allesley and Coundon Wedge Society, said there had been previous applications for engineering businesses, which had not been opposed by residents.

"We are concerned about about an environmental impact of course and do not agree with the council that the development will enhance the area," he said.
"But we really want the site used for manufacturing here - stuff being made at the site - not for goods being shipped in from China or India or wherever."
Jim O'Boyle, the councillor in charge of development in Coventry, said earlier this week the city could not afford to turn down more than a thousand jobs by rejecting the plans.
He said the investment by the "multi-national organisation" would amount to Â£120m and mean the "biggest influx of jobs into the city in one fell swoop in well over a decade".
A Goodman spokesman said it hoped the site, now called Lyons Park, would be in operation by next year.
