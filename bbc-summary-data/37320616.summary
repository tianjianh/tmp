[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pro12: Glasgow Warriors 33-25 Leinster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tommy Seymour scored four tries as Glasgow Warriors christened the newly-laid synthetic Scotstoun pitch with a Pro12 win over Leinster.

They trailed by seven at the break as Rob Kearney, Josh van der Flier and Zane Kirchner crossed to cancel out scores from Seymour and Tim Swinson.
Scotland winger Seymour then lacerated Leinster with three predatory strikes after the break.
The bonus-point win sees Warriors level on points with Pro12 leaders Ospreys.
This was a compelling shoot-out between two Pro12 heavyweights who have fought some thunderous bouts in the recent past.
The defending was often porous - Glasgow's missed tackle count hitting double figures, while Leinster were manipulated by the speed and variety of the Warriors attack.
When the opening try came, it was textbook Glasgow. After punishing carries from Jonny Gray and then Leonardo Sarto took the Warriors into the Leinster 22, the ball was swept to the opposite wing, with Sam Johnson zipping a sumptuous pass for Seymour to scamper in at the corner.
Co-captain Henry Pyrgos missed the conversion, and the rest of the half belonged chiefly to the Irish province.
Their pack were heaved into touch as they rumbled towards the freshly painted whitewash but it was a temporary reprieve for Glasgow, reliant on last-ditch breakdown scrapping with the visitors repeatedly puncturing their midfield.
Eventually they crumbled, the Ireland full-back, Rob Kearney, scything through two missed tackles and finishing well at the corner, young pivot Joey Carbery converting magnificently from the touchline.
The response from Glasgow was immediate and resounding. Swinson capped a spell of rapid, aggressive phase play, neatly orchestrated by Pete Horne at fly-half, by driving over between the posts, Pyrgos converting, barely two minutes after Kearney's try.
Back surged Leinster and Sarto was dispatched to the sin-bin for infringing metres from his own line.
It culminated in a comically simple try for Van der Flier as the flanker scooped up the ball from the ruck and exploited the lack of any discernible fringe defence, shrugging off Simone Favaro's lunge and sprinting under the posts, Carbery again adding the conversion.
Then, with the clock red, Leinster pounced again, Kirchner gathering Carbery's delicate crosskick on the bounce and racing in for an unconverted score and a seven-point half-time lead.
That advantage was bolstered by Carbery's penalty four minutes into the second period as Glasgow struggled to exit cleanly from their own half.
However, if the first 40 minutes belonged to Leinster, the second was sole property of Seymour as the Pro12's hottest finisher produced an irrepressible combination of speed, power and opportunism to turn the game on its head.
First, he plucked Carbery's pass from the air to dot down under the posts for Pyrgos to convert.
Then, a minute later, he seized on another loose Leinster pass to spin out of a tackle and out-pace the chasing defence to the line.
With Pyrgos' conversion, suddenly the Warriors led.
Carbery cut the deficit to a point with a penalty just after the hour, but it was Seymour who had the emphatic final word.
From a scrummage deep in the Leinster 22, he fizzed brilliantly on to Pyrgos' inside flick, the winger's momentum carrying him towards a remarkable fourth try - his sixth in two matches - and an easy conversion for his co-captain.
A dynamic and fitting climax as Glasgow followed last week's rout of defending champions Connacht with this high-octane defeat of the early title favourites.
