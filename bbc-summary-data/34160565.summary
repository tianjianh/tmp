[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 1-2 Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe inflicted more misery on winless Newport County as Paul Mullin scored a stoppage time penalty to grab a third successive win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors soaked up early pressure and took an unlikely lead from Alan Goodall's header from a corner.
Scott Barrow scored his first Newport goal to level with a drilled effort into the bottom corner from 25 yards.
But substitute Mullin converted from the spot in the 94th minute after a foul on Kevin Ellison.
Newport County manager Terry Butcher told BBC Radio Wales: "I can't describe the feeling in the dressing room to be honest. It's one of devastation and huge, huge disappointment because we played so well in the game.
"We made enough chances to have won two or three games, especially in the first half. To go in a goal down at half-time was a travesty.
"To lose the game 2-1 is an even bigger travesty because it's one long ball over the top, two minutes to go in added time and we don't deal with it and we've paid a heavy price."
