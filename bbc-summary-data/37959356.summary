[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 1-2 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aaron Pierre slammed home with virtually the last kick of the game to give Wycombe a long-awaited away win with a 2-1 triumph over Cambridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Chairboys were without an away league win since 9 February until Pierre thundered the ball into the roof of the net after Brad Halliday failed to clear a corner.
Paul Hayes gave the visitors an early lead, lifting a sixth minute penalty over Will Norris after Roberts was penalised for a challenge on Pierre.
The U's were then kept at bay by an inspired performance by Wycombe goalkeeper Jamal Blackman.
He parried an effort from substitute Uche Ikpeazu, before producing two superb stops in a matter of minutes to twice deny U's defender Mark Roberts.
Luke Berry lifted a freekick narrowly over and Blackman was called into action again to save Blair Adam's effort at his near post,
He was finally helpless to Cambridge equalising on 87 minutes, George Maris converting the rebound after Ikpeazu's effort hit the inside of the far post.
But Wycombe had the final word five minutes into added time.
