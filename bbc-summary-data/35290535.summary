Finance minister: DUP leader Arlene Foster set to name replacement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new finance minister for Northern Ireland is expected to be appointed at Stormont later on Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster, who held the finance job, became first minister on Monday after Peter Robinson stepped down.
She is expected to name a replacement rather than carry out a full ministerial reshuffle.
One reason is that the Northern Ireland Assembly will break up in March to allow an election campaign to begin.
Mrs Foster could look to experienced DUP backbenchers to head the finance department.
BBC News NI's political editor Mark Devenport said Alastair Ross or Peter Weir could be options for Mrs Foster to turn to.
