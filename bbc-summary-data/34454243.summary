The makers of computer game Call of Duty: Black Ops III have been criticised for using images of a flood-hit Denbighshire town in a promotional video.

A YouTube video marketing the game's November release shows a Rhyl street submerged in December, 2013.
The town's former mayor, councillor Andrew Rutherford, told the Daily Post it "put people's misery into a game".
Activision, which publishes Call of Duty, has been asked to comment.
About 400 people were forced from their homes after streets in Rhyl were flooded with sea water caused by a storm surge in late 2013.
Footage of a waterlogged Garford Road during the upheaval appears in a montage of dystopian images in a story trailer for the game's multi-console release.
"Whilst I can see it is a brief two-second clip, in amongst many other real destruction clips, I think it's a shame they chose to use it," town councillor, Mr Rutherford, told the Post.
"It's terrible to put people's misery into a game. It certainly wasn't a game for the those affected by it."
The floods left hundreds of homes without power and rail services delayed, with some residents needing to be rehoused.
Those marketing the game were also recently criticised for using a fictional terror attack in Singapore as part of a web campaign.
The Call of Duty series of first-person shooting games, which is available on platforms such as Xbox and PlayStation, has sold tens of millions of copies worldwide.
