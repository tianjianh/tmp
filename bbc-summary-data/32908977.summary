In the most recent attack four meters were attacked with fireworks and paint was daubed on a fifth.
A man was seen running off towards the town centre after an explosion was heard in Friars Walk at 22:00 BST on Sunday, Sussex Police said.
The most recent attacks have caused about £4,500 worth of damage.
Two parking meters were attacked with a firework and paint respectively in the Phoenix Causeway car park and fireworks were used to damage machines in Friars Walk, Garden Street and Southover Road, police said.
In the previous attack in October 2012, fireworks were set off in the coin slots of two pay-and-display machines, causing damage totalling £2,900, Sussex police said.
In 2011, vandals carried out 15 attacks on 14 parking meters in the town between September and November, causing more than £20,000 of damage.
Similar incidents had been reported in the town each year since 2004 when on-street parking charges were introduced.
