Fancy one of these for your next school bus? It's a bus that drives itself.

The electric-powered minibus can carry up to six passengers and was launched on 23 January in Paris, France.
It will take people between two stations in the city and it's free to go on.
Instead of a human driver it has a system which tells it if there is anything in the road so it can move out of the way.
The vehicle is guided by GPS technology and will run seven days a week.
Perhaps it's good that it doesn't go very fast, with a top speed of only 15 kph.
