Monitor ship HMS M33 has a new home in number one dock next to HMS Victory in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.
More than 100,000 lives were lost in the Gallipoli campaign between April 1915 and January 1916.
The ship's restoration cost more than Â£2m and was funded by the lottery and public donations.
The BBC's Joe Campbell has taken a look around.
