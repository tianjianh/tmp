Ravinder Takhar, 45, from Shirley in Solihull, had set off with her husband and son on a trek in Arizona but told them to go ahead when she felt tired.
Her family became concerned when she failed to return from the trek to to Echo Canyon, near Camelback Mountain in Phoenix. Her body was found inside the canyon, police said.
Phoenix Police said initial reports suggested her death was heat-related.
Mrs Takhar died on 7 July but the force has just released a statement on her death.
Officer James Holmes said Mrs Takhar and her family had been visiting Phoenix and decided to hike to the canyon, a popular beauty spot.
"Visitors often enjoy both the beauty and challenges of the canyon," he said.
"The family began their hike at around 10:15 that morning and at around 13:15 they started the trek back down the mountain.
"According to the husband and son, Mrs Takhar became tired and told the others to go on ahead while she rested for a bit.
"The father and son reached the bottom of the hiking trail and, after about 20-25 minutes, became concerned that Mrs Takhar had not returned."
The family contacted the emergency services and the trail was searched.
"Sadly, at around 18:30 she was found deceased inside the canyon," the officer said.
"Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Takhar family."
The Foreign Office said: "We can confirm the death of a British national in Phoenix, USA on 7 July.
"We are providing consular assistance to the family at this very difficult time."
