Castlereagh Council has submitted a planning application to replace Dundonald Ice Bowl with a new complex.
The Ice Bowl opened in 1986 and has around 600,000 visitors every year.
Papers lodged with the application state the new building would be a "flagship development", with updated facilities including an "Olympic standard" ice rink.
The demolition of the existing ice bowl would be phased and, when complete, would also include an NHS health and well-being centre.
When it first unveiled its proposal earlier this year, the council predicted the new complex would be finished by 2017.
The cost of the redevelopment has not been finalised.
Planning papers state the ice bowl is "a regional facility of significant importance to Northern Ireland's economy."
