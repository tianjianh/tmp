[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inquest ordered into Paul Chin Ashford care home death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has ordered an inquest into the death of a 47-year-old man at a care home near Ashford, Kent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Chin, from Margate, died after spending 10 months at Woodchurch House care home in November 2015.
His family has been campaigning ever since for an investigation into the circumstances of his death.
The care home's management said it "welcomed the interest" and several professional bodies had "found no evidence of wrongdoing".
In January Mr Chin was admitted to the care home, from the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, to recover from a bedsore.
He died 10 months later, with acute chronic kidney infection being given as the cause of death.
Craig Mackinlay MP, who represents South Thanet, said: "I'm very concerned about what happened with Paul Chin. He went in as an ill man but came out dead."
A pre-inquest review is to be held on 7 December at Canterbury Crown Court.
