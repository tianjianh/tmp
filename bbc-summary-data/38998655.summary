But the 23-year-old will miss the 2017 WSL 1 Spring Series while she finishes her degree in the United States.
Murray, who joined Liverpool from North Carolina in 2015, will return to England for the 2017-18 winter season.
"Satara played a crucial role for us last season," Liverpool Ladies manager Scott Rogers told the club website.
