Lizzie Armitstead drops away at Giro Rosa as Evelyn Steves takes lead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lizzie Armitstead finished almost three minutes behind her Boels-Dolmans team-mate Evelyn Stevens, who took the Giro Rosa lead with victory on stage two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stevens attacked on the final ascent to Montenars after a 111km race to beat Elisa Longo Borghini of Italy and Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma.
The American leads Niewiadoma by two seconds in the overall standings.
Britain's world champion Armitstead trails Stevens by three minutes, three seconds with seven stages remaining.
Molly Weaver finished almost four minutes back while fellow Briton Emma Pooley lost 10 minutes, 40 seconds on the stage.
Monday's flatter 120km third stage from Montagnana to Lendinara is expected to suit the sprinters.
