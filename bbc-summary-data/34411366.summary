The health implications of the diesel scandal

The diesel scandal started as a worry for car owners.

Yet, according to Prof Alistair Lewis, an air pollution expert at the University of York, "it is overwhelmingly a health story".
The costs of not doing more to tackle air pollution can be measured in "thousands of deaths and billions of pounds, all passed on to the taxpayer", he says.
"The real costs here are the ones the taxpayer picks up in terms of providing extra healthcare," he explains.
"The only reason we measure NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and particulates is because they are harmful to health."
The story goes back more than a decade, to government tax breaks for diesel cars.
Many people bought diesel cars believing they were less damaging to the environment.
But the evidence linking NO2 with health effects has grown substantially in recent years, with NO2 blamed for 23,500 deaths a year in the UK, according to official estimates.
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) gases - made up of oxygen and nitrogen - are produced when an engine burns diesel fuel.
The main nitrogen oxide (NOx) in diesel exhaust is nitric oxide (NO), which is converted to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air.
"It is a respiratory irritant which may exacerbate asthma and possibly increase susceptibility to infections," says the Department for the Environment.
According to Frank Kelly, an air pollution expert at King's College London, breathing air of poor quality can have both short and long-term effects.
In the short-term, some will feel a temporary tightness across their chest or an irritation in their throat.
After many decades of exposure, air pollution can lead to the development of a disease such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart disease, he says.
"Because air pollution is an invisible entity, not many people really understand the challenge it is having to their own health or their children's health."
There have been improvements in air quality over the last five decades through the introduction of a range of measures in the UK.
Emissions of nitrogen oxides have fallen by 62% since 1970, but in recent years progress has flattened off.
In 2014 the European commission launched legal proceedings against the UK for regularly exceeding NOx limits in 16 zones from London to Glasgow.
And in April this year, the UK's highest court ruled that the government must take immediate action to cut air pollution.
Prof Lewis says the costs to the NHS of not doing more to tackle NOx are "very substantial".
"The gap between what we've got and what we should have had amounts to the billion pound range in terms of costs to the UK health system," he says.
