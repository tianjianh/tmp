Five stations between Paisley and Port Glasgow have displayed the work of artists who have suffered mental health problems.
The Art Trail by Rail exhibition is part of this year's Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival (SMHAFF).
Over 100,000 passengers will see the displays.
The artwork, which is intended to challenge the stigma around mental health, will be displayed until the end of October. It has been created around the year's chosen theme of "power".
A launch event took place on Friday morning to commemorate World Mental Health Day.
Unsuspecting passengers on the 09:24 train from Paisley Gilmour Street were welcomed by Radio Clyde's Gina McKie, as well as singers, musicians and artists.
Ms McKie was joined by Rockus Community Choir and Paisley drumming group The Buddy Beat.
The musical and artistic moving tour passed through Paisley St James, Bishopton and Langbank, with a final stop at Port Glasgow.
The project was funded in part by anti-stigma programme See Me.
Judith Robertson, the programme's director, said: "We want to end mental health stigma and discrimination.
"The powerful artwork on this trail explores the mental health recovery of the artists themselves. The nature of the pieces challenges discrimination in a very busy public setting."
Heather Collins, manager of 68 ScotRail stations, including those involved in Art Trail, said that last year's two exhibitions at Paisley Gilmour Street were so well received that they added another four stations to make the tour. She said: "We're happy to play our part in supporting such a positive cause."
Jeanette Allan, lead occupational therapist for mental health in Renfrewshire and co-ordinator of the Renfrewshire strand of the festival, said: "Creativity and the arts make a significant contribution to people's mental health recovery and all the artists have actively engaged in exploring the issues of discrimination and empowerment."
