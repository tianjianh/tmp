[SN]TITLE[SN]
York Hospital nurse who watched golf at work suspended

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse at York Hospital who was caught watching golf at work has been suspended for 12 months for misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nigel Steel "breached fundamental principles and standards", a Nursing and Midwifery Council tribunal ruled.
Mr Steel, who worked for York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust for seven years from November 2005, was seen watching the Open championship on a work computer on 21 July 2012.
The tribunal also heard he told a patient to soil himself.
Mr Steel was also said to have failed to record his interactions with that patient and to have failed to have recorded any details of care given to two other patients.
The panel heard evidence Mr Steel had "openly admitted" using the computer to watch the tournament online.
The Nursing and Midwifery Council said the suspension was "appropriate and proportionate" and all the facts were proved in the case.
It said the suspension would cause hardship to Mr Steel but it was in the public interest and was necessary to protect patients.
Mr Steel did not attend the hearing in London.
