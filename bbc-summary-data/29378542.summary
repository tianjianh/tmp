Asterix creator Uderzo ends long dispute with daughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The co-creator of the famous Asterix cartoons, Albert Uderzo, has ended a seven-year legal battle with his daughter amicably, French media report.

The rift began in 2007 when Sylvie Uderzo and her husband Bernard de Choisy were dismissed by Asterix publisher Editions Albert Rene as managers of the Uderzo estate.
Albert Uderzo created the Asterix books with Rene Goscinny, who died in 1977.
Uderzo, 87, and his daughter say they have agreed to drop their lawsuits.
She had opposed his decision to sell his 60% stake in the Asterix publisher in 2008.
Last year, Uderzo sued his daughter and son-in-law for "psychological violence". He accused Mr de Choisy of being behind various legal moves by his daughter against him.
Sylvie Uderzo in turn brought a lawsuit against persons unnamed for abusing her father's "frailty" but the case was thrown out on Friday.
The illustrator and his daughter announced their reconciliation in a joint statement sent to AFP news agency.
"The Uderzo couple and their daughter are again reconciled and are determined to make a clean slate reciprocally, with regard to the reproaches made by both sides," the statement said.
"They wish henceforth to enjoy in full their newly rediscovered happiness."
Contacted by French daily Le Figaro, the Asterix co-creator said he had nothing to add.
More than 352 million copies of the Asterix albums have been sold worldwide and they have been translated into 111 languages.
The latest album, Asterix and the Picts, was published last October in 15 countries and 23 languages by new author Jean-Yves Ferri and illustrator Didier Conrad.
