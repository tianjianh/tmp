Tenby injury unit set to open - years after closure protests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to open a new minor injuries unit in Pembrokeshire have got a step closer - four years after protests against the closure of the previous one.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The minor injuries unit at Tenby Cottage Hospital was closed as part of a shake-up of health services back in 2013 leading to public demonstrations.
Hywel Dda University Health Board hopes the new nurse-led walk-in service will open in July.
The board said the unit would provide "convenient access" for residents.
St John Ambulance Service will provide treatment for minor injuries over the Easter period.
