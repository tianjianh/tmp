The BBC is understood to be considering some changes to strengthen its news output for audiences in Wales.
In his letter, Lord Hall said the consultation would assess "the relevance, reach and quality" of news on network services and in the nations.
The Welsh government and opposition parties have been invited to take part.
Lord Hall said: "As devolution continues we believe that the BBC may need to adapt our services to ensure that they fully reflect and report the increasing divergent policies of the UK, with more aspects of public policy devolved.
"I believe that there is now a much stronger case for providing a different mix of news and current affairs programmes to our audience."
The BBC is understood to be considering a number of changes to strengthen its news output for Welsh audiences, including the potential introduction of Welsh news opt-outs on Radio 1 and 2, and a 'Welsh Six' television programme that would provide Welsh, UK and international news.
Similar proposals were discussed when BBC executives were challenged by AMs about the broadcaster's portrayal of Wales while giving evidence to an assembly committee in November.
Lord Hall has written to organisations in all of the UK nations asking them to contribute to the consultation by the end of January, while the result of the news review will be known in the spring.
The Institute of Welsh Affairs and Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre have also been asked contribute.
