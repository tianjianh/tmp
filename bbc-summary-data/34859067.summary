[SN]TITLE[SN]
Long-awaited HBOS bank report to be published

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A long awaited report co-authored by two regulatory bodies - the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority - is out on Thursday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is hoped the report will shed more light on the reasons behind the demise of HBOS bank.
Yet, how could HBOS, the result of a merger of a traditional building society and a prudent Scottish banking institution, go so wrong so quickly?
The marriage between the Halifax Building Society and The Bank of Scotland was valued at £30bn, but it collapsed just seven years later - with all of that value completely wiped out.
HBOS became part of the Lloyds Banking Group and needed a £20.5bn injection from UK taxpayers to prevent it from crashing.
The three men at the top of the organisation; chairman, Lord Stevenson and two chief executives, James Crosby and Andy Hornby were blamed for the collapse by a group of MPs.
Senior executives said that the bank's failure was due to the markets reaction following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. However, MPs accused the bank of "reckless" lending policies, and in fact by 2008 the gap between loans and deposits was a staggering £213bn.
