17,982
Total number of complaints
3,454 about barking dogs
336 about bird scarers
16 about fireworks
10 about church bells
Ipswich Borough Council received the highest number of complaints over the five years, with 4,568.
Waveney District Council received 3,672 complaints, while Suffolk Coastal District Council had a total of just over 3,000.
Mark Johnson, senior public health officer at St Edmundsbury Borough Council, said the best thing for people to do was to speak with the person making the noise.
"It's the most common sense approach because sometimes they don't even realise they're causing a nuisance to their neighbours," he said.
As for dogs, Candice Rose, owner of Canine Creche in Martlesham, said they could be taught not to bark.
"The key thing is reward and distraction," she said. "We distract them and then reward the good behaviour.
"There are solutions, it could be a behavioural issue, in which case that can be adjusted, but if it's just through boredom - there really is no excuse in this day and age."
