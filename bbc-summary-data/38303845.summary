Spotlight: Investigation into scammers who conned elderly woman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A BBC Spotlight film has triggered an international criminal investigation that has broken up the infrastructure used by scam mail fraudsters.

The investigation was sparked by the story of a 74-year-old widow from Northern Ireland who lost thousands of pounds.
Her plight was first revealed a year ago.
In a follow up exposé BBC Spotlight's Chris Moore follows the money - across Britain, Europe and America.
The pensioner, identified as Elizabeth, told BBC Spotlight how she was scammed out of £180,000 in one year.
Most of that money went on telephone scams, but more than £5,000 went to mail fraudsters.
From the scam letters still coming through her letter box, the BBC Spotlight team identified PO Boxes in Holland that she sent her money to and discovered many belonged to Dutch businessman, Erik Dekker.
After viewing Elizabeth's interview in last year's programme, Dutch tax and fraud investigators began an investigation of Erik Dekker.
In June, armed investigators raided his mail packaging business, Trends Services. Inside, staff were opening envelopes and removing cash and cheques from victims.
An armoured truck came every day to collect the victims' payments.
They also found €500,000 (£418,000) in cash in 60 different currencies inside.
The Dutch investigators shared BBC Spotlight's information about Erik Dekker with the United States Postal Service.
They had long suspected Erik Dekker of handling money on behalf of fraudsters but now they were able to piece together a fuller picture of his involvement in a scam scheme in which $18m a year was being collected at Erik Dekker's office in Utrecht, using the same PO boxes that had been used to con Elizabeth.
BBC Spotlight also examined the cheques that Elizabeth sent to Holland. Using the information on the back of the cheques the team discovered that they were cashed in three high street banks in England.
In one example, 38 of Elizabeth's cheques - all crossed and made payable to 32 different names - were deposited into a single bank account in Chorley.
BBC Spotlight established that the account belonged to a payment processor - a company that provides financial services, mostly for mail order businesses.
Financial experts say that payment processors can be used as a shield from detection by scammers to launder their fraudulently obtained cash.
Spotlight also has discovered that the payment processor that cashed these cheques was part of the PacNet group of companies that the US government has designated a transnational criminal organisation that, it claims, for 20 years has knowingly processed money for a number of different mail fraud schemes in America.
Tuesday's Spotlight investigation is on BBC One NI at 22:45 GMT and available on BBC iPlayer from Wednesday.
