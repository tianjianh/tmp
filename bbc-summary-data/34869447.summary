The much-loved comedy drama ended in 2003 after five series.
The new eight-part series will reunite stars James Nesbitt, Robert Bathurst, Hermione Norris, John Thomson, Fay Ripley and creator Mike Bullen.
The transmission date has not yet been announced.
Starting in 1997, the show followed the ups and downs of three 30-something couples.
It won numerous awards and made household names of the cast.
More than 10 million people tuned into the final episode, which featured the funeral of one of the central characters, Rachel, played by Helen Baxendale.
The new series will rejoin characters Pete and Jenny, David and Karen and widower Adam.
Creator and writer Mike Bullen, said it felt like "the right time to revisit these characters, as they tip-toe through the minefield of middle age".
"They're 50, but still feel 30, apart from on the morning after the night before, when they really feel their age.
"They've still got lots of life to look forward to, though they're not necessarily the years one looks forward to."
ITV has also announced the commissioning of two other series.
The Good Karma Hospital, set in Goa in India, will follow the lives of a team of British and Indian medics and is described as "a feel-good drama".
Filming on the six hour-long episodes will begin next year and casting has yet to be announced.
Also commissioned is Him, by award-winning screenwriter Paula Milne.
The three-part drama is described as a "domestic horror" about a teenage boy, caught between his parents' two new families, who discovers he has supernatural powers.
Described as "bold, surprising and emotional", filming will start in January in suburban London.
