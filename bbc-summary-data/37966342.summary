India v England: First Test drawn as hosts cling on in Rajkot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England gave India a huge scare on the final afternoon before the first Test in Rajkot ended in a draw.

Set 310 from a minimum of 49 overs, India slumped to 71-4 with at least 25 left, but were steadied by Virat Kohli (49 not out) and Ravichandran Ashwin.
Ashwin and Wriddhiman Saha fell in the space of 16 balls, before Ravi Jadeja joined Kohli to take India to 172-6.
Alastair Cook made 130 in the tourists' 260-3 declared, with Haseeb Hameed (82) missing out on a debut century.

The second of the five Tests begins in Visakhapatnam on Thursday.
England, heavy underdogs at the start of the series, will travel east buoyed by this performance. They dictated the terms for most of the Test and, in the end, world number ones India were hanging on.
In making 537, England became the first visiting team to claim a first-innings lead in India for four years, their spinners outbowled India's and Hameed may have ended the long search for an opener to partner Cook.
But Visakhapatnam is likely to offer much more for the slow bowlers, which could favour India and provide England with a sterner challenge.
"England will take confidence from having competed well and they outperformed India," said ex-England batsman Geoffrey Boycott on BBC Test Match Special. "But in five Tests, I'd suspect somewhere the ball will turn earlier, so winning the toss could be very important."
England had India on the run during the final session and may have secured a remarkable victory had they held their chances before tea.
After Gautam Gambhir gloved Chris Woakes to second slip in the second over, left-arm spinner Zafar Ansari dropped a very sharp return chance off Murali Vijay and, in Ansari's next over, Stuart Broad grassed a more straightforward catch low down at point off Cheteshwar Pujara.
Still England pressed. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid, continuing his excellent bowling of the first innings, had Pujara lbw to a ball that pitched outside leg stump - the batsman not opting to review - and, after the break, Vijay inside-edged Rashid to short leg before Moeen Ali found huge turn to bowl Ajinkya Rahane off his pads.
With the pitch starting to play tricks, Rashid and off-break bowler Moeen had the ball spinning, spitting and bouncing, all while England catchers swarmed over the home batsmen.
India, not used to being under this sort of pressure in home conditions, were kept afloat by Kohli and Ashwin's stand of 47.
Just as the visitors began to tire, Ashwin needlessly drove Ansari to cover and the cavalier Saha jammed a catch back to Rashid.
England rushed around to squeeze in extra overs, but were denied by the pugnacious, defiant Kohli and the counter-punching of Jadeja.

We will get the surface we are expecting in the next Test - a bit of a minefield. That was where New Zealand were bundled out for 80 in a one-day international. But I don't think England will go there nearly as fazed as they might have done. Two weeks ago they were bundled out in a session by Bangladesh, here they had India fighting for their lives.

England have outplayed India. The body language of India was pretty poor today, they were just waiting for England's declaration as if they knew that was when the match really started. Only Kohli and Ashwin batted well for them and saved the game.

This is the best Test match Adil Rashid has had for England. He's bowled with more control than I've seen him playing for England, and the English spinners have caused as many problems as the Indian spinners - we weren't expecting that.
Cook began his Test career with a century in India, returned in 2012 with three more and this, his fifth, moved him top of the list of overseas century-makers in this country.
The left-hander resumed on 46 out of England's 114-0 and was much more fluent than the previous day, opening his shoulders in the second hour of the morning session.
With trademark cuts and less-familiar lofted cover drives, Cook brought up his 30th Test ton in a stand of 68 with Ben Stokes, who was promoted to number four.
When the skipper holed out off Ashwin's off-spin, he called time on England's innings.
Hameed, the 19-year-old making his Test debut, was highly impressive in moving to 62 not out on the fourth evening.
His performance on the final morning was less assured, with some uncertainty outside the off stump leading to an edge wide of slip off the bowling of Umesh Yadav.
When England looked to push on, he unselfishly put thoughts of his century to one side and slapped a return catch back to Amit Mishra.
Though he missed out on becoming the first England batsman to score a century before his 20th birthday, he did depart with the highest score made by an England teenager.
England captain Alastair Cook: "We played some good cricket. It was a good toss to win but you still have to score the runs.
"In India, if you get 530 like we did then you're always in the game. I am really proud of the lads, we were relentless with the ball and we didn't let India score quickly. To keep them to 480, I thought we played really well."
On Haseeb Hameed's 82: "It was a brilliant knock - he looked the real deal in the first innings, then to bat in the second innings the way he did, when we only had a lead of 50, was brilliant. I don't want to heap too much praise on him but he looks a good 'un."
Hameed on Sky Sports: "I did enjoy it. I felt more comfortable the more time I spent out there. I just took it as any other game in a way. It is quite surreal how quickly things have happened but I am trying to take it all in my stride and not look too far ahead."
India captain Virat Kohli: "We could have been much better on days one and two. We are never going to take England for granted and it is good to not give away a result at the start of the series."
