Six Nations 2017: Wales need to have 'honest debrief' - Sam Warburton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-captain Sam Warburton says Wales' players will have to be "harsh on each other" in reviewing the 29-13 Six Nations defeat in Scotland.

Wales led 13-6 but ultimately lost to Scotland for the first time since 2007.
Coach Rob Howley conceded his side's title hopes are over and Warburton said there was plenty to ponder.
"We need to have a good, honest debrief of the game, with players putting their hands up when they've made mistakes," he said.
"We need to do that to learn and need to be harsh on each other."

Warburton, replaced by Alun Wyn Jones as captain before the championship, acknowledged Wales were not accurate enough in the second half at Murrayfield.
"Our accuracy in the Scottish 22 let us down on a few occasions," Warburton added.
"There were a couple of moments where we had line-outs or line breaks and didn't get anything."
The Cardiff Blues flanker was diplomatic over the confused incident when Wales ended up kicking to the corner without success, despite captain Jones preferring to take a shot at goal.

"The call was to go to the corner and we backed that," Warburton told BBC Wales Sport.
"When you are within the 15-metres in the 22 it's quite a difficult kick and it's a 50/50 decision whether to go for the posts or the corner.
"It was a bold decision and the right one. We went for a 13-man lineout, which has been successful for us in the past, and if we executed that properly we would have gone over.
"Playing against a good Scottish team we had to get tries, we had to get something more than three points and I back that decision."
Wales are out of contention for the 2017 Six Nations title after taking just one bonus point from defeats against Scotland and England in the last two rounds.
But Warburton, who has led Wales 49 times, insists the team will not be short of motivation when they face an Ireland team still bidding for the title on Friday, 10 March in Cardiff.
"There is no greater motivation than playing at a packed Principality Stadium," he said.
"You can't win a championship losing two games so we know that's gone. For the rest of the campaign we are playing for pride and there are so many Welsh fans that come to Scotland.
"We appreciate that they spend a lot of time and money coming to watch us play so to put in a good performance for them at home is what they deserve from us."
