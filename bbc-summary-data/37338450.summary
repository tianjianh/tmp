The victory in Val di Sole, Italy, completed a perfect season for Atherton, 28, who had already won all seven 2016 World Cup events.
"Racing is just mad, there is nothing else like it. I wish everyone could experience it," Atherton said.
She was three seconds quicker than French runner-up Myriam Nicole.
Atherton recorded a time of four minutes 20.187 seconds to retain her title.
She has now won four World Championships titles and five World Cup crowns.
Hart, 24, - on the back of three successive UCI Mountain Bike World Cup victories - took his second world title after success in 2011 with a run of three minutes 32.484 seconds.
Elliot Heap was Britain's best finisher in the junior men's event in sixth, with 17-year-old Aston Tutt eighth in the junior women's event.
