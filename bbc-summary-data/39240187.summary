[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke defender Glen Johnson is absent with a shoulder problem but Marko Arnautovic should return after missing out in midweek because of illness.

Xherdan Shaqiri is back after a six-match absence, while Wilfried Bony, who was ineligible against Manchester City, is available.
Chelsea will assess a couple of unnamed injury doubts prior to Saturday's game.
Wing-back Victor Moses is expected to be available despite being substituted against Manchester United on Monday.
Steve Bower: "Stoke have won this fixture in two of the last three seasons, but despite frustrating Manchester City last time out, they will have to go to another level against the current league leaders.
"Chelsea's consistency is there to be admired by  everyone. Eighteen wins and just one defeat from the last 21 Premier League games tells its own impressive story.
"Quite simply, they are title-winning statistics. However, Antonio Conte will not allow his team to take their foot off the pedal as he eyes a repeat of Carlo Ancelotti's league and cup double."
"Mark Hughes' team have only lost twice in their last nine league games and will hope that the Chelsea machine isn't quite as well oiled as it has been for the majority of this season."

Stoke manager Mark Hughes on the lack of job security: "We are all trying to develop clubs and players and to do that you need time - and unfortunately a lot of managers aren't getting that.
"This is my fourth season and it's the exception to the rule. It's getting more and more difficult, I would say.
"Sometimes players have a direct line to owners and that can be dangerous. Should you be asking players who are disenfranchised with the manager?
"We have got an ownership here who are very close to the players and will engage and interact with them, but that direct line isn't there and that is correct."
Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte on the potential of one of his squad being named player of the season: "I hope that, at the end of the season, one of my players could be.
"It would mean we've won the league and, for me, it would be a great satisfaction to have one of my players winning this award.
"Until now it's important to be concentrated on the league and try and play game by game, to be focused. They are important but, if you don't win, they are not important."
Stoke showed with their 0-0 draw at Manchester City in their last game that they are capable of digging in against the top teams, but I don't see them holding out against Chelsea.
This is another hurdle for the Blues in their title bid, but I think it is one they will clear comfortably.
