[SN]TITLE[SN]
Libya not another Iraq, Lord Hague tells MPs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK did not repeat the mistakes of the Iraq war with its intervention in Libya, former foreign secretary Lord Hague has said.

It was "different" because there was no lack of planning following the ousting of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011.
"We had plenty of planning but no power to implement the plans," he told the foreign affairs committee.
He said Colonel Gaddafi was to blame for the "sorry state" state of the country now.
"The responsibility for the state of Libya today rests with Colonel Gaddafi - in power for 40 years, with hollowed out institutions and no proper system of government under a tyrannical dictatorship," he told the committee.
"The longer that went on the longer there was going to be an explosion - if he was still there today then next year or the year after there would be the revolution."
He said the UK and its allies had tried to leave Libyans to sort out things out on their own, but should perhaps have taken a "more prescriptive approach".
Libya's new leaders wanted elections "as soon as they could" but should have been persuaded to take longer over the transition to democracy, suggested the former foreign secretary.
The UK led international efforts, with France, to get a UN resolution backing anti- Gaddafi forces and attempted to support the building of a stable democracy after the dictator had been ousted.
But the country rapidly descended into violence and instability, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.
Mr Hague told the MPs: "I think we have to be careful to think it's another Iraq. The problems are different to Iraq. The problem here is not that a lot of people didn't think about the post-conflict at the time.
"It was that, unlike in Iraq, they didn't have the power to implement what was decided, or what was planned, after the conflict."
Mr Hague said there was "some parallel" with Iraq because of the "hostility to Gaddafi era figures" being involved in the new government.
But they did need "some of those people" because "in a country with a small population they were the only people who had run any aspect of government in the previous 40 years".
Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi said she voted against military action in Libya at the time "because I foresaw exactly what would happen".
Ms Qureshi said "we just don't understand the Middle East and we should not be intervening militarily in these countries".
Lord Hague said he respected that viewpoint but "if you think slaughter is about to take place and you have the capability to do something then you should".
