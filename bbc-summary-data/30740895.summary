On Wednesday morning, 12 people were killed in attacks on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris.

Since then millions have taken to social media to have their say on the apparent Islamist attack.
Some wrote messages of solidarity, while others followed breaking news as the hunt for the two gunmen continued in northern France.
Here are some of the popular topics that have emerged as the story has unfolded.
The hashtag expressing solidarity with Charlie Hebdo magazine and its staff - #JeSuisCharlie - was tweeted about 3.4 million times in the first 24 hours following the attack.
The phrase, appearing on placards, the media and across the internet, has become shorthand for support for freedom of speech and a free press.
One victim of Wednesday's shootings was a Muslim policeman Ahmed Merabet, who was shot in the street outside the Charlie Hebdo offices.
Thousands have paid tribute to the 42-year old using #jesuisahmed (I am Ahmed).
The first person to use the hashtag was a French magazine publisher living in Morocco, Julien Casters, who told the BBC: "It is a snub to the stigmatisation of Islam and a reminder that Muslims in France are not all Islamist radicals."
Just as many supported Charlie Hebdo - others saw it as magazine that could be racist or intolerant and pointed to a recent cartoon depicting the Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira, who is a black woman, as a monkey.
Many of these people - and those who were acknowledging that the 12 dead included a Muslim victim - chose to actively not identify with #JeSuisCharlie.
In a similar vein to #jesuischarlie, #NousSommesCharlie (We are Charlie) is being used to show solidarity to those who lost their lives in the shootings.
The phrase is being used worldwide (pictured above in the Dominican Republic) to reflect global support for the idea behind the #jesuischarlie trend with newspapers and magazines using the phrase.
A number of those using this hashtag - which translates to "against terrorists" - also shared a picture with the words: "I am Muslim. Islam is perfect, but I am not. If I make a mistake, blame me but not my religion!"
Despite Islamic leaders in France condemning the shootings, and appeals for calm, there have been reports of retaliatory attacks on French Muslims.
At the time of writing, a manhunt is continuing in France for a third day, with police chasing two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices.
The hashtag, which means tracking, was used by those following the live updates of the massive police operation.
#MarcheRepublicaine (Republican march) has been used to spread awareness for various marches happening across France following Wednesday's attacks.
Major cities including Paris and Lyon have organised marches this weekend.
Stephen Fry has told Newsbeat he will be travelling to the French capital this weekend as a mark of respect.
