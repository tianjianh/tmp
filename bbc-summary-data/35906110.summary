Vote Leave has removed the Carphone Warehouse co-founder, David Ross, and John Caudwell - who started Phones 4U - from the list published on Saturday.
A spokesman said Mr Ross's name was included in error and apologised.
He said Mr Caudwell had supported the campaign in the past, though he had not put himself forward for the list.
The Vote Leave spokesman added: "Mr Caudwell has been listed as a supporter of the campaign since he signed up in October last year.
"He has not told us that he no longer supports us but we have removed him from the list."
Other signatories include former HSBC chief executive Michael Geoghegan, JD Wetherspoon pub boss Tim Martin, hotelier Sir Rocco Forte and Luke Johnson - chairman of continental-style cafe chain Patisserie Valerie.
A referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU will be held on 23 June.
The announcement of business leaders supporting the UK's EU exit came after bosses of 36 of the largest listed companies in Britain signed a letter urging voters to remain in the EU last month.
Vote Leave also announced that its business council would be chaired by John Longworth, who resigned his role as director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) earlier this month.
