Former RAF pilot Andy Hill, 52, was interviewed under caution by police in December, after recovering from critical injuries in the 2015 crash.
The details emerged in papers filed by Sussex Police in its High Court bid to access evidence.
Mr Hill's Hawker Hunter crashed into four pieces, hitting people on the A27.
Sussex Police said: "A 52-year-old man was notified in December he is being investigated for possible endangerment pursuant to Article 138 Air Navigation Order 2009 and also manslaughter by gross negligence."
As part of its inquiry, the force has applied to see material gathered by the Air Accident Investigation Branch including cockpit recorders from the vintage Hawker Hunter and other footage.
Mr Hill was taken to the Royal Sussex County hospital in Brighton after the crash on 22 August and placed in a medically-induced coma. He was later moved to a specialist hospital.
BBC Sussex revealed last December the pilot voluntarily attended an appointment at a police station in Hertfordshire and was not arrested.
Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, said the families of the victims were having to wait too long to get to the truth.
"I am most concerned that it has taken so long to get to this point," he said.
He added the families should not have had to find out about the manslaughter investigation through the media.
"The families need some sort of closure, to find out about this in the press is hugely insensitive and I really feel for them."
Det Ch Insp Paul Rymarz, who is leading the investigation, said it was "completely incorrect" to say the families had only learnt of the information through the media.
"Throughout, we have kept all of the victims' families up-to-date with the progress of the investigation as we seek to provide answers as to what happened on that dreadful day.
"They were advised some months ago of the content of the legal appeal and that the man had been notified in December that he is being investigated for possible endangerment pursuant to Article 138 Air Navigation Order 2009 and also manslaughter by gross negligence," he said.
