Mothers living with cancer fight for time with their children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are hundreds of women in Wales, many of them mothers, living with terminal secondary breast cancer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some have paid large sums for treatment to give them more time with their children.
A chemotherapy drug called Kadcyla (or TDM1) costs Â£90,000 per patient and could give extra years of quality life.
It is not provided on the NHS in Wales, but a meeting will be held next month where recommendations about its future availability will be made.
Ahead of that meeting, cancer patients have spoken about the "frightening" prospect of dying when they know there is a drug which would buy them more time with their families.
While her oncologist recommended she be given it, she says Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) turned her request down.
"In February, my husband, Ian, had an almighty stroke that has left him unable to speak," Mrs Davies said.
"At the moment, we have carers coming to us, but if I die, which is my expected outcome, Ian will have to go into a care home.
"I was hopeful that my personal circumstances would be taken into account. But I was told it wouldn't be cost effective to give me the treatment."
Mrs Davies, who has three daughters aged 25, 19, and 17, described her life going from "a 100mph sales job into a brick wall" in 2011 after she was first diagnosed.
She has since had a double mastectomy but now has advanced secondary breast cancer after it spread to her spine, both lungs, heart and skin, leaving her in "excruciating pain" and struggling to walk.
The mother-of-three said: "Even six months extra is a long time when you are looking death in the eye.
"My children need me, my husband needs me. Who will look after him? When we have research, drugs developed, but can't have them, it is very hard."
The Welsh government said decisions on funding drugs not approved by guidance body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) are made by health boards.
While not commenting on Mrs Davies' case, an ABMU spokeswoman said it has a panel which meets fortnightly to consider requests.
Each, she said, is considered "on its merits, using clinical evidence available".
Nice assesses the cost effectiveness of treatments and how well they work compared with the price manufacturers ask the NHS to pay.
Last April, it offered draft guidance, saying Kadcyla's cost of more than Â£90,000 per patient made it "impossible" for it to recommend.
However, an independent appraisal committee will meet on 29 September to discuss it further.
Currently, it remains unavailable on the NHS in Wales and England, although there is a cancer drug fund over the border.
Mrs Cox, who has children aged 20, 17 and 13, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. It has spread to her liver, bones and blood.
She has not yet applied for Kadcyla but has spent Â£40,000 on chemotherapy and radioactive bead treatment in Wales and Harley Street clinic, London.
She said: "My mum died when I was 16 so I know how horrible it is living without a mum. I will pay anything for my children to have a mum in their life.
"People may scoff and say 'why should we fund a drug which will keep someone alive for an extra three months?' These treatments have kept my disease stable for nearly two years."
But she said she is running out of treatment options funded in Wales.
"Although I am pain-free and symptom-free and carry on my life, I am terrified of the immediate future as the chemo drug box is empty.
"If my tumours are left without poisons to kill or stop them growing it will take three months before I die of liver failure.  I am not ready for that, I have too much life to live."
The former management trainer is part of a trial at Velindre Hospital, Cardiff, with a drug called Pertuzumab. It has kept her cancer stable since October 2013.
But once it stops being effective, Kadcyla would be the "natural next step". However, she is frightened she will not have access to it.
The cancer returned in her sternum in 2006. She said she has been "very lucky", with the NHS-funded drug Herceptin keeping her stable.
"I know so many young ladies, with children, who would give anything for an extra six months to spend with their families," she said.
"There must be many ways of finding more funds."
