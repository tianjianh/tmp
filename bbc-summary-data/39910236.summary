[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rennes 2-3 Monaco

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Champions Monaco wrapped up their Ligue 1 season with a 12th straight league victory to match Paris St-Germain's record of 30 wins in a single season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Monaco won 3-2 at ninth-placed Rennes as Fabinho, Jemerson and Jorge scored.
Marseille pipped Bordeaux to fifth place - and the final Europa League spot - with a 1-0 win against Bastia.
Bastia were relegated to Ligue 2 as a result, while Lorient - who drew 1-1 with Bordeaux - finished third bottom and now face a relegation play-off.
Caen, who were one of four teams still concerned about automatic relegation on Saturday's final day, scored a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw at runners-up PSG to move above Lorient and escape the threat of dropping into the second tier.
These results meant Dijon also preserved their top-flight place with a goalless draw at Toulouse.
Lorient will play Troyes, who finished third in Ligue 2, in a two-legged tie next week. The system was reintroduced this season by the French league bosses after being scrapped in 1993.
At the other end of the table, Monaco's players marked the title success by dying their hair in the club colours - red and white - for their final game at Rennes.
The principality club wrapped up their first Ligue 1 title since 2000 with a 2-0 home win against Saint-Etienne on Wednesday.
