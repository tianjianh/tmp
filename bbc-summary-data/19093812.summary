Helguson, 34, scored nine goals for QPR last season to help the London side narrowly avoid relegation from the Premier League.
The Iceland international striker spent time on loan at Watford during the 2009-10 season, when Cardiff boss Malky Mackay was in charge at Vicarage Road.
Helguson has signed a one-year deal and is Mackay's fifth signing this summer.
The Bluebirds have already signed Joe Lewis,Jordon Mutch,Kim Bo-Kyung and Etien Velikonja during the close season.
