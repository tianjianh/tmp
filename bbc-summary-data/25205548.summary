A celebration by football fans in the US city of Seattle grew so loud on Monday evening it registered as a minor earthquake, a research group has said.

Raucous fans jumped up and down during an early first-quarter touchdown in the game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New Orleans Saints.
The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network detected the vibrations, measuring between a magnitude 1 and 2 earthquake.
The Seahawks won the game at CenturyLink Field 34-7.
Pacific Northwest Seismic Network director John Vidale told CNN his staff recorded five separate seismic events during the game.
It was not the first time fan celebrations shook Seattle. In 2011, the response to another US football touchdown registered at nearby seismic recording stations.
CenturyLink Field, which is open to the air, also set a Guinness World Record for noise in September.
