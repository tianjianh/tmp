Officers believe the vehicles were driven off the farm in Cantsdam Road near Kelty overnight on Friday.
It is being treated as a "high value theft", and police are appealing for any witnesses who saw the vehicles being driven on Friday night or Saturday morning.
The tractor is a blue New Holland T6080 with the registration SP10 EPJ.
The forklift is a red Manito with registration SF09 JWJ.
Det Sgt Kelly McEwan said: "This is a high value theft and we are keen to trace those responsible as soon as possible.
"These vehicles would stand out being driven late at night or in the early hours of the morning.
"We would appeal to anyone who was in the Cantsdam Road area on Friday night or Saturday morning and saw these two vehicles, or anyone acting suspiciously, to get in touch with us immediately."
