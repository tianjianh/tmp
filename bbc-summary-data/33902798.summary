Thirty-five firefighters tackled the blaze on the Melmount Road. They were called to the scene at 05:40 BST on Thursday.
Firefighters rescued 16 sows and 160 piglets from one of the two units destroyed in the blaze.
The cause of the blaze is not yet known.
Hugh McReynolds, one of the joint owners of SM Pigs, said he and his staff are devastated.
"I have to give credit to my staff though and the Fire Service for their quick response," he said.
"It was terrible and devastating for the staff to see this.
"This is a setback for us."
Max Joyce, a group commander with the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service, said six appliances were sent to the scene.
"When we arrived we found two of the houses with pigs inside alight. We managed to save five of the houses," he said.
"This is a very serious incident but crews reacted quickly."
Animal rights organisation Peta said the rescued pigs should be sent to a sanctuary after the "frightening" experience.
"Pigs are highly sensitive and intelligent animals, and they would have been fully aware of the danger," Peta UK director Mimi Bekhechi said.
