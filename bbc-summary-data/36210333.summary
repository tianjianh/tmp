Cate Blanchett in spoof tourist brochure for Orkney's 'Mama Westray'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mystery surrounds a spoof tourist brochure for a non-existent island which has appeared at a number of sites around Orkney.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The colour brochure is professionally produced and looks like a genuine guide to one of Orkney's North Isles.
But it features attractions that aren't there, on an island called Mama Westray that doesn't even exist.
It says actress Cate Blanchett is a regular visitor and keeps a pedal car in the garage airport.
Attractions include fish-eating pigs, The Tropical Gardens of Nether Biggings and "the world-famous Tomb of the Haddock".
Other "must-see" sites and attractions are said to be the Hall of McFlummery and an annual Ratsmack event.
There is concern among some locals on the real island of Papa Westray that the brochure could cause some confusion with existing promotional material.
