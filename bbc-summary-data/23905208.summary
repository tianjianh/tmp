Hastings skate park extension opens for Boyley Jam

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £61,000 extension to a skate park has been completed in time for an event held in memory of a local BMX rider.

Richard Ball, who was known as Boyley, died in a motorcycle accident in May 2002, aged 24, and the Boyley Skate Park in Hastings, East Sussex, is named after him.
This year's BMX event at the skate park will make use of the newly-opened street section.
Sunday's Boyley Jam event includes competitions and demonstrations.
The skate park in White Rock Gardens, reopened in August 2010, replaced an existing facility Mr Ball had helped to design.
The Boyley Trust Fund, set up after the rider's death, donated £15,000 towards the cost.
The park cost £165,000, with £100,000 coming from Hastings Borough Council and £50,000 from the government's Play Pathfinder scheme.
Councillor Emily Westley from Hastings Borough Council said: "The park was already a popular well-used facility for our local BMXers and skaters but now, with this extension so much more is on offer.
"This new street section is suitable for all levels of ability which is something asked for within the extensive consultation we carried out."
