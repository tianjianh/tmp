The 22-year-old joined Albion on a free in May 2014 and made 34 appearances.
Taft spent four months on loan at League Two side Cambridge United last season, before a tear to his anterior cruciate ligament ended his season prematurely in October 2015.
"After missing a lot of football last year for six months, I have to work even harder now and want to impress here," he told the club website.
