Reflections was founded by survivors of childhood abuse who want provide support to other victims.
Chairman Phil Lafferty said he has already started a petition calling for tougher sentencing for paedophiles.
Mr Lafferty said he hopes to meet with Justice Minister Michael Gove to discuss child abuse sentencing.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who spoke at the launch of the group, said she supported the organisation's campaign on behalf of sexual abuse victims.
"We are survivors not professionals, we are trying to make a difference," Mr Lafferty said on the Reflections website.
"Reflections aims for survivors to unite and work together - we all need to pull together.
"By having meetings in regional areas and growing across Britain, we hope to become a central force for good in tackling the abuse that has happened to many of us."
