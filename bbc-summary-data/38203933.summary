[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neighbours in Vale of Glamorgan are taking festive cheer to a new level by creating a "living" advent calendar.

Every night between December 1 to 24 a different resident of Arcot Street, Penarth, will light up their Christmas-themed window display.
Rosslyn Offord came up with the idea as a way of uniting the community and getting to know new people.
Her husband's blog documenting the project has attracted views from 90 different countries in just five days.
After hearing about a living advent calendar in the Yorkshire town of Saltaire, Ms Offord, 42, decided she could use the idea to do something nice for her community.
She later enlisted the help of her son, Osian, nine, who set about making leaflets to encourage neighbours to take part.
"In the past year, the country has been a bit divided, people in groups, not mixing and we thought, 'what's something nice that we could do together to get us talking to people in the street?'" she said.
"Christmas is a time when you think about peace and hope and we thought his could be an idea people might like and it's a way of talking to people you wouldn't normally talk to. Especially since Brexit."
The duo signed up their last participant a few weeks ago and have received positive feedback from local people and those further afield.
"People have been really enthusiastic, obviously not everyone can do it but even people that haven't have said it's a lovely idea and quite a few people have even thanked me for it."
Ms Offord's husband, Nick Beynon, 43, set up his blog to document the project and display pictures of the windows, which has had more than 1,200 views since Tuesday from countries including Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Australia.
"We are just amazed because we only put it [the blog information] through the doors of the people in the street so how are there 1,200 visitors from all over the world?" Ms Offord added.
Those who are taking part in the advent calendar have been asked to keep their lights on until 24 December.
