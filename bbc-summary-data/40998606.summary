The Ferwafa president Vincent Nzamwita insists the country is capable of hosting a tournament of such a stature.
"We have already submitted a formal request to Fifa to host the event and they have registered us and sent bid documents," Nazamwita told BBC Sport.
"We have a dateline of 25 August to send the terms and agreement to Fifa and later start preparing the bid."
Nzamwita said hosting a tournament like the World Cup will raise the profile of not only Rwanda but the region and continent as well.
Last year Rwanda hosted a successful Africa Nations Championship (CHAN) which saw a over 200,000 people travel to the country from across the African continent to cheer their teams.
The 2017 edition of the Under-17 World Cup kicks off in India on 6 October and will feature 24 nations, with Africa represented by Ghana, Guinea, Mali and Niger.
