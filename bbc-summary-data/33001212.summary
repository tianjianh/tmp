[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ed Burnett, 43, designed Gloriana for a huge parade up the Thames during the jubilee celebrations in 2012.
Police said he was found dead at his home in Totnes, Devon on 26 May and there were no suspicious circumstances.
Tributes have been paid by colleagues and friends to the "fiercely intelligent and astonishing" man.
A pageant of more than 1,000 boats involving some 20,000 people sailed down the Thames on 3 June 2012 to mark the Queen's 60 years on the throne.
Mr Burnett was also one of the rowers on board the 94ft (28.6m) barge as it led the Queen and Prince Philip up the Thames.
Mr Burnett ran a yacht design business in Totnes and had been a member of the local rowing club for several years.
Former club chairman Peter Rouse said: "He was an enormously accomplished naval architect, one of the leading timber boat architects in the world.
"He contributed to and improved every area of the club; he was really capable and talented and it's a tremendous loss.
"Everyone who knew him is absolutely devastated."
Damian Byrne, project manager for building Gloriana, paid tribute to Mr Burnett, saying: "There are notable naval architects practising today who declare an understanding for classic shapes, but few have shown the understanding of the subtleties of form that deliver a classic timeless vessel."
Mr Burnett's death has been referred to the coroner.
