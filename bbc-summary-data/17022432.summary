Brazil seeks more access to China to balance trade

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brazil has asked China to allow more of its manufactured goods in to the Chinese market as it seeks to tap into the country's growing economy.

The call comes as Brazil's trade surplus with China has been rising, hitting $11.5bn (Â£7bn) last year.
Brazil has also asked China to reduce its exports amid concerns that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods was hurting its manufacturing sector.
China is Brazil's biggest trading partner.
These issues were discussed during Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan's visit to Brasilia.
Brazil's exports to China are currently dominated by commodities and natural resources such as iron ore.
However, the country's manufacturers are now looking to increase their shipments to China in a bid to take a share of one of the fastest growing economies and consumer markets in the world.
Earlier this year, Brazilian plane maker Embraer appointed actor Jackie Chan as its brand ambassador in a bid to boost sales of private jets in the Chinese market.
The firm has already received orders from one of China's leading aircraft leasing firms for 13 new jets.
"We are discussing some issues of concern to Brazilian industry, such as Brazilian exports of manufactured goods to China," Brazilian Vice President Michel Temer was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.
Mr Temer said he had also asked Beijing for a "voluntary" reduction of Chinese exports to Brazil amid fears of their impact on the local manufacturing industry.
