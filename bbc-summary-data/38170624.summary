[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who told a pupil he thought he loved her "more than any other woman" has been banned from the profession.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Cassidy, 47, worked at the independent Princess Helena College, Hitchin, when he breached "professional boundaries" with an 18-year-old pupil.
In 2015, he hugged the pupil, tried to kiss her and invited her to his home.
The National College for Teaching and Leadership heard he admitted bringing the profession into disrepute.

A conduct panel heard how in May 2015, Mr Cassidy exchanged telephone numbers with the pupil after learning she was upset.
He admitted sending her a message telling the girl he was "there for her".
Later, after a maths lesson at the girls' school, Mr Cassidy admitted hugging the pupil and kissing her on the forehead and on a separate occasion tried to kiss her.
The panel found he had spoken to her "inappropriately" by telling her he thought a lot about her, that he "really, really" liked her and telling her 'I think I love you more than any other woman', or words to that effect.
He also admitted failing to take appropriate action when he was aware she had taken an "excessive amount" of painkillers.
Mr Cassidy resigned from the Hertfordshire college in June 2015 and is understood to have decided to leave the teaching profession.
