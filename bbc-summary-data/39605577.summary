[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 0-2 Bolton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers took another step towards automatic promotion to the Championship with victory at 10-man Port Vale in a game marred by crowd trouble.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Wheater and Gary Madine secured all three points for the Trotters, whose fans brought play to a halt with a pitch invasion following the first goal.
The home side had Riginio Cicilia sent off after 33 minutes when he was shown a second yellow card for handball following a foul on Madine eight minutes earlier.
Wanderers took the lead after 66 minutes when Wheater rose highest to nod in Filipe Morais' free-kick.
In the aftermath, referee Carl Boyeson took the players off the pitch for 10 minutes after clashes broke out between both sets of fans.
Madine then doubled the visitors' advantage, sliding home from Morais' pass in the 80th minute, but Wanderers' celebrations were put on hold after Fleetwood's late win at Gillingham.
