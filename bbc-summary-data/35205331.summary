Trapped couple speak of flood terror

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An elderly couple "would have gone" when their car was trapped by floodwater without the quick thinking of a passing delivery driver.

Water rose to the necks of Joanne Pool and partner Ralph Land as they were stuck in their car in Sparkwell, Devon.
Delivery driver Gary Brewer smashed the car window with a rock and dragged the couple to safety.
Mrs Pool told the BBC she and Mr Land would not have survived had Mr Brewer not been there.
She said: "We'd have gone - he was marvellous. I had to get my head under the water to get out of the car."
Mr Brewer called emergency services when he first saw the car in trouble but it took 22 minutes for a fire crew to arrive as other roads in the area were blocked.
The flash flood on Wednesday morning was one of many across the UK.
Mr Land said: "I climbed over the back seat and he had managed to get the boot open. I was almost underwater and started swallowing.
"If somebody hadn't turned up we would have been in real danger."
PC Steve Dykes from Devon and Cornwall Police said they "could have been looking at a tragedy" within a few more minutes.
