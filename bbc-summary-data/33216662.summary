Reggie Young was attacked at a house in Falkland Road, Sunderland, early on Saturday, and died in hospital.
Police said a small terrier-type dog removed from the house was in secure kennels and was likely to be destroyed.
Flowers and cuddly toys have been left outside the semi-detached house, along with messages of support.
One tribute said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with you at this tragic time.
"Shine like a bright diamond little one. Beautiful boy gone too soon."
