Hillsborough Inquests: Victim's 'possible signs of life' during CPR

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Liverpool fan who tried to save one of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster thought he saw his eyes "flicker" while trying to resuscitate him, the inquests have been told.

Ian Edwards said it was possible Ian Glover, 20, had some signs of life as he was being given CPR on the gymnasium floor following the 1989 terrace crush.
He agreed it was difficult to find medical assistance at the time.
The inquests also heard about the final movements of Christopher Edwards, 29.
Ninety-six fans were fatally injured during the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final held in Sheffield on 15 April 1989.
Mr Glover, from Walton in Liverpool, went to the match with his brother Joseph and two other friends, the court heard.
In a witness statement given in 1989, Joseph - who died 10 years later - described how he and his brother were thrown forward by a crowd surge on the Leppings Lane terrace.
He managed to escape through a gate in the perimeter fence, but could only watch from the other side as his brother's face turned blue.
In the statement, he said: "While I was shouting, his voice was getting quieter and quieter."
When his body was brought on to the pitch, Joseph said he tried giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Ian Edwards, a Liverpool supporter who had been in the North Stand, told the court he helped to carry Mr Glover on a makeshift stretcher across the pitch to a nearby gymnasium where casualties had been taken.
He carried out CPR with the help of a police officer.
For the coroner, Christina Lambert QC asked him whether there was any change in Mr Glover's condition.
He replied: "Momentarily I thought there was a flicker of the eyes, but I wasn't a 100% sure.
"I don't know whether that was because I was kneeling over and it was just so quick. We continued to give breaths and compressions but there were no signs of life."
Mr Edwards told the court at that point he realised Mr Glover was dead.
The jury also heard about Christopher Edwards, from South Wirral, who travelled to the game with a friend, Malcolm Ramsey, and his son.
The court was shown video footage of fans and police trying to carry Mr Edwards out of pen three on the Leppings Lane terrace at 15:27 BST - more than 20 minutes after the game had been stopped.
Former police sergeant Martin Hemingway, who was treating another victim in the central pens, said his attention was attracted to Mr Edwards when he heard someone shout: "He's alive!"
Mr Hemingway said he thought Mr Edwards was still breathing at that point.
He said he did not fully assess his condition because he wanted to get him out of the terrace as soon as possible.
When they reached the pitch, he said there were no signs of life.
Mr Edwards was pronounced dead by a doctor in the gymnasium at 15:50.
The inquests, sitting in Warrington, Cheshire, are due to resume on Wednesday.
