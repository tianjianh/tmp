Hill, 18, scored 15/16 in the skeet final to beat Thailand's Sutiya Jiewchaloemmit.
Scott, 30, triumphed in the double trap, shooting 27/30 to beat Qiang Pan of China.
"To come away with a gold is an amazing end to the year and I couldn't have asked for a lot more," said Hill, who won gold at the European Games in June.
