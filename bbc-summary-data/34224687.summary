About 6,000 youngsters took part in the Mini and Junior Great North Run, with a Great North 5k (3.1 miles) also staged.
Elite athletes were in attendance for the Great North City Games, although long jump world champion Greg Rutherford withdrew through injury.
A crowd of 25,000 was expected by organisers.
Taking part in the Great North City Games was 200m world champion Dafne Schippers, who raced to victory on a 100m track constructed on the banks of the Tyne.
Rutherford and 5,000m and 10,000m world champion Mo Farah took part in a penalty shoot-out at a launch event at Newcastle United's St James's Park stadium on Friday.
The Great North Run half marathon will be staged on Sunday with more than 50,000 people taking on the 13.1 mile course from Newcastle to South Shields.
It will be the 35th staging of the event, which began as a fun run in 1981.
Farah is aiming for his second consecutive victory in the men's elite race, which gets under way at 10:40 BST.
