[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The assault happened near Grosvenor Casino in Basingstoke Road between about 01:00 and 03:30 GMT on Saturday 19 December.
The 33-year-old victim and his two friends were attacked in a car park by a group of men they spoke to inside.
Thames Valley Police has issued a CCTV image of a man they want to question about the assault.
A spokesman said the two groups of men first had contact on the casino's smoking terrace.
During the attack, the victim was knocked to the floor and kicked in the head, sustaining a serious injury to one of his eyes and has subsequently lost his vision.
He was treated at the Royal Berkshire Hospital but has since been discharged.
The police spokesman said on 22 December four men were arrested on suspicion of inflicting grievous bodily harm.
They are a 41-year-old man from Earley, a 28-year-old man from Shinfield, a 26-year-old man from Caversham, and a 25-year-old man from Caversham.
All the men have been released on police bail until 2 April.
