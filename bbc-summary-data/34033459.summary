The accident happened about five miles north of Luss at about 11:05.
Police said the black Honda motorbike was travelling north when it was involved in a collision with a Range Rover and a Vauxhaull Mokka.
The road was fully closed for about six hours and police have appealed for anyone with information about the crash to contact them.
Sgt Archie McGuire said: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank motorists caught up in the delays for their patience.
"I would appeal to anyone who saw a black Honda motorcycle travelling north along the A82 or witnessed the collision to contact police immediately.
"In particular, I would like to speak to the driver of a black 4x4 vehicle, possibly a Ford pickup truck, who was heading southbound on the road and may have witnessed the incident."
