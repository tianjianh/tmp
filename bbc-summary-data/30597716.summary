Six months of roadworks which led to long delays for motorists in Oxford have been completed.

Work on the A423 Southern Bypass to create a "hamburger" style roundabout at Kennington began in June.
During the ??7m scheme, a contraflow system reduced the bypass to one lane between Hinksey Hill and Heyford Hill interchanges.
The roundabout is designed to increase capacity by up to 30%, Oxfordshire County Council said.
In July, motorists were warned by Oxfordshire County Council to use alternative forms of transport because of delays of up to three hours.
The work has included the refurbishment of four bridges and a new subway for pedestrians and cyclists.
Councillor David Nimmo Smith, cabinet member for transport, said: "The improved access through this key route into and around Oxford means that public transport services will also be quicker and more reliable, and I would encourage people to use these services."
