England's Chris Wood and Andy Sullivan moved into a tie for fourth but dropped five shots behind leaders Denmark after the World Cup of Golf second round.

The pair were in joint fifth, two off the front, heading into Friday's fourballs, when Danes Soren Kjeldsen and Thorbjorn Olesen shot 12 under par.
Wood and Sullivan moved to seven under with a six-under-par 66 in Melbourne.
Scotland's Russell Knox and Duncan Stewart climbed off the bottom of the leaderboard with a seven-under-par 65.
That leaves them three shots behind Ireland's Shane Lowry and Graeme McDowell on three under and a further stroke behind Wales duo Bradley Dredge and Stuart Manley.
But it was Denmark who produced a sensational round of 60 that included eight birdies and two eagles to leap to the top of the leaderboard.
"This is my kind of golf," said Kjeldsen. "You don't just get up and whack it as hard as you can. You have to think your way around."
The format returns to foursomes on Saturday, where players hit the same ball taking alternate shots.
