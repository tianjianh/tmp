Jay O'Shea's placed shot put the visitors ahead, but Ian Henderson levelled with a diving header.
Lee Novak restored the Spireites' lead from Dan Gardner's pass and Sylvan Ebanks-Blake then fired in the third.
Rhys Bennett nodded in to give Dale hope after Ariyibi was sent off for a second act of simulation, but the hosts were unable to find an equaliser.
Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester:

"As much as I was disappointed with the performance in the first half, the scoreline was retrievable.
"In the second half I thought we started superbly well, we got the equaliser and then we just made silly mistakes in quick succession which led to a 3-1 deficit and it was just too much of a mountain to climb.
"But I still believe in the players, I still believe in what we're trying to do and it was an entertaining game."
