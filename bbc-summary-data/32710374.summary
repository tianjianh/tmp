Real Madrid: Gareth Bale's agent talks too much - Carlo Ancelotti

Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has told Gareth Bale's agent to "stay quiet" after he suggested the forward's team-mates did not pass to him enough.

Jonathan Barnett claimed the 25-year-old Welshman is suffering because of a lack of help from other Real players.
"This is a world in which a lot of people talk and sometimes they talk too much," said Ancelotti.
"Bale has never had problems with his team-mates and his team-mates have never had problems with Bale."
Bale is the world's most expensive player after being signed in a Â£85.3m deal from Premier League side Tottenham in September 2013.
The ex-Southampton trainee scored 24 goals in 46 games during his debut season, helping Madrid win the Champions League and Copa del Rey.
But he has been jeered by some supporters this season and has faced heavy criticism from sections of the Spanish press.
Bale, who has scored 15 goals in 44 matches this season, also came under scrutiny for his display in last week's Champions League semi-final defeat at Juventus.
"Bale's agent, who has never been to one of our training sessions, who doesn't know the atmosphere we have, spoke from outside," added Ancelotti, before Wednesday's return leg where Madrid are aiming to overturn a 2-1 deficit.
"It would have been better to stay quiet. We are happy with Bale's season."
