The 35-year-old Wales prop will remain with the Blues until 2018 and has not ruled out the prospect of another tour with the British and Irish Lions.
He said the physical demands were increasing before his 17th season as a professional, but said his appetite for the game remained.
"I've still got ambition and I don't fancy finishing yet," said Jenkins.
"I've still got the hunger to play at a level above the Blues as well so that is what keeps me going.
"Obviously you've got to be playing well at regional level and with Wales to be selected for something like [the Lions].
"Even if it wasn't the Lions I try to take one campaign at a time nowadays . There's so many games ahead, I don't really look that far ahead."
Jenkins, who has a record 126 caps for Wales, has played five times for the Lions, although he missed the series win in Australia in 2013 because of injury.
And Jenkins, who was recently  named Blues skipper for the season, said head coach Danny Wilson helped make the decision to extend his contract at the region an easy one.
"It's tough, it's tougher than it ever has been. It's more physical and the training is harder," added Jenkins.
"But I've enjoyed the last 18 months here since Danny took over.  My body is feeling good so I'm delighted to put an extension down for another year.
"It's been going pretty well so far this season, there's a good environment, the boys are happy and I'm looking forward to carrying on this year and into the next."
