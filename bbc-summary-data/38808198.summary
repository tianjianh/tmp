Nottingham bus fire 'probably caused by electric fault'

A huge fire that ripped through a bus and melted nearby traffic lights was probably caused by an electrical fault, investigators have said.

About 20 passengers were evacuated from the bus moments before it went up in flames in Clifton, Nottingham, in May.
Nottingham City Transport (NCT) said evidence that would have revealed the cause was destroyed in the blaze.
But it concluded an electrical fault was the most likely trigger and said it had been "extra vigilant" as a result.
The driver was credited with potentially saving the lives of the passengers when he ordered them off before the fire took hold.
The blaze saw residents and pedestrians flee the scene. Witnesses reported hearing a "massive bang", but NCT said the bang was caused by a tyre exploding.
An NCT spokesman said: "The investigation into last year's bus fire was inconclusive as the fire damage was so extensive, it destroyed evidence that would give a definitive outcome.
"However, we suspect it may have been an electrical fault and we have been extra vigilant on all of our buses when they come in for their monthly service."
