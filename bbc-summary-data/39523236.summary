[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 0-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ivan Toney scored his 11th goal of the season to secure a vital three points for League One play-off chasing Scunthorpe at MK Dons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron's win was even more crucial given both sixth-placed Millwall and seventh-placed Southend won emphatically, but Gary Alexander's fifth-placed side maintained their four-point cushion over the Shrimpers.
The Dons started brightly and were the first to test either keeper as Stuart O'Keefe's speculative cross from the right found Ed Upson with space inside the box, before the midfielder's powerful volley forced a save.
But Alexander's side responded in emphatic fashion and took the lead 15 minutes from the break. Toney rose above the MK defence from Josh Morris' corner to guide a powerful downward header past  goalkeeper Lee Nicholls for his third goal in four games.
And despite Robbie Neilson's second-half substitutes for MK putting pressure on the Scunthorpe back four, the Iron held out for a valuable three points.
