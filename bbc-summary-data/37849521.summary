Two health boards share £68m extra after overspending

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than £68m is being added to the NHS budget to cover overspends by two local health boards (LHBs), Finance Minister Mark Drakeford has announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cash will plug gaps at Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales and Hywel Dda in west Wales, both expected to go over budget in the 2016-17 financial year.
The £68.4m will come from Welsh Government reserves.
Health board budgets are now planned on three-year cycles, after criticism of frequent bail-outs of LHBs in the red.
In the 2015-16 financial year Hywel Dda overspent by £31.2m and Betsi Cadwaladr by £19.5m.
