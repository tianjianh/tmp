Birmingham's Al-Hijrah school head teacher sacked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head teacher of a failing Birmingham school has been sacked after protesting parents prevented a new management team from taking over.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Al-Hijrah School, in Bordesley Green, was placed in special measures by Ofsted last year and an Interim Executive Board was appointed.
Interim head Anita Baptist's contract had been terminated, the council said.
On Monday, more than two dozen parents protested outside the school over the board's involvement.
The school is not among 21 currently being investigated over the alleged "Trojan Horse" plot.
Birmingham City Council said it had tried three times to replace the governors, since approval was given by Education Secretary Michael Gove on 16 May, but each time had been turned away.
Members of the IEB are expected to make another attempt to enter the school on Monday.
Their duties are expected to include management of the budget, curriculum, staffing, pay and performance, and the appointment of the head teacher and deputy head teacher.
Some parents protesting outside said they would not prevent members of the new board entering, but would "ask them questions" .
Last week, former governors were banned from the site and there have also been allegations that the school's budget was "mismanaged" amid claims of a Â£889,000 deficit.
The former chair of governors Waseem Yaqub said the deficit was as a result of Birmingham City Council's "financial mismanagement".
Mother-of-four Rabia Uddin, one of those protesting on Monday, described Ms Baptist's sacking as "a disgrace".
Ms Baptist was appointed in the wake of the last Ofsted report, published in February.
It rated leadership at the school, teaching standards, pupils' attainment, behaviour and safety, all as inadequate.
Since then, an Ofsted monitoring inspection said governance at Al-Hijrah remained inadequate and highlighted failures by the governors in handling the budget.
