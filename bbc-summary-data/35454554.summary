Officers forced entry to The Lectern in Pelham Terrace, Lewes Road, which had 30 people inside.
Two people received hospital treatment for injuries thought to have been caused at the squat. Several had injuries but refused medical treatment.
Five of the occupants were arrested on suspicion of abstracting electricity.
They included one man who was found hiding in the building after a police search.
Four men aged 25, 21, 27 and 42 and one women aged 21 are in custody.
A Sussex Police spokesman said at the height of the raid, at 10:28 GMT, 20 officers were at the scene.
Officers had been called to reports of three separate incidents of violence overnight on Saturday but no-one from the squat would give any information.
Chief Insp Katy Woolford said the building was in a state of squalor.
"The internal fabric had been smashed, graffiti was sprayed on most walls and fixtures inside were destroyed," she said.
"We have made arrangements for the building to be secured to stop re-entry and to prevent any further disruption to the local community."
Power tools believed to have been stolen from vans in the Brighton are were found during the police search.
Anyone who believes the tools may be theirs is asked to contact Sussex Police.
