His family praised his "tremendous" courage in fighting the disease.
In the statement, they said: "He has taken each day as it came and dealt with everything that has been thrown at him."
The family said they will "miss him everyday" and thanked all his well-wishers for their support over the past month.
"People's love for him, the beautiful words and unbelievable kindness that we have witnessed is beyond words and will not be forgotten," it read.
