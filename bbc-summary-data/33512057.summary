MK Dons have revealed plans to build a training facility with 20 football pitches in Northamptonshire.

The club said it had recently bought land for a club and community training centre to the north of Milton Keynes at Cosgrove.
It would include four first-team, 11 academy, three community and two 3G artificial pitches.
Pete Winkelman, club chairman, said: "It's been a long missing component of the development of the club."
The facility would also mean building a new access road linking it to the A508.
Mr Winkelman said: "This is the start of a long journey to develop an international standard club and community training centre and, as part of that, we will be looking to build partnerships and relationships.
"Although it's still early days, we are extremely excited about the project."
The plan will be submitted to South Northamptonshire Council at a later date.
