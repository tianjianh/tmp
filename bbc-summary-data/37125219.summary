The claims relate to alleged use of European parliamentary funds for party political purposes, such as election campaigning.
The matter has been referred to North Wales Police after being reviewed by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau.
Police have not contacted Mr Gill. He said he was not aware of the claims and would not comment at this stage.
A UKIP spokesman said: "These allegations are news to both UKIP and Mr Gill.
"He has not been spoken to by the police. It is impossible to make any comment when no facts are known."
UKIP's assembly group leader Neil Hamilton said: "We cannot know at this stage whether there is any truth in these allegations.
"The easiest way for Nathan Gill to put an end to speculation is for him to publish all details of his MEP emoluments and expenses claims since May 2014, together with full supporting documentation.
"All AMs' expenses claims are published in full when they are made. This is taxpayers' money. We have a right to know how it is spent."
A spokesman for North Wales Police said: "North Wales Police confirm they have recently received (11/8/2016) correspondence from Action Fraud [the UK's national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre] concerning allegations of fraud against an Anglesey man.
"That matter is now under investigation and therefore at this stage we are unable to add anything further."
A spokeswoman for City of London Police said: "Action Fraud received a complaint on 15 July 2016.
"The matter was reviewed by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau and referred to North Wales Police on 11 August 2016."
