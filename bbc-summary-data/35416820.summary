Lancashire County Cricket Club bowls into Twitter complaint mix-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who tried to contact her local authority about blocked drains accidentally sent the complaint to Lancashire County Cricket Club (LCCC).

A Twitter mix-up resulted in Kellie Hughes, 42, from Whalley, failing to reach Lancashire County Council (LCC).
Ms Hughes instead tweeted photos of her drains to LCCC, along with an angry message saying: "This is a disgrace!"
The defending Twenty20 champions then jokingly promised to send some of their players to help clean up the mess.
Ms Hughes posted her amusement at her Twitter faux-pas, together with the club's tongue-in-cheek response.
"I'm new to Twitter and I was trying to tell the council about what's been happening - but I got the cricket club instead," she explained.
"I said we must've done something wrong as we had cricketers messaging us."
The handle of the council's Twitter account, @LancashireCC, appears to be very similar to the cricket club's, which is @LancsCCC.
A spokesman for the cricket club said: "While the lady has our every sympathy, I'm afraid we were just being light-hearted with our tweet.
"We hope she gets the problem sorted out soon."
A spokesman for Lancashire County Council said an engineer "has been out today" to make sure the drains on King Street are clear.
