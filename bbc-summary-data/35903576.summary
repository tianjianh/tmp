The 25-year-old victim was said to be distraught following the attack, which took place between midnight and 01:00 on Saturday 12 March.
Police said she had been been walking on Haugh Street, Bainsford, before she was assaulted by two men on waste ground near an area known as Coo Park.
Officers in Forth Valley are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
One man is described as being between 25 and 35 years old. He was over 6ft tall and had a muscular build.
The suspect had a Scottish accent, which was not local, and he was wearing a long-sleeved tight-fitting top, and trousers.
The second man was also over 6ft and of a similar age, with a slim build.
Det Insp Allyson Blair, of Larbert Police Station, said: "This woman is obviously extremely upset and distraught following this attack.
"Inquiries utilising both specialist and local resources have been ongoing since the incident was reported, and now we're asking members of the public for their help.
"We're urging anyone who remembers seeing two men acting suspiciously around that time, or who recognises their descriptions, to speak to police."
