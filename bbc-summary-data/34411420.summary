[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Beano' domain name to be handed to DC Thomson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The publishers of the world-famous comic strip Dennis the Menace have taken control of a "Beano" website from a Norfolk businessman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dundee-based DC Thomson and Company Ltd, which first published The Beano nearly 80 years ago, took action against Stephen Fisher from Ellingham.
The domain name "thebeano.co.uk" had been registered in Mr Fisher's name.
But internet watchdog Nominet said it was an "abusive registration" and ruled he hand it over to the publishers.
DC Thomson, which describes itself as "one of the leading media organisations in the UK", has many household name titles including well-known comic The Dandy and a Scottish newspaper empire.
The Beano features Dennis and his dog Gnasher, the Bash Street Kids and Billy Whizz, and back in the 1950s, had a peak circulation of more than 1.9 million.
DC Thomson convinced Nominet Mr Fisher should hand over the domain name.
Nominet expert Peter Davies said the company had rights in the Beano name and it had, "to his reasonable satisfaction", shown the domain name was an "abusive registration".
Mr Davies directed the domain name must be transferred to DC Thomson.
