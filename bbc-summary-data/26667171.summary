Police in Northern Ireland have been given more time to question a veteran republican arrested in connection with the murder of Jean McConville.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mother-of-ten was taken by the IRA from her flat in December 1972.
Ivor Bell, 77, was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the case. The police have been given until Friday night to continue questioning him.
Mr Bell was part of an IRA delegation that held secret talks with the British government in London in 1972.
Among the delegation at those talks were Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness.
Jean McConville, 37, became known as one of the Disappeared.
She was held at one or more houses before being shot.
Her body was recovered on a beach in County Louth in August 2003.
The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles.
The IRA admitted in 1999 that it murdered and buried at secret locations nine of the Disappeared.
The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains was established in 1999 by a treaty between the British and Irish governments.
It lists 16 people as "disappeared". Despite extensive searches, the remains of seven of them have not been found.
