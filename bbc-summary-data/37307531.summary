Newport County may seek help from Glamorgan cricket club as they look to overcome their Rodney Parade pitch problems.

The club are hoping to obtain a cricket-style ''super-sopper'' after Saturday's home game with Barnet was abandoned at half-time because of a water-logged pitch.
Newport manager Warren Feeney revealed the matter is being discussed.
"It cannot keep happening," said Feeney.
"Obviously with Rodney Parade we are tenants, so I am sure a lot of discussions will be going on with them over the next couple of weeks.''
A ''super-sopper'' is a rolling device that absorbs excess surface water and the Exiles believe it could help with a problem which has dogged them for the past few seasons.
Feeney added: ''You have to give yourselves every chance.  If Glamorgan cricket can do us a favour, why not?
'We want to play football, we want to get it on. We don't want to be playing catch up.  That is a game we are owed already.''
Championship outfit Cardiff City used the "super-sopper" last season after encountering problems with the surface at their Cardiff City Stadium home.
