Matt Machan top scored with 103, adding 96 with captain Preston Mommsen (56) and 98 with Richie Berrington (52), as Scotland made 296-6 in their 50 overs.
Ireland made a steady start before seamer Alasdair Evans (4-17) took four wickets in his first three overs.
Spinner Majid Haq wrapped up the innings with 3-9 as Ireland collapsed to 117 all out in 27 overs.

While Scotland know they will face sterner tests than their fellow International Cricket Council (ICC) associate member when the World Cup begins this weekend, they will take heart from an assured batting display after Mommsen won the toss at Blacktown International Sportspark in the Sydney suburbs.
Former skipper Kyle Coetzer fell to Max Sorensen (3-55) without scoring but his opening partner Calum MacLeod made a steady 41 before Machan, Mommsen and Berrington helped the Scots post a formidable total.
In reply, Ireland captain William Porterfield (23) and Paul Stirling (37) added 57 for the first wicket before Evans ripped through the top order.
Five wickets fell for 20 runs in less than five overs, and Gary Wilson (15) was the only other Ireland batsman to make double figures as they collapsed to Haq and Josh Davey (2-36).
Ireland, who lost to Sydney club side Randwick Petersham last Friday, play their final warm-up game against Bangladesh at the same venue on Thursday, the same day that Scotland head across the city to face West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
Both Ireland and Scotland then head to New Zealand for their opening group games, with Ireland meeting the Windies in Nelson on 16 February, and Scotland up against co-hosts New Zealand in Dunedin a day later.
In Tuesday's other warm-up game in Adelaide, India opener Rohit Sharma smashed 150 from 122 balls, including seven sixes, as they made 364-5 against Afghanistan.
A shock looked possible when India were 16-2 early on, but Sharma added 158 with Suresh Raina (75) and 95 with Ajinkya Rahane (88 not out).
Usman Ghani (44) and ex-captain Nawroz Mangal (60) led Afghanistan's reply but the loss of four wickets for 16 runs in mid-innings ensured India maintained their supremacy, although the Afghans managed to bat their full 50 overs and finished on 211-8, losing by 153 runs.
