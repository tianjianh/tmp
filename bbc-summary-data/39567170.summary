Fujitsu: Union says Northern Ireland to avoid significant job cuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fujitsu's Northern Ireland operation looks to have avoided significant job losses, a trade union has said.

Last October, the Japanese company said its NI workforce was likely to be impacted by 1,800 job losses across the UK.
The firm employs just over 700 people in Northern Ireland, 451 in Belfast and 250 in Londonderry.
However, Unite has now said total job losses across Northern Ireland are likely to be in the region of 11 to 20.
The union said that management had indicated that the bulk of the workforce are no longer included in the scope of potential redundancies being considered currently.
A spokesperson for the company said it could not comment on the union's claim because the consultation process was still ongoing.
Fujitsu, which has 14,000 UK staff, said the job losses across its UK offices were necessary to better compete with foreign rivals that offer IT services more cheaply.
The firm has a range of businesses in the UK, from software services to providing air conditioning units.
Last March, Fujitsu announced that 40 employees faced redundancy as it was closing its maintenance and repair centre in Antrim.
It said following a review, it was transferring the work to Belfast, and Solihull in England.
