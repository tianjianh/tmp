Rio Olympics 2016: Mo Farah 'to end' track career after 2017

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four-time Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah plans to end his track career after next year's World Championships in London - but has not ruled out running the marathon at Tokyo 2020.

Farah, 33, became Britain's most successful Olympic track and field athlete by winning Saturday's 5,000m.
It was his second in Rio following his 10,000m triumph six days previously.
"In 2017, I'd like to end it on the track, and then we'll see what we can do in the marathon," he said.

Farah, who finished eighth on his marathon debut in London two years ago, will be 37 at the time of the Tokyo Games.
"In the long-distance events you can't plan too far ahead," said the Londoner, whose training partner Galen Rupp won bronze in the Rio marathon on Sunday. "But you can't rule it out."
Farah's 5,000m triumph secured the 'double double' after his successes at London 2012, but his defence of the 10,000m title almost faltered when he was tripped.
"All my training for four years, I thought in one moment it's gone," he said. "It took a lot out of me. I had to stay strong and think, 'I've got a long way to go, this is what I've trained for'."

BBC commentator and former Olympic bronze medallist Brendan Foster said Farah is "more than a national treasure" and "the greatest we have ever had".
And the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, was among many calling for the athlete to be knighted.
Farah, who has now won more world and Olympic titles than Ethiopian great Kenenisa Bekele, said: "I'll leave it to the public. I just want to do what I'm good at. I just run, and I let the rest take care of itself.
"I know my career is short and I try and make the most of it. I enjoy what I do, and I try to make nation and country proud. I owe it to the people."
