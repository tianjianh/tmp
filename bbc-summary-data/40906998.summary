Torquay United have signed former Macclesfield winger Andy Haworth on non-contract terms.

Haworth, has previously played for 13 clubs, including Rochdale, Notts County, Falkirk and Barrow.
The 28-year-old was released by Macclesfield in May, having made two appearances for the club.
"As both a player and a manager, I'm fully aware of how destructive he can be to defences," Torquay player-manager Kevin Nicholson said.
