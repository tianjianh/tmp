[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "serial liar" who made a series of false rape allegations has been convicted of perjury and perverting the course of justice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jemma Beale claimed she had been sexually assaulted by six men and raped by nine, in four different encounters.
One allegation led to the conviction of a man who was jailed for seven years.
The 25-year-old from Hounslow was found guilty following a six-week trial at Southwark Crown Court. She is due to be sentenced on 24 August.
Kevin Lynott, who led the investigation by the Metropolitan Police into the false allegations, said Beale had "been exposed as a serial liar".
"I can only think that she was motivated partly by financial reward, but mainly the attention and control over her partners and family at the time she made the allegations," he added.
