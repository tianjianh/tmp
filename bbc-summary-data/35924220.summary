Celtic's Craig Gordon aims to hold on to Scotland position

Craig Gordon wants to retain the goalkeeper's jersey after making only his second Scotland start in six years in Tuesday's 1-0 win over Denmark.

Gordon's appearances have been limited by serious injury combined with the good form of Allan McGregor and more recently David Marshall.
But the 33-year-old produced a series of good saves at Hampden, underlining the strength in depth in that position.
"I don't think I could have done much more," said the Celtic keeper.
"I've kept a clean sheet, made a few saves - but it's probably the hardest position at the moment for competition.
"That's all I can do, keep myself in the manager's thoughts and hopefully be the one who gets the nod when the qualifiers come round."
Gordon's last competitive match for Scotland was in a 2-0 win over Macedonia at Hampden in 2009, when George Burley was in charge.
Marshall was Gordon Strachan's number one for the Euro 2016 campaign, performing well as McGregor and Gordon had to be content with places on the bench.
The Cardiff City goalkeeper missed Tuesday night's match after contracting pneumonia.
In Marshall's absence from the two friendlies in the last week, both McGregor and Gordon have shown their worth and the latter says there is never any animosity over the manager's decision.
"We're fine - everybody has to look after themselves but at the same time, whoever's picked, we support the one that plays," he added after his 44th cap.
"It's a difficult decision for the manager to have so many players for the one position but hopefully this will show him he has a few players for other positions as well.
"That's what we've looked to try to do over the two games. He's blooded a few new players, which can only help us for the future."
Among the new players was Kieran Tierney, Gordon's 18-year-old Celtic team-mate and the keeper was unsurprised by the composed manner in which the teenage full-back dealt with his international debut.
"He's so calm," added Gordon. "Nothing seems to faze him at all. Wherever he's playing, whether it's at Celtic Park in front of a big crowd or stepping up to international level, he's very level-headed.
"I think that'll stand him in good stead as his career progresses. He's taken everything in his stride so far, he's still working hard, it's not going to his head at all.
"It's easy for young players to do that but he's certainly one [where] I wouldn't expect that to happen."
