Krzystof Jakubiak, 49, used a website to advertise women under his control as prostitutes, Cheshire Police said.
He and fellow trafficker Marlene Soska, 37, were arrested at their homes in Crewe and Nantwich, Cheshire, in May.
Eight women were found in properties in both towns, as well as in Bristol, London, Preston and Stoke-on-Trent.
The operation is believed to have been operating for two years, the police said, and could have made more than Â£1m.
Jakubiak, who had pleaded guilty to 36 human trafficking and sexual exploitation offences, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years at Warrington Crown Court.
He was also subject to an indefinite control order, which will place him under restrictions upon his release - the first time the order has been issued following new anti-human trafficking legislation.
Soska, who had admitted seven offences relating to human trafficking and sexual exploitation, was given an 18-month community order.
Det Insp David Browne, from Cheshire Police, said human trafficking and sexual exploitation are crimes that exploit "some of the most vulnerable people in our society".
"People may be shocked to hear that this sort of thing has taken place in Cheshire but this case highlights the fact that human trafficking and sexual exploitation can happen anywhere," he said.
