Sam Burgess' move back to South Sydney Rabbitohs has stalled as it will take the club over the NRL's salary cap.

The 26-year-old England World Cup player quit rugby union to return to his former club in rugby league.
The deal was confirmed on 5 November but the Rabbitohs must release players in order to register Burgess, who helped them win the NRL title in 2014.
"The Rabbitohs look forward to the confirmation of Sam's contract in the coming weeks," said a club spokesman.
Hooker Isaac Luke has already left Sydney to join New Zealand Warriors and Glenn Stewart has joined Super League side Catalans Dragons.
On Thursday Souths also confirmed they were releasing Australia international Dylan Walker.
The 21-year-old requested an exit after ending up in hospital after taking an overdose of painkillers.
Walker and winger Aaron Gray were fined by Souths.

Former Bradford Bulls prop Burgess left Australia in November 2014 to switch codes and join Premiership side Bath on a three-year deal.
He made his England debut only nine months later and was included in Stuart Lancaster's squad for the World Cup ahead of more experienced back Luther Burrell.
Burgess had been used as a flanker for his club, but was played as a centre by Lancaster - a move that drew criticism as England failed to get out of the group stage.
The player asked to leave Bath after the tournament, citing family reasons, and rejoined the Rabbitohs, where he will link up again with his brothers, twins Tom and George.
South Sydney's first game of 2016 season is at Allianz Stadium on 6 March against Sydney Roosters, whose assistant coach is England rugby league boss Steve McNamara.
