Parts of Upper Street, Charlton Place, Camden Passage and Colebrooke Row near the Angel Islington were all closed.
The fire brigade said the water was 2m (6.5ft) deep in basement properties on Charlton Place.
Thames Water has apologised and said it would take several days to fix the pipe. London Fire Brigade said it had pumped water into a nearby canal.
Firefighters from Islington, Dowgate, Whitechapel, Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Battersea and Edmonton stations are at the scene, and the Metropolitan Police's marine unit was also helping.
The Steam Passage Tavern opened its doors to residents whose homes had been flooded.
Homeowner Trevor Turner said: "I woke up at 05:30 with essentially a river flowing down Charlton Place.
"We're just refurbishing our kitchen. The last bits of the tiling were due to happen this morning and some damp proofing as well."
Mary, another resident, said: "I woke up at 05:45 as I heard something.
"I thought it was torrential rain so I put my head out the window and saw it was a torrential flood instead and then several policemen who were knocking on doors on the other side and said to evacuate."
Motorists were advised to avoid the usually busy area, with the southbound side of Upper Street closed.
A Thames Water spokesperson said the company was "supporting those whose properties were flooded" with help finding alternative accommodation and making insurance claims.
The company said repairs to the pipe would "continue throughout this week" with engineers working "24 hours a day to get the job done".
"It was our pipe that burst and it's our responsibility to put things right," the spokesperson said.
Richard Watts, leader of Islington Council, said the flood had "caused considerable damage and distress".
