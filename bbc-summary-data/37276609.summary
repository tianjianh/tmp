Tony Pulis: West Brom boss will not resign despite disappointing transfer window

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Brom boss Tony Pulis will not be resigning - despite being disappointed by the club's failure to land some of his preferred targets this summer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Baggies broke their club record to sign Spurs' Nacer Chadli for £13m, but a move for Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho did not materialise.
Pulis, 58, was absent from Saturday's friendly against Delhi Dynamos, fuelling speculation he would quit.
But he was scouting his next Premier League opponents, Bournemouth.
The former Gillingham, Bristol City and Stoke City manager walked away from his previous job at Crystal Palace in August 2014.
That decision to leave was believed to involve a dispute over bonuses.
Fuelled by a new £5.1bn three-year television deal, Premier League clubs spent a record £1.165bn during the summer, including £150m on transfer deadline day.
West Brom signed Belgium midfielder Chadli, QPR winger Matt Phillips, Watford full-back Allan Nyom, Everton full-back Brendan Galloway on loan and free agent striker Hal Robson-Kanu.
Chairman John Williams said in a statement that "Tony wanted five and got five", describing the head coach as "very selective and particular about the players he recruits".
He said the summer transfer window was an "extremely difficult market" and admitted not adding a "further quality midfielder player" was a "disappointment".
A £15m deal to bring in Malaga midfielder Ignacio Camacho, 26, was close, but I understand his recent injury record gave Pulis concern. Williams said the deal was not pursued for "footballing reasons".
Euro 2016 winner Carvalho, 24, a highly-rated defensive midfielder, was targeted for about £20m, with Pulis believed to be particularly disappointed a potential club-record deal was not done.
After the transfer window, avoiding relegation will be a major challenge.
Of the five players brought in for a total summer outlay of less than £20m, only Chadli could be described as a marquee signing.
Chadli's club-record £13m fee demonstrates how West Brom have operated within their limited resources in previous years, but Pulis wanted bigger signings to make a statement.
Since the window closed, the club have been at pains to stress that majority shareholder Jeremy Peace was fully supportive of any transfer deals.
There will be pressure for Williams and new technical director Nick Hammond to demonstrate in the next window that West Brom are serious players in the Premier League.
