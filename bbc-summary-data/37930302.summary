Ahmed Mohammed murder: Four sentenced over Moss Side stabbing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four men have been sentenced for their role in the murder of a 20-year-old man who was "cruelly" stabbed to death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ahmed Mohammed, known as Mudi, died in hospital after he was attacked in Crondall Street, Moss Side, in March.
Abdirashid Boos, 23, of Broadfield Road, was found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum of 23 years at Manchester Crown Court.
Three other men were also sentenced for assisting or encouraging an offender.
The court heard Mr Mohammed was standing with friends when he was approached and stabbed by Abdirashid Boos.
Boos, who was joined by Johnson, had earlier parked up in a hire car and set upon the group, shouting and swearing at them.
After the stabbing, the men drove off before the killer's brother, Abdirahman Boos, arranged for them to get out of Manchester.
They travelled to Cheshire Oaks before ending up in Liverpool. Adnan Mohammed later set fire to the get-away car.
The following day the brothers travelled to Leeds and met Adnan Mohammed.
The three men were arrested and officers seized tickets to Amsterdam which had been booked for the following day.
Further inquiries then led to the arrest of Johnson.
After the sentencing, Mr Mohammed's family said listening to the "cruel and callous" circumstances of their son's death had been "the hardest thing we have had to endure".
They said: "We take comfort from the fact that the evidence acknowledges that Mudi was a greatly respected young man, a caring and loving soul, who always put others before himself.
"We came to court to seek answers from those who have been accused of this sickening crime but none of them have shown any remorse towards Mudi or his family."
Det Insp Kev O'Regan, of Greater Manchester Police, praised the family's "courage" in facing "every parent's nightmare".
