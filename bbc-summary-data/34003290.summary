Post-medieval silver mount found in Deeside declared treasure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A silver artefact believed to date back to the early 17th Century has been declared treasure after its discovery in Flintshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gordana Mitchell, of Deeside, found the mount while metal detecting in March 2013.
It features a motif of a female saint with long hair, botanical scrolls and a cherub.
The mount is thought to be a decorative hinge or a decoration from a small bible or prayer book.
Dr Mark Redknap from National Museum Wales said: "Although incomplete, it is an interesting example of 17th Century decorative silverwork."
