A bright and colourful ceremony at Rio's Maracana stadium, celebrating Brazil's history and natural beauty, kicked off the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.
It's the first time the Games has been held in South America.
The Olympic torch was lit by former marathon runner Vanderlei de Lima, and tennis champion Andy Murray led the Great Britain team into the arena.
The audience inside the Maracana were treated to an amazing display of light, colour, dancing and a few hundred fireworks!
Huge projections lit the floor showing different images to tell the story of Brazil, from ancient history to modern day, as performers jumped and danced.
Millions of people around the world watched the ceremony.
