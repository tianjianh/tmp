Ant & Dec explain Brits hosting U-turn 'after a few drinks'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After "an instant decision to say no" Declan Donnelly says it took a "few drinks" to change his mind about hosting Wednesday night's Brit Awards.

Along with Ant McPartlin, the pair return to present the music ceremony after a 14 year gap.
"They have asked us in between (now and 2001)," notes Ant. "And we've said 'no' but it just felt kind of right to do it this time."
It turns out the duo had that change of heart on a night out.
They also admit they "said never again" after the experience of presenting the Brits in 2001 when nerves got the better of them.
"The call came through and we said 'no'," explains Dec. "And we were out and had a few more drinks and started talking about it.
"We said, 'If we were going to do it we'd do it like this, and we'd do that', and a few more drinks later we said, 'All right let's change our mind, we'll do it.'"
"So here we are," grins Dec.
The pair say they haven't had any restrictions imposed on what they can say or do tonight, but admit some artists have been 'less forthcoming than others' when it comes to joining in the jokes they've got planned.
Ant and Dec haven't written their Brits script by themselves, there is a team of writers they use on Saturday Night Takeaway and I'm a Celebrity that they've collaborated with as usual.
"We all sit round a table and throw some ideas around," says Dec. "And we just spark off each other.
"The guys go away and come up with a draft script," he continues. "And then we all get together and read it through, spark off some more ideas, it will constantly change."
As you'd expect Ant and Dec aren't revealing any on stage shenanigans beforehand, apart from saying Ed Sheeran won't be as much of a target as he was on Saturday Night Takeaway last weekend.
"We put him through enough on Saturday night," laughs Dec.
"Standing next to us two with our lack of trumpet and trombone skills," smiles Ant, recalling how Ed Sheeran managed to keep singing live on TV while Ant and Dec played instruments, badly, at Ed's side.
"We've always known Ed had a good sense of humour, but he really showed it on Saturday night," says Ant.
There are "no fears" about hosting, just "excitement" at this point, say Ant and Dec, and they'll cope if a few jokes fall flat.
"That happens a lot," the pair laugh together.
"Anything can happen at this awards show," admits Ant. "And if they want to cause havoc those pop stars and get up to no good then let them do it, we'll just stand along and watch them."
