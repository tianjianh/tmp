Kaydel Williams died after being found with serious head and chest injuries in Hunton Road, Erdington, Birmingham, on the evening of 7 October.
West Midlands Police said it believed "several people" were involved in the Tipton 19-year-old's death.
Simon Seeney, 34, from Downside Road, Erdington, was due to appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court.
A 34-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and assisting an offender has been released on bail while inquiries continue.
Investigating officer Det Insp Warren Hines said: "The death of Kaydel Williams remains very much a live enquiry.
"We believe that several people may have been involved in the young man's death and we need to hear from anyone who has information about what happened.
"We understand how reluctant some people are to speak to police so the best way to give that information is anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
