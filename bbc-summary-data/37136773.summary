Kevin Gomis: Dundee sign central defender from Nice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee have signed centre-back Kevin Gomis on a one-year contract from Nice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old Frenchman has played 57 games for the French Ligue 1 club since 2011 but was restricted to just three appearances last season.
Gomis had a brief spell on loan at Nottingham Forest two years ago.
He becomes the seventh summer arrival at Dens Park after midfielders Danny Williams, James Vincent, Mark O'Hara and Michael Duffy (loan), and strikers Yordi Teijsse and Faissal El Bakhtaoui.
