Rachel and Nyomi Fee deny murdering the two-year-old in a house near Glenrothes on 22 March 2014 and blaming his death on another child.
Jurors at the High Court in Livingston retired to consider their verdicts on Friday morning.
They were sent home on Friday afternoon after the case was adjourned over the weekend.
The judge, Lord Burns, told them to consider the evidence dispassionately and without speculation.
Rachel, 31, and Nyomi Fee, 29, who are both originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny all the charges against them.
The trial has been running for seven weeks.
