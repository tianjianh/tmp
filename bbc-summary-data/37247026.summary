Staff noticed rat droppings in a number of classrooms at St Teresa's Primary School, the BBC understands.
It is understood that the droppings were found on Wednesday, the day before term was due to start.
Headmaster Terry Rodgers said he hoped the school would open as normal on Monday 5 September.
Parents of the 450 pupils at the school were contacted to advise them of the closure.
"We have had to close St Teresa's for an additional two days at the start of the new school term due to confirmation we received that the school had a rodent issue," said Mr Rodgers in a statement.
"I can assure parents that the school is dealing with the problem as swiftly as possible.
"Once we have carried out a deep clean of the school we hope to be open as normal next week.
"I will be in touch with parents to keep them up to date."
The Education Authority (EA) and Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) had been consulted on the decision, said the school.
