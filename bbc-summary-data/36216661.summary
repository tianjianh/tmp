The 62-year-old from Northumberland was working on the Â£1.4bn bridge which is being built across the Firth of Forth.
He is thought to have been hit by a moving boom on a crane on the deck of the north tower on 29 April.
An investigation is being carried out by Police Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive.
In a statement, Police Scotland said Mr Cousin's family wanted to thank everyone for their "thoughts and support at this sad time".
It is understood that he suffered severe blood loss in the incident and he was unable to be resuscitated.
