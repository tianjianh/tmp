Caroline MacAskill, 52, from Fortrose near Inverness, died from injuries she suffered whilst riding on Saturday.
Her husband, Ian, 54, is believed to have attempted to resuscitate his wife before she was taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. She died on Sunday.
Mrs MacAskill was described as "a popular and well-known figure".
A statement issued by the Caledonian Riding club in Inverness said: "Her good-humoured enthusiasm for her sport shone through everything she did.
"She will be so much missed and was a wonderful example to everyone else of doing what you love most with commitment and courage."
Mrs MacAskill worked as the head of customer services at Cairn Housing Association.
The association's chief executive Jason MacGilp said: "Caroline was always an enthusiastic and skilled member of the team, and her passion for life and for delivering quality services for tenants always shone through in her work.
"She cared about people and the communities she worked for.
"Caroline helped so many people through her working life and further afield over the years, and she will be very sorely missed by us all."
