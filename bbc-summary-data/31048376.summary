Raped on a uni trip: Claire's story

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Claire was in her first year at university when she signed up to go on a trip with some friends.

On the first night everyone got really drunk and Claire passed out at the bar.
Later, she woke up in her room fully-clothed and says she could barely move she was so drunk - and then she blacked out again.
This is what happened to Claire next and just a warning that you might find some of her story upsetting:
"When I woke up again it was because one of the guys I was in a mixed dorm with was on top of me," Claire says. It's not her real name. She asked us to change it.
"I kept trying to push him off and say 'no', but I was still just completely, completely drunk and I could barely move.
"I was saying 'no', but it wasn't meaning anything to him, he wasn't stopping, he wasn't acknowledging anything," she explains.
"The next thing I wake up and he's still in the room.
"He's just in the bed next to me and I get up and go have a bath and I just sit there trying to process what happened.
"But it took so long to even be able to acknowledge that what happened that night was actually rape," she says.
"Anyway, I eventually ended up telling a couple of friends, I think about five people now actually know.
"It's so easy to think that perhaps you're exaggerating, perhaps you're remembering things wrongly, perhaps in some way it is your fault," she says.
"It just didn't seem to fit. I knew my attacker. I knew who he was, it just seemed so wrong.
That's why Claire thinks the new guidelines on consent in rape cases are so important: "It's enabling people to feel empowered to come forward and say 'yes I was drunk', but that doesn't mean that I'm responsible.
"Rape is rape at the end of the day. It happens to men too," she points out.
"Just because you're drunk, perhaps you've taken drugs, it doesn't make any difference.
"There shouldn't be any grey area and victims shouldn't be made to feel guilty - that's wrong and I'm so glad that that's going to change."
