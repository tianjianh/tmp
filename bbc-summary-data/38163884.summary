[SN]TITLE[SN]
Setback for Alternative A5 campaigners

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A campaign group has suffered a blow to its attempt to halt a multi-million pound dual carriageway project linking Counties Londonderry and Tyrone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Wednesday, the High Court dismissed claims that an ongoing public inquiry into the need for the road was flawed.
The decision marks a setback for those opposed to the planned 85km route.
Work on the new dual carriageway section is due to get underway next year, subject to the result of a public inquiry.
The opposition group, known as the Alternative A5 Alliance, are made up of farmers, landowners and others with an interest in the area.
They argued there is a requirement for alternatives to be examined by the Planning Appeals Commission (PAC) and accused the Department for Infrastructure of engaging in a charade.
Counsel for the department, said further PAC hearings in December will look at other options and enable objections to be voiced.
The judge said the commission must then prepare a report for the minister's consideration.
"I reject the suggestion that the inquiry is simply a sixth-form debating exercise," she added.
"That, it seems to me, does a disservice to its aims."
