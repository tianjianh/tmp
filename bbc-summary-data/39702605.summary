Talks to resolve Southern rail doors row adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southern rail and the RMT union have adjourned negotiations after two days of talks in a bid to resolve a dispute over driver-only operated trains.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The year-long row is over Southern's plans to give drivers responsibility for operating the doors, and changing the role of guards to on-board supervisors.
The RMT has taken 31 days of strike action over the proposed changes.
Negotiations are due to resume next week, officials said.
