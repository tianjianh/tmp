Arlene Foster: 'I have felt intimidated by Jonathan Bell'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Arlene Foster has said it is "nonsense" that she was abusive to former DUP minister Jonathan Bell during a meeting over a green energy scheme in February - and that it was Mr Bell who was "aggressive" to her.

Mrs Foster added that "the Jonathan Bell that appears on your programme tonight is not a Jonathan Bell that would be familiar to many of his political colleagues".
Mrs Foster was speaking to BBC presenter Stephen Nolan.
Mr Bell had claimed that Mrs Foster was verbally "abusive" and angrily "overruled" him when he tried to close a green energy scheme in February, over concerns it was wasting millions of pounds of public money.
