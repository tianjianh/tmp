[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Centre Jonathan Davies has handed Welsh rugby a second boost within a week with the news that he is likely to be available for the 2016 Six Nations.

It was confirmed on Friday that the British and Irish Lion, 27, will rejoin Scarlets from Clermont Auvergne next season on a national dual contract.
Davies missed the World Cup with a serious knee injury but expects to return to action within a month.
"Hopefully I'll be back the middle of December," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"But things can change, times can change, but at the moment I'm looking pretty good. I'm looking forward to it."
Davies, who has 48 Wales caps, ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in May 2015 but his imminent return will be welcome news for Wales head coach Warren Gatland.
Scott Williams impressed at outside centre for Wales in Davies' absence, but he also suffered a serious knee injury during the World Cup.
The 24-year-old, who could form a potent midfield partnership with Davies at Scarlets next season, is not expected to return before the end of the season.
That means Davies could slot back into the national side to resume his Wales and 2013 Lions partnership with Jamie Roberts, provided he has proved his fitness with Clermont.
"Obviously it's very difficult being injured but Clermont have been excellent in my rehab and have got me back into a position now that I'm nearly fit to be playing on the field again," added Davies, who left Scarlets for France in 2014.
"So I look forward to getting back on the field for Clermont and hopefully finishing this year with some silverware.
"I've had two years, enjoyed my time out there and I've learned from great players.
"I've been able to play with some of the best players in Europe like Wesley Fofana, Fritz Lee, Brock James, they're all great players.
"It's a new culture to learn off new people obviously helps me in the long run.
"But the [Welsh Rugby] Union and the region are much better now and I want to get back to being a part of Welsh rugby again
He added: "I'm just glad to get myself sorted personally, Welsh rugby is certainly in a good position and hopefully a number of the boys can come back.
"The Scarlets are going very well in the Pro12, but that's next year now, there's a lot of rugby to be played and it's an exciting time for me."
