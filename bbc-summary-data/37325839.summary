[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leicester City 3-0 Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City's record signing Islam Slimani marked his Premier League debut with two goals as the champions outclassed Burnley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker opened the scoring in the last minute of the first half with a header from Christian Fuchs' free-kick.
He made it two just after the restart with another header and Ben Mee's own goal completed the scoring.
The win capped off a great week for the Foxes, who also won 3-0 at Club Brugge in the Champions League on Wednesday.
Slimani, who arrived for a reported Â£29m from Sporting Lisbon last month, had a Premier League debut to remember.
The 28-year-old Algerian should have opened his account when he somehow failed to connect with a deep cross from Marc Albrighton before he got off the mark for his new club.
Matt Lowton needlessly fouled Albrighton on the left-hand edge of the area in the last minute of the first half and Slimani powerfully headed home Fuchs' free-kick.
He was celebrating his second goal in the 48th minute with another header after Jamie Vardy flicked on Riyad Mahrez's low cross after the Clarets gave away the ball in their own half.
His goals were not the only thing that stood out on Saturday, though, as he linked up well with fellow Algerian Mahrez and strike partner Vardy.
Manager Claudio Ranieri, whose team had picked up only four points from their first four league matches before Saturday, will also have been pleased with the industry his new striker showed when closing down the Burnley defence.
It was a hard afternoon for Sean Dyche's side.
They could have got the day's first goal when Steven Defour headed straight at Ron-Robert Zieler after Scott Arfield headed George Boyd's cross across goal to him.
However, they never recovered from conceding the first goal and were probably fortunate to only lose by a three-goal margin.
Dyche started with a five-man midfield but this left Andre Gray isolated. Once the Foxes scored their second goal, the Burnley striker was a mere spectator as the hosts showed why they were last season's champions.
The Clarets could do little to stop Mahrez and he claimed the assist for the third goal when Mee put though his own goal from his low cross.
Burnley substitute Johann Berg Gudmundsson's deflected free-kick forced a good save from Zieler in the dying minutes and Dyche will have at least been pleased with how his side continued to compete with the game over as a contest.
"The reality was four minutes of madness - two before half-time and two after," Dyche said.

Leicester City boss Claudio Ranieri: "I am very happy with the result and the performance of the players. I was curious to see how my players reacted after the Champions League and they reacted very well.
"After the victory in the Champions League, it was very important to continue in the Premier League.
"We scored three goals and Islam Slimani scored twice. I think our fans are very happy. It's important Slimani continues to score because if he only scores in the first match we have a problem. He is a good lad and very happy."

Burnley boss Sean Dyche: "We gave away a really poor free-kick and they score. You go into half-time and try and change things and calm things down. Then we give away another poor goal.
"You are in trouble after that because we're playing against a very good team. We have to keep learning and keep moving forward."
Leicester host Ranieri's former side Chelsea in the third round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday, while Burnley are back in action with a home game against Watford a week on Monday.
