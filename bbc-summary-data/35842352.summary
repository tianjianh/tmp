Danny Ings: Burnley expect 'biggest ever' tribunal fee for Liverpool striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley chief executive Dave Baldwin expects the fee for striker Danny Ings' move to Liverpool to be the biggest ever decided by a transfer tribunal.

Ings, 23, left the Clarets for Anfield last summer after his contract expired.
As Ings is under 24, the clubs had the opportunity to agree compensation, but have failed to do so.
"The reason it is different to the ordinary is this tribunal claim will be the biggest in history," Baldwin told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"The key to this was that we bring the claim against Liverpool, therefore we had to prepare an extremely robust case.
"You're talking a documentation bundle of probably in excess of 400 or 500 pages with witness statements, evidence, analytics about player performance, the statement as to why we make a judgement as to what we believe the player is worth, compared to what Liverpool want to offer.
"You get your ducks in a row and do the job right."
Ings joined the Clarets from Bournemouth in 2011 for an undisclosed fee, reported to be Â£1m, and scored 43 goals in 130 games for the club.
He made his England debut in October in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania, but subsequently suffered a knee injury which has prevented him playing since October.
"The value is based on training compensation, not the market value of a player," added Baldwin.
"It's how long you have that player at your club, what did you do to develop him, what were your investments in how you developed him and as a result of that what player did you produce at the point he departed your club.
"Thereafter, his injury should bear no relevance to the tribunal panel.
"We are dealing with five human beings here who have to make an opinion and no right to appeal."
Burnley chief executive Dave Baldwin was speaking at a fans' forum alongside manager Sean Dyche. You can listen to show show again via the iPlayer.
