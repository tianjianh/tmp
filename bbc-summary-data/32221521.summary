Kaysha, whose real name is Edward Mokolo Jr, is currently based in Portugal but he often visits his native Kinshasa. That's where DJ Edu, the presenter of BBC Radio 1Xtra's Destination Africa programme, met him recently.
DJ Edu started by asking him why, coming from a country where many musicians are still heavily influenced by traditional rumba sounds, he is better known as a singer of Caribbean zouk, and kizomba, a genre which mixes semba sounds from Angola with zouk and kompa music from Haiti.
