[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Warren and Westley Linnen admitted conspiracy to burgle at Chelmsford Crown Court.
The pair targeted pubs across southern England, including premises in Essex, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire.
The pair, aged 35 and 38 , from Beckton, London, were each jailed for five-and-a-half years.
The court heard their six-week crime spree happened while they were on licence after being released from jail.
They will serve their new prison terms on top of the remainder of their previous sentences for burglary.
Det con Kirsty Swan, from Essex Police, said the brothers "targeted" pubs and bars and stole from private living areas and staff rooms.
"It was only after arresting them, having been wanted for burglaries across Essex and Hertfordshire, that I began to fully uncover the number of crimes they had committed," she said.
"This case has involved liaising with officers from seven other forces to pull together all our work to make a strong case which meant the Linnen brothers had no choice but to admit their guilt when faced with the weight of the evidence compiled against them."
The pair stole about £19,700 in cash and property worth about £1,000 including safes, handbags and electrical items.
