The former Manchester United trainee, 24, was Swindon's top scorer last term with 25 goals in all competitions.
Head coach Luke Williams has previously said they must "plan for life without" Ajose and midfield star Yaser Kasim.
BBC Wiltshire also understands that Swindon have agreed a deal worth about £400,000 to sign Lawrence Vigouroux.
The Chilean goalkeeper made 36 appearances while on loan at Swindon from Liverpool in 2015-16.
Vigouroux, 22, was a regular in the Wiltshire club's starting side before suffering an injury in March.
Charlton were relegated from the Championship last term and will play in League One alongside Swindon in 2016-17.
On Thursday, the Addicks signed Northampton Town midfielder Ricky Holmes for an undisclosed fee.
