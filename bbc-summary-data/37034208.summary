Bicester retail park plan dismissed at appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new out-of-town retail park in Bicester have been thrown out on appeal.

The development off the A41 Oxford Road would have included three stores, three restaurants, a gym and car park.
The initial application was refused by Cherwell District Council in October 2015.
Planning inspector Martin Whitehead said there would be an "unacceptable" impact on traffic should the site go ahead.
He added there would be a "harmful effect" on the surrounding highway network which would not be adequately mitigated.
Councillors rejected an outline planning application in October, citing concerns over traffic and the appearance of future residential developments in the area.
CPG Development Projects said the park would have prevented shoppers travelling to Oxford and Milton Keynes - a situation they described as "increasingly unsustainable".
The firm lodged an appeal and a six-day planning inquiry led by the government planning inspector took place in June.
Mr Whitehead's decision to dismiss the appeal was delivered last week, ending the developer's hopes.
The council's lead member for planning, councillor Colin Clarke, said residents feared the site would increase traffic around the already heavily congested town.
"Until we can be assured that enough provisions are in place to mitigate congestion, which this development is sure to generate, the inspector agrees we cannot justify approving these proposals," he said.
