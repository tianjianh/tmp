A man who shot and killed his partner's son-in-law with a sawn-off shotgun after a family row in East Yorkshire has been jailed for 14 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Smith, 38, died instantly when he was shot twice outside a bungalow in Melton on 20 May.
Peter Guy, 54, of Melton Old Road, was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter last Friday after a week-long trial at Hull Crown Court.
He admitted five associated firearms offences at a previous hearing.
Guy has been sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court.
During the trial the court heard Mr Smith had driven from his home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, to Guy's property and repeatedly crashed his lorry into his van and garage door after a family row.
The jury was played the emergency call to the police in which Guy was heard claiming he had been stabbed twice in the neck.
He was then heard to say: "I've shot him."
Guy's claim of shooting Mr Smith in self defence was rejected by the jury.
