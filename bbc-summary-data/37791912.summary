Pizza Hut worker Ali Qasemi, 45, died in May, two days after he was punched and left dying on the pavement in Peterborough.
Mark Lintott, 29, of Peterborough, denied robbery and manslaughter but was found guilty at the city's crown court.
The jury heard how he and a friend hatched a plot to take the food without paying for it.
His accomplice Joel Lawson, 25, of Norwich, admitted both charges ahead of the trial and both men are expected to be sentenced on 18 November.

During Lintott's trial the court heard he and Lawson had been drinking with friends when they came up with their plan to take the food.
"They intended to take it using threat or force," Gregory Perrins, prosecuting, said.
"Mr Lintott gave the restaurant a false address, so when Mr Qasemi arrived, he had to call the number of the person so he had to ask where they were."
When Mr Qasemi arrived. "they came out of the flat intending to take those pizzas by force", he said.
Lawson punched Mr Qasemi, causing him to fall and hit his head, the court was told.
They left him dying on the pavement outside and went back in to continue partying, Mr Perrins said.
A passerby called an ambulance.
Mr Qasemi, a married father of two, died from a serious head injury following the attack on 8 May.
The court was told his wife Fawzia was pregnant at the time of his death.
"This was a sickening, senseless crime, which has caused misery to Mr Qasemi's wife and her young sons," Det Insp Lucy Thomson, from Cambridgeshire Police, said.
"They have lost a loving, devoted husband and father, devastating their close-knit family, all for the price of three pizzas."
Following Mr Qasemi's death, Pizza Hut UK said it had reviewed its training methods for drivers.
"Since May we have put in place a number of measures... including a new order verification process and a review of delivery driver safety training," a spokeswoman said.
The company had been "extremely saddened" by news of Mr Qasemi's death and had been "working closely with our franchisee to support Mr Qasemi's family", she added.
