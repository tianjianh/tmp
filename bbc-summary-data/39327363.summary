[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mrs MacDonnell from Quebec in Canada has just been named the best teacher in the world!

Around 200,000 teachers were nominated for the award, and the winner was announced by a French astronaut on the International Space Station.
Mrs MacDonnell works with students in a remote village in north Canada.
As well as teaching the students, she's also set up a fitness centre and a community kitchen in the village.
There are loads of amazing teachers out there... what do you think makes them great?
If they are not strict they are amazing.

What makes a brilliant teacher is the way that they teach and whether they are strict or not.
