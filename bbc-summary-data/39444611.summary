[SN]TITLE[SN]
Glasgow firm fined £80,000 over nuisance phone calls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Glasgow building restoration firm has been fined £80,000 for making nuisance phone calls, following an investigation by the information watchdog.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Xternal Property Renovations made more than 109,000 unlawful marketing calls.
The case centred on calls made to people registered with Telephone Preference Service, which meant they had opted not to receive sales calls.
The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said nuisance marketing would not be tolerated.
Example of complaints from people who had received calls included:
Ken Macdonald, of ICO regions, said: "Nuisance marketing, whether it's by calls to people's landline or mobile, or through spam texts, causes disruption, annoyance and, in the worst cases, serious upset.
"We issue fines like these to firms behind nuisance marketing to send a clear message that such action will not be tolerated."
