Norwich City fan reported for abusive language by TV viewer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Norwich City football fan was reported for "racially abusive" language by a television viewer during the play-off match at Ipswich Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The armchair fan from Bolton phoned Suffolk Police alleging that Ipswich player Tyrone Mings had been abused during the 1-1 draw at Portman Road.
Officers scanned footage and arrested a 17-year-old during the match.
The fan admitted using non-racist but abusive language. He will not go to the final under a community resolution.
Police said the television viewer phoned them during the first half of the match on Saturday, 9 May.
The 17-year-old fan from Cromer was removed from the crowd during the second half and taken into custody.
Suffolk Police would not disclose the actual language used by the supporter but a spokeswoman said it was not racist.
Mings told officers he had not heard anything and the person who reported it then declined to give an official statement, according to the force.
It was agreed to use the community resolution rather than charge the Norwich fan and take him to court.
The resolution meant the 17-year-old agreed to stay away from the second leg of the play-off semi-final at Carrow Road and any subsequent trip to Wembley.
Norwich won that match 3-1 to progress to the final which takes place against Middlesbrough on Monday.
Suffolk Police said it was unable to confirm whether the 17-year-old had been planning to go to Wembley.
Some Canaries fans have expressed disappointment that Norwich's allocation of 38,888 tickets for the final have not been put on general sale.
