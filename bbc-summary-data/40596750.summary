Det Con Elaine McIver was among 22 people who died in the explosion at an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May.
The 43-year-old, who worked for Cheshire Police, was off duty when Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device in the venue's foyer.
Some of Ms McIver's colleagues formed a guard of honour outside Chester Cathedral as the coffin arrived.
The private service opened with words from the Very Reverend Prof Gordon McPhate, Dean of Chester.
Ms McIver's sister Lynda and Det Insp Karen Jaundrill read tributes and the service included Peace Poem and Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream by John Denver.
In a statement, Ms McIver's family said it had been their "worst nightmare" but they have been "overwhelmed and humbled" by the support they have received.
Ms McIver's partner Paul, who was seriously hurt in the blast, "continues to improve physically but it is a long road ahead", they said.
"We will sing her to sleep one last time and say night, night sleep tight beautiful little sister."
By all accounts, Det Con Elaine McIver was a dedicated, passionate and diligent police officer, who rose quickly through the ranks at Cheshire Constabulary and was lauded for her work in bringing down complex organised crime networks.
Away from work, her family and friends described her as "bubbly" and "positive", while Cheshire's chief constable said she was "full of life".
Her funeral was a very private affair, with tributes from speakers including two police chaplains and a detective inspector.
Land of Hope and Glory and Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer were sung among the hymns.
As uniformed officers filed into Chester Cathedral in sombre silence, the service was another reminder of how the emergency services themselves have suffered throughout this atrocity.
Not only in the way they responded to such horrors on the night of the bombing - for which they were universally praised - but by losing one of their own.
Speaking after the service, Cheshire's chief constable Simon Byrne said it had been "a difficult hour, but a fitting tribute".
"She was clearly a person who meant so much, both to her family and the force. She was full of life, always seeing the bright side of life."
In work, Chief Con Byrne said Det Con McIver had worked on very complex and "specialist" cases as part of the force's economic crime unit.
Her work using complex legislation to bring criminals to justice earned her praise in a letter from the prime minister, he said.
"She always went the extra mile for victims to have people brought to book."
The chief constable said he had been "very moved" by the spontaneous applause that broke out as the coffin was carried into the service.
"I thought it was a lovely touch and a mark of appreciation for the wider police force," he added.
He said Cheshire Police has been inundated with tributes from forces around the world, with a flag from New York Police Department present at the service. The Metropolitan Police also offered to send officers to the region to cover for colleagues attending the funeral.
GMP had also shown their support "not withstanding the awful events they have had to deal with and come to terms with".
