Kit Harington: Game of Thrones should get more awards

We all know Game of Thrones is one of TV's most popular shows.

But the show hasn't proven such a big a hit at the Golden Globes, one of TV's biggest awards shows.
In four series, it has only been nominated for three awards, winning once when Peter Dinklage was named best supporting actor.
Now one of the show's leading actors, Kit Harington, tells Newsbeat he'd like the fantasy epic to get more recognition.
"I always think Game of Thrones should get more nominations," he told us as he prepares to head to Los Angeles for the ceremony.
At this year's event the programme is nominated for a solitary award (albeit a biggie), as it competes for best drama series.
"I'm very, very happy we have a Golden Globe nomination. We haven't had one since season one."
It was the 2012 Golden Globes when Peter Dinklage, who plays Tyrion Lannister, won his award and the show lost out to Homeland for best drama series.
Speaking about this year's nomination, Kit said: "It really is great to be recognised in that way and I hope it'll be the first of many more in the future as we progress towards the end.
"There are lots of people who deserve nominations but it's not up to us."
The fifth series of Game of Thrones begins this spring, with some episodes being shown in Imax.
Before that comes along, Kit is promoting Testament Of Youth, a period drama about the First World War memoirs of Vera Brittain.
There's always lots of talk about his long curly hair, which he's contractually obliged to keep in order to play Jon Snow.
In Testament Of Youth, it's short and straight. So Kit turned to a wig.
"It was one of those things I was quite concerned about. We knew we couldn't cut my hair because it was close to the filming of Thrones so we wigged it.
"It was done really well by a really good guy and it didn't distract because it can be one of those things that really takes away from a performance if there's a wig that looks wrong."
In the film he plays Vera Brittain's fiance Roland Leighton.
"I'd done a lot of sword wielding, playing brooding silent types. Bit this was a real opportunity to explore a character.
"It's a movie where I could play a real life historical character which is very different to what I've been doing."
