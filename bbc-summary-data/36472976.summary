[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hungary's government granted new anti-terror powers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hungary's parliament has granted the government the right to seek temporary extra powers if it believes the country faces a heightened terrorist threat.

These include more public surveillance and increased scope to use the army.
Any request from the government would have to be approved by MPs and the new powers could be used for up to 15 days.
Critics said there was no justification for the constitutional change and opposition politicians have warned that the powers could be misused.
The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest says the amendment - the sixth to Hungary's five-year-old constitution - is a watered down version of an earlier draft, which opposition parties opposed unanimously.
The governing right-wing Fidesz party had sought additional powers including the ability to inspect bank accounts, but this was rejected.
The new version passed with the necessary two-thirds majority thanks to support from the far-right Jobbik party.
However, other opposition groups and rights organisations including the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty International criticised the amendment, saying existing laws were sufficient and the government could not be trusted not to abuse its new powers.
The move to increase government powers came in the wake of the Brussels terror attacks, which Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said "should be considered as an attack on Hungary as well".
