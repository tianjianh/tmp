Andreas Weimann: Wolves sign Derby County striker on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolves have signed Derby forward Andreas Weimann on loan from Championship rivals Derby County until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old has only started one league match this season and has been a peripheral figure under Steve McClaren.
Weimann's move sees him reunited with Wolves boss Paul Lambert, who managed the Austrian at Aston Villa.
Rams boss Steve McClaren said Weimann was "a good player", but he had "too many players in that area".
Weimann joined Derby for an undisclosed fee in June 2015 and has played 45 games, but only 16 have been starts.
He is available to play in the FA Cup, having only been an unused substitute in the competition so far this season.
Wolves play Liverpool in the fourth round at Anfield on Saturday, 28 January.
