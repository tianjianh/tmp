The public have been warned not to approach Shane O'Brien, who is wanted following the killing of Josh Hanson.
Mr Hanson, 21, of Kingsbury, north-west London, was killed at the RE bar in Eastcote, Hillingdon, early on Sunday.
Scotland Yard said up to 40 people were in the bar when he was killed and directly appealed to Mr O'Brien, 27, of Ladbroke Grove, to contact them.
Mr Hanson, a roads planner, was confirmed dead at the scene, after being stabbed in the neck at about 01:10 BST.
"We are very keen to speak with Shane O'Brien as part of our ongoing inquiries," said Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh.
He described Mr Hanson as "a hard-working young lad, up at 5am for his job as a roads planner and often working seven days a week".
He said: "He had everything to live for and when he went out that Saturday night, no-one could have imagined what would happen to him. His family is in pieces.
"I would appeal directly to Shane to contact us, or ask that anyone who has seen him or who knows where he is to contact us as well."
The day after Mr Hanson died, his mother Tracey said those who knew him had "only good things to say".
"And this is being reflected in the offers of condolence to myself, his friends and family," she said.
"Please, if you know anything, come forward and tell police who committed this horrific murder."
