Swansea's 2-0 win at Sunderland means Hull - who are four points back - will be down if they lose at Selhurst Park.
"The pressure's on them and I'm sure they'll feel it a bit," said Carroll.
If Hull win or draw, the issue will be settled next Sunday when Swansea host West Bromwich Albion and the Tigers welcome Tottenham to the KC Stadium.
In the meantime, Swans manager Paul Clement is content with his side's efforts, saying they "can be happy" with their win at Sunderland.
Fernando Llorente put the visitors in front and Kyle Naughton scored his first for the club to seal victory.
"We got the job done," Clement said. "We'll be looking at the Palace v Hull game with a lot of interest.
"We've got ourselves into a strong position, but the season is not over and we don't think it is done. Now have to look to next week," Clement said.

Swansea captain Leon Britton also described beating the already relegated Sunderland as "a massive win".
The Black Cats had beaten Hull last weekend, but could not repeat the feat against against the Welsh side.
"We knew coming up here - playing before Hull - a win would put the pressure on," midfielder Britton said.
"And our support was brilliant. They were very vocal and it's been a difficult season for them - three managers and fighting relegation. They deserved that today."
Swansea-bred pundit John Hartson told the BBC: "Swansea have come into form at the right time and have won three out of four.
"They were rock bottom when Paul Clement came in so you have to give him huge credit.
"I know Fernando Llorente has been heavily linked with Chelsea, and Swansea won't want to lose him. He's been outstanding for the past three or four months."
