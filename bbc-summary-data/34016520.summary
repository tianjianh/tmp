Police said the animals were taken from Parks Farm in Beattock some time between 24 July and 17 August.
The lambs and ewes, which are texel cross with white faces, were taken from two fields.
PC Laura Paton said: "This is a large-scale theft of livestock and obviously a vehicle must have been used.
"We are appealing to anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity around the Beattock area over the past few weeks to get in touch with us."
