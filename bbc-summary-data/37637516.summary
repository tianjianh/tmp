Trailing 6-0 from the first leg, the visitors quickly fell further behind to the first of Anna Gerhardt's two goals.
Scotland international Lisa Evans made it 2-0 but there was some cheer for Hibs when Abigail Harrison thumped in a shot to make it 3-1 at half-time.
The Scottish part-timers fought gamely in the second half but Vivien Miedema completed the scoring for the hosts.
It was Hibs' first appearance in the knockout phase of the tournament, with the gulf in class apparent from the start of last week's encounter at Easter Road.
Hibernian manager Chris Roberts: "The team put in a special performance, demonstrating incredible passion and desire.
"Their work-rate was incredible and we showed a lot of quality on the ball. The goal is a special moment we can remember but the experience overall will help us grow and develop."
