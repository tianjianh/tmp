Not only had they spotted a pair of rare Southern Right Whales - one of them was an albino whale.
The completely white calf was closely following its mum as they swam around the shores of the Chile, which is unusual as the creatures are normally found near Argentina hundreds of miles away.
As you can see it was a real treat for these guys - who said it was a dream come true!
