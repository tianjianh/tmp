A 10-year-old child was injured by a museum's vintage trap, which was once used to catch large animals.

The boy had to be freed from the metal device by a fire crew at Torquay Museum on Thursday afternoon and was taken to hospital.
Its director said the trap was in a closed position and setting it would have taken "a considerable effort".
Basil Greenwood said he believed it had been "tampered with" and the museum has now been assessed as safe.
"It's called a spring trap and they were used in Victorian times for catching large animals," Mr Greenwood said.
Devon Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to the museum at 15:30 BST to free the child and attended for more than an hour.
Mr Greenwood said he believed the boy's hand had been punctured and he had been discharged from hospital.
"I believe the child was the innocent party in this," he continued.
"Somehow, this object was made into a dangerous state and I do not believe that would have been the child.
"It is very heavy and would have taken two strong individuals to set it."
He said there was a possibility that the boy tripped and hit the trap, although the circumstances remained a mystery and CCTV was being reviewed.
