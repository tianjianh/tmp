Kevin Nicholson: Torquay United boss says he feared sack after Guiseley loss

Torquay United manager Kevin Nicholson says the club's new owners would have been "well within their rights" to sack him given the team's poor results.

The Gulls, recently taken over by Gaming International, are two points from safety with one win in 10 games.
"Every time the phone rang on Sunday I was looking, because I thought that might've been it," said Nicholson.
"I got a call from Clarke Osborne and he spelt out, in no uncertain terms, that this isn't good enough."
Osborne, chairman of Gaming International, appointed Geoff Harrop as the club's general manager and ex-Fenerbahce scout Dave Hedges as head of recruitment earlier this month.
Nicholson blamed his side's "sketch show" defending for their National League defeat on Saturday by Guiseley, who played for around 40 minutes with 10 men.
"I think they'd have been well within their rights to have pulled the plug and removed me on Sunday because regardless of what you think, everything is always the manager's fault and that's how it should be," Nicholson added to BBC Radio Devon.
"[But] they spelt out exactly what they expect and then they've backed me, they've given me a little bit extra funding-wise to try and get one or two players in.
"This has been ongoing. We've had weeks now when the results haven't been right - we've promised a lot and not delivered. Well, we've got to deliver now."
