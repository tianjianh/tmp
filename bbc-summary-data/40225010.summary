Spalletti led Roma to the runners-up spot in 2016-17 before leaving on 30 May after 16 months in charge.
The 58-year-old has signed a two-year contract with Inter, who dismissed Stefano Piolo on 9 May.
An Inter statement said Spalletti will take first-team training from 3 July with the three-time champions of Europe.
Inter's ambitious Chinese owners, the Suning Group, are keen to restore the club's fortunes. They missed out on a place in Europe after finishing seventh in the season just finished, 29 points behind champions Juventus.
Last month, Inter Milan refused to comment on reports they were planning to offer Chelsea boss Antonio Conte a deal to replace Pioli.
