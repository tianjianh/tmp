The Championship club say they have paid a club-record fee for the 23-year-old, having only broken their previous record by signing MK Dons defender Kyle McFadzean on Tuesday.
Irvine, who has signed a three-year deal, made 45 appearances for Scottish top-flight side Ross County last term.
He won his fourth cap for Australia in their 2-1 defeat by England in May.
"He's an Australia international who has got good experience in Scotland with Celtic and most recently Ross County," Brewers boss Nigel Clough told the club website.
"He's still relatively young but he's one that we think can still improve with us and he wants a chance to play in England."
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre said: "After refusing a number of bids from Burton Albion, they submitted one that met Irvine's release clause and he has subsequently agreed terms.
"We reluctantly see Jackson head south."
