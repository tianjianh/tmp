[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hospital laundry life no picnic for lost teddy bear

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
He may not have travelled as far as Paddington but this teddy bear is a long way from home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bear, which has 2004 written on his right foot, ended up at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg Health Board's laundry department in Llansamlet, Swansea.
It is thought he may have accidently been picked up at one of its hospitals during a linen change.
Now staff are trying to reunite him with his owner.
