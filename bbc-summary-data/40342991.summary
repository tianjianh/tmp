Tributes have been paid in Manx parliament to broadcaster Ian Cannell CBE, who was known as "the voice of Tynwald".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
President of Tynwald Steve Rodan led tributes to Mr Cannell who died aged 83 on Saturday after a long-term illness.
He said the broadcaster was a "true friend of Tynwald" and his "dignified, fluent and informed commentary" had "illuminated proceedings" for 52 years.
Mr Cannell was made CBE in 2004 for his work with the Royal British Legion.
Mr Cannell, from Peel, was also the first official TT commentator for Manx Radio.
Mr Rodan said he truly was the "voice of Tynwald".
The Isle of Man's chief minister Howard Quayle said he made a "huge contribution to community life in the Isle of Man" and will be sadly missed.
