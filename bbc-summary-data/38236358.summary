Glasgow Warriors backs Peter Horne and Rory Hughes could miss Scotland's Six Nations Championship with ankle and knee injuries respectively.

The pair were carried off in the 16-15 Pro12 defeat by Munster last week.
Centre Horne, 27, sustained knee and ankle damage and is expected to be out for up to 16 weeks after ankle surgery. And winger Hughes, 23, is likely to miss eight weeks after knee surgery.
Scotland's Six Nations opener is at home to Ireland on 4 February.
"We knew it was going to be disappointing news, but it's actually not as bad as some of our worst fears," said Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend.
"It doesn't rule Pete out of all the Six Nations, so he'll have a target to comeback at some point during that period and hopefully play for us to get his match fitness."
Meanwhile, Warriors back-row Adam Ashe has stepped up his comeback from a hip injury and is being integrated back into training.
Second-rows Tjiuee Uanivi, Scott Cummings and Greg Peterson, along with centre Richie Vernon, are progressing well after shoulder injuries ahead of a return early in the new year.
