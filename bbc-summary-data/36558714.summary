Ryan Christie hopes to make an immediate impression on new manager Brendan Rodgers and force his way into the Celtic team for the coming season.

The midfielder has only started two games since joining from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in September, but he hopes to become a regular next term.
"I'm hoping to hit the ground running," 21-year-old Christie said.
"We've got a lot of big games before the leagues starts, so it's important to impress the manager straight away."
Christie was sold to Celtic last summer but immediately sent back to Caley Thistle on a season-long loan cut short by a knee injury in November.
Now the manager who signed him, Ronny Deila, has been replaced with Rodgers.
"I've been really looking forward to working with him ever since he was announced," said Christie of the former Liverpool and Swansea City boss.
"I think this kind of appointment shows how big a club Celtic really is, with the manager we can still attract.
"I think in terms of the way the club wants to go, it's shows we're very very positive.
"My mindset going into training next week is it's like a clean slate and your job to impress him every day in training and try to get in his thoughts of the season ahead."
Christie is unconcerned by the recent comments by Rangers' new signing, Joey Barton, who has already stirred up the rivalry ahead of the first Old Firm fixture of the season on 10 September.
Barton said Celtic captain Scott Brown was "not in my league" as a player.
"He likes to build it up a bit more, maybe make it more exciting," Christie said of the former Burnley midfielder.
"But, to be fair, it's not anything that's going to effect us, or any of our camp.
"He can focus on Rangers and we'll focus on us.
"It doesn't really affect me. I think the way he goes about his publicity is probably good because it attracts attention.
"Maybe that's what he wants, or Rangers wants, but for us, it's nothing really."
