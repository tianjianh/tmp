Sergei Canos fired the Bees ahead, but Jamie Paterson slotted in an equaliser shortly after half-time.
Scott Hogan latched on to Konstantin Kerschbaumer's through ball to restore the lead before the pair combined again for the striker's second.
Substitute Lasse Vibe smashed in after replacing Hogan, and John Swift capped Town's misery with a late fifth.
Brentford's excellent late season run of seven wins from their final nine matches took them away from danger and up to a ninth-place finish.
The Terriers, who won just one of their final eight games, ended the campaign in 19th, three places above the relegation zone.
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner: "To be honest we struggled from the first second and the goals we conceded were too easy.
"We tried to work but we were just too tired. The tank was empty."
Brentford head coach Dean Smith: "It was a great performance but the scoreline was very flattering for us because Huddersfield aren't a bad team.
"To finish ninth is a fantastic achievement for the club."
