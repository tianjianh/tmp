Two sniffer dogs from Flintshire have helped authorities in Tanzania seize a haul of elephant tusks.

Jenny, a Belgian Malinois, and Dexter, an English springer spaniel, discovered four tusks in a village outside Ruaha National Park.
The pair have been trained to detect ivory, bush meat and firearms by Holywell-based firm Wagtail UK.
Managing director Collin Singer said: "It is the first main success for the dogs so we are very pleased."
Mr Singer said the dogs had been searching a house when Jenny picked up a trace which led to a parked car outside.
The Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the project in Tanzania, said the tusks were concealed in plastic under the car and are thought to have been from "young elephants".
"Hopefully this is the first bust of many, and we hope this will give a boost to local people in the area," Mr Singer added.
