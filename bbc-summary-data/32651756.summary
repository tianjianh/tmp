[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Las Vegas judge has dismissed a lawsuit accusing blues legend BB King's business manager of financial and welfare abuse.

King's long-time manager Laverne Toney will remain in legal control of the 89-year-old's affairs.
Three of King's children claimed Toney was stealing money and neglecting the musician's medical care.
A judge said investigations found no evidence of abuse or reason to take power of attorney from Mr Toney.
"Mr King has counsel. I don't have anything here that says he lacks capacity. He has some serious health issues. But he has counsel. If he feels like he's being taken advantage of, he has remedies," the Family Court Hearing Master, Jon Norheim said.
King, who suffers from diabetes and is currently in home-hospice care, did not attend.
He was forced to cancel the remainder of a tour last October when he fell ill during a show, and was later diagnosed with dehydration and exhaustion.
The judge's ruling doesn't prevent King's children from returning to court to press their claim once all family members have been legally informed of the action.
"We lost the battle, but we haven't lost the war," his daughter Karen Williams vowed.
His eldest daughter Shirley King said the dispute had brought disrespect to her father's name.
"I'm not too sure things are right. But my dad would never want this," she said.
The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time.
He is known for such hits as The Thrill is Gone and Every Day I Have the Blues.
