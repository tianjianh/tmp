[SN]TITLE[SN]
Martin McGuinness 'willing to help' Independent Commission on Information Retrieval

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness has said he would be "absolutely willing" to go forward to a commission which would aim to provide relatives of Troubles victims with information about their deaths.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plans for the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval were set out in the Stormont House Agreement in December 2014.
Information given to the commission would be inadmissible in criminal and civil court cases.
The commission has not been established yet owing to a lack of political agreement on broader issues connected to the legacy of the Troubles.
During Question Time in the Assembly, the TUV MLA Jim Allister asked the Deputy First Minister if he would be willing to go forward to the commission.
Mr Allister asked: "Will he as an officer commanding in the IRA, lead by example and give information to the Information Retrieval Commission if it's to afford any hope to the many innocent victims of his IRA?"
Mr McGuinness said there "isn't much point" in establishing agencies to deal with the past "if people aren't prepared to go forward".
He added: "If I am required to go forward on any point of relevance to myself, I am absolutely willing to do that."
