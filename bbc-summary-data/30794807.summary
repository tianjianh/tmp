Kevin Pietersen: Eoin Morgan wants me in England side

Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen claims new one-day captain Eoin Morgan would "love" to have him in the side.

England ended the international career of Pietersen in February 2014.
"I know that the current captain would love to have me in the England team," said Pietersen while co-commentating on the Australian Big Bash Twenty20.
Ex-Australia captain and fellow commentator Ricky Ponting said some England players had bigger "egos" than Pietersen.
England start a one-day tri-series against hosts Australia and India on Friday, before the World Cup starts on 14 February.
Pietersen, who has scored 195 runs at an average of 39 for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash, said: "I want to play for England.
"I'm 34. Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara is 38 years old and has just scored a double hundred.
"I honestly believe I am batting as well as I have ever batted at the moment.
"I got over my knee injury, which was huge. Over the last 18 months I've just hated batting just because my knee has been so sore."
Morgan took over from Alastair Cook as England captain in December, before playing four games for Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash.
Pietersen, who has not played for England since the 5-0 Ashes Test series ended in January 2014, released a book later in the year in which he said there was a bullying culture in the dressing room.
In April last year England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton dismissed the chances of Pietersen ever playing for England again, saying: "The sooner we understand that Kevin has had his time, the better - I don't see any going back."
And just before Christmas, following the publication of Pietersen's controversial book, Downton told the Daily Telegraph: "If anything more bridges have been burned by Kevin's book. There is no interest from our point of view in going backwards."
During commentary on Tuesday former Australia captain Ponting said: "You were quoted in your book as saying if there was an Olympic race in your team for egos, you wouldn't be on the podium. Who would be?"
Pietersen responded by asking: "Who would you reckon would be on the podium?"
Ponting - who said egos were "a trait of champions" - did not name players but strongly hinted at Graeme Swann, Matt Prior, James Anderson and Stuart Broad.
He said: "I would probably say a right-arm off spinner, the guy that fielded behind the wicket and wore a bit of protection and maybe a couple of your fast bowlers would be the ones.
"You wouldn't probably don't even rank in the top four."
