Allardyce took charge of the Black Cats in October when they were winless in their opening eight matches, but guided them to 17th and safety.
"I don't want to go through that again," he told BBC Newcastle.
Allardyce added that he plans to discuss transfer targets with owner Ellis Short in the next few days.
Sunderland survived with a game to spare after victory over Everton with Allardyce describing it as a "miraculous achievement."
However the former West Ham and Bolton boss, who has never been relegated, says the club must learn from its mistakes this campaign.
"Our season has been a difficult one. I don't want to go through that again - that's the most important thing for me, not to put myself through what I did to get where we are today," he added.
"The turnaround has given me great satisfaction. It hasn't made me forget about when it was tough, and we have to make sure it doesn't happen again."
Sunderland ended the season with only one defeat in 11 games, and were unbeaten in their last six.
Allardyce plans to discuss summer signings with Short when he is back from a mini-break - a meeting that "will be one of great importance" according to the the 61-year-old.
"We will have a couple of days off and then see what the situation is," Allardyce said.
"I can't look or see in to the future. It looks very positive but until we need to get down and talk about it. Then we can move forward."
