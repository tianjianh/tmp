[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adam Coombes and Adam May struck their first goals for Sutton in guaranteeing another season in the fifth tier with a comfortable victory over Chester, who slumped to their fifth successive defeat but are unlikely to be relegated.

Sutton took control of the game with two goals inside the opening 10 minutes, first Coombes firing into the top corner from 25-yards with just five minutes on the clock before May doubled the lead three minutes later with a fierce 20-yard strike.
Jamie Collins made the points safe four minutes before half-time with a free-kick which floated over the wall and into the top corner with goalkeeper Alex Lynch rooted to the spot, and then supplied the cross for Coombes to head home his second in the 46th minute.
The hosts made it five in spectacular fashion as a corner was headed clear only for Nicky Bailey to rifle the ball home from 30-yards on the half-volley.
James Alabi took advantage of a mistake by goalkeeper Will Puddy to reduce the arrears in the 79th minute from a tight angle and three minutes later he struck again when he collected a pass from Tom Shaw, cut inside and fired home.
