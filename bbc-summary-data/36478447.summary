Three friends raised almost £5,000 in a cycle challenge - but then had their bikes stolen after they finished.

Ryan Webster, of Aberdeen, James Mackie, of Inverness, and Scott Hunter, of Bathgate, took up road cycling and signed up to do 150 miles for the Men United prostate cancer event.
Their padlocked bikes were stolen the day after the event, outside King's Cross St Pancras station in London.
They have now launched an appeal to raise £2,500 to buy replacements.
This is to allow them to continue to support various charities.
Mr Webster and Mr Hunter, both 28, and 30-year-old Mr Mackie bought the bikes earlier this year.
The charity cycle at the weekend took them from the Olympic Velodrome to Harwich ferry port, and then to the Netherlands to reach Amsterdam.
Mr Webster told BBC Scotland: "We have all had someone affected by cancer so it was a cause close to us all.
"We were buzzing, we had raised more than our target.
"But when we came back to the station on Sunday and the bikes were gone it was such a drop in feeling. We had thought they were secure.
"And the CCTV at the spot was facing the wrong way.
"The plan was to keep on cycling in future and raise more money for charity."
