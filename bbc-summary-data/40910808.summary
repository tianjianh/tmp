Supporters group Club 1872 invited Macmillan Cancer fundraiser John Burkhill to the home game against Hibernian after Rangers fans abused him in July.
Mr Burkhill was mistaken for a rival Celtic fan and harassed ahead of a friendly with Sheffield Wednesday.
The 78-year-old has completed over 980 races and raised more than £400,000.
Mr Burkhill, from Handsworth, walks miles each day pushing a pram and collecting money for Macmillan after losing his wife June to cancer.
Laura Fawkes, of Club 1872, said fans were "delighted" to have helped.
"Rangers fans raised £4,025 after they heard about an incident involving John and a small number of their fans before the club's pre-season friendly with Sheffield Wednesday," she said.
"John was presented with a cheque on the pitch at Ibrox at half time to support his ambition of raising £1 million for the charity."
Mr Burkhill - who has completed the London Marathon 16 times, the New York Marathon, every Sheffield Half Marathon and countless 10ks and local races - said the fans were "absolutely out of this world" and he was "really touched".
"It was only a small number of people and the vast majority were great with me so I'm just a little overwhelmed and I thank them for helping me get that bit closer to raising a million for Macmillan," he said.
"Thank you, Rangers, thank you very, very much. They're welcome to Sheffield any time they want."
Mr Burkhill was awarded a British Empire Medal in 2013 for his fundraising.
His grandson, Daniel, wore the green wig and pushed the pram for the time Mr Burkhill was in Glasgow.
