Minke whale dies after tail becomes tangled in rope

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An adult female minke whale has died after its tail became tangled up in rope, according to experts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The whale was one of a number that have been feeding off the north coast of Mull.
Last week, the whale was spotted dead in the sea off the island and later washed up on a remote shoreline of the Ardnamurchan Peninsula.
Staff of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust were able to reach its carcase on Tuesday.
Scientists at the Inverness-based Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme were able to confirm from tissue samples and photographs the entanglement was the "most likely" cause of its death.
