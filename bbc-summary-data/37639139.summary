Gardner, 29, has been with the Baggies since moving from Sunderland on a free transfer in the summer of 2014 and has made 81 appearances, scoring six goals.
His existing contract was set to expire at the end of the current campaign.
"I just want to keep playing Premier League football alongside some top players," Gardner said.
"This is a great family club and the lads are brilliant to play with."
