It is the first time the guild has declared a tie for best film in its 25-year history, another indicator that this year's Oscars race is wide open.
The PGA has correctly picked the film that has gone on to win best picture at the Oscars for the last six years.
Disney's Frozen won best animation and Behind the Candelabra won best TV film.
ABC's Modern Family picked up the best episodic comedy award, while Breaking Bad won for best episodic TV drama.
James Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson were among those given special honours for their contribution to film.
We Steal Secrets: The Story of Wikileaks, scooped best documentary, while The Voice won best competitive TV series.
Other winners included Sesame Street, which won outstanding children's programme.
The PGA awards followed hot on the tails of the Screen Actors Guild awards, which also took place this weekend - SAG voters eschewed both Gravity and 12 Years a Slave, choosing instead 1970s crime caper American Hustle for its top honour.
The Oscars take place on 2 March.
Voting among the 6,000 members runs from 14 to 25 February.
