Luke Wright: Sussex batsman steps down as county captain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Wright has stepped down as Sussex captain, saying the role has affected him "on and off the pitch".

Former England batsman Wright became Sussex's Twenty20 captain in 2015, before replacing Ed Joyce as skipper in the other two formats from last season.
The 32-year-old averages 22.28 with the bat in first-class cricket this season.
"After taking some time, I decided that stepping down was in mine and the club's best interests going forward," Wright said.
"I have always been someone that loves and enjoys the game, but over a period of time now while being captain, this has not been the case and it has affected me both on and off the pitch.
"I look forward to giving my full commitment as a player to future Sussex successes."
Sussex have won only one of their four County Championship Division Two games this season, while they were knocked out in the group stages of the One-Day Cup.
Opening batsman Chris Nash has been named as captain for Sussex's next Championship game against Worcestershire, which starts on Friday.
