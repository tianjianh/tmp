[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 0-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheltenham overcame the 18th-minute dismissal of midfielder Kyle Storer to hold in-form Mansfield to a draw at Whaddon Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The flashpoint arrived when Storer launched into Jamie McGuire with a full-blooded challenge on the halfway line in front of the visiting bench.
Referee Charles Breakspear wasted little time in brandishing a straight red card, with Robins manager Gary Johnson sent from the dugout in the aftermath.
Cheltenham were rocked, but the Stags - beaten just once in their previous 12 League Two outings, could not find a way through as Ben Whiteman scuffed horribly off target from two presentable openings.
The hosts began the second half on the front foot with Mansfield skipper Lee Collins getting a vital touch on Will Boyle's on-target header shortly before Liam Davis hit the crossbar straight from a corner on 51 minutes.
Whiteman miscued again from 18 yards just before the hour and Mansfield substitute Shaquile Coulthirst lifted the ball over from inside the box late on as Cheltenham secured a fourth successive clean sheet.
