The programme is being funded with a £432,000 grant from the Big Lottery Fund.
The cash will see more than 2,000 people given training.
Community support groups will also be set up to provide ongoing help and peer support for those involved in the schemes.
The money is part of £2.8m being handed to 13 projects in Wales as part of the lottery fund's People and Places programme.
Other recipients include £215,000 for an advocacy scheme for adults with autism spectrum disorders, and £234,000 for a programme promoting healthy relationships and highlighting the dangers of sexual exploitation.
