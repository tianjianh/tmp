Solitary bees aren't like honeybees that live in hives. They make their nests on their own and lay their eggs in tunnels.
To help them have somewhere to live, you can make your own bee hotel...
To make a bee B and B you'll need:
Get a grown up to help stick all of the sides of the box together with wood glue - leaving one side open. Then stick on the top and bottom of the box.
Put bamboo cane and other hollow materials into the box- ask a grown up to cut it down to size if necessary. The bees will nest and lay eggs in these tubes.
And there you have your bee B and B!
