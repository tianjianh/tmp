[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 2-0 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheltenham Town boosted their survival hopes with a win over Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yeovil were closest to opening the scoring during a poor first half on a difficult pitch, with Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro hitting the outside of the left post with a low shot two minutes into time added on.
Tin Plavotic also had to clear off the line after a low ball in from Tom Eaves caused real problems for Cheltenham.
But it was big defender Plavotic who opened the scoring in the 48th minute with the first goal of his loan spell from Bristol City.
He nodded James Rowe's free-kick powerfully past Artur Krysiak to give Cheltenham the lead.
The hosts doubled their advantage in the 63rd minute when Kyle Wootton was caught in the box by a high foot from Matt Butcher and referee Darren England pointed to the spot.
Billy Waters made up for missing a good chance nine minutes earlier by sending Krysiak the wrong way and netting his 14th goal of the season.
