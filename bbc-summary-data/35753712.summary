Lee Power: New deal for Swindon Town boss Luke Williams close, says chairman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swindon Town chairman Lee Power says manager Luke Williams could be given a new contract "fairly soon".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swindon have won six of their ten League One games since Williams took interim charge in December after Martin Ling resigned citing "health reasons".
In January, the 35-year-old former Brighton Under-21 and reserve team coach was made manager until the end of the 2015-16 season.
"Luke's come in and results speak for themselves," Power told BBC Wiltshire.
"That is something that we're looking at at the moment and, you know, it might happen fairly soon."
Swindon have risen to 12th in the table under Williams' management and are now only seven points outside the play-off spots.
"This season has been a bit transitional, it wasn't meant to be like that but through injuries and other reasons it's turned into one of those," Power said.
"At the moment we're on a good run and if we finish strongly it might actually be a fruitful season.
"But definitely, the crux of the team and a lot of the players that wouldn't necessarily have played if those injuries hadn't occurred have come on and are now some of the strongest players in the side
"It's definitely a team we're excited about for next season."
