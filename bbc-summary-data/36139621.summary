Salford Red Devils: Super League side to appeal against points deduction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salford Red Devils owner Marwan Koukash will appeal against the Super League side's six-point deduction and £5,000 fine for breaching salary cap rules.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Monday, an independent Rugby Football League tribunal ruled there had been a "serious breach" of the rules in 2014 and 2015, including exceeding the £1.825m cap in 2014.
The punishment leaves Salford second from bottom in the Super League table.
"I think the decision was an unfair one," Koukash said.
"We'll wait for the papers to come from the RFL and we'll study them so that we know what we're appealing against."
Koukash had earlier said that he would only appeal against the ruling "if the RFL can demonstrate to the club and to the sport that the proceedings will be independent".
He has also previously stated that he would be willing to contest the RFL's ruling in the "highest court of the land" if the tribunal decided against the club.
