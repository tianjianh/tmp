[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father killed his ex-partner and their two young children in a Leicester flat before hanging himself in a country park, a coroner has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The inquest ruled Aram Aziz, 32, unlawfully killed Joy Small, 24, their son Aubarr, two, and three-year-old daughter Chanara in Leicester.
Their bodies were found in her flat in Mowmacre on 12 February last year.
Aziz was found hanged at a birdwatching hut at Watermead Country Park in Leicestershire the day before.
At the first hearing, Coroner Catherine Mason, at Leicester Coroner's Court, ruled that Aziz had committed suicide.
Mrs Mason was told that in a note Aziz had left by his body he asked for the bodies to be buried in the Islamic way.
The note said: "I killed myself... Please keep our corpses together."
That note lead officers to the flat on Jersey Road where they found three bodies and a second note.
It said: "So I began by killing Joy and then killing the children by Aubarr and then Chanara and finally myself."
At a second inquest held immediately after the hearing into Aziz's death, Mrs Mason recorded unlawful killings verdicts for Ms Small, Aubarr and Chanara.
Mrs Mason heard that there was a history of domestic violence in the couple's relationship.
Aziz had previously threatened to kill Ms Small if he found her with another man.
He had been convicted of battering and was given a harassment order by police.
The hearing was told that there were missed opportunities in the way agencies dealt with the "vulnerable" family.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found that Leicestershire Police had contact with the family on at least eight occasions between 2006 and 2010.
Focusing on police handling of four of incidents in 2010, the IPCC said that while its investigation found no failings amounting to misconduct, it did identify the need for learning by some individual officers in relation to domestic abuse.
IPCC Commissioner Amerdeep Somal said: "Some appropriate steps were taken by police to help Joy Small at different times.
"This included their proactive actions to install an alarm at her address.
"However some incidents could have been handled and recorded better.
"The high risk assessment rightly applied to Ms Small by officers should have meant her being referred to an independent domestic violence advisor, but... this did not happen."
At the inquest, it was not revealed how Ms Small and her two young children died.
