[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ivan Cavaleiro's late penalty gave Wolves victory over Bristol City, condemning the Robins to a fourth successive defeat.

Dave Edwards' header put Wolves ahead inside the opening three minutes, only for City striker Tammy Abraham to fire in his 14th goal of the season.
Aden Flint then headed the visitors in front before half-time.
But Helder Costa's volley made it 2-2, and Cavaleiro scored from the spot after Flint's handball to win it.
There was more drama right at the very end of the match when Marlon Pack's header was cleared off the line, with City's players and supporters feeling it had snuck over.
But Wolves survived to record back-to-back victories for the first time since August, moving them above the Robins to 15th in the Championship table in the process.
City, whose manager Lee Johnson remonstrated with the referee on the pitch after full-time, slipped to 17th having lost 10 of their past 13 matches in all competitions.
Wolves boss Paul Lambert: "We were brilliant. The entertainment value is unbelievable. It really is.

"The chances we created and how exciting we are going forward is fantastic. There is a great bit of flair in the side which I have always wanted in my teams.
"Going forward we are a threat. We are still a million miles from where I want to be but we look different to the team that started in August.
"I would rather go through that than a 1-0 boring game."
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson:
"We have to be better, we are too easy to cut through at the moment.
"Our challenge is to turn these performances in our favour. There is not a lot wrong. A couple of players in key positions will help us.
"It is disappointing but we have to make sure that when we are 2-1 up we close up the game a lot better than we did."
