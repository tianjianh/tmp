The pupils, who are taking part in this year's BBC School Report, asked Ollie several challenging questions about many topics including - what it is like to be a journalist at such big events, the memorable highlights of the Sochi Games so far and Great Britain's progress.
Q - At this Winter Olympics, which countries have done particularly well and in what?
A - Holland are doing really well in speed skating in the 2014 Winter Olympics, claiming almost every single gold medal possible, and they are participating well. They have actually had a band of supporters that have been performing dressed completely in orange!
Q - So far Great Britain have won only two medals. Don't you get upset when Britain lose?
A - Well obviously I get upset, but I think it's worse for the athletes. They have obviously been training hard and to lose after that must be devastating. I have met athletes who lose and get really annoyed about training for four years only to lose. But that's what makes a great Olympian - when they lose, rather than give up they train harder to strive to get that goal.
Q - I've seen the Russian dancers - they seem to have a really big community spirit. Do you think there is more community spirit in Russia than over here in Britain?
A - I couldn't really tell because journalists don't really get to see that part. It was pretty cordoned off here but you do get a big sense of community spirit. All countries have community spirit in their own way - especially in Britain you see quite a lot of the community working together.
Q - We are speaking to you on the second Wednesday of the Games. Could you tell us what has happened today?
A - The British women's curling team has been knocked out, but is still in with a chance of winning the bronze. (Russian) Vic Wild's wife has won bronze, and he won gold within about 15 minutes of her (both in the snowboarding)!
Q - I know there have been some security threats recently - how are people coping with this and do you think they have affected the Games at all?
A - At the start that was one of the big concerns for the Sochi Games. There were hundreds of reports about security threats, but because of the number of security staff it's like going through an airport - every day I have to have my baggage scanned and checked. I feel like this is the safest place I can possibly be in!
Throughout the day, the women's and men's curling semi-finals took place, bringing victory to Canada and Sweden's teams of women and excitement to the Ice Cube Curling Centre as crowds gathered to witness the men's curling semi-finals.
Soon after the interview, Russia's Vic Wild claimed Winter Olympic gold in the men's snowboard parallel giant slalom (as Ollie mentioned) - beating his biggest rival, Nevin Galmarini from Switzerland.
Shortly after that, Norway won the gold medal in the biathlon mixed relay, pursued by the Czech Republic and Italy.
