Manny Pacquiao: Boxing return against Jessie Vargas down to money

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao has admitted money is the reason for his return to the ring.

He was elected to the Senate of the Philippines in May but is coming out of retirement to fight welterweight champion Jessie Vargas in November.
"Boxing is my main source of income. I can't rely on my salary as a public official," said Pacquiao, 37.
"I'm helping the family of my wife and my own family, as well. Many people also come to me to ask for help."
Pacquiao's manager Michael Koncz confirmed that a promotional tour for the fight would be held from 8-10 September in Los Angeles, USA but a venue for the fight is yet to be announced.
Pacquiao said he would return to the Philippines straight after promoting the fight to fulfil his political duties.
Filipino boxing pundit Ronnie Nathanielsz has warned that fighting 27-year-old WBO champion Vargas is "dangerous" for Pacquiao.
"Manny has slowed down in recent years, he certainly isn't the fighter he was before, which means he's past his prime," he added.
Pacquaio first fought in 1995 and has lost only six of his 66 contests, with 38 wins by knockout. He originally retired after beating Timothy Bradley by unanimous decision in April.
American Vargas has lost only once in 28 bouts - by a unanimous decision to Bradley in June 2015 - with 10 wins by knockout.
