In the past year more than 90% of girls aged between 12 and 13 have had the treatment, an NHS spokeswoman said.
The vaccine, which consists of three injections over a six-month period, is given in secondary schools and at community clinics.
HPV causes most types of cervical cancer.
Dr Lincoln Sargeant, consultant in public health medicine at NHS Cambridgeshire said: "We are very pleased with the response to the HPV vaccination programme across the county.
"In the UK cervical cancer is the twelfth most common women's cancer."
