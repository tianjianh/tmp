Vincent Kompany: Man City captain has treatment on groin injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City have set no date on a return for captain Vincent Kompany, who is having treatment on the groin injury suffered during his comeback match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The centre-back, 30, left the pitch just before the end of Wednesday's 2-1 EFL Cup victory over Swansea.
Kompany, who had thigh surgery during the summer, was making his first appearance since May 4.
His injury is not a recurrence of the calf problem that restricted him to 14 league appearances last season.
City have stayed in south Wales since Wednesday's match, as they are away to Swansea again on Saturday (15:00 BST) in the Premier League.
