The Danes - aged 21, 22 and 24 - took the substance thinking it was cocaine.
Dutch police have released an image of the man believed to have sold the drug to the three visitors.
This is the first case of white heroin in Amsterdam since the deaths of Shaun Brotherston and Bradley Price last year.
The friends from Plymouth were found dead in their hotel room in November with heroin in their systems.
It's thought they believed they were being sold cocaine - not white heroin - and overdosed.
Since September, 20 people have been treated in hospital after taking the drug. Three have died.
Newsbeat spoke to Amy Totterdell - the girlfriend of 21-year-old Shaun Brotherston.
"You think it's not going to happen... but it does.
"Drugs were never a part of Shaun's life. That's why it was such a shock for this to have happened."
Amsterdam police told Newsbeat at the time they didn't think the dealer was deliberately selling white heroin - a purer form than the more common brown heroin - as cocaine.
"We don't know if the man [in the photo] is connected to previous white heroin incidents," a police spokesperson told us today.
"After receiving treatment the three tourists have been released from hospital and flown back to Denmark."
