Stage three on 8 September will start in Cumbria but finish at Floors Castle in Kelso via Gretna.
The following day the race will resume in Edinburgh before heading south to Northumberland.
Paul Bush of EventScotland said the "stunning scenery" of the area would provide a "perfect stage" for the race.
"The Edinburgh start in particular will be of particular interest to Scottish cycling fans as we see the peloton ride through the capital for the very first time," he said.
"With excitement and passion for cycling at a record high following the hugely successful road race at the Commonwealth Games last year, we look forward to welcoming some of the world's top riders to Scotland once again."
The first stage to come into Scotland starts in Cockermouth but will cross the border at Gretna and head through Dumfries and Galloway before racing through Hawick, Selkirk and Melrose before finishing in Kelso.
The following day it will leave Edinburgh and pass through Musselburgh, East Lothian, Duns and Coldstream before crossing back into England.
"The return of such a prestigious event emphasises our ability to host high-profile events here in the Borders and is further recognition of the fact that the Scottish Borders is Scotland's leading cycling destination," said Stuart Bell of Scottish Borders Council.
Councillor Richard Lewis, Edinburgh's new festivals and events champion, said it was an "exciting event" for the city.
"Elite cyclists from all over the world will descend on the capital and the dramatic backdrop of Edinburgh's winding streets will make for a spectacular sight," he said.
"This is going to be a must-see event for both local people and visitors to the city."
Race director Mick Bennett said: "This year's route gives us the fantastic opportunity to have two days of racing in Scotland and to make first visits to the east of the Scottish Borders and Edinburgh," he said.
"I am sure many cycling fans will be excited, just like we are, at the prospect of seeing the world's top riders on the streets of the Scottish capital, and will hopefully use the race as an opportunity to visit the areas we pass through".
