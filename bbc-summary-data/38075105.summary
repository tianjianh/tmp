He said: "This decision... is absolutely huge for the people of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.
"We are talking about £600m for infrastructure, £170m for housing, we're going to be able to decide locally what to do with skills funding and this give the people an opportunity to directly elect their mayor."
Cambridge City Council was the seventh and final authority to vote in favour of the deal at its full council meeting on Tuesday.

Seventy million pounds over five years has been ring-fenced to the city council for a Cambridge Housing Plan.
It will be spent on plans for more than 500 new council homes.
There will be a £100m affordable housing fund over five years across the combined authority area, and a new £20m annual fund for the next 30 years to support economic growth, development of local transport infrastructure and jobs.
​Arrangements to hold elections for a mayor in May will get under way alongside setting up a shadow combined authority.
