[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff rapist's failed appeal bid gets him longer sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rapist who attacked a student as she walked home during freshers' week has been given an extended sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Remus Hamza, 41, of Riverside, Cardiff, was jailed for 12 years in February 2016 for raping the 20-year-old and was also given four years on extended licence.
He took his case to the Court of Appeal in London, arguing this was too severe.
But judges said his appeal was "totally without merit" and gave him an extra 28 days in prison for wasting court time.
Hamza claimed he had consensual sex with his victim, but was found guilty after a trial.
He had also previously exposed himself to three young women in the same area.
The woman was walking home along Museum Avenue in the early hours of 20 September 2015 after losing her friends while on a night out.
Hamza grabbed her and raped her in nearby bushes. He fled after a passer-by spotted him and called the police.
Judge Sarah Munro QC said the victim suffered serious psychological harm as a result of the attack.
Hamza's lawyers argued the crown court judge made the wrong assessment of how serious his crime was and did not take enough account of the fact he would have to serve two thirds of his jail term before his release can be considered.
Dismissing his appeal, Judge Munro said it was "not arguable" the sentence was excessive.
She added: "The provisions relating to early release and licence should be left out of the picture when determining sentence. There is no merit whatsoever in this appeal."
