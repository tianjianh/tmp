Head coach Danny Wilson has described Cardiff Blues as "mentally weak" for their second half collapse at Gloucester in the European Challenge Cup quarter-finals.

Blues led 26-20 after 50 minutes, but conceded four unanswered tries as Gloucester won 46-26.
"For 50 minutes of the game, we were really good and should have been further ahead," said Wilson.
"What unfolded in the next 15-20 minutes was unacceptable."
In the first half there were two tries by Gloucester-bred Blues wing Alex Cuthbert to one by Gloucester's Wales back-rower Ross Moriarty and another from full-back Tom Marshall.
Blues led 23-20 at the break, but after Steven Shingler kicked their last points, the hosts Jonny May, Marshall, Mark Atkinson and Henry Purdy went over.
"Gloucester finished well but I'm incredibly frustrated at the way we collapsed," said Wilson.
He added: "Sport throws you curve balls and that has thrown me, or us, a massive curveball in terms of what happened in that last 15-20 minute period.
"We've got to look at that and build on the positives from the 50 minutes and the rugby we were playing and look and try and find out why we ended up as we did and, if I'm brutally honest, as mentally weak as we looked in that last 30 minutes."
There are four rounds left in the regular Pro12 season.
Blues travel to Ulster in that cross-border competition on Friday hoping to redeem themselves with a win that could help them replace Connacht in seventh.
There are 13 points between eighth-placed Blues and Glasgow, who are in sixth, while Edinburgh are 16 points below Blues in ninth.
"It looks like a seventh-place battle between us and Connacht," said Wilson.
