"We have won in F1 as a team and as an engine supplier," he said. "There is no reason why we cannot repeat that."
Renault have also confirmed they have dropped Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado from their driver line-up.
Former McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen will partner Jolyon Palmer for 2016, with Esteban Ocon as reserve.
Frenchman Frederic Vasseur will run the team, with experienced engineer Bob Bell as chief technical officer.
The car Renault unveiled has a predominantly black livery with flashes of yellow, which is the company's corporate colour.
But Renault Sport Racing president Jerome Stoll implied the livery could change before the first race of the season in Australia on 20 March and a spokeswoman said the colours seen on Wednesday were temporary and would only be used for testing.
Renault chief executive Carlos Ghosn said: "We are not here [just] to participate, we are here to compete at the highest level and eventually win. It's not going to happen in 2016 - it's going to take more time."
He set a target of podium appearances in the next three years.
Renault must continue to rebuild the Lotus team they took over last year and improve their engine, which has lagged badly behind the Mercedes power-unit since the introduction of turbo hybrid engines in 2014.
