Billy Redmayne, 25, and from the Isle of Man, sustained severe head injuries in the crash and passed away in hospital in Middlesbrough on Monday.
Redmayne had already won the Junior Manx Grand Prix in 2015 and was set to make his TT debut this summer.
A Manx Motorcycle Club spokesman said he "made a huge impact on the sport".
The Bob Smith Spring Cup meeting at Scarborough was abandoned following the Manx soldier's accident at the weekend.
Redmayne was a serving member of the Parachute Regiment for eight years and completed three tours of Afghanistan.
This year his regiment had given him their full support to pursue his road racing ambitions.
Jim Hunter of the Manx Motorcycling Club, who organise the Manx Grand Prix, said he was a "modest and very unassuming character with an immense talent".
He added: "He was a real kingpin in the paddock. Everybody appreciated his opinion and everybody looked up to him. He made an huge impact on our event. It is such a sad loss for all of us."
TT riders and road racing fans have paid their tributes on social media.
Twenty-three time TT winner John McGuinness tweeted: "Really sorry to hear the terrible news of the passing of Billy Redmayne. Thoughts are with family and friends at this moment #RIPmate."
Meanwhile, fellow Manx racer Conor Cummins tweeted: "Terrible to read of the passing of Billy Redmayne this morning. No doubt a talented young rider. My prayers are with his family and friends."
TT organiser Paul Phillips said Redmayne was a "smart, ambitious and talented young man".
