Injuries have hampered preparations for two of Britain's leading title contenders ahead of the first golf major of the year.

Charley Hull and Melissa Reid are both struggling ahead of the ANA Inspiration which starts at Mission Hills Country Club, Rancho Mirage on Thursday.
Hull has a wrist injury and said: "It's an old fracture and always going to be there."
Reid has a back problem and says she is "80% fit."
Both are hoping to be fit for the tournament.
Hull, who was second in 2016 behind world number one Lydia Ko, pulled out of last week's Kia Classic after aggravating her wrist when hitting out of the rough.
"It's like a chip out of the bone and I inflamed it," added the 21-year-old.
"I should be fine to play this week. I will sleep with it strapped and do everything else except golf with it strapped but when I play I will take it off."
Reid is battling a back problem which led to a missed cut at last week's Carlsbad event in California.
She told BBC Sport: "I've really struggled with my back, I think I only had one practice day in 10 going into last week so I went there to kind of prep for this week more than anything."
Reid is hoping the adage of "beware the injured golfer" will apply on the Dinah Shore Course this week.  "It's kind of good in a way because I'm not expecting very much this week, it would be a bonus if I played well," she said.
"I'm just trying to do my maintenance. It is a long process for me to be fully fit and keeping healthy is the main thing."
The injury is a source of great frustration for the 29-year-old after succeeding in a "make or break" bid to secure her playing rights on the LPGA Tour.
"I would honestly say that was the biggest achievement in my career, coming through Q school," said the six times winner on the Ladies European Tour.
"I put a lot of pressure on myself to get it.  I didn't want to play full time in Europe any more and I wanted the option of playing in America as well.
"I needed it for my career, I felt I had got a little bit stale out in Europe and this where I want to be.  I want to be with the best golfers in the world playing some of the best tournaments in the world.
"It's given me my hunger back for the game.  I want to say it is life changing and we are considering moving out here at the end of the year."
Reid and Hull are joined by fellow Britons Catriona Matthew and Jodi Ewart Shadoff in the $2.7m (Â£2.1m) tournament which is one of five majors on the women's circuit.
