[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff centre to 'celebrate' Welsh language planned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Welsh language and cultural centre could be developed in the heart of Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The aim of the proposed facility is to celebrate and protect the language, as well as provide a space for residents and visitors to speak Welsh.
Cabinet members will be recommended to authorise the development at the Old Library at a meeting on Thursday.
Funding would come from a Â£1.25m Welsh government pot aimed at creating similar facilities around the country.
The centre would be run alongside the Cardiff Story museum which is already at the Old Library, on The Hayes.
Among the bodies set to be involved are Cardiff University, which would run Welsh language courses, nightspot Clwb Ifor Bach, which would showcase Welsh bands, and broadcaster S4C, which would provide interactive equipment for children.
If permission is granted, the new joint facility would be called Yr Hen Lyfrgell (The Old Library) and would include a cafe bar, book shop, teaching rooms, and exhibition, performance and conference space.
