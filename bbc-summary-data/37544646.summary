[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Wales mortgage fraud three must repay criminal gains

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three people involved in one of the UK's biggest mortgage frauds, worth up to £24m, must repay some of the money they made.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-policeman Antony Lowry-Huws, 68, of Kinmel Bay, and Sheila Whalley, 70, of Abergele, were jailed in 2013 after duping lenders across north Wales.
Lowry-Huws' wife Susan, 63, who got a suspended sentence, must pay back the largest amount of £75,790.
The three were convicted of conspiracy to defraud along with two others.
At a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Mold Crown Court, it was agreed Antony Lowry-Huws and Whalley made £4m each from their crimes.
Lowry-Huws was ordered to repay £27,905, while developer Whalley will give back £18,350.
His wife, who was said to be on the periphery of the scam and under the influence of her husband, benefited £896,351 and must pay back £75,790.
During the trial, the court heard mortgage lenders were conned into lending thousands of pounds in mortgages on properties across north Wales, Cheshire and the north west of England.
The prosecution said the deceit was achieved by inflating the value of the property used as security, hiding that in some cases no deposit was put down, or inflating the rental income potential to make the mortgage rate more acceptable.
In some cases the homes on which mortgages were advanced did not exist.
