Kuenssberg became political editor last July and has been at the forefront of the corporation's Brexit coverage.
The judges said: "In a tumultuous year [Kuenssberg] rose to the challenge and made the story of Brexit her own."
The Guardian and BBC Panorama were named joint winners of investigation of the year for the Panama Papers scandal.
The Marie Colvin Award was given to Syrian citizen journalists reporting for the Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently group.
Abdalaziz Alhamza, one of the site's founders, picked up the award, saying: "Our work shows that we can fight arms with words, and that ultimately is the only way to defeat them, and Isis knows it."
The judges said of their decision: "Given what those people have done and the price they have paid, it would be odd to put anyone ahead of them."
Channel 4 journalist Waad Al-Kateab, currently trapped in Aleppo, Syria, won the foreign journalism prize, with judges praising her "sensitive, visceral reports" that showed "immense bravery".
Press Gazette editor Dominic Ponsford told the audience the journalism industry faced "a constant fight for survival".
He said: "The work on display helps explain why what we do is important - and why it should be cherished and encouraged.
"This event aims to bang the drum for the best of what we do as the British industry, which holds everyone else to account."
