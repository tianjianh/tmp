Union members have voted to reject a new pay offer from the Offshore Contractors Association.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unite said 81% of those who took part in the consultative ballot turned down the offer. And 61% of GMB members participating did likewise.
The unions will now consult about the next step to be taken.
The Offshore Contractors Association said it was "extremely disappointed" and the priority was to find ways of avoiding industrial action.
Unite regional officer Tommy Campbell said: "We have repeatedly warned the OCA employers and other offshore employers that we cannot simply have a race to the bottom, with companies competing with each other to suppress the pay and conditions of offshore workers."
GMB National Officer Dave Hulse said: "This result comes as little surprise given the attacks our members have faced on their pay, terms and conditions in recent years. The offer the employers have made is just not up to scratch.
"Our members believe that over recent times they have been treated with contempt - enough is enough."
Paul Atkinson, chief executive of the OCA, said: "We are extremely disappointed that members of the trade unions who took part in the consultative ballot have rejected our pay offer.
"Our priority is to find ways of avoiding industrial action. We will continue to maintain an on-going dialogue with union officials in an attempt to bring this to a resolution."
In December, a previous offer was also rejected.
