More than 16 million drivers are set to take to UK roads, with four million travelling on Good Friday and 4.5 million on Easter Sunday.
Arriva Trains says passengers in Wales will face delays if travelling to London due to engineering works.
Details of affected services can be found on Arriva Trains Wales website.
Motorists can check for planned works, delays or latest incidents on the Traffic Wales website.
A South Wales Police spokesman said: "Motorists are advised to take note of travel information and allow plenty of time for their journeys."
Motoring organisation the RAC said the millions travelling would make it "hectic" on UK roads this weekend.
A spokesman said: "The first spring bank holiday of the year traditionally heralds the start of busier weekends.
"This Easter is set to be a hectic one.
"We recommend considering starting a journey earlier in the day if the plan is to drive a long distance."
It is also expected to be a busy weekend at Cardiff Airport with more than 11,000 passengers expected to fly to and from the Welsh capital.
Topping the list of destinations from Cardiff is Amsterdam with Dublin, Tenerife and Malaga also popular as Easter getaways.
