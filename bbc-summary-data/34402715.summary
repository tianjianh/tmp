The 43-year-old said he accepted responsibility for their performance in the 5-1 loss at Gillingham on Tuesday.
The former Scotland international took over at Highbury Stadium in 2012 and guided them to promotion, winning the League Two play-off final in 2014.
Fleetwood sit 20th in the table, with just two wins from 10 games, a point above the relegation places.
"It is an extremely unpleasant part of being chairman having to make such a decision," chairman Andy Pilley told the club website.
"However ultimately, for a number of reasons, I felt this was in the best interests of the club.
"I would like to place on record my personal thanks for the success Graham brought us with the promotion to League One, his supreme professionalism and for all the hard work he invested over his time here at Fleetwood, and wish him all the best for the future."
Last season was their first ever in the third tier and Alexander guided the Cod Army to a 10th-placed finish just six points off the play-off places.
Alexander had a playing career spanning 22 years, where he featured for Scunthorpe, Luton, Burnley and had two spells at Preston.
The club are yet to announce who will take charge of the first team for their game at Scunthorpe on Saturday.
