Northern Ireland's new churches: The impact of immigration on religious life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Immigration has brought huge changes to Northern Ireland over the last decade, and religious life has been impacted as well.

Migrants are not only joining local congregations, but setting up their own churches too. The number of churches in Northern Ireland led by migrants has risen to more than 30 in recent years.
These new churches are not only attracting people from ethnic minorities, but intriguing locals.
The Redeemed Christian Church of God is a Nigerian-based church, but has become the fastest growing denomination in the UK and Ireland.
They have set up three churches in Northern Ireland within the last eight years. The congregation includes people from a variety of African nations, the Caribbean, and both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
Chris Ifonlaja, who runs one of their Belfast churches with his wife, says it appeals to people because it is a "neutral place".
"We did not experience the Troubles," he said. "We see that as a blessing because we don't see all of the division, we just see people."
The couple said they were conscious of the possibility that migrants joining their church may be slower to integrate into Northern Ireland.
Angela Ifonlaja said "we didn't come to run a church for migrants, it's just a church".
"But I think what happens is when you go into a place where you are new in that place, it's natural that you gravitate towards those that you identify with, at least on a physical level," she added.
Other churches have decided to make a permanent physical commitment to Northern Ireland.
Iglesia Ni Cristo or Church of Christ, are headquartered in the Philippines. They began meeting in a house in Belfast 10 years ago with only a handful of people. In 2014, they purchased an old church on University Avenue and refurbished the whole building.
The converted church has only been open a few months.
Brother Philip Velasquez is the minister, and he said that his church is reversing the traditional flow of mission.
"It is very rare for a religious organisation which began in the far east - in an impoverished country - to actually spread its mission throughout the whole world to first world countries," he said.
"We're not only growing because of the immigration of Filipinos but also because of the conversion of many people who belong to those first world countries."
These new churches may still be small in number, but they are seeing growth at a time when many traditional churches are losing members, and are challenging the old divisions in Northern Ireland.
There will be more information on the new churches on BBC Newsline on Thursday and Friday at 18:30 BST.
