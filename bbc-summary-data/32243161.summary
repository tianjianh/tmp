A plan to make it easier for young people to rent homes in Wales has been proposed by the Liberal Democrats.

They say 18-30 year olds could borrow up to Â£1,500 from the government for a deposit, which would have to be paid off within two years.
The party says it will launch 'Help To Rent' in England, if it is in the UK government after the general election.
The Lib Dems say they would also make money available for Welsh ministers to bring in the policy across Wales.
To be eligible for the scheme, tenants would need to be in work and not be home owners or seeking social housing tenancy.
The Conservatives have called for an increase in housebuilding as part of their 'Vision For Welsh Housing'.
Labour wants to overhaul the law relating to renting, giving tenants more protection.
Plaid Cymru supports rent controls to help tenants and say the Liberal Democrat policy is "misguided".
UKIP says it would prioritise social housing for people with parents born locally.
