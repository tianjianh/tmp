A seven-year-old boy has written to a football club asking for the job as team manager.

The handwritten application follows the departure of John Hughes from Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
Writing to chairman Kenny Cameron, Ewen says he can speak to his headmaster to "see if he would be up for me leaving school early for important matches".
He adds: "I'm sure it won't be a problem as long as the players chip in and help me with my homework."
The Scottish Premiership club has published the letter on its website with the message: "We think Ewen could be a top contender for the vacant ICTFC managerial position....what do you think?"
Previous football vacancies, including at Celtic at the time of Ronny Deila's appointment, have attracted applications from young football fans. Recent years have also seen a nine-year-old seek the top job at Bolton Wanderers.
The youngster points out in his application that he has attended several football courses for young people and plays for his school's team.
He requests that Inverness player Richie Foran, who has been linked with the vacancy, be his assistant manager.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle confirmed the departure of manager Hughes earlier this month.
The 51-year-old had been negotiating a release from his contract following a rift with the board over his budget.
Hughes joined the Highlanders in December 2013 and won the Scottish Cup last year, the club's first major honour.
He had become increasingly frustrated at the loss of key squad members and spoke of his disappointment when an approach from Dundee United was blocked earlier this season.
