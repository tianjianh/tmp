Disappointing Saturday for Ulster teams in women's Irish Hockey League

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster's four clubs in the women's Irish Hockey League endured a disappointing Saturday, with Pegasus the only side not to lose.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pegasus dominated their game against Pembroke Wanderers but had to settle for a 1-1 draw.
Jill Ringwood gave Pembroke an early lead but Michelle Harvey equalised.
Ulster Elks, Belfast Harlequins and Ards were all beaten as Hermes-Monkstown remained two points clear at the top.
Ringwood scored after six minutes for Pembroke and it took until the 47th minute for Harvey to find the back of the net to earn a draw from her side's 12th penalty corner.
That goal earned a draw but it is a result that leaves the Belfast side in sixth place in the table.
The point for Pembroke moved them ahead of Belfast Harlequins and Ulster Elks in the three-team battle to avoid relegation.
The Elks lost 1-0 at Cork Harlequins with Michelle Barry getting the only goal of the game and they remain bottom on goal difference from Harlequins who were beaten 6-0 by Railway Union at Deramore.
The scoreline was flattering to the visitors and had Harlequins converted a couple of good first half chances the result might have been different.
Former Irish international Kate Dillon opened the scoring in the first quarter and two goals in the second quarter from Anna May Whelan and a penalty stroke from Orla Fox made it a mountain to climb for Harlequins.
Dillon, with her second, Zara Delaney and Kate Orr scored in the second half.
At the top of the table Hermes-Monkstown maintained their two point lead over UCD after a 4-0 home win over Ards.
Internationals Anna O'Flanagan, with another domestic hat-trick, and Chloe Watkins with a penalty stroke were the scorers.
An Orla Patton goal was enough for UCD to beat Loreto 1-0.
Saturday's results mean that the Ulster sides fill four of the bottom five places in the league.
