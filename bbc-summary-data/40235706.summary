Mica Moore is hoping her Winter Olympics and Commonwealth Games double remains on track after being crowned Welsh 100m champion.

The 24-year-old won the sprint at the 100th Welsh Athletics Championships in 11.69secs.
Moore has just returned to bobsleigh training in preparation for the Winter Olympics in South Korea next February.
The Commonwealths are staged on Australia's Gold Coast the following April when Moore is hoping to run.
"It is possible and the timings work quite nicely," said Moore.
"Both competitions are going to need a massive amount of hard work and commitment.
"It would be amazing but I am realistic with my goals.
"It's such an exciting time and I am looking forward to what's happening in the next year.
"We have just started back in bobsleigh training and I am sure the two sports will help each other in the summer.
"The bobsleigh work is helping my athletics start and given me a lot more power there. The running is helping my bobsleigh in terms of keeping up with the sled."
Moore was pleased with her form on the track after winning the Welsh title in Cardiff.
"I knew it was going to be tough but the season has gone well," said Moore.
"The last two years have been difficult through injury and illness so I am glad to be back in some kind of form."
Moore is still outside the Commonwealth Games individual qualification standards and believes the most realistic chance of reaching the Gold Coast would be a relay place.
She was part of the Wales 4x100m quartet who reached the Commonwealth final in Glasgow three years ago, but there are no guarantees there will be a relay squad selected to go to Australia next year.
"The relay is one of the better opportunities because the standards are so tough and quite a lot of people have qualified already," said Moore.
"We are looking to do a couple of relays with Welsh Athletics and hope to do a good time."
This would be two months after the Winter Olympics where Moore is trying to book a place in the bobsleigh pair.
Moore only made her debut in the sport in November 2016 and was crowned World Junior gold medallists with Mica McNeill before the pair finished 16th in the senior World Championships.
"Bobsleigh was quite scary at times but I really enjoyed it," said Moore.
"I am looking forward to getting back and working hard and trying to secure a place in the Olympics."
