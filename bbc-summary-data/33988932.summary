County Championship: Surrey's Tom Curran cuts through Gloucestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pace bowler Tom Curran took 6-61 as promotion-chasing Surrey enjoyed a good opening day against Gloucestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old pushed his season's wickets tally past 50 at Bristol as the home side were all out for 233.
Gloucestershire's top order failed, with the exception of Gareth Roderick, who hit 12 fours in his 71.
James Fuller (48) and Tom Smith (47 not out) put on 57 before Curran broke the stand by bowling the former, and Surrey reached 74-2 in reply at close of play.
Surrey went into the game needing a maximum of 43 points from four matches to be sure of a return to Division One next summer.
And they reduced the home side to 63-4 after Curran's younger brother Sam (2-47) had Will Tavare lbw in the second over.
Only Roderick was able to come to terms with the youthful pair, aged just 20 and 17, but he was one of three wickets to fall in five overs immediately after lunch when he edged a ball from Tom Curran to the wicketkeeper.
Fuller and Smith batted well, but having picked up maximum bowling points, Surrey will now be looking to do likewise with the bat despite losing both openers before the close.
Surrey bowler Tom Curran told BBC London 94.9:
"Having a bit of cloud cover, the ball swung nicely for the boys and I think we stuck at it well.
"Sam (Curran) swung it nicely up front and I'm pleased for him to get a couple more wickets, he bowled nicely.
"I'm really happy to go past 50 wickets and to get six wickets against Gloucestershire I'm very very pleased, but the job's not done."
