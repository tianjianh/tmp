English rose to prominence  when he played Judas in the Australian version of Jesus Christ Superstar in the 1970s.
He went on to become a fixture on Australia's music scene, and also had a successful television career, starring in the local sitcom All Together Now.
English died on Wednesday due to post-operative complications, weeks out from an expected Australian tour.
A Facebook post announced to fans two weeks ago that English's Trilogy of Rock shows would be cancelled due to "unexpected ill health".
"Jon is currently hospitalised and waiting to undergo a small operation, but is expected to make a full recovery over the coming weeks," the post said.
But English died on Wednesday, his management confirmed in a statement.
"It is with great sadness that we commemorate the passing of Jon English," the statement said.
"At the time of his passing he was surrounded by family members, including his four children, wife Carmen, sister Janet and brother Jeremy, as well as other close family members."
Details of a public memorial will be released shortly.
