The 36-year-old Poland international provided cover for first-choice centre-backs Wes Morgan and Robert Huth last season, starting just eight games.
He said on Instagram: "Signed a new contract. I am glad I will be one year longer part of this team and club."
Wasilewski joined City on a free transfer in the summer of 2013.
He has made a total of 72 appearances for the club, scoring two goals.
The centre-half has won 60 international caps but last played for Poland in 2013 and is not in their squad at Euro 2016.
