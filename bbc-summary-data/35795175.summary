Paris St-Germain wrapped up the French league title in emphatic style and Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus all took further strides towards winning their respective leagues over the weekend.

But what else happened in Europe? Here are the stories you may have missed.
FC Rostov have never finished higher than sixth in the Russian Premier League but they could be on their way to an unlikely title triumph.
Saturday's 2-0 win over CSKA Moscow took them above CSKA to top of the table, with 10 games to go, thanks to their superior head-to-head record.
Rostov, based in southern Russia, did win the country's domestic cup competition in 2014 to gain a place in the Europa League.
But they have been plagued by financial problems in recent years and operate with a fraction of the budget of Russia's biggest teams.
Last season they survived a relegation play-off to stay in the top flight, but do have a proven winner in charge as manager.
Kurban Berdyev, 63, twice led Rubin Kazan to the Russian Premier League title and famously master-minded their Champions League win at Barcelona in 2009.
It's been quite a weekend for goalkeepers young and old in Italy.
While Juventus' 38-year-old Gianluigi Buffon beat Dino Zoff's club record of 903 minutes without conceding in Serie A, it was a different story for teenager Gianluigi Donnarumma.
The AC Milan youngster, who has been a revelation since making his debut last October, spent part of Sunday in hospital.
An unfortunate clash with Chievo's Fabrizio Cacciatore saw the 17-year-old taken off with what appeared to be a head injury with less than 20 minutes on the clock.
Christian Abbiati arrived in his place as the Rossoneri were unable to break down a resilient Chievo side, drawing 0-0 and stay sixth in the table, 19 points behind leaders Juventus with nine games remaining.
Vincent Janssen could be one to watch following a spectacular debut season in the Dutch top flight.
The striker, a Netherlands under-21 international, joined AZ Alkmaar from second tier side Almere City last summer.
On Saturday, Janssen, 21, scored for a sixth successive game in a 2-0 win at Willem II, taking his total for the season to 19 and making him the club's first player to score six in a row since Sweden international Rasmus Elm in 2011.
Janssen's mother is former 200m freestyle world champion and Olympic medallist Annemarie Verstappen.
It must be in the genes.
They say there's no substitute for experience but it didn't help Deportivo La Coruna stop the rot.
With only one win in 15 La Liga games, Deportivo picked 40-year-old defender Manuel Pablo for their trip to Atletico Madrid.
Pablo, who helped Deportivo win the title way back in 2000, wore the captain's armband on his first league start of the season.
But the former Spain international lasted less than an hour before being substituted as Atletico cruised to a 3-0 win.
When it comes to long service, the efforts of former PSV Eindhoven steward Piet Adriaan will take some beating.
Adriaan worked as a steward on match days at the club's home for a remarkable 52 years.
Now seriously ill, the 88-year-old was taken to Saturday's game against Heerenveen on a stretcher, where he was given a guard of honour by fans.
PSV tweeted: "Thanks for everything Piet!"
