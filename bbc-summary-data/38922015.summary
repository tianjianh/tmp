[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tynwald committee to investigate Manx government's £11.1m overspend

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An £11.1m overspend by the Manx government is to be investigated by Tynwald's Public Accounts Committee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A spokesman for the spending watchdog said it would examine the Department of Health and Social Care, "particularly at Noble's Hospital in Braddan".
Written submissions from anybody with views on the services provided by the hospital have been invited.
Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman Juan Watterson said he wants "no stone left unturned".
Mr Watterson, Speaker of the House of Keys, said: "We are all aware of (the Manx) government's difficulties in balancing the books, so this £11.1m overspend will be of great concern to the public.
"The PAC hope this inquiry will ensure no stone is left unturned in the quest to ensure our NHS is as efficient and effective as it can be."
He continued: "The general public and staff have a clear interest in this and we hope that the inquiry will serve to enhance the understanding of the public on the cost pressures of the Department of Health and Social Care."
Submissions should be sent to the Clerk of the Committee by 17 February.
