[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 0-1 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Jabo Ibehre scored the only goal of the game as Cambridge earned their first win of the season by inflicting a fourth straight defeat on Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ibehre broke the deadlock on 63 minutes when a shot from Uche Ikpeazu was parried by goalkeeper Glenn Morris and the striker tucked in the rebound from close range.
Crawley went close early on when midfielder Mark Randall rattled the crossbar with a dipping long-range effort while at the other end, Ikpeazu was foiled by a smart Morris save.
Enzio Boldewijn failed to connect with a cross from Jordan Roberts for the hosts before Ikpeaku had a shot on the turn tipped over the bar by the alert Morris.
Crawley began the second half in lively fashion and Randall had a goal-bound shot blocked from the edge of the area but they fell behind through Ibehre's composed finish.
Dutch striker Thomas Verheydt and Matt Harrold both came close to equalising for Harry Kewell's side, who are rooted to foot of the League Two table.
