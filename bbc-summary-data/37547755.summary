Swansea City wrong to overlook Ryan Giggs for Bob Bradley - Chris Sutton

Swansea were wrong to hire former United States boss Bob Bradley over either Ryan Giggs or Steve Bruce, BBC pundit Chris Sutton says.

Bradley, 58, replaces Italian Francesco Guidolin and becomes the first American to manage in the Premier League.
"Is Bob Bradley better qualified than Steve Bruce and Ryan Giggs to get this job? I don't think so," Sutton said.
The former Blackburn striker said Bradley essentially got the job because the club now have American owners.
Swansea, who have been in the top flight since 2011, were taken over by Americans Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien in July.
Former Manchester United caretaker boss Giggs, 42, was interviewed for the job but ultimately lost out to Bradley.
The former Egypt and US coach was coaching French second division side Le Havre and took charge of Monday's 2-1 win over Sochaux.
Bruce, 55, was also linked with the Swansea post.
The former Hull City boss, who was in the frame for the England job earlier this year, is also being tipped to take over Aston Villa.
Swansea have lost their past three league matches and are above the relegation zone only on goal difference.
While Sutton feels Bradley lacks the Premier League experience needed to guide them away from trouble, he agrees they were right to sack Italian Guidolin just seven games into the season.
"Swansea for me, since Guidolin has taken charge, have lost their identity and their way of playing," he told BBC Radio 5 live.

However,, former Swansea winger Leighton James says it is the "wrong time" to be replacing the manager.
"We've got so many games left to go," he told BBC Radio Wales.
James also believes the club decided to replace Guidolin before Saturday's defeat by Liverpool, their sixth Premier League game without a win.
"There's no doubt in my mind Bob Bradley was coming in this week," said James. "What would have happened if we'd have won on Saturday against Liverpool as we looked like doing at half-time?
