Dumfries and Galloway artists fling open studio doors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dozens of artists and craft makers in Dumfries and Galloway are opening their studios and workshops to the public as part of the annual Spring Fling event.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The three-day showcase is expected to draw in thousands of visitors and provide a major economic boost.
This year's programme will include the addition of poet Skye Loneragan as writer-in-residence.
She will travel the studio routes and draw on her meetings with visitors and artists to produce a suite of new work.
It will be performed at the Wigtown Book Festival in the autumn.
The Spring Fling runs from Saturday to Monday at locations throughout the region.
