[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers were looking to momentarily move to the top of the table with victory before their rivals played later in the afternoon but struggled to cope with the artificial pitch at Sutton.
In a tight first half, Sutton striker Fitchett thought he had given the hosts the lead in the 31st minute when he finished coolly into the bottom corner, only for it to be rightly chalked off for offside.
But two minutes after half-time, Fitchett nodded in the winner after getting in front of a defender following a knock down from Maxime Biamou.
Chances were few and far between for either side as the hosts held on for victory while fourth-placed Tranmere's winless run extended to four matches.
