The ICC Development Programme Annual Awards have been running since 2002 and are open to countries who are associate and affiliate members.
Cricket Scotland's Ian Sandbrook said: "This is great recognition for our clubs, schools, coaches, volunteers and staff that have all put in a huge amount of effort to grow and sustain the game we love."
The winner of the ICC award receives a cricket equipment grant of Â£3,500 to its national cricket body.
Cricket Scotland's head of participation was delighted to receive such recognition for its grassroots programmes.
"We are continually looking at how we can improve our work with clubs, schools and other key stakeholders to attract new people to the game and build a sustainable future for cricket," said Sandbrook.
"Great initiatives like the Thriving Clubs Programme, CricketForce, Community Coaching Programme, our new Club Awards, Last Man Stands leagues, the roll out of the curriculum for excellence programme, and our continued growth in female cricket, has started to establish a stronger foundation for the game to flourish.
"From my perspective, we have only just started and we're absolutely committed to building on this to take cricket to the next level in Scotland."
Meanwhile, Scotland will play two one-day internationals against Afghanistan at The Grange in Edinburgh on 4 and 6 July, with Hong Kong visiting the same venue on 8 and 10 September.
