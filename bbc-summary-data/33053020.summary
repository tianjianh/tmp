The body of Lee Irving was found on grass near Hazeldene Avenue in Fawdon, Newcastle, on Saturday morning.
Police described the 24-year-old, from Camperdown, East Denton, as being vulnerable with learning difficulties.
Mr Irving's mother, Bev, wrote on Facebook: "My son been killed the day [today] off [by] a bunch of... bully he had the mind of a eight year old".
Detectives have admitted they think his learning difficulties may have been a factor in his death, although details of how he died have not been disclosed.
Four men aged 23, 28, 31 and 50 and two women aged 20 and 50 have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are being questioned.
After his body was discovered, paramedics were called to the grassed area, but he was declared dead at the scene.
Northumbria Police released a statement on behalf of Mr Irving's family, which said: "Lee was a wonderful young man. Loved by many, he used to love ice-skating, going to the pictures and enjoying life.
"He will be very sadly missed by all who knew him. What we have lost is irreplaceable and we must live with our loss every day.
"We would like to thank everyone who has supported us at this devastating time. Lee will always remain in our hearts and thoughts."
Supt Bruce Storey, of Northumbria Police, added: "It's thought those involved in this incident know each other.
"Lee had learning difficulties and was vulnerable. One of our key lines of inquiry is to establish whether this is a factor in his death and a motivation in this crime.
"It's important those suspected of being responsible face the consequences of their actions and I would urge anyone who was in Fawdon on Saturday morning, between 7am and 9am, to come forward and speak to us.
"Extra officers will continue to carry out patrols in the area to offer reassurance to the local community, who understandably are shocked and appalled by this tragic death."
