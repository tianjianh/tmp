The contract for the scheme - which will house secondary, primary and nursery pupils - was signed last week.
Contractors Graham Construction are set to start work on site on 19 September with the campus expected to open to staff and students in June 2018.
Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was "good to see progress" with its plans for education in the town.
The new campus includes:
Councillor Jeff Leaver said: "We want our young people to get the most from their education which means creating environments that stimulate and encourage learning.
"We are committed to creating schools that will deliver the highest standard of learning facilities that can benefit young people for years to come."
The campus work costs have been estimated at about £28m with more than £6m also required to prepare the land involved.
