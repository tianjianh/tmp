Fivemiletown bales: Graffiti artist makes art of the silage bales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catch an eyeful of this... a graffiti artist has set up his spray cans in a field near Fivemiletown to the delight of the local community.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kev Largey, from Belfast, was invited to 'make hay' while the sun did or didn't shine in County Tyrone by Sliabh Beagh Arts Project.
The group wants to bring the arts into rural communities and Kev's graffiti art has proved a hit.
He has painted up a huge pyramid of silage bales.
"I get lots of beeps from passing cars," he said.
"People come up and ask me what I'm doing. They also want to take photographs. It's been very positive."
The switch from painting walls to painting silage bales took a little time but, armed with his spray paints, he has converted the huge black plastic wrapped bales into something to smile about.
They are eye catching and motorists stop on the A4 Belfast Road outside the town to have a proper look.
"I normally do walls and buildings. Black plastic is a bit different," he said. "The paintings on the bales are not going to last forever, but that is part of the beauty of it."
And the art work should prove a little food for thought for the local livestock too. It's not often you get such colourful wraps on your dinner.
Kev's mainstay is street art and wall murals. He has been working as a graffiti artist for 10 years.
Painting bales needs a certain level of fitness, he said.
"It involves a lot of long days and a lot of climbing. The bales are high."
But he relishes the fact that so many people are interested.
"One of the days, I seemed to be chatting to people more than painting. And then there was the day of the massive downpour. Luckily a man was able to give me shelter in his car. People have been great. They have been so very friendly."
Kev has painted the fronts of 14 bales so far, piled up in a pyramid structure in the field.
His is very much "a work in progress", he said.
