At the time of the incident, he was wearing a dark coloured baseball cap and dark coloured clothing.
The second man is white, 5ft 9ins, about 30 years old, of medium build and with stubble.

Both men were seen riding on two bikes on Alford Avenue at about the time of the incident.
Det Insp Colin Robson, of Police Scotland, said: "Today we have released images of the two men who we are very keen to speak with as part of our ongoing investigation into this armed robbery.
"Both men were observed on bicycles on Alford Avenue and I would be interested to hear from anyone who can help us establish their movements or identities.
"We are continuing to carry out various lines of inquiry in relation to this matter and I would like to thank everyone in the local community who has assisted with our investigation up to this point."
Ch Insp Stevie Hamilton, added: "There will be an ongoing police presence in the area for the foreseeable future while our inquiries continue.
"In the meantime, local officers will continue to engage with the community, who have been extremely cooperative and supportive of what we are doing and I thank them for their patience.
"We are working tirelessly in an effort to trace those responsible as quickly as possible and I urge anyone who can help identify the males shown in the images to come forward.
"What may seem like trivial piece of information could have a huge impact against the wider context of our investigation."
