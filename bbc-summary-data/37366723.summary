A "topping out" ceremony to mark the building reaching its highest point in construction has been held at a hospital project in Dumfries.

The multi-million pound scheme at the Garroch roundabout will replace the current building on Bankend Road.
Work began in March last year, with about 400 staff now on site every day.
Main contractor Laing O'Rourke is on schedule to hand over the completed building to NHS Dumfries and Galloway in a year's time.
Health board chief executive Jeff Ace said it was a significant milestone.
"I'm quite emotional, to be honest, it's been the longest project I've ever been involved with in my career," he said.
"We started back in 2008 on this project.
"The amount of work that so many people have delivered successfully to get us here is overwhelming."
Dumfriesshire MSP Oliver Mundell said he was very impressed by how far forward the building works had come and it should be ready for late next year.
"From the remarks we have heard today we can be fairly confident that it is going to be handed over by at least round about the 9 September deadline that's been set," he said.
Mr Mundell said there were some "unanswered questions" about transport to the site but nonetheless he was "very positive" about the project.
"The hospital does have a different feel to the existing site, it is significantly smaller," he said.
"But it does look like they have packed a lot in to the new site."
