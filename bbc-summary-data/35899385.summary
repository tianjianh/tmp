More than 17,000 competitors - including double Olympic champion Mo Farah - will take part in Saturday's 13.1m (21km) IAAF/Cardiff University World Half Marathon.
And 100,000 spectators are expected to pour into the city.
A travel guide has been created by Cardiff council for race day.
Network Rail said improvement works to the Cardiff and Valleys railway line - part of a Â£40bn redevelopment across the UK - will begin after 21:00 GMT on Saturday to allow spectators and competitors to travel home.
However, the works will  then run until into Tuesday, with Cardiff council warning those staying in the city overnight to be aware.
"Many local services into and out of Cardiff will be affected with bus replacements in operation, diversions will also be in place via different routes and trains will start and terminate from different stations," a spokesman said.
"Customers using local rail services during this period are advised to check journey plans before travelling."
The work includes upgrading track and signalling on the railway in and around Cardiff Central station, which will help to improve the reliability of the rail services in the area.
Rolling road closures at Cardiff civic centre began on Monday so the finishing area could be built. On the day, roads will be shut around Cardiff from the late morning until the evening.
Some Cardiff Bus services will also be diverted or changed for a time.
The women's elite race sets off outside Cardiff Castle at 13:35 with the men's elite and mass participation races starting at 14:10.
Farah, who won gold in the 10,000m and 5,000m at the World Championships in Beijing, will join the race as part of the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team.
He is vying to become the Britain's first male winner in the event's 24-year history.
BBC One Wales and BBC Radio Cymru will provide live coverage.
