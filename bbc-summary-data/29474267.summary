TOWIE's Arg says being sick on a plane was 'typical' him

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Only Way is Essex star James Argent has admitted he was sick on a plane and said it was "typical" of him.

Speaking to Newsbeat, Arg said his flight had been delayed and got so drunk because he started drinking "relatively early".
Despite it being "embarrassing and cringey", he says the beauty of Towie is "we're people with normal lives."
But Arg says being on the show meant his story went public, whereas for other people it's "just a memory."
We don't know how much of the incident he remembers, but there were plenty of witnesses to remind him.
He was seen being helped off the plane and in to a shuttle-bus with vomit smeared on his unbuttoned shirt.
"I'm sure most people have got pissed and got a bit sick or got drunk on a plane, but if I do it I get caught," he said.
Just weeks earlier Arg had sparked a man hunt after his mum reported him missing.
He didn't turn up at Gatwick airport to meet his agent and explained to Newsbeat how he came to be labelled as missing.
"I went to wrong airport and then I tried to get back to the other one, when I realised I wasn't going to make it I checked in to hotel.
"I had no battery [on my phone], so my manager's waiting, my mum and dad think I've left on another flight and no-one knows where I actually am."
He was out of contact with the world for 26 hours and when he woke, the cleaner told him he was a missing person.
"I asked to borrow a charger and then I turn my phone on and saw the hashtag '#prayforarg'.
Again, he admitted being embarrassed but said it was "one of those things".
And what about his pal and former TOWIE cast-member Mark Wright appearing on Strictly Come Dancing?
"Dancing doesn't come naturally to Mark - he hasn't got the greatest rhythm or moves but he's a trier."
And Arg said he's "definitely" going to watch a live show after being "surprised" by the quality of his first routine.
