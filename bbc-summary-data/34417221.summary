Newport County part company with manager Terry Butcher

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County have parted company with manager Terry Butcher.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former England captain was appointed last April but the League Two side have made a poor start to the new season, winning just one of 12 matches.
Assistant manager Russell Osman and chief scout Steve Marsella have also left Rodney Parade.
Butcher's departure follows the news that Newport County Supporters' Trust has raised the required £195,000 to take over the Welsh club.
The club said it hoped to make an announcement on Butcher's successor before Saturday's home league game against Exeter City.
One possibility is former Plymouth Argyle boss John Sheridan, with County chief executive Jason Turner having been with him at the Devon club.
Linfield manager Warren Feeney has also been linked with the vacant post.
Butcher took over at Rodney Parade last April from Jimmy Dack, the interim boss who had been in charge since Justin Edinburgh left to manage Gillingham in February 2015.
The 56-year-old had to rebuild a squad with just four first-team players remaining under contract last summer, with the board aiming to slash their wage bill to around £900,000 from an estimated £1.4m.
That reduced budget was a result of the decision by benefactor Les Scadding, a EuroMillions lottery winner, to step down as chairman.
