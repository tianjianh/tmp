[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted fraudster on the run from British authorities has posted Facebook messages claiming she wants to be the first female president of Nigeria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tina Beloveth Powerful said she would lobby "my Facebook friends," President Obama, Michelle Obama and David Cameron for support.
Powerful, 48, skipped bail ten months ago after being found guilty of running a bogus business school.
Thames Valley Police said an arrest warrant for her was outstanding.
Powerful, thought to be living in Nigeria, was found guilty of fraud and false advertising in July 2015, but went on the run prior to being sentenced.
The case related to her Milton Keynes-based Everest School of Transformational Management.
Her Facebook page suggests she has returned to teaching, with one post saying she is "on my leadership training mission".
And a recent post headlined "women leadership" talks about women becoming presidents of their countries.
In it, Powerful wrote: "I desire most unreservedly to become the first Nigerian female president sooner than later.  I have been nursing this feeling since my mama born me."
She added: "I strongly believe that my Facebook friends, President Obama and Mitchell (sic) Obama, my long-time outstanding friends, Rt. Hon. David Cameron my allied and host of other powerful women and civilized men nationally and internationally will support me massively."
Powerful had offered courses and degrees she did not have the correct accreditation for and advertised facilities that did not exist, including a library.
The BBC discovered she formed another business school in Bedford while on trial, but later flew back to her native country following a death in the family.
