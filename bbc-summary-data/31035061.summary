The Met Office's yellow "be aware" warning is in force until midday on Sunday, with the most frequent sleet and snow showers expected in west Wales.
Up to 2cm of snow could fall on low ground and untreated roads may be icy as temperatures drop.
Forecasters also said gusts of up to 60mph could hit exposed northern and western coasts.
There was some disruption overnight into Saturday with reports of hazardous driving conditions on the A487 and A486 around Synod Inn in Ceredigion.
There was also a heavy hailstorm and two crashes on the A40 in Carmarthen.
In Denbighshire, the A542 Horseshoe Pass reopened on Saturday morning as most of the overnight snow fell on high ground.
The latest warnings follow hazardous conditions on some mountain roads in Wales in recent days.
Several cars were left stuck in snow on the A470 in Gwynedd on Thursday on the Crimea Pass near Blaenau Ffestiniog.
In Rhydymain, Gwynedd, a 50-year-old man had to be airlifted to hospital after his car crashed in snowy conditions.
Six schools in Gwynedd and Anglesey also closed on Thursday due to the severe weather.
