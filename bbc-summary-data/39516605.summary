Pardeep Kaur killing: Figure caught on CCTV dragging body

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Images showing a figure dragging the body of a woman after she was sexually assaulted and killed in west London, have been shown in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
CCTV cameras caught Pardeep Kaur walking towards a bridge over the M4 in Hayes and being followed by a "stooped man" on 17 October last year.
Ms Kaur's body was found in undergrowth near Harlington Bridge nearly a week after she was reported missing.
Vadims Ruskuls, 25, who was sleeping rough under the bridge, denies murder.
Ms Kaur was snatched while on her way to work at the Sheraton Skyline Hotel in Harlington, Middlesex.
On the footage, presented to the Old Bailey, Ms Kaur and the figure, who is seen staggering in the street, disappear from view behind a bush at 06:33 BST.
Twenty-five minutes later, an indistinct figure is seen dragging her body back down the path and behind a pillar under the bridge.
PC Victoria Wellsted told the court no-one else was seen in the area in the 25-minute gap between Ms Kaur and the suspect walking out of view.
She told the jury the poor quality of the film meant it was impossible to tell from the footage if the person seen dragging the body was a man or woman.
However, she said there were "certain similarities" between the man seen following Ms Kaur in the images and Mr Ruskuls.
The trial continues.
