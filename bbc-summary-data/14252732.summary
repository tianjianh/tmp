The 27-year-old tested positive for the anabolic steroid testosterone and Clenbuterol last month.
Wilson's test was conducted after she ran a time of 11.95 seconds for the 100m at the Bedford International Games on 12 June.
UKA say Wilson has the right to a full hearing of the case.
The provisional suspension came into effect on 9 July. It was issued by UK Anti-Doping, the independent body responsible for all anti-doping programmes and the management of violations and disciplinary issues in the United Kingdom.
Wilson, from Lincolnshire, could face a two-year ban if found guilty of doping.
This year she has set new personal best times in the 60m and 100m. She ran 7.25 seconds for the 60m at the European Indoor Trials in Sheffield in February, and 11.57 seconds for the 100m at the Inter Counties Championships in Bedford in May.
She also ran a wind-assisted time of 11.41 seconds for the 100m in Loughborough in May.
Wilson is coached by George Skafidas, and reached the semi-finals of the 60m sprint at the European Indoor Championships in Paris in March.
She ran 7.30 seconds in qualifying for the semi-finals, but did not progress to the final despite bettering her time to 7.28 seconds.
Clenbuterol is the same substance that Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador tested positive for during last year's Tour de France. He said the positive test was a result of eating contaminated beef.
Clenbuterol, similar to the asthma drug salbutamol, is used to treat breathing disorders as a decongestant and bronchodilator. It causes an increase in aerobic capacity, blood pressure and oxygen transportation, and speeds the rate at which fats are burned. It is officially classified as a sympathomimetic steroid.
Away from the track, Wilson works as a sport development officer for East Lindsey District Council, who said in a statement: "East Lindsey District Council is aware of the investigation announced today by UK Athletics in relation to international athlete Bernice Wilson.
"The council takes this very seriously, and will be discussing this fully with Bernice, but it would be inappropriate to discuss individual staffing issues with third parties."
