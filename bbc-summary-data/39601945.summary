Banbridge, who were appearing in the last 16 of the tournament for the first time, trailed 1-0 at half-time thanks to a Christophe Peters-Deutz strike.
Matthew Allister, a pre-match injury doubt, levelled by scoring into an empty net 11 minutes from time.
Lisnagarvey face Spanish giants Atletic Terrassa in Eindhoven on Saturday.
The Spanish side will be aiming to reach the final four for the second successive season when they take on Jonathan Bell's Irish outfit at 09:30 BST.
'Garvey will hope to become the first Irish club to make the last eight of the competition, but must make a couple of changes to their squad.
Michael Robson is not eligible as he joined the club from Annadale after the European deadline, while Timmy Cockram is also unavailable.
Irish internationals Paul Gleghorne and Sean Murray have knocks but are likely to play a part on Saturday.
Banbridge faced the French champions on Friday, having successfully negotiated Round One last October on their home patch at Havelock Park.
Mark Tumilty's side, who are in the running to win the Irish Hockey League next week, responded well to going a goal down, with Jonny McKee and Eugene Magee both going close to finding an equaliser.
McKee eventually provided the assist for Allister to turn in from close range, but the French side held their nerve to reach the last eight by scoring all of their penalties.
