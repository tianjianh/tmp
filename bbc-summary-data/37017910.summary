Leeds United 1-1 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Wood's injury-time overhead kick against Fulham secured Leeds United their first point of the season.

Tom Cairney's curled effort 13 minutes from time looked to have continued Fulham's perfect start to their Championship campaign.
Ex-Leeds striker Matt Smith and forward Sone Aluko both hit the post for the Cottagers in an impressive display.
But the hosts created chances themselves and were rewarded with Wood's spectacular effort.
Wood had earlier sent the ball wide with a header when well-placed at the back post, while Swedish forward Marcus Antonsson also missed two good chances.
However, Fulham created more opportunities throughout the game, with Rob Green forced to save from Floyd Ayite, who also sent a header narrowly wide of goal.
Aluko had an appeal for a penalty turned down shortly before Cairney's opener, as the visitors struggled to turn chances into goals.
But Slavisa Jokanovic's side remain fourth in the table despite being punished for their wastefulness in front of goal by Wood's fine strike, while Leeds climb to 20th in the table.
Leeds United head coach Garry Monk:
"I don't know if delighted is the right word, but I was very pleased for the players and everyone. I was very pleased for Woody. He missed that chance, but he came back and it was good reward for him. It epitomised our spirit.
"There was spirit with them in the changing room and you can see that. Tonight was a really good test for us. We could have easily thought that it wasn't going to be our night.
"I was especially pleased for Chris, he missed an earlier one and could have easily felt sorry for him, frustration was coming his way but his mentality epitomised what the team were doing. I'm very happy for him to score that goal, it'll give him a big boost."
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic:
"[Ryan Sessegnon] is a very good project of the football club, he needs to continue to keep working hard, in this way we have to be careful about him.
"For his debut he offered many, many, many quality things during the game. I don't want to say (he is a) kid, but he is doing work with adult people and I don't find a big difference between them.
"It is a little bit unlucky, we are a little bit frustrated after this late goal. We didn't score more goals at the beginning and during the game and Leeds scored a typical Championship goal, a big centre-half touches the ball and the big striker catches a bicycle kick, which can happen."
