The 20-year-old made his first-team debut for the Scottish Premiership club in August 2013 and has made 25 appearances for the Edinburgh outfit.
But he has been mainly on the bench this season.
Oliver, who has signed a one-year contract, told Hearts' website: "I'm now looking forward to my new challenge and playing regular football."
Hearts signed fellow striker Gavin Reilly from Queens this summer.
