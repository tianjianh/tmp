Bloody Sunday: DUP call for Martin McGuinness to be questioned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The police ombudsman has been asked to investigate why the PSNI has not questioned the Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness about Bloody Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The DUP MP Gregory Campbell complained to the ombudsman after claiming the PSNI refused to say whether or not they planned to question Mr McGuinness.
Mr Campbell said that he should be interviewed as part of the Bloody Sunday investigation after Lord Saville said Mr McGuinness was "probably" carrying a Thompson sub-machine gun on the day. Mr McGuinness denies this.
The Police Ombudsman has confirmed that a complaint has been received but refused to give any further details.
It is not clear if the office intends to take any action.
Mr Campbell said that if the police do not question Martin McGuinness it will be a "dereliction of duty".
"The same report that concluded that the soldiers had some questions to answer also concluded that Martin McGuinness had a sub-machine gun," said the East Londonderry MP.
"Nobody seriously believes he was using it to plant tomatoes. He had a sub-machine gun so what was he doing with it? The police need to question him about that.
"It is now the police ombudsman's job to establish why they intend not to question him and if necessary, to say they should.
"It's not a big ask in the interest of fairness," Mr Campbell added.
A PSNI spokesman said: "As a complaint has been made to the office of the police ombudsman it would be inappropriate to comment at this time."
Det Ch Insp Ian Harrison, from Legacy Investigation Branch, said: "Police have concluded interviews with former military personnel and are in the process of compiling a report for the PPS."
The police investigation into the events on Bloody Sunday is continuing.
