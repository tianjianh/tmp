Paul Bramley, 28, from Hull, is one of three Britons known to have died when an Airbus A320 crashed in France on Tuesday. There were no survivors.
His father, Phillip Bramley said his son would be "sadly missed".
Paul Bramley had been studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland.
He was travelling to the UK via Dusseldorf after a short holiday in Barcelona.
His father said: "He was just a lovely lad, cheerful and happy. He was always hard working.
"He was just doing a hotel and management course in Switzerland. He was doing very well. He will be sadly missed.
"Our hearts go out to all the families.
"We would like to thank the Foreign Office and David Cameron for all the work they've done, they've been very good.
"[We would also like to thank] the French authorities, it must be a terrible job.
Mr Bramley's mother Carol, who lives in Majorca, said: "Paul was a kind, caring and loving son. He was the best son, he was my world."
Reverend Canon Alison White, the newly appointed Bishop of Hull, said: "It's appalling news. Our hearts go out to the people who are grieving right now.
"All we can do is just surround those people with our love and stand with them while the anguish rolls over them."
