Scissor stabbing sparked by neighbour noise row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been convicted of stabbing his neighbour's nephew in the chest with scissors during a row over noise.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James McCrimmon, 32, was originally charged with attempting to murder 42-year-old Steven McCartney in Montraive Street, Rutherglen, on 6 March 2015.
But a jury at the High Court in Glasgow found him guilty of the lesser charge of assault to the danger of life after deciding he acted under provocation.
Sentence on McCrimmon was deferred and he was allowed bail.
The court heard that McCrimmon's downstairs neighbour, 58-year-old Robert Baird, had moved into the four-in-a-block house in Montraive Street in 2012.
The accused claimed he constantly complained about the noise his two young sons made and would constantly shout, swear and bang up to tell them to be quiet.
The row which sparked the stabbing allegedly started when Mr Baird banged upstairs to complain about noise.
McCrimmon, who had a pair of wallpaper scissors in his back pocket, lost his temper and went down to Mr Baird's home and kicked at his front door.
When Mr Baird refused to come to the door, McCrimmon knocked on the door of another neighbour, Mr McCartney, who is Mr Baird's nephew.
Mr McCartney returned home to find McCrimmon banging on his door and a scuffle broke out, during which McCrimmon stabbed Mr McCartney with the scissors.
McCrimmon claimed that McCartney took the scissors from his pocket and struck him on the head and neck.
He said that as he tried to grab them back from Mr McCartney he stabbed him in self-defence.
The court heard that Mr McCartney was stabbed close to the heart with the scissors and McCrimmon had two wounds on his head and neck.
Mr McCartney denied ever having the scissors at any point.
The court was told that when police arrested McCrimmon, he had just showered and taken the scissors into the shower with him to wash the blood off them.
Both McCrimmon and Mr Baird have moved house since the incident.
