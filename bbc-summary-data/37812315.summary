Neil Warnock was left to rue the absence of striker Rickie Lambert after losing his unbeaten record as Cardiff City manager.

The Bluebirds lost 1-0 at home to Wigan on Saturday despite creating several chances.
Lambert, 34, suffered an "horrific" leg injury at Nottingham Forest a week earlier which means he is set to miss Cardiff's next match at Newcastle too.
"You miss your talisman in the games we've played," said Warnock.
"That's life in the Championship - you get injuries and you have to get on with it. I still think we created enough chances."
Having won two and drawn one of his first three matches in charge, the defeat at Cardiff City Stadium was Warnock's first since succeeding Paul Trollope earlier this month.
Although the match against Wigan suffered from an overall lack of quality, Cardiff had 19 shots to their opponents' seven and squandered some promising opportunities.
Warnock was also frustrated by the performance of referee Oliver Langford.
"I thought we could have got a few more decisions against [Cardiff forward Anthony] Pilkington - he was molested a few times and not got the decisions," the 67-year-old added.
"They seemed to go very easily the opposite way, which disappointed me."
Warnock had caused a stir the day before the Wigan game by claiming Cardiff are the "biggest club in Wales".
So it was perhaps fitting that Wigan's goal was scored by former Swansea City midfielder Jordi Gomez, who also struck the winner in a south Wales derby between the Swans and Cardiff in 2008.
"It was just a bit of tongue in cheek. I just thought I'd stir the Swans up," said Warnock.
"They've done brilliantly over the years and I just think it's a great club in Cardiff. Somebody said it's the main club in Wales so I must have just slipped my tongue."
