Borja Baston: Swansea City striker joins Malaga on season long loan deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City have confirmed record signing Borja Baston has signed for Malaga on a season-long loan deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Spanish striker joined for a club record Â£15.5m from Atletico Madrid in August, 2016, but only scored once.
Borja, 24, almost joined Villarreal on loan in January, but the move fell through.
Malaga, who finished 11th in La Liga last season, wanted a replacement for Sandro Ramirez who has joined Everton.
Borja made 18 Premier League appearances in the 2016/17 season, just four of which were starts and featured twice in the cups.
His one Swans goal came in the 3-2 defeat at Arsenal last October.
The Swans are also monitoring South Korea midfielder Ki Sung-Yueng, who has had minor surgery on a knee injury.
Ki picked up his injury in South Korea's Asian World Cup qualifier against Qatar.
He will remain in South Korea to continue his rehabilitation, before returning to Swansea after Paul Clement's squad return from their pre-season tour to America.
The club's medical team have been to South Korea to assess him following the operation.
The injury is not expected to keep him out long term.
