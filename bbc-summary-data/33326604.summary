Eileen Swannack, 70, and partner John Welch, 74, both from Wiltshire, have not made contact since the shootings at the resort near Sousse on Friday.
Police said relatives of Ms Swannack and Mr Welch, of Corsham, were getting family liaison officer support.
It is feared up to 30 UK citizens were killed, but only 18 are confirmed dead.
Speaking to the BBC on Saturday, Mr Welch's grandson Daniel Welch said: "You know that we're going to get some sort of news at some point, whether it be today, tomorrow or the next day, and you know it's probably not going to be great, because they haven't been able to make contact themselves by now."
Tunisian authorities have arrested several people on suspicion of helping the gunman, who had links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).
