At 17, Ebner became the youngest player to play for the US rugby sevens team.
He was drafted into the NFL after university, joining the New England Patriots in 2012, and helped them win the Super Bowl three years later.
In March, the 27-year-old decided to take a leave of absence from American football to concentrate on gaining an Olympic place.
Ebner, who has just signed a new contract with the Patriots, will rejoin the NFL side after the conclusion of the Games on 11 August.
