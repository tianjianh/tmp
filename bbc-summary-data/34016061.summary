[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bilal Ahmed, of Tentercroft, Oldham, abused the vulnerable teenager when she was away from the care home.
University graduate Ahmed, 27, sexually abused the girl on two occasions during a week last September.
Two other men were also jailed at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court for abduction and facilitating abuse.
The victim told Greater Manchester Police about a "disgusting" experience she had endured with Ahmed.
The jury convicted him of two counts of child abduction and two of engaging in sexual activity with a child.
His friend Hassan Ali, 21, of no fixed address, was jailed for 12 months at an earlier hearing after he was convicted of abducting a 13-year-old boy.
Dilon Rasul, 24, of Worsley Street, Oldham, provided accommodation to Ahmed. He was jailed for two years after he was found guilty of facilitating sexual activity with a child.
A fourth man, Jubair Rahman, 23, of Waterman View, Rochdale, admitted child abduction at an earlier hearing and will be sentenced on Monday, police said.
After sentencing, Det Con Ben Harris said: "All four men befriended the children, who were extremely vulnerable and given drink and drugs.
"The offenders gained their trust before taking advantage of them to satisfy their own needs."
Neil Usher, prosecuting, told a previous court hearing that the children in the care of Rochdale Social Services - the 13-year-olds and a 15-year-old girl - went missing from separate care homes in September and October 2014.
The girls would meet each other and seek the company of older men, the court heard, staying out overnight occasionally and being given alcohol and cannabis.
On 21 September, the three teenagers caught a tram to Oldham where they arranged to meet Ali.
They were taken to a house party where the 13-year-old girl was sexually abused by Ahmed. She was abused again within a week.
