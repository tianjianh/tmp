Leeds have scrapped a controversial "pie tax" that had been introduced on some match-day tickets at Elland Road.

The club raised the price of adult tickets in the South Stand by Â£5, which also included a "meal deal" voucher.
A statement on the club website read: "Meal deal structures have been simplified to help speed up service."
As a result of the changes, the club announced adult match tickets in the South Stand will no longer be sold as part of a meal deal package.
When the increase was announced in December 2015, Leeds Supporters' Trust chairman Michael Green said it showed the club was "out of touch with its supporters".
A number of Leeds fans walked out in the 17th minute of their home game against Hull City on 5 December 2015 in protest against the ticket price increases.
