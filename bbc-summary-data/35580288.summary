[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Turner, 57, deliberately drove at Frank Buckley, 51, after the pair had a fight in the street.
Mr Buckley suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured skull, and died at the scene on 26 June last year.
Turner, of Landau Way, Turnford, Hertfordshire, denied murder but was found guilty at St Albans Crown Court.
He will be sentenced next month.

During Turner's trial, jurors heard there was "bad feeling" between the pair which it was claimed went back 20 years.
On the day of Mr Buckley's death, the court heard, the two men got into a fight in Groom Road, Turnford.
Turner claimed to have lost control of his van as he tried to drive away after Mr Buckley sprayed something into his face.
During the trial, the jury was shown film footage of Mr Turner handcuffed to a bed in hospital. He had suffered superficial burns to his face and chest.
He was adamant he had not intended to hurt or kill Mr Buckley, the court heard.
However, prosecutor Christopher Donnellan QC told the jury Turner "deliberately turned his van into Frank Buckley and knocked him down".
"It was carried out by a man who was angry and in a temper, possibly he acted in revenge about something that had happened in the course of the confrontation," he said.
Adrian Foster, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: "Turner clearly acted out of blind rage in a grossly disproportionate manner and is undoubtedly an extremely ruthless and violent man."
