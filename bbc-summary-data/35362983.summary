Powys council's plans to delay pupils' nursery start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children in Powys could start nursery school later in a bid to save the council £1.5m a year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Currently, children in the county start school at the beginning of the term in which they have their fourth birthday.
But the authority wants to push the start date back so pupils start in the September after they turn four.
If agreed, the policy, which is part of council's plans to save £27m over the next three years, could start in September 2017.
Councillor Arwel Jones, cabinet member for schools, said the changes would bring the authority in line with the majority of other councils in England and Wales.
Parents can have their say on the plans until 1 March.
