Weeping Window is to be installed at the Maritime Museum in the city centre for two months in 2017.
The building, formerly the Dock Offices, tells the history of the city's mariners.
The site has been chosen to highlight sacrifices made by the Merchant and Royal Navies, said Hull City Council.
Much of Hull's fishing fleet was requisitioned for mine-sweeping and many fishermen helped the war effort.

The Weeping Windows poppies are to be displayed in Hull from 22 March to 29 May 2017.
