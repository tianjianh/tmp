[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 3-0 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gavin Massey's double inspired Leyton Orient to a 3-0 win at home to Stevenage in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors nearly took the lead after three minutes when Matt Godden lobbed over onrushing O's goalkeeper Alex Cisak, only for Tom Parkes to get back to hook off the line.
It was a let-off for Orient and they made Stevenage pay in the 20th minute when Dean Cox crossed in for Jay Simpson, Jamie Jones saved his effort before Harry Cornick's follow-up header hit the post and eventually fell to Massey, who fired in from six yards.
The game continued to be end-to-end and O's crucially doubled their lead through Cox in the 37th minute. Massey released Cornick down the right and he brilliantly found Cox on the edge of the box, who headed home off the post.
Predictably the pace of the game slowed in the second half, but Orient wrapped up the victory 15 minutes from time when substitute Jordan Bowery crossed in from the right and Massey smashed home his second from close range.
