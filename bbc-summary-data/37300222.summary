Nottingham GP surgery closed after 'inadequate' rating

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 2,000 people have been left without a GP after a surgery was closed for being inadequate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patients at the Mapperley Park Medical Centre in Nottingham have been advised to contact other GP surgeries nearby.
After being put in special measures last year, continued concerns were raised about staffing levels, infection control and record keeping.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said the practice will remain closed until necessary improvements are made.
The practice, run by Dr Mark Stephen, was initially rated as inadequate after an inspection in March 2015 and placed in special measures the following June.
A subsequent assessment in December found "patients were still at risk of harm because effective systems were not in place to ensure identified risks were sufficiently mitigated".
The CQC confirmed it carried out another inspection on 1 September and found "a number of concerns".
In a statement it said: "We are working closely with Nottingham CCG [Clinical Commissioning Group] and NHS England with regard to the service and have taken urgent action to protect people who use the service.
"While our legal processes do not allow us to go in to further detail at this time, we will publish a full report of our findings in due course."
A patient outside the clinic said they were "very surprised" at the move.
