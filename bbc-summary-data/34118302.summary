Leicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill has confirmed the club offered a contract to South Africa captain Jean de Villiers.

Tigers have previously said they are keen to bring in a marquee signing at inside centre, but 34-year-old De Villiers opted to stay in his homeland.
"We had discussions and thought we may have had a deal, but we move on," Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester.
Meanwhile, wing Gonzalo Camacho has signed a new one-year contract.
A shoulder injury has kept Camacho out of action for two years, meaning he has yet to play for Tigers.
But he made his international comeback for Argentina against Australia in the Rugby Championship this summer.
Cockerill added: "Gonzo has had a tough time and has worked really hard.
"We have agreed a contract with him so let's hope he is injury free and gets back to how we know he can play."
