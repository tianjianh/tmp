Plans have been lodged for a Â£40m whisky distillery development near Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders.

Mossburn Distillers want to build the plant near the former Jedforest Hotel at Camptown.
Developers claim it could create 50 full-time jobs and produce millions of bottles a year. The proposed facilities include a 200-seat restaurant.
A planning application has been submitted to Scottish Borders Council with a decision expected in the autumn.
The company is also behind the Torabhaig distillery on the Isle of Skye.
The project is one of a number of schemes in the pipeline for the Borders which has no whisky distilleries at present.
The Three Stills Company has lodged plans for a site on Commercial Road in Hawick.
Last year a competition by R&B Distillers saw the public pick Peebles as the preferred site for a distillery.
