There have been 21 million pound winners in the G postcode since 2014 - more than any other area in the UK.
Glasgow also had 106 millionaire wins since the first draw in 1994, ranking it second in the UK to Birmingham.
But the Paisley postcode area - PA - was named the luckiest in Scotland with most winners per head of population for prizes of £50,000 and above.
Andy Carter, senior winners' advisor for The National Lottery, said: "Scotland has been enjoying plenty of National Lottery luck recently with residents of the Paisley postcode celebrating the most big wins.
"Glasgow has secured its position as the country's Lottery millionaire capital too producing nearly two a month over the past couple of years.
"There are now a massive 4,250 National Lottery millionaires across the country and with more than six new millionaires made every week there is likely to be another local winner made soon."
In terms of lottery millionaires in Scotland since 1994, Edinburgh is second to Glasgow with a total of 62, followed by Motherwell on 43 and Aberdeen on 41.
In the last two years, 30 top-tier prizes of at least £50,000 have been banked by players in the PA postcode, which includes towns in Renfrewshire, Inverclyde and Argyll and Bute, including the creation of four Lottery millionaires.
In total, 182 major prizes of £50,000 or more have been won in the area since the National Lottery began.
