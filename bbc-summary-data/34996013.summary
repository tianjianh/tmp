Sean-Caio Corr from Derrylaughan, near Coalisland in County Tyrone, and his friend Christian "MC Schnitz" Berger, took their boards to Manchester's Curry Mile.
The Mid-Ulster Mail reported that the pair never intended to make a video.
"It started off as a joke between me and my friend," Mr Corr said.
"We're always joking about getting barrelled in Manchester."
The 19-year-old who is studying a business degree at Manchester University, said they had a positive reaction from drivers.
"We actually had people pulling in and asking us did we want them to turn around and do it again? We had one guy drive past around three or four times," he told the BBC.
"It was freezing man, we were bare feet and in board shorts.
"We got some funny looks but overall the reaction was really positive, people were coming up and saying we had made their day."
The video has been featured on German and Swedish news outlets since it was posted.
