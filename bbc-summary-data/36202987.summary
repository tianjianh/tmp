[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The exam season has begun for tens of thousands of pupils and students across Scotland.

For the first time candidates will sit new Advanced Higher examinations, developed to support the Curriculum for Excellence.
Higher and National 5 exams will also be carried out over the next four and a half weeks.
The schedule began with a Lifeskills Mathematics exam at 09:00 and will end with Politics on 3 June.
Results will be published on Tuesday 9 August.
Students' final grades will reflect a combination of coursework, projects and results from internal assessments conducted through the academic year.
Last year the pass mark for the Higher Maths exam was significantly lowered amid concerns it was too difficult.
This year's Higher English exam paper has been replaced as a "precautionary measure" amid concerns some questions were leaked.
Among the 142,512 people who will receive their results this summer include those who have been continually assessed throughout the year.
They have been working towards National 1, National 2, National 3, National 4 and Skills for Work courses and awards.
Scotland's chief examining officer Dr Janet Brown said: "After months of work and hours of study, tens of thousands of candidates are now preparing to complete their qualifications and take the next step in their education or into work.
"I'd like to wish everyone sitting examinations and taking qualifications at schools and colleges the best of luck between now and the end of the term."
Dr Brown, the chief executive of the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), added: "The new national qualifications, including the new Advanced Higher, provide candidates with the opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and understanding they've acquired and prepare them for further study, employment or training.
"Our qualifications are robust, relevant, and designed to equip young people with a wide range of skills."
