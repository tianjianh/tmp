Stone masons have been called in to inspect part of St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney.

A section of sandstone surrounding a stained glass window high in the south transept fell off overnight.
The cathedral is scheduled to be the venue for Battle of Jutland commemorations on Tuesday, with many dignitaries due to attend.
It is thought that a section of the stonework fell about 70ft to the ground between Saturday and Sunday.
