It happened when 43-year-old Nadia Sattar was crossing Nithsdale Road, close to the junction with Dargarvel Avenue, at about 18:15 on Friday.
She was hit by a grey Volkswagen Touran and then a white Volkswagen Golf.
A police spokesman said the woman died en route to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. The car drivers were uninjured. Police have appealed for witnesses.
The road was closed for several hours to allow crash investigations to be carried out.
Sgt Nicola Taylor said: "Since our initial media appeal, the two individuals we asked to come forward have been in contact with police.
"Inquiries are ongoing to determine the circumstances surrounding the crash. We would continue to ask anyone who witnessed the crash to contact police with any information they have."
