The 20-year-old, who won the event at Rio 2016, improved on her own previous best by 0.11 seconds.
"I wasn't expecting that at all, I'm absolutely over the moon," she told Vincosport.
"My aim is to keep getting faster I suppose. It's going to be hard."
Nottingham's Hahn burst onto the world stage when she won the T38 100m world title as a 16-year-old in 2013, a title she retained two years later in Doha.
