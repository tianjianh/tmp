Eduard Peticky, 48, and his younger brother, Ludovit, abused two boys and a girl as young as three years old in the Eastwood area between 2010 and 2012.
They were found guilty of 10 charges between them, including sexual assault, after a trial on 25 July last year.
Sentencing them at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Peter Kelson said it was "a hugely horrifying incident".
Eduard Peticky, of Josephine Road, Rotherham, was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to serve a minimum term of 10 years for four offences including sexual exploitation and trafficking.
His 45-year-old brother, Ludovit Peticky, of Legrams Lane, Bradford, was jailed for 12 years for six offences.
Both had denied all the charges.
Speaking of Eduard's offending, the judge said: "This is a hugely horrifying incident and as depraved as could possibly be. It is horrific. He poses a substantial risk to society."
A police investigation began in September 2013 after the victims disclosed what had happened to them.
Det Con Ian Hampshire, of South Yorkshire Police, said he hoped they could "now try to move on with their lives and put this dreadful ordeal behind them".
"These young children suffered horrific abuse at the hands of these brothers over a prolonged period of time.
"The harm that they caused will stay with them forever.
"I am pleased the young victims found the courage to tell someone what had happened to them so that we could take swift action against the men and bring them to justice."
