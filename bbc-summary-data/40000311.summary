Freddie Burns: Leicester Tigers have been in 'some dark places', says departing fly-half

Departing Leicester fly-half Freddie Burns says he is proud of the club for reaching the Premiership semi-finals after a troubled campaign.

Only a late Wasps try prevented Tigers, who sacked long-serving director of rugby Richard Cockerill in January, from reaching the final.
Burns, who now rejoins Bath, told BBC Radio Leicester: "We've been in some unbelievably dark places this year.
"To get to a semi has to fill you with pride."
Burns, 27, will return to his boyhood club next season in a deal which sees England fly-half George Ford rejoin Leicester.
In March, he said he was unhappy at the way the move was handled, having been keen to see out the final year of his existing deal at Welford Road.
And his time at Leicester ended abruptly in the closing minutes of the game at the Ricoh Arena, as Josh Bassett went over two minutes from time to send Wasps into the final, where they will face Exeter Chiefs.
"It's disappointing that we couldn't go that one step [further] and send everyone to a final down at Twickenham," Burns said.
