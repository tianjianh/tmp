The star of How I Met Your Mother and Gone Girl will host 10 episodes of the variety show for NBC, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
Harris called the show, created by British TV presenting duo Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, "a game changer".
McPartlin, Donnelly and Harris will produce the yet-to-be named show, which is likely not to air on Saturdays.
The show, which pays homage to variety shows of the past, started in the UK in 2002.
It won two Bafta awards this year and there are versions in Germany, Portugal, Italy and Belgium.
The show features comedy sketches, song and dance numbers and audience interaction.
"As I watched the show, I couldn't stop smiling. Now that I've seen many seasons, my face hurts," Harris said.
"Its unique structure fits right into my random skill set. I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and have some fun."
Harris has just finished a run on Broadway in Hedwig and the Angry Inch and was recently announced as the host of the 2015 Oscars.
Last year he made his fourth appearance hosting the Tony Awards, drawing plaudits for his hosting duties and show-stopping opening number.
