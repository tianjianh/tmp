The 27-year-old victim was on the delayed 22:24 GMT train from Sheffield to Leeds on Saturday.
British Transport Police said she was targeted prior to the train departing when sitting alone by the window.
Her partner had gone to the toilet and after he left, the offender sat down next to the woman and attempted to rape her.

Her partner returned from the toilet unaware of what had happened and physically moved the offender from his seat.
Police said the incident happened on the delayed train, which left Sheffield at 22:40 GMT from platform 1B.
Det Con Ian Grice said the victim was being supported by specially-trained officers.
He appealed for information and said: "Sexual offences of this nature on the railway network are rare, but are understandably incredibly distressing for the victim."
The man is described as white, late 20s to early 30s, with brown hair and wearing a blue Puffa jacket.
He was with another man, also white, aged late 20s to early 30s, wearing a black Puffa jacket.
The victim and her partner got off the train at Swinton, but police said it is not known where the other men alighted.
