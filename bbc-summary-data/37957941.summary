The Christmas tree that will take centre stage during Cardiff's festive celebrations will be an artificial "structure" made in China.

Cardiff council was criticised for not having a tree up in time for the Christmas lights switch-on on Thursday.
The authority said it had leased a pre-decorated 40m (131ft) tall "tree-shaped structure" for the next three years.
It will not go up until 25 November as it is being shipped from China.
In a statement, the council said the Christmas tree, covered in golden baubles, should be a "spectacular addition to Cardiff's Christmas offering".
The tree, on a three-year lease from UK-based company MK Illuminations, will arrive with all the decorations pre-attached.
Last year, insurance company Admiral sponsored the main tree outside Cardiff Castle, which was up in time for the city's Step Into Christmas event.
