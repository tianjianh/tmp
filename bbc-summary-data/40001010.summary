[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour and SNP take control of Dumfries and Galloway Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coalition between Labour and the SNP has taken control of Dumfries and Galloway Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It means the Conservative group, which won most seats at the recent elections, is kept out of the administration.
Between them Labour and the SNP have 22 seats on the 43 member local authority - enough for a narrow majority.
Former MSP Elaine Murray has been named the new leader of the council replacing her Labour colleague Ronnie Nicholson. The SNP's Rob Davidson is her deputy.
The new coalition said it was committed to "working together constructively" and would put aside constitutional issues to tackle local problems.
It pledged to seek new opportunities for investment and aim to improve town centres across the region.
The administration said it would be "characterised by co-operation" with a "resilient and collegiate" approach.
There were 16 Conservatives elected in Dumfries and Galloway with Labour and the SNP tied on 11, four independents and one Lib Dem.
A Labour minority administration was previously in control of the council.
In a joint statement Ms Murray and Mr Davidson said the two groups looked forward to working together to deliver "shared ambitions for the region".
"We're committed to working together for the benefit of our communities, we've both stepped up to that to that responsibility today, and we're confident that we'll work together effectively and constructively," it said.
"Both groups have put aside our political differences on constitutional issues to concentrate on what needs to be done in the interests of the people and communities in our region.
"Both parties in this partnership are committed to tackling poverty, to opposing austerity, and protecting, as far as we can, our most vulnerable individuals and communities from its effects. "
They said their partnership was "passionate about delivering for Dumfries and Galloway".
The council also agreed who would chair a string of its committees:
The role of provost of Dumfries and Nithsdale was taken by the SNP's Tracey Little.
Conservative group leader Ian Carruthers said he was disappointed with the outcome.
"To try and put it into context we got nearly 39% of the vote share across Dumfries and Galloway," he said.
"If you collectively add up both the SNP and Labour who have formed the administration I think they got round about 41%.
"We just think we had a clear mandate from people in Dumfries and Galloway."
He said that people had voted for a change but that was not now being delivered.
