Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester he expected Tuilagi to be out for six to eight weeks after their win over Bath.
Tuilagi scored in Leicester's opening game of the season, his only appearance so far this campaign.
The 25-year-old, capped 26 times, previously spent 15 months out with groin and hamstring problems.
"His groin is tight and we want to rehab that and get it right so it is done with," said Cockerill.
"It is a little bit frustrating for him obviously but he's working really hard in his rehab - he's in good nick, his weight's good and his attitude is brilliant at the moment.
"We've just got to be patient and when he's right he'll play."
