Dumfries DG One closure update given

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors have received an update on progress at a flagship leisure centre closed to allow major repairs to be carried out four months ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The DG One facility in Dumfries was shut in October last year, a little over six years after it opened.
It emerged several weeks later that remedial works had yet to begin on the site.
The latest update was given to councillors in private due to the legal sensitivities involved.
Gym facilities are currently in place at Loreburn Hall with a temporary swimming pool in the Ice Bowl car park.
The timescale for the works has been estimated at about five months for the so-called "dry side" facilities such as the fitness suite.
A further 13 months are likely to be needed before the swimming pool can reopen.
It means the full leisure centre is unlikely to reopen to the public until late next year at the earliest.
Dumfries and Galloway Council is seeking compensation from the contractors who built the complex.
It includes a claim for the costs of providing temporary sport facilities during the closure.
