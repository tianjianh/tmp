[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 3-0 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton earned their first victory of the season and the first under new manager Russell Slade with a 3-0 League One defeat of Shrewsbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His discouraging start, which began with two defeats and a draw, concluded with perhaps the most convincing win of unpopular owner Roland Duchatelet's reign.
The club's supporters have been among the Football League's most dejected since Duchatelet's takeover in January 2014.
He has overseen a steady decline, but a more recognisable team hinted at the first signs of recovery through two goals from Ricky Holmes and another from Johnnie Jackson.
Charlton, who climb to eighth with four points from three fixtures, were rewarded for their early desire when the impressive Holmes curled them into a 22nd-minute lead.
The winger had already demonstrated his threat with his movement and several promising runs when he again received possession in midfield.
He began another, before from the edge of the area sending a right-footed effort into the top right corner beyond Shrewsbury goalkeeper Jayson Leutwiler.
Jackson's goal almost instantly followed. With the visitors unable to clear a cross from the right in the 24th minute, the club captain reached the loose ball and routinely finished from directly in front of goal.
Holmes effectively secured Charlton's much-needed three points in the 31st minute by curling a left-wing corner directly over Leutwiler and into the top right.
They thereafter rarely committed to pursuing a fourth, but not conceding felt equally positive. Shrewsbury, who are 23rd with a point, and manager Micky Mellon look set for a difficult season.
