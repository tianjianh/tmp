[SN]TITLE[SN]
Son's sentence for 'Face/Off' killings upheld

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who killed his parents after telling police they had been replaced with imposters like in the film Face/Off has failed in a bid to have his sentence reduced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kamil Dantes, from Nottinghamshire, said he wished to "destroy" the imposters, claiming they were wearing his parents' faces as skin masks.
The sentencing judge said cannabis had induced psychotic behaviour.
He gave him a life sentence with a minimum term of 18 years.
The case reached the Appeal Court because his legal team challenged the length of the minimum term, but the appeal was rejected.
Lady Justice Hallett said: "These were the most brutal attacks on two innocent and virtually defenceless human beings.
"It was an impeccable sentencing exercise. No complaint can be made about the length of this minimum term."
Dantes, from Worksop, was originally charged with murder but the prosecution accepted his guilty pleas of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The 29-year-old, now aged 31, was ordered to be detained in a psychiatric unit when he was sentenced on 20 July 2015.
His minimum term would have been 19 years and 73 days but was reduced to 17 years and 354 days because he had spent more than a year in custody by the time he was sentenced.
Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Mr Justice Jeremy Baker and Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, rejected claims that Dantes received insufficient credit for his guilty pleas.
She dismissed arguments that the judge should have taken more account of his anguished history of mental health problems.
Lady Justice Hallett also noted that he had taken cannabis and amphetamines shortly before the killings, despite knowing that this could worsen his fragile condition.
