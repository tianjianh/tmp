The 29-year-old former Leyton Orient and Stevenage player joined the Reds in May 2014.
He has since made 76 appearances, scoring two league goals and recovered from a broken ankle last season.
"His experience, a willingness to work hard and his energy are all important attributes to have at this level," head coach Dermot Drummy said.
Meanwhile midfielder Bobson Bawling has also agreed a one-year contract with the West Sussex club, with the option of a further year.
