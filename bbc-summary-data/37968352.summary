Tottenham striker Harry Kane has been released from the England squad before Tuesday's friendly with Spain as he recovers from injury.

The 23-year-old has played 73 minutes for Spurs since damaging his ankle against Sunderland on 18 September.
He was an unused substitute for England's World Cup qualifying win over Scotland on Friday.
"The sessions we're going to do aren't what Harry needs at this time," said interim England boss Gareth Southgate.
"It was never really my intention to start him in a game and I think it's important that he gets a different training programme to what we're going to follow over the next couple of days."
England have not called up a replacement for Kane, leaving Daniel Sturridge, Jamie Vardy, Marcus Rashford, Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott as striker options.
Spain's visit to Wembley is the fourth and final fixture Southgate was given responsibility for, but with England still top of their 2018 World Cup qualifying group, he is heavy favourite to get the job on a full-time basis.
Kane, who scored his third league goal of the season on his return from injury in the north London derby against Arsenal, will be available for Spurs' fixture against West Ham on Saturday.
