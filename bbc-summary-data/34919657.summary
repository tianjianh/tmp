A learner driver took a wrong turn and ended up travelling on a motorway in the middle of a test, police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hampshire force tweeted: "Officers assisted driver on driving test who took wrong turn off roundabout and ended up on M27. Test abandoned & driver failed."
On the same motorway, on the same day, police also stopped a driver for watching YouTube on a smartphone.
Another driver was pulled over for using an iPad.
The road policing unit said the learner driver ended up on the eastbound carriageway at junction seven for Hedge End.
A spokesman said the learner and the instructor pulled the VW Passatt on to the hard shoulder before officers assisted the vehicle off the motorway.
A provisional licence does not allow learner drivers to use motorways.
