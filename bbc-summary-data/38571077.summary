More arrests have been made in connection with a bikers' Halloween "ride out" in Leeds.

About 50 bikers caused chaos on 31 October when they brought a major route into Leeds to a standstill and rode dangerously through the city centre.
Two men, aged 27, and one, aged 23, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance.
Nine men and a woman who were previously arrested remain on police bail.
Meanwhile, Leeds City Council has been granted a five-year extension to its county court injunction banning similar events.

The injunction allowed officers to stop ride outs planned to take place before Christmas and on New Year's Eve, police said.
Labour councillor Debra Coupar, executive member for communities at Leeds City Council, said the injunction allowed the authority to "take action against people behaving irresponsibly", but would "not affect people who ride in groups in a law-abiding and sensible fashion".
The order bans more than one motor vehicle meeting in a public place in the Leeds district to drive anti-socially. It also forbids people from promoting or organising any such meet-ups.
In October witnesses posted videos online showing bikers in convoy, with some pulling wheelies and others riding on the pavement.
The scene was described as "utter chaos" by one passer-by and compared with the Mel Gibson film Mad Max.
