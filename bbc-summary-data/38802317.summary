Rekeil Pyke: Colchester United sign Huddersfield Town forward on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester United have signed Rekeil Pyke on loan from Huddersfield Town until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old forward has yet to play a competitive first-team match for the Terriers but did feature in pre-season friendlies against Liverpool, FC Ingolstadt 04 and Oldham in 2016.
He had a three-game loan at National League side Wrexham earlier this term.
The deal to take him to Colchester, ninth in League Two, would include the play-offs should they reach them.
