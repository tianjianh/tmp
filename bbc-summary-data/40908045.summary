[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester's search for their first League Two win of the season continues after they were soundly beaten by Luton Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Olly Lee scored on the stroke of half-time with James Collins and Dan Potts sealing the win for the Hatters in the second half.
Colchester went close early on, Doug Loft's long range effort testing goalkeeper Marek Stech, while Luton striker Danny Hylton's header was parried away by Sam Walker.
Town midfielder Lee was denied by an excellent save from Walker and Andrew Shinnie then shot straight at the keeper from Jack Stacey's cross.
Hatters were ahead on the stroke of half time, though, Lee firing home at the second attempt when a corner was not cleared.
After the break, Alan McCormack's fierce shot was superbly tipped over by Walker, although he could do nothing but watch as Collins curled into the top corner in the 52nd minute.
Hatters keeper Stech produced an incredible save to keep out Sammie Szmodics' close-range header, while Luton almost got a third, with Hylton heading against the bar.
Alan Sheehan saw his volley hit the woodwork too before Potts made it 3-0 with seven minutes remaining after touching home Sheehan's free-kick.
