Ex-West Ham United and Wales midfielder Jack Collison is retiring from football at the age of 27 because of injury.

Collison played 121 times for West Ham, but suffered persistent knee problems.
He signed for League One Peterborough in 2015, playing 12 times, but will now focus on a coaching and media career.
"The nights I wake up in pain, or the mornings where I struggle to walk, will be a constant reminder I was lucky enough to play the game I love," said Collison, capped 17 times by Wales.
"I still wake up some mornings feeling good and think 'one more try'," said Collison, who dislocated a kneecap while playing for the Hammers in 2009.
"But that would be unfair on myself, my fellow pros and my family. I want to bow out with some pride intact."
