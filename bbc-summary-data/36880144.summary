[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peter Trego's century earned Somerset a tense victory over Middlesex in the One-Day Cup at Taunton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trego and Lewis Gregory's (69) decisive 86-run fourth-wicket partnership helped the hosts claim a four-wicket win.
Having been put in to bat, Nick Gubbins (89) and Paul Stirling (58) hit half-centuries before James Fuller's 42 off 26 balls propelled Middlesex to 296-9.
However, Trego followed up his 2-27 with the ball with 104 as Somerset reached 297-6 with an over spare.
An 83-run first-wicket partnership between Stirling (58) and Ryan Higgins set the platform well for Middlesex, before Trego had the latter caught at cover for 39.
Gubbins went on the attack as he hit his first fifty of the tournament, clubbing four fours and three sixes in his 78-ball knock, but fell 11 runs short of three figures as he was caught at short fine leg off Tim Groenewald.
It was left to Fuller, who did not bowl for the away side during the second innings, to get Middlesex just shy of 300 with both Ollie Rayner and James Harris run out off the final two balls.
Somerset faltered early on, slipping to 24-2, after Jim Allenby was caught for a duck off Harris and Johann Myburgh was forced off the field with a back injury.
Trego steadied the innings as the 35-year-old hit nine fours and a six, but he was bowled by Rayner with Somerset still 94 runs short of victory.
However, Roelof van der Merwe bludgeoned 41 in a stand of 71 with Gregory to see the hosts in sight of victory before Josh Davey and Craig Overton took them over the line.
