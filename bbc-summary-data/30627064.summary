In the week before Christmas, the GP out of hours service had 20% more calls than in the same period in 2013.
There were also more calls on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and the following weekend for the entire week last year.
Dr. Sharon Hopkins, of Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, asked patients to only use the service in emergencies.
