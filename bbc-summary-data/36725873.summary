The Ocean Film Festival World Tour was brought to Scotland for the first time last year and visited Edinburgh and Inverness.
It will be at Edinburgh's Festival Theatre on 14 September and return to Inverness's Eden Court on 15 September.
The University of Glasgow will stage the festival on 22 October.
Venues in England and Wales are also part of the tour.
Many of the short films deal with the pursuit of water sports and expeditions in harsh environments.
These include Kayaking the Aleutians about British explorers Justine Curgenven and Sarah Outen's bid to paddle 1,553 miles (2,500km) along the Aleutian chain of islands in Alaska.
The women spent 101 days battling high winds, rough seas and unexpected powerful currents and also had close encounters with bears.
Iceland's first and only professional surfer, HeiÃ°ar Logi ElÃ­asson, is the subject of The Accord, while India's First Surfer Girl tells of Ishita Malaviya's experience of challenging negative attitudes and stereotypes to her becoming her country's first female surfer.
In an introduction to her film, Malaviya said: "In India women are expected to get an education, find a job, get married and then make babies."
The Right, another of the films, tells of Australian Gold Coast surfer Ryan Hippwood's efforts to ride on one of the world's most dangerous and unpredictable waves.
Dubbed The Right, the waves break off the coast of Western Australia.
Frenchman Corentin de Chatelperron's six-month voyage through the islands of Indonesia on a boat with two egg-laying hens and a small greenhouse to grow potatoes is the subject of Gold of Bengal.
One Voice examines the threats to the survival of North Pacific humpback whales.
