"Poo To Me", a cover of You To Me Are Everything by The Real Thing, is the brainchild of Rochford District Council in Essex.
With dogs wearing "Scoop My Poop" neckerchiefs and the lyrics "To me it seems insanity when people put it in a tree", the video hopes to stamp out dog fouling for good.
Portfolio holder for environment Keith Gordon, said: "Dog fouling on our streets, parks and open spaces looks bad, smells bad, and is offensive to everyone. Rochford District Council want to address this issue."
