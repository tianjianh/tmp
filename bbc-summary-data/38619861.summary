[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter City boosted their play-off hopes with a victory over fellow League Two play-off hopefuls Colchester United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reuben Reid opened the scoring for the hosts in the first half, with David Wheeler doubling their advantage 13 minutes before the end.
And substitute Liam McAlinden added the third late on as Exeter extended their unbeaten run to nine games and ended Colchester's own nine-game unbeaten record.
Exeter took a 20th-minute lead thanks to a composed finish by Reid.
Ollie Watkins was the provider with a stunning piece of control and through ball, and Reid made no mistake, sending an angled drive into the far corner of the net.
After Reid's second goal in his last two games, the Grecians squandered two glorious chances to extend their lead in the first half.
Troy Brown rose highest to head Lloyd James' corner narrowly wide before the defender sent another header into the side-netting moments later.
Exeter keeper Christy Pym was only troubled once and produced a stunning finger-tip save to divert Brennan Dickenson's free-kick over the bar in the first half.
Wheeler made it 2-0 in the 77th minute after being teed up by Watkins as the duo broke at pace and the U's were caught on the counter.
And McAlinden made it 3-0 in the 89th minute as he latched onto Watkins' pass and rolled the ball under Sam Walker.
