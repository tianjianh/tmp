[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took the lead when Anthony Knockaert fired home with a low strike, before Glenn Murray tapped in Liam Rosenior's cross to make it 2-0.
Tomer Hemed had the ball in the net after the break, but his effort was ruled out after Knockaert had handled.
Hemed scored from the spot soon after when Stephen Kelly fouled Murray as the hosts continued their unbeaten start.
Chris Hughton's side, who drew at Derby and beat Nottingham Forest in their opening two matches, moved up five places to the Championship summit.
Rotherham are now without a win in their last eight league games and slip to 20th place in the table following the defeat.
It was a frustrating night for the Millers as they could not find a way past Brighton goalkeeper Niki Maenpaa, who was making his league debut for the club.
Brighton manager Chris Hughton:
"We had to wait for our moments. But there were two moments of quality for the first two goals. Bruno has not played too many games at centre-back but I knew he could play there. He`s been good for [Lewis] Dunk as well and the clean sheet is as pleasing as the goals.
"I am delighted with the result and the performances so far in being unbeaten. We have a tough game at Reading on Saturday and we must try and keep the run going.
"It was a really important win today. You have got to do well at home as it will be tougher away from home."
Rotherham United manager Alan Stubbs:
"I knew it would be a challenge and tough. It makes me even more excited to do something with the opportunity. I don`t fear what is in front of me. It is what it is and it makes it rewarding when you get results.
"We have changed considerably the way we try and play and our squad has to grow into the demands of this division very quickly. When they do, they`ll compete much better."
"After our trip to Aston Villa, coming to Brighton was always going to be difficult. We make a mistake in our box and give Brighton an opportunity for their first goal. Then the game drifted away from us and we didn't stop the cross for the second goal.
"But in the second half we showed a little bit of character and that pleased me. Sometimes at 2-0 you can accept things and the hardest thing is to do something about it. We did that much better in the second half."
