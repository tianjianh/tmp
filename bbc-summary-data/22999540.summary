The Market Hall Cinema in Brynmawr used to be run by the local council but when it announced its funding would stop last month, work began to find a way to keep it going.
In February about 4,000 people signed a petition in support of saving the cinema which is believed to be the longest continuously run in Wales, dating back to 1894.
Here, Peter Watkins-Hughes explains more to BBC Wales Gwent Valleys reporter Paul Heaney.
