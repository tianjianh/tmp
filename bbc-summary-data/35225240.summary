The episode was watched by an average of 6.6 million viewers live on the day and it beat EastEnders in the ratings battle.
New consolidated figures show a total of 10.5 million watched the ITV drama.
The Queen's Christmas Broadcast was the most watched on 25 December itself with 7.2 million viewers watching it live.
The figure is combined from its broadcasts on both the BBC and ITV.
The consolidated figures include people who watched the programmes on catch-up, but does not include those who watch the BBC's iPlayer or ITV Player through computers.
Taking the new numbers into account means the Queen's Christmas Broadcast was knocked from the top of the ratings to number six.
Comedy Mrs Brown's Boys was in second place with 9.5 million viewers, up 3.1 million on the overnight figures. Call the Midwife came third with 9.30 million, with 3.5 million viewers watching on catch-up.
BBC One animation Stick Man was in fourth place with 9.28 million viewers, up 2.9 million.
And the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special was in fifth place with a total 8.54 million viewers, which is up 2.1 million.
