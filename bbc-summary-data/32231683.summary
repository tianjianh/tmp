A man has been charged after a 70-year-old cancer patient was attacked for his holiday cash in Cheltenham.

John Jukes received six fractures to his eye socket during the mugging, in which he lost 3,000 euros (£2,190) he had recently withdrawn.
A 30-year-old has been charged with grievous bodily harm and robbery and is due to appear before magistrates.
More than £1,600 has been raised so far in a campaign to reimburse Mr Jukes before his trip to Greece.
