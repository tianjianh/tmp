Information and support for young people

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some stories and subjects young people see and share, or might want to report about themselves, may cause them anxiety or unexpected upset.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Whatever the worry is, it's always better to talk about it.
If you or someone you know is concerned about something we suggest speaking to someone you/they know and trust - this could be a family member or friend, a teacher, school nurse or GP.
The following organisations and helplines can also provide support for young people who are upset or want to get advice, particularly about their mental health and wellbeing.
If you need advice or just want to talk, call Childline: 0800 1111 (available 24 hours and calls are confidential and free).
Childline can help and support young people (up to 19) with any issue they're going through, no matter how big or small, if you are feeling sad or worried, or if you just want someone to talk to.
You can also talk to a Counsellor confidentially online on the Childline website.
Young Minds helps children and young people to cope with difficult feelings - their website has lots of useful information and you can also call them on: 020 7336 8445 (local rates).
