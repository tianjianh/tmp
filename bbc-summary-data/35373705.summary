Wicketkeeper James Foster has signed a new two-year contract at Essex, a month after leaving his role as club captain.

The 35-year-old, who made seven Test appearances for England between 2001 and 2002, has spent his entire 15-year professional career at Chelmsford.
Foster has scored 12,499 first-class career runs at an average of 37.08, alongside 785 dismissals.
"James, in my opinion, is still one of the best wicketkeepers in the world," said Essex head coach Chris Silverwood.
"He's got vast experience and is a great individual to have around the club, especially for the younger players coming through."
Foster had been Essex skipper for five years but it was announced in December he would no longer continue in the role.
The county is yet to announce his successor.
