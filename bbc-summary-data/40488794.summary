Turner, 34, won at Windsor aboard the 11-2 shot Flying Sparkle, trained by Michael Bell.
The ride was a warm-up for Turner's appearance in the new Lady Jockeys' Thoroughbred World Championship in Sweden on Tuesday.
Turner was unseated after the winning line but was unhurt.
She retired in 2015 but came back to ride for the female team at last year's Shergar Cup event at Ascot.
Turner, who returned again for one ride at Windsor before the Swedish event, says she has no plans to resume her career as a jockey.
