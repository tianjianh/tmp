Lincoln Plaza in London's Docklands won the 2016 Carbuncle Cup with one judge describing it as a "horror show" and the "embodiment of sea sickness".
It's the fifth consecutive time a London building has scooped the dubious honour run by Building Design Magazine (BD).
Galliard Homes said its "scheme sold out to buyers, so clearly the project is liked by the purchasers".
The developers said: "Architectural design is art, and like all art, a matter of personal tastes. Each project the company delivers is bespoke and distinctive and the company has built a strong reputation for rapidly selling out."
Lincoln Plaza, designed by BUJ Architects, consists of two, 31-storey residential towers - named Franklin and Greenwich - integrated with a hotel.
On its website, Galliard Homes said it offers "breathtaking views, first class facilities and superlative living accommodation... Lincoln Plaza is set to provide one of the most prestigious and sophisticated new landmarks on Canary Wharf's iconic skyline."
Prices start at Â£795,000 for a 3 bedroom flat with residents having access to a snooker suite, private cinema, gym and sky garden.
Ike Ijeh, BD's architectural critic said: "Lincoln Plaza is actually in South Quay and not Canary Wharf but what better way of showing contempt for your local context than by insinuating it is actually located in your flashier neighbouring district?"
He described Lincoln Plaza as a "putrid pugilistic horror show that should never have been built... it exhibits the absolute worst in shambolic architectural design and cheap visual gimmickry.
"This building is the architectural embodiment of sea sickness."
The architect firm declined to comment.
Two other London buildings made the six-strong short-list - luxury development Saffron Square which was described as having a "car crash of a facade" and 5 Broadgate the home to UBS was called a "mute steel fortress".
Also on the short-list was The Diamond, accommodation for University of Sheffield engineering students, One Smithfield in Stoke on Trent, and an extension to Poole Methodist Church.
