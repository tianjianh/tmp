Watford v Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watford will make a late decision on whether to start Troy Deeney, who has returned to training following illness.

Sebastian Prodl is also doubtful with a calf problem, while Valon Behrami has been ruled out with a thigh injury.
Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole is getting closer to making his first appearance since September after a hip problem but Saturday may come too soon.
Victor Anichebe has also returned to training after a long-term injury, while Lamine Kone is fit again.
Mark Scott: "Sunderland will desperately be hoping Jermain Defoe's almost inevitable goal on his England return can kick-start a glut of them at club level, after what constitutes a mini barren patch by his high-scoring standards.
"But others need to step up too in order to get the ball to him more often, as Defoe's been provided with hardly any opportunities during his - and the team's - four-match run without a goal.
"Despite a seven-point cushion above the drop zone, there's some worry around Watford after just two league wins since mid-December has caused them to slip from seventh to 14th.
"Walter Mazzarri insists he's 'not too concerned' about their position in the table - lose this one and that view might have to change."

Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri: "The last 15 days I have tried to make the players understand that I want them to treat all of the last 10 games as if they were cup finals.
"We always want to win and would like to win this game. I heard the Sunderland manager said they are coming here to get three points.
"We will try and win and play the way I like, we will give everything for sure. Let's not forget that Sunderland are a strong team."
Sunderland manager David Moyes: "We go into these games knowing we have to win them because they are running out. No half measures.
"We have got a big week now, three games this week coming up, so we have to look to take points.
"Watford are a powerful team. I think they've done fine and they have some good players in their team, so it'll be a tough game."
Watford have only taken one point from their past four games and are the team looking the most likely to slide into relegation trouble.
I think the Hornets will stop their slump at the weekend, however, unless Sunderland manage a massive improvement on their recent performances.
Prediction: 2-1
