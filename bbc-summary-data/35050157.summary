An inshore rescue vessel has been stolen from a Dorset lifesaving saving charity.

The rolled up inflatable is thought to have been taken from a storage container at Branksome Chine Surf Lifesaving Club sometime on Tuesday.
The volunteer-run charity bought the Â£6,500 boat during the summer to be used for beach safety patrols and training for flood rescues.
Club captain Phil Nye said he "felt sick" when he heard about the theft.
Members of the club have just returned from helping in the aftermath of the floods in Cumbria.
Mr Nye said the locked container appeared to have been broken into sometime on Tuesday afternoon, with the Arancia 380 Inshore Rescue Boat, a specialist Tohatsu outboard engine and other safety equipment taken.
"I'm exasperated - it seems so pointless to steal from an organisation like ours."
He said the specialist nature of the equipment and the branding on the boat would make it difficult for a thief to sell on and he was concerned it would be dumped.
Dorset Police confirmed officers were called to the break in on Shore Road, Branskome on Tuesday afternoon and appealed for any information.
