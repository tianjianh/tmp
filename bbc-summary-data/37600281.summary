Henry Brooke: Jockey out of induced coma after fall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jockey Henry Brooke has been brought out of an induced coma following a fall at a Hexham racecourse on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"He's had a much more comfortable day and has regained consciousness which is fantastic news," a statement from the Injured Jockeys' Fund read.
"The doctors are pleased with his progress."
Brooke, 25, is believed to have broken his collarbone and suffered a suspected collapsed lung when riding Old Storm in a novices' handicap chase.
Racing was delayed for almost two hours as medical staff treated Brooke in the wake of his mount's fall and a kick from another horse, before he was taken to hospital.
