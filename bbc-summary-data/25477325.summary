[SN]TITLE[SN]
Work set to start on Far Gosford Street in Coventry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work to finish the restoration of one of the few Coventry city streets to escape World War Two bombing and post-war redevelopment is expected to start.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Far Gosford Street is described by the council as "one of the city's most important historic streets".
In April, Â£1m of Heritage Lottery funding was given towards a programme of restoring shop fronts.
The street has 14 Grade-II listed buildings, including a number with medieval timber frames.
The project is organised by a partnership between Coventry City Council and Complex Development Projects (CDP).
Chris Patrick, the council's conservation and archaeology officer, said the first phase of the scheme in 2012, which cost Â£2.7m, had seen the repair of two timber-framed buildings and a 19th Century weaver, among other projects.
The council hopes that by restoring the rest of the street, they will be able to turn it into a "bohemian quarter for the city".
Mr Patrick said: "Many of these historic buildings look a bit sad. We want to rescue them from a world of fried chicken and general grot."
He added the final phase would start in early 2014.
Councillor Lynnette Kelly said: "Far Gosford Street is one of Coventry's gems, a great survivor from the past.
"The regeneration that has taken place over the last few years has reversed decades of decline.  But it remains a job half-done and this funding allows us to complete the job, tackling buildings that missed out in the first phase."
