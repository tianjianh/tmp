Nama deal: Irish police investigate new claims by Mick Wallace

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in the Republic of Ireland have begun an investigation into claims in the Irish parliament (Dáil) by the Independent TD Mick Wallace that an official at Nama sought a bribe from an agency debtor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wexford TD alleged in the Dáil on Wednesday that a portfolio officer had asked for the money from a construction company that wanted to discharge its debts to the agency.
His remarks were condemned by the speaker of the house who said the Dáil should not be used as a "star chamber".
Prime minister Enda Kenny said the Public Accounts Committee was the body charged with oversight of Nama.
Mr Wallace first raised claimed about the sale of Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio, alleging in the Dáil  that a payment of £7m was due to be made to a politician though no evidence has been produced for that claim.
The chief executive of Nama has said that Mr Wallace had not provided the agency with any information relating to what he spoke about in the Dáil on Wednesday.
In response to Mr Wallace's claims of money being sought by, or paid to, people linked to the agency, Nama's chief executive Brendan McDonagh has written to the country's police chief to ask him to investigate the claims.
