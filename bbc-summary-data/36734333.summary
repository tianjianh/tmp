Judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry will continue to preside over the competition, once again presented by Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc.
BBC director of content Charlotte Moore said: "Mary, Paul, Mel and Sue are the perfect recipe for the festive season."
The shows will replace the Bake Off Masterclass programmes.
Last year saw Nadiya Hussain win the final of the show after baking a "big fat British wedding cake" adorned with jewels from her own wedding day as the showstopper.
The final became the most-watched TV programme of the year with an average audience of 15.1 million people, according to consolidated figures, which include catch-up viewing.
Hussain went on to bake the Queen's 90th birthday cake in April.
