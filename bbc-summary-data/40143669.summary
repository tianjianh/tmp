Republic of Ireland: Robbie Brady impatient for return against Uruguay

Robbie Brady is ready to deliver for the Republic of Ireland after what he admits has been a 'stop start' season.

The Burnley midfielder missed the World Cup qualifier against Wales through suspension but plays in Sunday's friendly against Uruguay in Dublin.
The game is vital preparation for the qualifier with Austria on 11 June.
"I feel confident," says Brady, "I enjoy playing on the big stage internationally and I am really looking forward to these games".
Brady, 25, missed his country's home qualifier with Wales in March after being booked for the second time in the campaign during November's 1-0 win over the Austrians in Vienna.
He is raring to go after finding himself cast in the role of spectator in the scoreless draw against the Welsh.
"It was a tough one last time. I was in training for the full time the lads were in, so it was a hard one to watch.
"But it was a decent result and I got to play in the following (friendly) game against Iceland, so it just gave me a bit of a taste for it again.
"I have been waiting now. I can't wait for these games coming up. I am really looking forward to tomorrow's game and the big one next week."
It is almost a year since the former Manchester United youngster burst onto the international stage with a series of fine displays as Ireland reached the last 16 at the Euro 2016 finals in France.
His exploits were rewarded with a big-money move from Norwich to Burnley, although the transition to life at Turf Moor has not been as smooth as he would have liked.
To date, he has made just seven Premier League starts for the Clarets and the same number of appearances as a substitute, scoring one goal, a stunning equaliser against eventual champions Chelsea.
"This season has been a little bit stop-start for me personally, but every time I've come back here, I've been ready to play.
"I'm fit and I am excited for these two games coming up. I love coming back here to play. I've been in and around the squad for a number of years now and I have been learning every time I've come in."
Manager Martin O'Neill is likely to turn to his senior players once again after fielding a largely inexperienced side in a 3-1 defeat by Mexico in New Jersey during the early hours of Friday morning.
Brady, Keiren Westwood, John O'Shea, Jeff Hendrick, Aiden McGeady, Jonny Hayes and Jonathan Walters joined up for training on Friday and Glenn Whelan and Harry Arter followed suit on Saturday.
