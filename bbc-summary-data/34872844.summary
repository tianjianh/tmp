Ramute Butkiene's remains were discovered after an unpleasant smell was reported coming from a room rented by boyfriend Vytautas Jokubauskas.
Jokubauskas, 57, of Mayor's Walk, Peterborough, was found guilty of her murder by a Southwark Crown Court jury.
Judge Nicholas Loraine Smith sentenced him to a minimum of 20 years in prison.
Jokubauskas, who had denied murder but admitted manslaughter, also pleaded guilty to preventing the burial of a corpse at an earlier hearing.
The torso of Ms Butkiene, 42, was found in the locked room on 5 June this year.
Jokubauskas had strangled Ms Butkiene with the cord from her dressing gown around a week ealier, the court heard, after accusing her of seeing another man.
He then dismembered her body before watching war films and drinking whisky with her torso stuffed into a suitcase next to him.
Jokubauskas buried her arms and legs in nearby wooded areas and disposed of her head before going on the run, jurors were told.
He was tracked down and arrested on 7 June, just a few streets away from where he had left his girlfriend's body.
During interview, he told police "I am a killer" and said he had strangled his girlfriend "just a little" to scare her.
Speaking after the sentence, Det Insp Pushpa Guild said: "This was a gruesome crime against an innocent woman, all because of a moment of jealousy.
"In a moment of rage, Jokubauskas killed Ramute and then butchered her in an attempt to cover his tracks."
