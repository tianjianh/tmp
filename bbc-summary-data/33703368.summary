The importance of Neil Armstrong's first moon walk has not diminished with the passing years, but they have not been so kind to his spacesuit.

Lisa Young has taken on the task of conserving the iconic suit worn for his Apollo 11 Moon landing mission.
She has become an expert in conserving museum objects after graduating from Cardiff University.
A crowd-funding project has raised more than Â£320,000 ($500,000) for the three-year spacesuit conservation project.
Ms Young helps to protect historic items for the Smithsonian, a collection of museums in the United States.
The spacesuit will eventually go on display at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) in Washington DC for the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission in July 2019.
For the past two decades Ms Young has been studying the technology, engineering and materials related to the aerospace collections at the NASM.
She said: "I am honoured to be able to contribute the skills gained through conservation training at the university and am pleased that the funding was awarded to take the next steps to preserve this national icon.
"It means a lot to the museum, the public and the world and we feel really strongly that we wanted to have the spacesuit back on display for the 50th anniversary in 2019 for everyone to see."
