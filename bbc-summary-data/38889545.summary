[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 0-0 Sheffield United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Fleck was denied by the woodwork as League One leaders Sheffield United had to settle for a goalless draw at Bristol Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder drove a low shot against a post from the edge of the box on 57 minutes after a poor clearance by goalkeeper Joe Lumley had put Rovers in trouble.
Both keepers distinguished themselves in the second half, Lumley stretching to keep out a Caolan Lavery shot and United's Simon Moore diving to divert a Cristian Montano effort around a post.
Rovers thought they had won it when Rory Gaffney headed home on 84 minutes but the striker was ruled offside.
The best chance of an even first half fell to United's Jay O'Shea on nine minutes. Unmarked moving onto a Lavery cross, his first time shot was just wide of the left hand post.
Billy Bodin offered the biggest first-half threat for Rovers and twice went close with efforts from outside the box.
Ollie Clarke fired just over for the hosts but the only save of note came from Lumley, when he dived to parry a 44th-minute header from Lavery.
