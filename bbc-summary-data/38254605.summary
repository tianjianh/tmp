Players involved in the incident with Morpeth Town, following Newton's 3-2 FA Vase defeat, have also left the club.
Dixon was dismissed "due to the on-going ill-discipline" of some players.
"It's not been easy but we've acted straight away and want to draw a line under it," chairman Allan Oliver told BBC Sport.
"If there are any investigations we will fully take part, but it is difficult to comment further."
Newton Aycliffe, of Northern Football League Division One - the ninth tier of English football - have previously been the subject of a Durham Football Association investigation after Spennymoor Town refused to play the second half of a pre-season friendly in July after the match took an "aggressive direction".
Oliver said Dixon's departure was related only to Saturday's incident.
Morpeth's joint-chairman Gary Munday said the club, who play in the same league as Newton Aycliffe, are in the process of submitting a full statement to the Football Association as the incident is understood to have also been witnessed by the match referee.
While the club have not made a complaint to police, they said that if any player was to report an assault they will fully support any investigation.
Video footage of the clash at Newton Aycliffe's Moore Lane Park ground against their north east rivals shows a number of players from the home side running towards and gathering at the visitors' dressing room door.
Morpeth staff and coaches are said to have kept Newton Aycliffe players back, with at least one member of the home club's staff also trying to keep players out.
Oliver and another staff member are also understood to have walked Morpeth players back to their cars after the match.
Munday said he "had never witnessed anything like it at a football match" and "applauded Newton Aycliffe's strong stance" in dealing with the matter internally.
However, he fears it could have an effect on the club's support.
"We are shocked and disgusted by what happened," he said.
"Morpeth Town is a very family-orientated football club as we encourage our juniors, free of charge to support the club - that grass-root support is the future of football.
"Unfortunately, we have had parents say that they will never take their children to away games again.
"We will try to encourage them back as we do feel that this is a one-off."
The BBC have contacted the FA for comment, but are yet to get a response.
