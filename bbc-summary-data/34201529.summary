[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cannabis factory clearer job advertised by police in Somerset

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cannabis factory clearer is being sought by Avon and Somerset Police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The force said the job would involve being on call 24-hours a day, 365 days a year, and working in confined spaces, at height and underground.
Successful applicants will not only be required to clear sites of "all plants" but recycle them in the "appropriate manner".
The recruitment is part of Operation Viscount, which aims to tackle cannabis cultivation in the region.
Along with a full, current driving licence applicants will also need a tolerance for high temperatures and a "good level of physical fitness" as "bending, lifting and stretching" would be required.
Interviews for the £17,763 to £18,933-a-year post are due to take place in October.
