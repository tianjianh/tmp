Terry McSpadden, from Elm in Norfolk, was 24 when he disappeared after a night out at The Locomotive pub in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, on 1 March 2007.
The father of two is presumed dead and a pre-inquest hearing has been held in King's Lynn.
His mother Helen Thrower said the family "needed closure".
She said: "Please, somebody needs to come forward, we need to know what happened to Terry.
"You get up every morning, it's like living in a nightmare because it's the same thing, day in, day out.
"You just think, birthdays, Christmases, where is he, why can't I just send him a card, why can't we do anything?
"Why do we have to live in this nightmare when somebody could easily just stop it for us?"
The last sighting of Mr McSpadden was at Tesco in Wisbech at 01:00 on 2 March when he said he was going home to nearby Elm, but never arrived.
Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake held the pre-inquest hearing to make preparations for a full inquest later in the year.
Norfolk Police said the case remains "unsolved" and, while it is not currently conducting an active investigation, "should any new information come to light it would be reviewed accordingly".
