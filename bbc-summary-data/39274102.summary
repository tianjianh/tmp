Super League: Hull FC 32-12 Widnes Vikings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Widnes are still without a win in the 2017 Super League season after Albert Kelly scored two tries for Hull FC.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aaron Heremaia's fourth-minute try was the only time the visitors were ahead and Hull led by six points at the break thanks to Kelly and Mahe Fonua.
Danny Houghton, Jamie Shaul and Kelly's second try of the night saw the hosts move up to second in the table.
Lloyd White ran in a late consolation for Widnes but they have now lost four of their opening five matches.
Hull move level on points with leaders Castleford who travel to Salford on Sunday.
The visitors went in front when Heremaia threw a dummy to open up the Hull defence and go over, while White added the extras.
But Hull hit straight back as a Marc Sneyd's cross-field kick was caught by Fonua, who set up Kelly to score.
Fonua dived in for his first try of the season following a pass by Kelly as the home side led 14-6 at the break.
Hull scored two tries in three minutes when Houghton pounced on Sneyd's kick-through, before Mark Minichiello's break down the left freed Shaul to go over.
Sneyd added the extras on both occasions to go with the six points he scored in the first half.
Two minutes later, Minichiello was held up but Kelly powered over after a smart dummy and Sneyd put over the conversion.
White converted his own try with eight minutes remaining, but it was too little too late for winless Widnes.
Hull coach Lee Radford:
"First and foremost I'm pleased with the result. How we started the second half went a long way towards dictating the scoreline.
"I'm pleased with the way we went about our business. There was some fluency in what we did, which I said would come.
"It sets us up nicely for the fixture next week. Wigan at Wigan is a tough fixture and it's one we're looking forward to."
Widnes coach Denis Betts:
"We keep giving sides 18 points by rolling over in patches in the game. We are making it easy for sides.
"We were up against a side running pretty hot with threats from all over the field, but I felt we handled them well for big patches of the game.
"We went toe to toe with them in the first half, which shows we're not far off but then we hit a patch and look like a side that looks like it doesn't know what it's doing."
