On Twitter, the Delta told passengers: "Our systems are down everywhere."
Delays were reported at a string of airports, including in the US, the UK, Iceland and Japan.
The airline has said en route flights are unaffected, but passengers waiting to board should check their flight status while the issue is addressed.
"Delta experienced a computer outage that has impacted flights scheduled for this morning," it said in a statement.
"Flights awaiting departure are currently delayed. Flights en route are operating normally."
One passenger told the BBC he was waiting with "several hundred" fellow stranded passengers at San Francisco airport, after being asked to leave a plane he had already boarded.
"We were ordered off the lane after approximately an hour or more," said Dick Ginkowski.
"Tempers are starting to get just a little bit strained at this point," he added. "They aren't able to rebook anyone on other carriers."
