Olympic Games-bound Ciara Mageean and former European Indoor 400m champion David Gillick will be among the athletes in action at Saturday's Belfast International meeting.

Dublin-based Mageean, 24, will be returning to the Mary Peters Track to compete in a mixed 3,000m race.
Meeting director Eamonn Christie coached the Portaferry woman for several years in Belfast before she linked up with Jerry Kiernan.
Gillick, 32, will race in the 400m.
The Dubliner clocked 48.05 seconds at a meeting in Italy last weekend as he continues a low-key comeback.
That time was 3.28 seconds outside the Irish record he set back in 2009 but Gillick reported afterwards that he had plenty in the tank at the finish after not pacing the race correctly.
The 2005 and 2007 European Indoor Champion has said that he is running purely for enjoyment at the moment and insists that he has no targets.
County Down woman Mageean ran well in the winter as she set new Irish indoor 1500m and mile records but it will be interesting to see her form at the Mary Peters Track where Christie helped to develop her talent.
While Mageean, who has qualified for the Olympic 1500m, will be the meeting's main attraction, a plethora of other international athletes will also be in action.
Poland's European Junior Championship bronze medallist Matusz Borkowski, who has an 800m personal best of 1:47.73, will be joined in the two-lap event by his compatriot Gurdak Kamil (pb 1:47.34) plus Scotland's Cameron Boyek and Irishman Joe Warne.
The women's 800m is shaping up to possibly be the race of the meeting with last year's winner England's Alexandra Bell set to take on a field which will include local athletes Katie Kirk, Aislinn Crossey, Erin McIlveen and Kelly Neely plus another Polish visitor Monika Halasa and Irish international Laura Crowe.
Ballymena & Antrim's European Championship hopeful Christine McMahon will be in a women's 400m hurdles field which includes her fellow Irish international Jessie Barr plus British duo Jess Turner and Georgina Rogers.
The men's 3000m is set to feature Irish middle distance talents John Travers and Kevin Maunsell while the Eamonn Christie-coached James O'Hare will be in a 1500m entry that also includes Irish international Rory Chesser and English duo Richard Weir and Dan Studley.
Banbridge athlete Emma Mitchell will be up against Olympic Games-qualified Irish star Ciara Everard in the women's 1500m.
The meeting is being jointly organised by Athletics Northern Ireland, Beechmount Harriers and the Irish Milers Club.
After a number of underage races, the main programme will start with the men's 110m hurdles at 14:05 BST with Mageean's 3000m race scheduled for 14:56 and Gillick due to race at 16:04.
