Kevin McGuigan Sr, 53, was murdered at his home at Comber Court in the Short Strand last Wednesday.
Three men, aged 53, 44 and 41, were arrested on Tuesday morning over the murder.
Fr John Nevin spoke out against the murder during the Requiem Mass at St Matthew's Church in Belfast.
"The only thing that all of us can take from this terrible tragedy and from today's funeral Mass is that violence does not solve problems," Fr Nevin told the hundreds of mourners.
"Violence and war and revenge do not solve problems, but create more - the circle goes on."
Fr Nevin said he had visited the victim's family on Monday and they had questioned the killing.
"I have no answers for these tragedies that wreck families," the priest said.
He added that there had been hundreds of cards at the house and that "this says something about Kevin and his family".
"There is a lot of love, gratitude, appreciation for all the good Kevin did in life."
Police believe two men shot Mr McGuigan several times in the head and chest at point blank range before running off.
He was buried in the City cemetery.
