[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Non Stanford says her move from Wales to Leeds was "absolutely integral" to her claiming a place in the British triathlon team at the Olympics.

The 2013 World champion will compete alongside Vicky Holland and fellow Welsh athlete Helen Jenkins in Rio.
Swansea-raised Stanford trains in England with Holland and male athletes Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee.
Asked about the impact moving to Leeds made on her, Stanford replied: "It's been career changing."
And she added: "It's been absolutely integral to be honest.
"I wouldn't be sat in this chair right now talking about going to my first Olympic games if I hadn't moved to Leeds.
"The boys [the Brownlees] really showed me what it is to train and how to train and so definitely shifted me from an amateur athlete to a professional athlete and I can't thank the team enough for doing that for me."

Stanford and Holland pre-qualified for the Olympics by finishing second and third at the World Triathlon Grand Final in Chicago in September 2015.
However, Stanford has not competed at a major multi-sport event at senior level after missing the 2014 Commonwealth Games with injury.
Her Welsh compatriot Jenkins has had a long battle with injury since the London Olympics in 2012, and admitted she was relieved after being confirmed in the team for Rio.
The Bridgend athlete was nominated after winning the International Triathlon Union race in Gold Coast on 9 April.
"I'm really excited," said Jenkins.
"It's great to have the official announcement because until then you are only nominated so there's still that couple of % doubt so it's great to be here and get the official letter."
