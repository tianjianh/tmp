The Gloucestershire Stalking Support Service was set up by the Hollie Gazzard Trust, with police support.
Ms Gazzard, 20, was killed by her ex-boyfriend at the beauty salon she worked in, in Gloucester.
Her father Nick, said the service would "ensure a robust response to stalking behaviour and its victims" and increase awareness of the issue.
The service will include a dedicated helpline and advice and guidance from a fully-trained independent stalking advocacy caseworker.
Asher Maslin, 22, admitted repeatedly knifing Ms Gazzard, 20, at Fringe Benefits and La Bella Beauty salon in Gloucester, in February 2014.
He was jailed for life with the judge ordering Maslin to serve a minimum of 24 years.
Ms Gazzard had ended her relationship with the former security guard just days before, the trial was told.
Mr Gazzard said that when she moved to London to undergo training to go on a cruise ship Maslin followed her there.
"He was really stalking her from the outset, being fixated and obsessed by her," he said.
Mr Gazzard explained he had been working with Hampshire Police who have a "best practice" model involving a "stalking clinic".
He said they had looked at it and tailored it to Gloucestershire's needs.
"It includes a stalking clinic where professionals deal with the high risk cases," he said.
"We will also fund an independent stalking case worker who will provide specialist guidance to victims of stalking, and raise the awareness of what stalking is because it is very very misunderstood and under reported.
"We'll work with the police to... get a more robust and effective response to stalking in the county."
