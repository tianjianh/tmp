Salford Quays: Giant sculptures of endangered species on show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Giant sculptures of endangered species have gone on show in Salford Quays.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A polar bear, whale, red squirrel and bee - which will all be illuminated at night - represent threatened species in the Unnatural Borders exhibition which runs until 29 May at MediaCityUK.
Unnatural Borders by Sober Industries - which is part of Quays Culture showcase of art - explores human civilization and the animal kingdom.
Lucy Dusgate of Quays Culture said it questions "our responsibilities".
The sculptures, which are 4m (13ft) high, are being illuminated each night from 21:00 BST throughout the 10-day exhibition.
Ms Dusgate said: "Unnatural Borders questions our responsibility to these beautiful creatures, and our own understanding [or misunderstanding] of natural and manmade borders and boundaries in these changing times."
