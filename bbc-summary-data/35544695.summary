As reported in the Eastern Daily Press, Brett Day, from Beccles, has seen videos of his spray paint art on wheelie bins shared millions of times online.
People have begun to affectionately call him "Binsy" in homage to street artist Banksy.
Quitting his old job for good, he now hopes to make a full-time living out of his bin art.
"I looked in the garden when I was putting them out and I realised that they looked horrible, and I thought, 'why not try and make them a bit more pretty'," he said.
