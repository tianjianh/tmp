Robbie Neilson: MK Dons set to appoint Hearts head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
English League One club MK Dons are set to appoint Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson as their new manager subject to the two clubs agreeing compensation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 36-year-old was in Milton Keynes on Tuesday for talks, but will take charge of Hearts' Scottish Premiership match against Rangers on Wednesday.
Hearts would go second in the table with victory at Tynecastle.
Neilson will replace Karl Robinson as manager of the Dons, who are 19th in England's third tier.
The former Scotland and Leicester right-back was given his first management job by his old club Hearts in May 2014.
He led his side to the Scottish Championship title and promotion in his first season in charge and they finished third in the top flight last term.
It is expected Neilson will take his assistant Stevie Crawford to MK Dons, who had previously been in talks with former England and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard.
However, the 36-year-old said the vacancy came "a bit too soon" for him after his exit from LA Galaxy.
Robinson's six-year reign at MK Dons ended in October, following a poor start to the season having been relegated from the Championship last term.
Meanwhile, Rotherham United have said that they did not make an approach for Neilson, despite reports that he turned down the change to move to the Championship side as a replacement for Kenny Jackett, who resigned on Monday.
