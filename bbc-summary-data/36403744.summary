McEnroe told Eurosport on Friday that he is going to be a consultant for the Canadian at Wimbledon next month.
The 57-year-old won three championships at the All England Club in the 1980s and has forged a career as a pundit since his retirement.
Raonic, 25, reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon in 2014 and the Australian Open in 2015.
He is seeded eighth at the French Open at Roland Garros, where he won his third-round match on Friday.
Raonic is currently coached by by 1998 French Open champion Carlos Moya and Riccardo Piatti.
"Milos is a very dedicated and professional," said McEnroe. "I just want to consult and be part of his team and add a little bit to his quest on the grass.
"He is a guy who can win majors and one of five or six who can win Wimbledon. This is exciting."
This year's tournament runs from 27 June to 10 July and will be broadcast live across the BBC.
