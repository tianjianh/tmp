[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Giants ended a run of five straight derby defeats against Leeds Rhinos with Super League victory at the John Smith's Stadium.

Late tries from Jake Connor and Eorl Crabtree pulled the Giants away at the end of a seesaw battle between the two top-flight strugglers.
Leeds led by four at the break thanks to two goals from Jordan Lilley, with a try apiece from he and Ukuma Ta'ai.
The second period exploded in a flurry of points, but Giants came out on top.
Victory is a major boost for a Huddersfield side who were bottom before Salford's points deduction for a historic salary cap breach saw them slide to the foot of the table.
That said, Leeds were just two points above, with one of their three wins this term coming at home to the Giants earlier in the campaign.
After going in behind at half-time, Huddersfield showed character to see off the dogged Rhinos, as the two teams traded tries up to the final 12 minutes.
Gene Ormsby's score was wiped out by Josh Walters, while Rob Burrow did the same following Jermaine McGillvary's effort.
The two late tries ensured Paul Anderson's side returned to winning ways, but Leeds' concerns continue after losing for the 10th time in 2016.
Huddersfield Giants head coach Paul Anderson:
"The win is the all important thing. Of the last three games, we've won two so we're starting the ascent and hopefully we can keep it going.
"It was a real scrappy game but I couldn't care less, we found a way to win whereas in the past we would have lost.
"There were some really pleasing things. I thought defensively we were pretty good and we came home strong.
"I'm really pleased with our resolve and composure. We're still coming up with errors but not as many."
Leeds Rhinos head coach Brian McDermott:
"It's a tough one to lose. We had some really good moments near our line and probably broke the record for try-savers. There are some really encouraging signs.
"In the end some of the bump and dump from Huddersfield, their quick play-the-balls, got us."
