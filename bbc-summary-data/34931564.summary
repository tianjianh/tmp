Reports included the shooting of a buzzard and the poisoning of a peregrine falcon, a red kite and a buzzard.
The charity said the figures represented "only a fraction" of the illegal persecution in Wales.
It is calling for better application of laws to protect Wales' birds of prey.
RSPB Cymru's biodiversity manager, Stephen Bladwell, said: "To protect our magnificent birds of prey we must defend the laws that protect them, in particular the EU Nature Directives."
