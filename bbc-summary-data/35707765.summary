In this Newsround special, we'll be finding out how important technology is to us, how much time we're spending on our gadgets, and what would happen if we weren't allowed to use them anymore.
We set a special technology challenge for a class of 11-12 year olds to see how much they would miss their gadgets if they were taken away, and we caught up with legendary YouTuber Stampy to find out what his top tips are for getting a balance of tech time.
Could you handle the challenge? - Take a look to see how the class got on.
