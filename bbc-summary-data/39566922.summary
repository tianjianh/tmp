An aviation firm has confirmed its Flintshire branch is set to close after failing to find a buyer.

Marshall Aviation Services began a 45-day consultation with its 126-strong Broughton workforce last month after plans to close were first announced.
"Sadly, we have been unable to identify any viable options to continue trading as a going concern," the firm said.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said the Welsh Government was supporting affected workers.
"This is a highly skilled workforce in an area where aerospace engineering expertise is in high demand and we remain optimistic that those affected by the decision will quickly find re-employment," he added.
In a statement, Marshall Aviation Services said the decision followed "detailed discussions with the trade unions over the last two weeks".
It added: "We will continue to work with the unions, via collective consultation, to discuss and explain the options available during this difficult time for our employees."
Unite's regional officer Dave Griffiths said: "The closure of Marshalls is a devastating blow for the workforce, their families and the economy of north east Wales.
"A facility has existed on the Hawarden Airfield since 1930, providing well-paid secure employment in the area for over 80 years.
"The majority of the workforce that remain have long service and are highly skilled.
"Unite's priority is to ensure that our members' valuable expertise and skills are not lost and are transferred to other employers in the sector."
Alyn and Deeside AM Carl Sargeant said it was "a blow for industry in the area".
He said: "I've been in touch with the cabinet secretary for economy, Ken Skates, and I know his officials are doing all they can to help my constituents during this difficult period for them.
"Marshall Aviation Services' staff are highly employable so I hope they'll be well placed to take up work at nearby companies such as Raytheon and Airbus.
"If this isn't the case the cabinet secretary has confirmed that the Welsh Government programme ReAct will be used.
"This incentivises companies to take on people who are under notice or have recently been made redundant and provides funding for any training they may need to transfer or update their skills."
Last month the company blamed "significant losses" in business for the proposed closure.
It also said the process would not impact on its other businesses in Cambridge, Kirkbymoorside, Brize Norton and Birmingham.
