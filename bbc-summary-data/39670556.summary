The 28-year-old quit the game at the end of last season, having taken 170 wickets across all formats.
But he played for Northants' second XI last week and was included in their squad for the Division Two match against Worcestershire.
Carter took three wickets in 10 balls - including England's Moeen Ali - during the first day's play.
