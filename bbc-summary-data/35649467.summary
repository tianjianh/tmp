A prize-winning photograph of a hillwalker gazing out from inside a snow cave was taken as the battery ran out on the photographer's camera phone.

David Brookes' image won the Mountains of Scotland category and overall award in the Edinburgh Mountain Film Festival photography competition.
It shows fellow hillwalker Juliet Harris looking out over Loch Avon in the Cairngorms.
Mr Brookes had 5% of battery life left in his phone when he took the picture.
The climber, who is originally from Cumbria and lives in Edinburgh, said: "This photograph was taken in October 2015 in the Cairngorms. Remarkably the snow had lasted from the previous winter.
"We had hoped to climb on Hell's Lum Crag but the rock was too slippery after a long wet summer. Instead, we decided to walk up Ben Macdui and came across this snow cave at Feith Buidhe."
Mr Brookes added: "I wasn't intending this to be a photography trip so I hadn't brought my usual camera.
"All I had was an iPhone with 5% battery left - and with that, I took this picture."
Another of the festival's winning images was a photograph of ice climber Kev Shields which was taken by Euan Ryan, of Scottish adventure film-making company Finalcrux Films.
Mr Ryan's picture won the People in Wild Places category.
