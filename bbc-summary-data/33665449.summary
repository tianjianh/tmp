Brodies, which has offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Brussels, saw turnover climb by 11.2% to ??57.9m in the 12 months to 30 April.
Profits before partner distributions also rose by 14.2% to ??27.1m.
Last year Brodies launched a three-year strategic plan, which included sustained investment in client services.
Investment activity during the year included opening a new purpose-built office in Aberdeen and investment in IT and technology.
Later this year Brodies' teams in Glasgow will move into a new office in the city's Queen Street.
In 2014-15, the total number of lawyers and staff at Brodies grew by 7%, from 564 to 603, taking the firm's headcount above 600 for the first time.
Over the same period, the number of partners rose from 80 to 82, while the number of other lawyers and professional advisers jumped from 268 to 293 - an increase of 9.3%.
Over the past decade, the firm has achieved a compound annual growth rate of 12%.
In November, Brodies was named UK Law Firm of the Year at the British Legal Awards in London.
Managing partner Bill Drummond said the company was pleased with the progress it had made.
He said: "The past financial year saw gradual improvement in the Scottish and wider UK economy, the historic referendum on the question of Scottish independence and continued change in the Scottish legal market, with the disappearance of yet more well-known independent firms.
"Against this backdrop, Brodies focused on delivering and investing in client services and engaging with individuals, business and organisations across the UK on the legal aspects of potential constitutional change."
He added: "A strong balance sheet coupled with being owned, headquartered and run in Scotland enables us to seize opportunities for the benefit of clients quickly and efficiently as they arise, whether investing in technology, new premises, new services, developing our people or hiring leading lawyers.
"We remain focused on our strategy of delivering on client needs in all sectors that are central to the sustained future success of the Scottish economy."
