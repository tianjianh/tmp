The pom-pom parade stretches along Bedminster's North Street, to celebrate the start of British Summer Time.
It is the idea of artist Vicky Harrison who said more than 700 volunteers have been involved in the production, aged from three to 93.
Ms Harrison estimated the teams had made "about 10,000" of the eye-catching woolly balls.
She said the pom-poms were put up to celebrate the start of British Summer Time on Sunday and for the whole community to come together to have fun.
"It's really captured  everyone's imagination and created a buzz about the streets,  young and old have all joined in," she said.
"We've had seven schools involved, community groups, families and people in residential care.
"They've come together and made 10,000 pom-poms to decorate the area and make people smile.
