Ferry services have resumed at the Port of Calais following a fresh protest by former workers of dissolved ferry company MyFerryLink.

Earlier passengers faced delays as protesters blockaded the port with lifeboats, stopping ships from sailing.
Ferry operator P&O tweeted that the port was now open again but its services were subject to delays.
DFDS Seaways tweeted that normal service had resumed and all its services were running to schedule.
The P&O ferry The Pride of Kent was allowed to disembark lorries and cars at about 01:20 local time (00:20 BST) and the operator's Spirit of Britain left Calais a short time later.
P&O had told waiting Bank Holiday travellers: "We regret to inform you that currently there are no movements permitted in or out of the port for any ferries.
"Protesting crew from the recently dissolved My Ferry Link has blocked the port entrance."
Duringthe disruption DFDS Seaways said its Malo Seaways ship was waiting for permission to enter the Port of Calais.
The company said it was running to Dunkirk with an extra sailing, and advised those booked with Calais departures to head to Dunkirk.
Nicholas Bernier, a passenger on a ferry heading to France, spoke to the BBC while his ferry was halted.
"I'm roughly about two miles from the Port of Calais. We've got about three ferries standing still in front of us and what we were told is that the port is blocked by two lifeboats," he said.
Richard Hill, on the Spirit of Britain, said while it was unable to leave the port: "We are stuck on the ferry along with 2,000 others; luckily we have a seat.
"The seating is very limited now and people are starting to get weary."
Natacha Bouchart, Mayor of Calais, tweeted her "regret" that the port has been closed and requested firm action was taken.
Eurotunnel, which operates and manages the Channel Tunnel, said it was only accepting passengers with pre-booked tickets on rail services.
It tweeted: "We are unable to sell tickets to any non-reserved customers from Calais tonight."
Employees from MyFerryLink have held previous protests, including last month when delays were caused after tyres were set alight near a main road.
The firm ceased ferry operations as of 1 July 2015.
It came after Eurotunnel announced in May this year that it was ending its partnership with MyFerryLink.
In January, Eurotunnel was told it must cease the service following a ruling by the Competition Appeal Tribunal.
