Paralympian David Smith has been on a bike for the first time since having life-saving surgery on a back tumour.

In posts to social media sites, the 37-year-old from Aviemore said it was "fun" to be back on a bicycle for the first time in 16 weeks.
The athlete was able to push the pedals on a bike mounted in a fixed position on an indoor turbo trainer.
After the surgery, Smith had been temporarily paralysed on the left side of his body.
Smith, who won a rowing gold at the London Paralympics, had hoped to be part of the Great Britain Para-cycling team at the Rio Games this summer.
However, the need to have another operation ended his dream.
The tumour was  just 8mm (0.3in) from his spine. If left, there was a risk it would crush his spinal cord and stop him breathing.
