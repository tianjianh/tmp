Mairi Hedderwick, author and illustrator of the ginger-haired Isle of Struay adventurer, produced the festive drawing.
The picture shows children from around the world being welcomed to Ms Sturgeon's official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh.
Cards will feature the print and the original will be auctioned for charity.
The proceeds of the sale will be shared between four charities;
Ms Sturgeon said:  "I am delighted that Mairi Hedderwick was able to create such a wonderful illustration for this year's Christmas card.
"Katie Morag's adventures accompanied by Mairi's beautiful illustrations are adored by both children and adults right across the world.
"Christmas is a time for spending time with those that we love, but it is also a time for thinking about those less fortunate than ourselves."
She added: "There is no doubt that Scotland is a caring and compassionate country but this year in particular, I have been so proud of the warm welcome and kindness which has been extended to all who have come here."
Two years ago, the popular children's book was adapted for television and is shown on the BBC's Cbeebies channel. The key role is played by young actress Cherry Campbell who posed with the Christmas illustration alongside Ms Hedderwick and Ms Sturgeon.
