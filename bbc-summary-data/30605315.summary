[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fraser Gibbon, 20, of Cuminestown, is thought to have been working by the side of the B9170 road near the village when he was struck by a car.
Although police officers and the ambulance service attended the scene, they were unable to save him.
His relatives described him as "a gentle giant" and said his death left "a massive hole" in their lives.
A statement issued through Police Scotland said: "Fraser was ripped from our lives and has left a massive hole that can never be filled. Fraser was described by all who knew him as a gentle giant, very much a family person who would do anything for anyone."
They added that he was a "proud father, a doting uncle to two nieces and brother to three sisters who all loved him dearly.
"He was the precious and deeply loved only son of Anne and Donald, and has been taken from us far too soon.
"We would also like to offer sincere thanks to all who assisted at the scene."
