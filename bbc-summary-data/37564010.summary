The 23-year-old academy graduate has made 85 appearances for Quins since making his first-team debut in 2011.
Last week, the tighthead was named in England's 45-man elite player squad ahead of the autumn internationals.
"I have no doubt that he has the necessary qualities to be a major influence in our quest for trophies," director of rugby John Kingston said.
Quins have not disclosed the length of Sinckler's new deal at The Stoop.
Sinckler has represented England at under-20 level and previously trained with the senior squad in the summer of 2014.
