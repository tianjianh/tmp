He died at his home in Connecticut of natural causes, his family said.
Frank Gifford won the 1956 NFL title with the New York Giants and was inducted into the American Football Hall of Fame in 1977.
After his playing career he moved into TV commentary, working for ABC's Monday Night Football from 1971 to 1997.
"Frank Gifford was the ultimate Giant. He was the face of our franchise for so many years," Giants President John Mara said.
Bob Iger, chairman of ABC's owner, the Walt Disney Company, described Gifford as "an exceptional man who will be missed by everyone who had the joy of seeing his talent on the field, the pleasure of watching his broadcasts, or the honour of knowing him".
Gifford made 367 catches for 5,434 yards with 43 touchdowns, whilst also running for 3,609 yards and 34 touchdowns.
He was the MVP in 1956 and was an eight-time selection to the Pro Bowl.
In a statement released to NBC News, the Gifford family said: "We ask that our privacy be respected at this difficult time and we thank you for your prayers."
Gifford married Kathie Lee Gifford, a host on NBC's Today show, in 1986.
In a Twitter post, she said: "Deeply grateful to all 4 ur outpouring of grace. We r steadfast in our faith and finding comfort in knowing where Frank is."
