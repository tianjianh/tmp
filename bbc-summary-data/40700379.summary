The 24-year-old Australian has spent his entire professional career to date at Newcastle, making his debut in 2014.
He has made 44 appearances, five of them coming in 2017.
"His position is one that we identified at the start of the season that we did not have a great deal of depth," said Trinity head coach Chris Chester.
"By bringing in Tyler, it will bring in a genuine competition and add quality to what is already a strong squad."
