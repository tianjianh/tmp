[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Warriors half-back Jake Shorrocks is likely to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury sustained in non-contact training.

The 21-year-old had already been absent earlier this season with a knee problem that had limited him to just one first-grade appearance.
The Warriors have also lost prop Tony Clubb for an indeterminate spell while he undergoes an routine operation.
Clubb, 29, has a medical condition but is expected to make a full recovery.
He has played nine games this season, including the World Club Challenge success against NRL premiers Cronulla Sharks in February.
"Unfortunately sport can be cruel and this is definitely the case for both Tony and Jake," rugby director Kris Radlinski said.
"It's a tough pill to swallow but we will give them all of our support, as I'm sure will the Wigan fans and we look forward to seeing them back out on the field playing for Wigan."
