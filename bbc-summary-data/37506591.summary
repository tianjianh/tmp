Paralympic table tennis champion Will Bayley had a bit of a shock when he returned to his car on Thursday morning.

The Rio gold medallist had parked in an empty car park in Tunbridge Wells on Wednesday, but found the local farmers' market had set up around the vehicle the next morning.
"I turned the corner and my car was surrounded by fruit and veg stalls. It felt like I was in an episode of Only Fools and Horses," he told BBC Sport.
"I was too embarrassed to say anything so I just went to my brothers' - luckily he knows some of the stall owners and they were fine with it."
Table Tennis England said it was a "classic Will Bayley moment" and added: "He is so focused on table tennis that organisation takes a back seat."
Bayley now has to wait until the market closes on Thursday to retrieve his car.
