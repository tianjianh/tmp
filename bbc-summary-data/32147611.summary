[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lorna McCarthy wanted 'new sexual relationship'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman estranged from her husband wanted to start a sexual relationship with a man she had contacted on a dating site, a murder trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry McCarthy, 50, denies murdering Lorna McCarthy, also 50, who was found dead at their marital home in Gorleston, Norfolk, in September.
Norwich Crown Court was told Mrs McCarthy and the man had agreed to have sex a week before she died.
They had exchanged text messages and calls and planned to meet in October.
The court heard statements, read by the prosecution, from men who Mrs McCarthy contacted on websites.
The jury was told of another man who said Mrs McCarthy had called him as she walked home in the hours leading up to her death.
She told him she was not looking forward to what was waiting for her, but she did not say she felt unsafe or in danger.
The court also heard a statement from forensic medical examiner Dr Franciscus Bohncke who saw Mr McCarthy in the hours after his wife's death.
He said Mr McCarthy was emotionally upset by his actions but fit for interview that day.
Previously, the court heard Mrs McCarthy was found with several stab wounds including one through the heart.
The jury listened to a police recording where Mr McCarthy admitted to killing his wife.
The couple had split up a few months earlier but were still living together in Sussex Road in the town.
Mrs McCarthy worked for a charity and was well known in the Great Yarmouth area.
The case continues.
