Edinburgh Hogmanay street party tickets still available

Organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations have said tickets for the Scottish capital's street party event are still available.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three days of new year festivities are set to kick off on 30 December.
Tens of thousands of visitors are expected to attend and police asked party-goers to be aware of safety threats, but not be alarmed.
The main street party was sold out last year and other events around this year's street party have sold out.
A midnight fireworks display will welcome in 2016, with the traditional mass rendition of Auld Lang Syne to follow.
For safety reasons, Calton Hill will be closed off to people hoping to see the fireworks display at midnight.
Police Scotland said they were being "vigilant" over the current severe terrorism threat to the UK - but there was no specific threat to Scotland or Hogmanay.
