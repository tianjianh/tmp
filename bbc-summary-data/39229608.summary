Milton Keynes Yorkshire terrier mauled to death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dog that mauled a tiny Yorkshire terrier to death outside its home, was "out to kill", its elderly owners said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Their pet Lacey was being walked on a lead with three other terriers when she was attacked by a black "Alsatian type" dog in Oldbrook, Milton Keynes.
She died after sustaining internal injuries and broken legs. Her owner was bitten as he tried to rescue her, as reported in the MK Citizen.
The owners reported the attack and said police were investigating.

Lacey's owner Ron, 75, who did not want to give his surname, said: "I had two of the dogs on leads, and my wife had the other two.
"The dog lunged at my arm and pulled me down to the ground as it tried to get to my dog. It bit me four times."
He said his other three dogs were saved by a passing postman who bundled them into the back of his van.
The incident left him "absolutely terrified" to take his other dogs for walks, he said.
His wife Valerie said she had struggled to leave the house since the incident and was having panic attacks.
"As soon as I open the front door it all comes flooding back. I can't get it out of my head - it will stay with me until the day I die," she said.
"All I can see is Ron walking towards me with her, and bringing her in the house. You could see her intestines... and her legs were ripped off.
"There's no way ever that dog should not a have had a collar on and a lead. That wasn't a little dog-on-dog scrap. That dog was out to kill.
"If it hadn't been for our heroic postman, I think it would have been more dogs," she added.
