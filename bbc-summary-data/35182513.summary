The RSPCA said the pooch, nicknamed Pudding, was so matted when he was found in Plymouth, Devon, his breed was unrecognisable.
After cleaning him up, the animal charity now believes Pudding is a shih tzu cross.
Inspector Sarah Morris said seeing a dog neglected and dumped on Christmas Eve had made her angry.
Pudding was discovered by a member of the public on their way to work, who then alerted the RSPCA.
Ms Morris said: "I took him straight to a vet who gave him a body score of three-and-a-half out of 10, so he was very thin.
"It brought a tear to my eye when I was taking him to the animal centre. He must have been terrified, hungry and so uncomfortable, just left out in the dark, wind and rain."
Pudding, who is thought to be about six or seven years old, was unable to see out of his right eye, his nails were overgrown and he was also covered in fleas, the RSPCA said.
He has been taken to the RSPCA's Little Valley Animal Centre, near Exeter.
