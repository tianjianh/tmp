Samit Patel made an unbeaten century as Nottinghamshire kept their One-Day Cup hopes alive with a seven-wicket defeat of Lancashire.

Chasing 261, Notts were wobbling at 84-3 before Patel (103) and Steven Mullaney's (77) unbroken stand of 181.
Lancashire were earlier restricted to 260-6 despite an unbeaten 75 from Haseeb Hameed, as Notts put in an excellent all-round bowling display.
Notts will reach the quarter-finals if they beat Northamptonshire.
Meanwhile, Lancashire must beat Durham to have any chance.
Lancashire had won their previous three games, including a thriller against Derbyshire on Friday, but were outclassed in front of a crowd in excess of 8,000 at Trent Bridge.
The visitors were squeezed in excellent batting conditions, firstly by the pace of James Pattinson and Stuart Broad, then the control of Patel's spin and Mullaney's medium pace.
An opening stand of 98 between Karl Brown and Alex Davies was compiled in only 16 overs but, after Brown drove Broad to cover for 52, Lancashire were strangled.
Hameed held the innings together with delicate touch and swiftness between the wickets, but Lancashire simply could not accelerate.
Although Ryan McLaren (42) helped Lancashire take 61 from the final six overs, their total seemed well short of being competitive, and looked even more so when Michael Lumb and Riki Wessels got stuck into the visiting bowling.
But Lancashire all-rounder Danny Lamb, on his debut in the absence of the injured Jordan Clark,  removed both to drag the away side back into the contest.
However, Patel and Mullaney absorbed the pressure, then exploited a Lancashire attack that became increasingly short of options.
In the end, Patel in particular accelerated towards the finish line, the victory completed with 24 balls to spare.
Notts all-rounder Samit Patel told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"I've been ticking quite nicely but just not been converting and that's been disappointing.
"I've been working hard on my game and it's now coming all together at the right time.
"We can only do what we can do against Northants but it's a massive game on Tuesday. We've got to play well to qualify."
Lancashire head coach Glen Chapple told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"260 was possibly a bit light. It was a funny innings really. We worked well through the powerplay and up to the first 17 overs but then it got more difficult.
"Leicester now have a tough game against Yorkshire and Notts have a tough game against Northants.
"So all we can do is go to the Riverside and try to beat Durham and see."
