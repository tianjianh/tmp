Names have been revealed for the adult and children's facilities at a massive £842m new hospital complex in Glasgow.

The Southern General campus will replace the Southern General Hospital, Western and Victoria Infirmaries, Mansionhouse Unit and Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill.
It will feature a 1,109-bed South Glasgow University Hospital for adults.
The 256-bed facility for children will retain the Royal Hospital for Sick Children name.
Both new hospitals are due to open in 2015.
Robert Calderwood, chief executive, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: "In deciding what to name the new hospitals we needed to acknowledge that the new adult hospital is bringing together both healthcare and research facilities.
"We wanted a name that encompasses this and we have chosen a name we hope recognises the significant history of the hospitals moving to the new site as well as the significant teaching and learning facilities.
"The new children's hospital will continue with its proud and long history of providing care and treatment for children across Scotland and beyond."
He added: "We have many requests on what the new hospitals should be called and it is hoped through further discussion that we can incorporate some of the names within areas of each of the new hospitals."
In addition to replacing adult hospitals in Glasgow, the new South Glasgow University Hospital will incorporate a new teaching and learning facility and the Centre for Stratified Medicine and clinical research facilities.
It will sit alongside the new children's hospital and both will be linked, via a subterranean tunnel, to the nn £90m laboratory which is already operational.
Every patient in the general wards of the new adult hospital will have their own single en-suite room.
Up to 10,000 NHS staff will be based on the campus when it is fully operational.
