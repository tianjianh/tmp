Westminster council CCTV cameras in London to be axed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fixed CCTV cameras in central London are being axed to save £2.7m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Westminster City Council said the 75 cameras were primarily used to support police prosecutions rather than as a deterrent.
Cameras in the area run by Transport for London, private businesses and on housing estates will continue to operate.
In its report the council said the cameras, which require a £1.7m upgrade, cost £1m a year to run.
The cameras will be axed when the current contract with security firm G4S ends in September.
The council is now working with police, the Greater London Authority and other boroughs to find a pan-London solution.
Nickie Aiken, cabinet member for public protection, said: "Like many other local authorities around the country, our current view is that we are not able to continue to subsidise this non-statutory service when there are many other pressures on our budgets and where other partners are the main beneficiaries."
