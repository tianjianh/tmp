Michael Leask: Scotland all-rounder signs for Somerset

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset have signed Scotland and former Northamptonshire off-spinning all-rounder Michael Leask.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leask has played in 22 limited-overs internationals for Scotland and is part of their team for the upcoming World Twenty20 in India.
The 25-year-old played his only game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014.
"He's a good little cricketer - feisty and quite a strong character," director of cricket Matthew Maynard said.
"It will be interesting to see if he can put pressure on the first-team bowlers this year, because I primarily see this year as a learning curve for him in the second XI, but the opportunity is there."
