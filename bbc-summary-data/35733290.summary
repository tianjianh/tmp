[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 1-0 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Taylor scored his 20th goal of the season as promotion-chasing Bristol Rovers made it four successive victories with a win over Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taylor shot home at the far post from Cristian Montano's cross just after the hour mark.
But, it took an outstanding Steve Mildenhall save from a late Lee Collins shot to ensure a win that moves Rovers to within three points of third place.
The game was Darrell Clarke's 100th in charge of Rovers.
