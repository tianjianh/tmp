North Wales Fire and Rescue Service was called to Y Ddwylan chip shop on Church Street, Llangefni, at about 10:00 BST on Tuesday.
All roads in the centre were closed to traffic and drivers were asked to avoid the area.
Firefighters left the scene at 16:45 BST and the cause is believed to be accidental. No injuries were reported.
Ian Williams from the fire service said the blaze started on the ground floor and quickly spread to the upper floors.
Llangefni councillor Bob Parry said there were concerns about smoke affecting other businesses in the street.
He added: "It's right in the centre of the town and to have something like that, well, it could be an eyesore for a time."
Keith Thomas, who owns J Thomas & Sons butchers next door to the chip shop, said it had been badly damaged.
"The fish and chip shop is gutted," he said.
"There's been so much smoke we can't really tell about damage at my shop."
Andrew Hughes, owner of Tlysau engraving shop, said: "The shop went up in flames, there's nothing left of it.
"I saw the windows blow out. I'm 100 yards away from it and felt the heat. It's what's to be expected, with what's inside the shop."
Beth Rowlands, who works at Dafydd Hardy Estate Agency, said: "There was thick black smoke all across Llangefni for the past hour.
"It was going out for about 20 minutes before the fire brigade arrived. All the chip shop staff are all OK."
