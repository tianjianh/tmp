The ex-Newcastle forward, 33, initially quit last year but was persuaded to join Bristol as injury cover.
But after 14 appearances and two tries for the Premiership side, he has decided to retire for a second time.
"I thought my time in professional rugby had ended last year when I originally retired," said Hawkins. "But I was delighted to be have been able to contribute to Bristol this season."
Hawkins began his career at Bath and spent seven seasons at the Recreation Ground before moving to Leicester in 2010.
He was a member of the side which won the Premiership title in 2013, and then played for Newcastle from 2014 until the end of last season.
"Rob has been an excellent professional and is respected by players and the coaching team alike," said Bristol head coach Mark Tainton.
