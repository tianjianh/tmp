[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Clark scored the eighth-minute winner, and keeper Marek Rodak pulled off some superb saves to deny the promotion-chasers.
After Clark's header broke the deadlock, Argyle keeper Luke McCormick pulled off a brilliant one-on-one stop to deny Shay McCartan as he swept through the home defence in the 15th minute.
After that Rodak came to the fore, starting with a brilliant point-blank stop to keep out Antoni Sarcevic's volley.
Argyle continued to press but the closest they came was in the last minute of the first half as striker Jimmy Spencer's 20-yard angled strike skimmed past the post.
McConville's 65th-minute header was kept out at the foot of his post by Luke McCormick.
Rodak flapped over a goal-bound Yann Songo'o header and then made his best save, diving to somehow keep out sub Ryan Taylor's fierce 15-yard volley.
