[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A primary school in Blackpool has become the first mainstream school in the town to be rated "outstanding" by Ofsted inspectors since 2009.

St Nicholas C of E Primary School was praised for its "highly effective teaching" and "ambitious leadership".
Ofsted said the school had been on a "phenomenal journey" since its previous inspection when it was rated as "requiring improvement".
The school said Blackpool was "bouncing back" from "negative headlines".
Secondary schools in the town were described as "dire" last year by the chief inspector of schools, with two thirds of schools rated as either "inadequate" or "requiring improvement".
In contrast, inspectors said pupils at St Nicholas, on School Road, behaved "impeccably", were proud of their school and were highly curious and confident.
The report, following an inspection on 1 and 2 March, also praised staff, governors and parents and said outcomes had "improved rapidly", with "excellent progress, especially in reading and mathematics".
Head teacher Andy Mellor said it was all down to a "truly community effort".
"It has been a hard journey but well worth the considerable effort," he added. "I am sure that it won't be long before other Blackpool schools will be judged outstanding too.
"There have been so many negative headlines... and yet there is so much fantastic work going on in Blackpool schools. Our kids in Blackpool deserve the best."
An outstanding rating was "great for the town", he said, adding: "Blackpool is bouncing back."
Westcliff Primary School was rated outstanding by Ofsted inspectors in 2009. It has since become an academy school and was rated "good" in 2013.
The only other schools rated "outstanding" in Blackpool are specialist schools: Highfurlong School and Park Community Academy.
