As the highest scoring challengers, second-placed New Zealand picked their opponents leaving Sweden to face Japan in the other play-off.
"We had a look at the forecast over the coming week and thought it was our best chance of progressing," said New Zealand helmsman Peter Burling.
Team USA won the qualifying round with a crucial victory over New Zealand and take a one-point lead into the finals.
Holders USA advance automatically to the first-to-seven America's Cup matches - which begin on 17 June - and will have a bonus-point lead over their challengers.
The first team in each semi-final to win five races progresses to the challenger final for a chance to take on the American team.
Ben Ainslie said his Land Rover BAR team are facing "a real battle" against New Zealand but were "up for it".

Great Britain went into the final day of qualifying with an unassailable lead over bottom-of-the-table France knowing qualification was already guaranteed.
In their first race of the day, the British boat jumped Japan at the pre-start and then dealt well with the conditions to seal their fourth race win of the qualifiers before losing the final race to USA.
Elsewhere, Sweden comfortably beat France, who were eliminated on Friday - all but one of the six teams taking part in the qualifiers advanced to the play-offs.

Four semi-final races from 18:00-20:00 BST.
New Zealand v Great Britain - Race 1
Sweden v Japan - Race 1
