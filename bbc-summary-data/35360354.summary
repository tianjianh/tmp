French officials had identified nine attackers but there were doubts about the nationalities of two men involved in the Stade de France bombings.
The claim was made in the latest issue of the group's Dabiq magazine.
Two other suspects in the November attacks, which killed 130 people, are still on the run.
Who were the Paris attackers?
The English-language magazine featured pictures of nine men in military fatigues whom it said were responsible for the attack, under the headline "Just Terror".
A black and white photograph of Paris was used as a background image.
The two men, thought to have been involved in the Stade de France bombings, are identified by the nicknames Ukashah al-Iraqi and Ali al-Iraqi.
Their full names were not given and no other information has been published.
They could be the two suspects identified as "Ahmad al-Mohamed" and "M al Mahmod". Both men used Syrian passports to enter Greece and travel through Europe, but officials believe the documents were fake.
The third suicide bomber involved in the stadium attack has been identified as 20-year-old French national Bilal Hadfi.
What happened on the night
The names given in the magazine for the other men suggested that four were French and three were Belgian.
At the centre of the picture is Abdelhamid Abaaoud, identified by his nom de guerre Abu Umar al-Baljiki, or Abu Umar the Belgian.  French investigators have named him as the mastermind of the attacks.
The police are still searching for two suspects of involvement in the attacks - Salah Abdeslam, a 26-year-old French national born in Brussels, and 29-year-old Mohamed Abrini.
The attacks in Paris on the night of Friday 13 November by gunmen and suicide bombers hit a concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars, almost simultaneously.
