Christine Archibald, 30, from Castlegar, British Columbia, was the first person to be named as killed in Saturday's attacks in London.
She is described as a kind-hearted person who cared deeply about her work with people struggling with addiction and homelessness.
Her family asked that people honour her memory by helping in their community.
"Volunteer your time and labour or donate to a homeless shelter.  Tell them Chrissy sent you," the Archibald family said in a statement.
In response, people around the world are now using the hashtags #chrissysentme and #chrissysentyou on Twitter.
Alpha House Society, where Ms Archibald worked before relocating to Europe, said in a statement that her former colleagues are devastated by her death.
"Chrissy was a bright light to many, and her generosity, kind spirit and huge heart for her work in responding to issues of addictions and homelessness at the centre inspired us all," the Calgary-based charity said.
"We grieve the loss of our dear friend and colleague, and will remember her as a talented social worker, workmate and exceptional human being. It was our privilege to have known her."
Calgary's Mount Royal University, where Ms Archibald studied social work, described her as "a truly outstanding student".
Ms Archibald and her fiance were in London when three attackers drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in the nearby Borough Market.
The attackers were shot dead by police.
Seven people were killed in the terror attack and 48 people were injured, 18 critically.
Ms Archibald died in the arms of her fiance, Tyler Ferguson, on the bridge.
Ms Archibald was born and raised in the Canadian province of British Columbia before moving to the city of Calgary, Alberta. She had most recently been living in Holland with Mr Ferguson.
Mr Ferguson's sister, Cassie, wrote on Facebook: "Hearing his painful sobs on the phone while he's alone trying to deal with this tears me apart."
His brother, Mark, said on Facebook that Ms Archibald was one of those struck by the van in the initial attack.
"His life, and all those close to her have been changed forever," he wrote.
"These senseless acts of terror need to stop! What does it accomplish other then wreck the lives of innocent people?"
Her family says they are grieving the loss of their "beautiful, loving daughter and sister".
The statement adds: "She had room in her heart for everyone and believed strongly that every person was to be valued and respected.  She lived this belief working in a shelter for the homeless until she moved to Europe to be with her fiance. She would have had no understanding of the callous cruelty that caused her death."
Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said over the weekend he was "heartbroken" that a Canadian national had been among those killed.
