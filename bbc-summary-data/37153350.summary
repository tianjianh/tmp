The film, which reportedly cost around $100m (£77m) to make, took just $11.4m (£8.7m) on its opening weekend.
Suicide Squad held the number one spot, taking $20.7m (£15.8m) on its third weekend of release, despite a lukewarm response from critics.
Animated comedy Sausage Party was also a non-mover, taking $15.3m (£11.7m) to retain its number two position.
War Dogs, the first film Todd Philips has directed since he completed The Hangover trilogy, debuted at three with $14.3m (£10.9m).
Jonah Hill and Miles Teller star in the comedy, which is based on the true story of two young men who won a contract from the Pentagon to arm America's allies in Afghanistan.
Another new entry - Kubo and the Two Strings - landed at number four after taking $12.6m (£9.7m).
The animated children's film features the voices of Charlize Theron, Ralph Fiennes and Rooney Mara.
Ben-Hur is the fifth film adaption of Lew Wallace's novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, which was published in 1880.
It was first made as a silent film in 1907, and again in 1925.
The first big screen adaptation to include spoken dialogue was released in 1959, with Charlton Heston playing the lead role.
The actor also lent his voice to an animated children's adaption of the story which was released in 2003.
The new film stars Jack Huston as Judah Ben-Hur, alongside Morgan Freeman and Rodrigo Santoro, who plays Jesus Christ.
