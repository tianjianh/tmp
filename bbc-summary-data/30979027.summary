The county's Road Safety Partnership said 26 people were killed on roads across Cumbria last year, with a further 205 seriously injured.
In 2010 the number of recorded fatalities was 30, with 224 people seriously hurt.
Deaths peaked in 2006, when 59 people were killed on the county's 4,800 miles (7,724 km) of road.
The partnership said most accidents were down to driver error.
