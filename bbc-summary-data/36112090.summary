Former Norwich City striker Grant Holt is confident the Canaries will avoid Premier League relegation this season.

Norwich are currently 17th, but, without a game this weekend, may drop below Sunderland and Newcastle by Sunday if results go against them.
"I said a few weeks ago that I didn't think we'd go down, and I don't think we will," Holt told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"I still think we've got enough in the squad to stay up. You'd rather have points in the bag than chase."
Alex Neil's side were defeated 3-0 by the Black Cats on Saturday, which left the north east team one point behind the Canaries.
Sunderland host Arsenal on Sunday, while Newcastle travel to Anfield to face Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool on Saturday.
Holt, part of Norwich's Premier League squad for three seasons, continued: "Some of the decisions you see last week and some of the errors of the players and referee don't help you - I thought they got the tactics right, but an individual error cost them in the end.
"But that's football, they've got to stop the errors and keep together as a group like we did a few years ago."
One player that has drawn criticism has been forward Steven Naismith, who since scoring on his debut against Liverpool after his January move from Everton, has failed to find the net in nine matches.
"Everton play a completely different style of play to what Norwich do. He came in straight away and set the world on fire with the goal against Liverpool," said Holt, who now plays for League One side Rochdale.
"It's been tough for all the forward lads. I wouldn't attribute it just down to him. I think it's the team in general, when they aren't performing it's very difficult for your nines and 10s.
"I go back to Chris Hughton times when it was all about defensive shape and it was difficult up front at times. I bet there were some performances I played that year that were really, really bad.
"It's difficult for him, but he's a player who's come in and I'm sure he'll find his form. When you need someone to score on the pitch, he's certainly one."
