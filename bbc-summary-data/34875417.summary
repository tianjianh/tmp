An official report has described how an American fighter jet flew directly below a glider over the Black Mountains in Powys.

The incident happened near Talgarth on 30 July as the glider soared at 1,600ft (488m) in an area known as Gospel Pass.
The US Air Force F-15 was flying at 517mph (832km/h) at an altitude of 500ft (152m).
The glider pilot told experts the risk of collision was "high". Neither was fitted with warning equipment.
At the time of the incident, the aircrafts were outside controlled airspace, flying on Visual Flight Rules (VFR) where pilots are required to "see and avoid" each other.
The F-15 pilot, who is based in the UK, said he was aware of a gliding club in the area but had not seen the other aircraft and did not believe there was a risk of a collision.
The Black Mountains Gliding Club told officials there had been informal agreements with RAF Harrier pilots in the 1990s to keep the fast jets and gliders apart.
The gliding club suggested that the arrangement with military pilots should be reinstated but Airprox board officials said there should be more formal restrictions on flying in the area.
Experts concluded neither pilot had seen the other aircraft in time to take evasive action and the risk was category B - a medium risk.
