The Imps reached the fourth round for the first time in 41 years thanks to a dramatic injury-time winner by Nathan Arnold at Sincil Bank.
"The players were fantastic. Over 180 minutes we deserved it," Cowley said after the third-round replay victory.
"They went toe-to-toe with Championship players and came out on top."
The Imps, who have won 17 of their 26 league matches this season, are at home against Brighton in the fourth round on Saturday, 28 January.
Cowley said they will need to replicate their "immense" display when they face Championship opposition again.
"We set a new standard and new benchmark and we have to continue to get to that," he said.
"This is about the football club and a group of players who I thought were immense with the way they worked and the energy they played with."
Match-winner Arnold said his telling contribution in front of the BBC Television cameras did not come as a complete surprise.
"My missus said she had a dream that we won 1-0 and I scored the winner and that is gospel," he told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.
"Whether she is psychic or not I'm not sure, but I just happy to get the winner.
"I am happy for the club. We are in such a good place at the moment and the fans are unbelievable.
"We wanted to reward them with a performance first and foremost. We've gone toe-to-toe with a Championship team - it was an unbelievable night at Sincil Bank. We are making this place into a fortress."
