[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forgotten WW1 hero who 'never existed' honoured in Leicester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A World War One veteran who took part in a daring attack to stop German vessels entering the English Channel has been honoured with a new headstone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Archibald William Toach, from Leicester, was badly injured during the Zeebrugge Raid, in April 1918, but lived for another 10 years.
He did not have a military burial and his grave remained unmarked.
David Humberston, from the Western Front Association, said there had been little record he had ever existed.
'Back to life'
Pte Toach, who lied about his age to fight in the war, received severe injuries to his right arm, from which he would never fully recover.
However, despite his disability he saved two children from drowning in Bournemouth, shortly before he died aged 28.
Mr Humberstone, who tracked down Pte Toach's unmarked grave, in Belgrave Cemetery, Leicester, said providing a headstone for the soldier would "bring him back to life".
"He should be better remembered," he said.
"A lot of men's [graves] were like this, unmarked. Only a few dusty records said he existed at all.
"The injured, those suffering from wounds, tended to get missed. They didn't have the support they would get now."
A new headstone was unveiled by representatives of the Friends of Belgrave Cemetery and the Leicestershire & Rutland branch of the Western Front Association, at Belgrave Cemerery on Sunday afternoon.
