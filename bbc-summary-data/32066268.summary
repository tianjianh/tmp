Bruce Roseweir was caught when he was filmed on CCTV filling up his company car at the city's Broxden service station shortly before the raid.
The 36-year-old admitted taking £410 from the Co-Op on Oakbank Road after presenting a knife to an employee.
Lord Bannatyne told the heroin addict he had committed a "serious and nasty offence".
Roseweir was pictured on CCTV buying petrol and a pair of gloves which he wore during the robbery on 26 October. In the footage he was also seen wearing the same blue hooded top he wore during the raid.
Entering the Co-Op at about 21:25, he walked up to the checkout and pulled out a knife, telling the female employee working there to "empty the till".
The manager came through from the back of the shop minutes later to find the employee hysterical and Roseweir gone, along with £410 in notes from the till.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Roseweir had previous convictions for crimes of violence, and was "desperate to fund" his heroin habit.
Jailing him for five years, Lord Bannatyne said: "This was a serious and nasty offence involving the presentation of a knife.
"In her victim impact statement your victim talks of her life having been turned upside down by what you did."
