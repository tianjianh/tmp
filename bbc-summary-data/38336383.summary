Midfielder Darian MacKinnon has signed a contract extension with Hamilton Academical and defender Lennard Sowah is poised to do likewise.

But Trinidad and Tobago striker Richard Roy is to leave the Scottish Premiership club during December.
Player-manager Martin Canning praised MacKinnon after the 31-year-old secured a new deal until May 2019.
"In the last six weeks, he has probably been on the best run of form for the club," he said.
"He is one of those players who doesn't really play poorly, but I think he has been excelling in the last few weeks and it is something that we have been looking to do - tie him down for a bit longer."
MacKinnon, who joined Hamilton from Clydebank in 2012, has made 20 appearances this season.
"His attitude is great," said Canning. "I think he is 31 now, but he is as fit as they come. He is a natural athlete.
"It is great for the club that we have managed to tie him down again."
Sowah, who has made six appearances after joining from Hamburg, has also done enough to persuade Canning to hand him an extension to his short-term contract.
"Hopefully that will get sorted in the next day or two," Canning said of his 24-year-old fellow defender.
However, Roy will be leaving Hamilton when the 29-year-old, previously of Defence Force in his homeland, comes to the end of his four-month contract this month.
The striker, who played six times for his country prior to 2012, made the last of his two Accies appearances in August.
