The Paisley club have received the 21-year-old midfielder's signed release papers and expect him to join A-League club West Sydney.
Mooy signed for the Buddies in October 2010 after compensation was agreed with Bolton Wanderers and made 30 appearances for the Buddies.
This move will give Aaron the opportunity to play more first-team football
The Sydney-born under-23 international joined the English club from the New South Wales Institute of Sport in 2006.
St Mirren general manager Brian Caldwell told the Scottish Premier League club's website: "This move will give Aaron the opportunity to play more first-team football, which he really needs at this stage of his career.
"He has been in the UK for the last six years, so I'm sure he will be glad to get back home to Australia, where he will look to push on with his career.
"We would like to thank Aaron for his efforts while here at St Mirren and to wish him all the best for the future."
Mooy has been capped at under-20 and under-23 level and was called into the senior Australia squad in August 2009 for a friendly against Republic of Ireland but did not play.
However, he made only 12 appearances this season for St Mirren, his last coming as a late substitute in a 2-0 home defeat by Hearts in the Scottish Cup.
His one goal this term came in a 2-1 win over Rangers in December.
