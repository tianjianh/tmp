Deng, who played for both the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls last season, will effectively replace NBA superstar LeBron James, who joined the Cavaliers last week.
"Luol Deng is one of the most important free agent signings in the history of the franchise," said Heat president Pat Riley. "He is a proven All-Star."
Dwayne Wade will be at Miami next season after re-signing for the Heat.
Sudan-born Deng represented the Bulls from 2004 to 2014, twice earning selection as an NBA All-Star. He was traded to the Cavs in January.
The 29-year-old competed for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics and has been named in Joe Prunty's squad for the forthcoming Eurobasket qualifying campaign.
The Heat have appeared in the last four NBA Finals, winning in 2012 and 2013, but were beaten by the San Antonio Spurs last season.
