Andy Serkis, 52, began his career at the venue in 1987, appearing in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
A former Lancaster University student, Serkis has also starred in King Kong, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
He said he was "delighted" to return to the venue where he "learnt his craft".
He said: "I performed here in 14 plays on the trot, appearing in a wide variety of plays, and I remember my time in Lancaster with great fondness.
"I am delighted to become an honorary patron of The Dukes."
The Dukes is currently performing its own outdoor walkabout version of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit in the city's Williamson Park until 13 August.
Artistic director Joe Sumsion said: "We're excited that Andy has agreed to be an honorary patron.
"The timing couldn't be better as we look forward to a season with The Hobbit - a story with which Andy has such a strong connection."
