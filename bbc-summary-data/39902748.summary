The 25-year-old, who can also play on the wing, spent the second half of the 2016-17 at Dover Athletic.
Hurst has also had spells with West Bromwich Albion, Crawley, Torquay and AFC Telford United.
"He's at a point where he wants to put down roots and he's looking forward to the challenge here," Keates said.
"He's north-west based, so we had a chat with him this week.
"He came across well and I'm looking forward to working with him."
