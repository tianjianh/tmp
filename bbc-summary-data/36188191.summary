Didier Deigna, known by the stage name Pepito, drowned at a beach in the small town of Jacqueville in southern Ivory Coast on Sunday, it said.
Magic System are particularly popular in French-speaking West Africa and in France.
Reports say Pepito died while trying to save another person who was drowning.
"For the last 16 years, Pepito was our backing vocalist, our drummer, but above all the conductor with our group Magic System," the band added in a statement.
Pepito's tragic loss comes a week after the sudden death of influential Congolese musician Papa Wemba, who collapsed on stage while performing in Ivory Coast's main city, Abidjan.
