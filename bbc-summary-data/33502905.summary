The town of Crookwell in New South Wales' Southern Tablelands was blanketed in snow over the weekend. Some major roads in New South Wales and Victoria were closed because of snow and ice
There were snowy scenes across New South Wales, Victoria, and even light dustings of snow in the 'Sunshine' state of Queensland. Freezing conditions brought snow to New South Wales' Southern Tablelands
Hundreds of Queenslanders travelled south across the New South Wales border to go 'snow-spotting'. Paul Tully told the BBC he woke up at 2.30am on Sunday so his teenage son could see snow for the first time.
The RSPCA has appealed to Australian pet owners to bring domestic animals inside to escape freezing conditions.
A severe weather warning was issued on Monday for large parts of New South Wales with damaging winds gusts of up to 100km/h (28m/h) expected.
