The Buddies are bottom of the Scottish Championship without a league win this season - level on points with Dunfermline and two off Dumbarton.
Rae, 46, replaced Ian Murray in December and led the Paisley club to sixth place last season.
The head of the club's academy, Allan McManus, has been appointed interim boss.
St Mirren claimed their third league draw of the season away to Dumbarton on Saturday, the game ending 1-1.
Former Millwall, Sunderland and Rangers midfielder Rae was player-manager of Dundee between 2006 and 2008.
"The board would like to thank both Alex and David for all of their efforts on behalf of the club and wish them all the best for the future," the club said.
