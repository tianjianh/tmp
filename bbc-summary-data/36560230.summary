A portable machine has been sending high-frequency radio waves into the earth to map out the building's "footprint" concealed beneath.
The survey is the first comprehensive archaeological investigation at Reading Abbey for more than 150 years.
Experts say the Hidden Abbey Project could even uncover the high altar where King Henry I and Queen Adeliza are buried.
