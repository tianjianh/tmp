Footage released by the firm showed skateboarders testing the hoverboard with varying degrees of success.
The film was recorded on a specially constructed skate park near Barcelona in Spain.
The hoverboard contains powerful magnets which are cooled to -197 degrees celsius with liquid nitrogen, allowing the board to ride along a track hidden in the surface of the skate park.
The firm said the hoverboard was a prototype and would not be available for sale. The skate park has now been dismantled again.
