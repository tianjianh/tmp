BBC correspondents have been reporting from Hungary, Austria and Germany after travel restrictions were eased late on Friday.
In Hungary, many people waiting for trains had set up temporary camp in the underpasses underneath the city's Keleti station.
Fed up after days of waiting to be allowed to board trains, a group of 1,000 people decided to start walking to Austria.
In the early hours of Saturday morning, they crossed the border by foot.
They then boarded trains for Germany. Jenny Hill was in Munich to see them arrive.
Meanwhile, a second wave of migrants decided to begin the journey from Budapest on foot.
And across the border in Austria, many people turned out to offer help.
The Hungarian side of the border is now littered with the things people couldn't carry, or didn't want.
A convoy of cars driven by activists set out to collect migrants from the border area. One woman explained why she was moved to help.
The BBC spent the weekend at Munich station. Timelapse video captured the many thousands who arrived over 48 hours.
