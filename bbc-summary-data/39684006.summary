Farewell Claudio Ranieri: Foxes boss's Leicester home goes on sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Claudio Ranieri is selling the home he lived in while masterminding Leicester City's title triumph.

The four-bedroomed detached house in the Stoneygate area of Leicester has been put on the market for Â£695,000.
The 65-year-old Italian was sacked by the Foxes in February after winning the title the previous year.
On its website, estate agent James Sellicks said Ranieri was selling the home as he was "moving on to new adventures".
The refurbished property features three reception rooms, three bathrooms and a conservatory.
The advert states: "After taking a well-deserved break, he [Ranieri] is now ready for a return to management which means he is moving on to new adventures and selling the home which served as his base here.
"Much like the man himself, the house is unassuming yet stylish."
