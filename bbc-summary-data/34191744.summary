Yousif Badri on trial over terrorism offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has gone on trial in Glasgow accused of terrorism offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yousif Badri, 29, faces a number of allegations including an accusation he was involved in conduct "with the intention of committing acts of terrorism".
The medical student denied three charges under the Terrorism Act.
The offences are said to have been carried out at two places in Aberdeen - Mr Badri's former flat in Ashgrove Road and in Berryden Retail Park.
Mr Badri's current address in Halifax, West Yorkshire, also features in the alleged offences.
Prosecutors claim that between 2007 and 2013 Mr Badri collected or made a record of information likely to be useful to a person "committing or preparing an act of terrorism".
This allegedly included footage of terror attacks as well as instructions on "urban assassinations" and "guerrilla tactics".
The second charge alleges that Mr Badri "with the intention of committing acts of terrorism" engaged in various actions between 2006 and 2013.
Accusations listed in the indictment include a claim he had an "equipment list" for attending a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan.
He is also said to have possessed "advice for those involved in conducting terrorist attack planning operations".
The charge further states that he had documents, recordings and files containing "extreme ideology".
The final accusation claims that on April 16 last year Mr Badri posted on Twitter the phrase: "Whoever feels safe from punishment, misbehaves".
The comment is said to have come from a copy of the Inspire magazine - described as being published by the "propaganda wing" of Al-Qaeda.
The trial, before Judge Lord Turnbull, continues.
