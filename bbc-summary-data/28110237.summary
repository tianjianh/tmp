[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A thief who stole or attempted to steal from five women who were aged between 62 and 80 has been jailed for three years at Inverness Sheriff Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter MacMillan, 41, described as a prisoner in Inverness, broke into homes in the Dalneigh area of Inverness.
He stole money, gift vouchers and jewellery.
MacMillan admitted five offences which included attempted theft and theft by housebreaking between 9 May and 6 June this year.
Defence agent Duncan Henderson said there was little he could say on behalf of his client other than he immediately wanted to plead guilty.
Sentencing MacMillan, Sheriff Margaret Neilson told him: "You have a bad record of crimes of dishonesty but these charges take your offending to a whole different level.
"You deliberately targeted vulnerable women living on their own.
"Housebreaking is a disgraceful crime as it makes people feel violated and scared in their own homes."
Following sentencing, Andrew McIntyre, procurator fiscal for sheriff and jury cases in the north of Scotland, said MacMillan targeted the homes of older people.
Mr McIntyre said: "Such offences can have a devastating effect on victims' sense of security in their own home and that's why we have a prosecution policy focussed on tackling crimes against older people."
He added: "Not only will this sentence protect the public but I hope it will make clear to others that crimes such as these, perpetrated targeting some of the more vulnerable in our community, will be dealt with swiftly and effectively."
