The Black Lives Matter UK movement said it was responsible for the demonstration on Tuesday morning.
Five men and four women, aged between 23 and 32, are charged with aggravated trespass and being unlawfully airside within a restricted area of a plane.
They were released on bail until next Wednesday, when they will appear before Westminster magistrates.
Protesters occupied the runway shortly after 05.30 BST and it was closed until about 12:00.
The demonstration meant a number of flights in and out of City Airport were either cancelled, delayed or diverted.
