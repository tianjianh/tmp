The broadcaster, which airs popular drama Downton Abbey, said it had seen 14% growth in net revenue for the three months ending March 2015.
Total revenue was Â£665m, up from Â£585m during the same period last year.
Broadcast and online revenue was also up by 10%, to Â£530m, along with the studios division, which saw revenue increase by 17%.
Adam Crozier, ITV chief executive, said: "We've had a strong start to the year with further growth across all parts of the business.
"In April we completed the acquisition of Talpa Media, the creator of entertainment formats including The Voice, The Voice Kids, Utopia and Dating in the Dark, which marked an important step forward in our strategy of building a world-class production and distribution business."
ITV's results came out as staff staged a 24-hour strike to coincide with the company's annual meeting.  Unions have rejected a 2% pay rise, saying they should get a higher increase in view of the TV company's profits.
ITV's share price had dropped 1.5% by lunchtime.
