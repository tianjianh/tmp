In the other pool, FUS Rabat went to the top of their group after a 3-1 win over fellow Moroccans Kawkab Marrakech.
Mazembe, African Champions last season, secured the narrow victory with a goal from Zambia's Rainford Kalaba.
Mazembe have a five point lead in Group A with two matches to play.
Ghana's Medeama, who secured a 3-1 win over Young Africans of Tanzania on Tuesday, and Moloudia Bejaia are second and third respectively - both on five points.
Young Africans are bottom of Group A with one point from four matches and are almost out of the running for the last four.
Medeama recorded a fine home win in Sekondi to stay in the hunt for a semi-final place.
Two goals from Abbas Mohammed and another from Daniel Amoah brought them the victory. They also had a penalty saved.
In Group B, two goals from Mohamed Nahiri inside the first ten minutes put FUS Rabat on the path to victory over Kawkab Marrakech.
They extended their lead in the final minute, with the visitors recording their consolation goal deep into stoppage time.
With two games to go, FUS lead the pool with 10 points so far - three ahead of title holders Etoile du Sahel, whorecorded a 1-0 win over Al Ahly Tripoli on Tuesday.
Ahmed Akaichi got the only goal of the game for Etoile, who are defending the title they won last year.
That match was played in Tunis for security reasons and the victory takes them top in their pool.
