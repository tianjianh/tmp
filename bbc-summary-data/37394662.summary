North Ferriby United 0-1 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southport got just their second win of the season as they beat North Ferriby at Grange Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sandgrounders dominated the early stages and James Gray missed a good chance to put his side ahead.
North Ferriby had chances in the first half, as Reece Thompson cut inside before smashing against the bar.
On the stroke of half-time, Liam Nolan poked in the only goal for the visitors - the first time Southport had scored from open play in the first half of a match this season.
The Villagers responded vigorously in the second half, but Steve Burr's men deserved the points for some stern defending.
