Knowing defeat would consign them to Championship football next season, the visitors to Dens Park made the perfect start when Billy Mckay fired them in front after just two minutes.
Alex Fisher's superb goal put them 2-0 ahead and Richie Foran's side were rarely threatened thereafter.
The win moves Caley Thistle within a point of 11th-placed Hamilton.
Inverness CT simply had to win and just one more might be enough, for now. They've given themselves hope and did so on the back of a blistering start.
McKay came so close to an opener inside 60 seconds when he charged down Scott Bain's clearance, with the ball sailing inches wide.
It was a warning Dundee didn't heed. McKay gathered again shortly after around the penalty spot and fired home with a clinical finish after poor defending.
Then Iain Vigurs sent a ball in towards Fisher, he controlled it and produced a fabulous volleyed finish to double the lead.
And the visitors might have had more. Fisher nodded just wide and Greg Tansey chose the wrong option when he could have played Liam Polworth in on goal.
Brad Mckay tested Bain from a corner as time ticked on, but his strike was straight at the keeper.
Reassuringly though for Caley Thistle fans, their side looked composed on the ball and very much in control despite their predicament at the bottom of the table.
Foran's side also earned a rare clean sheet which will add to their encouragement. They were excellent at the back in every element.
It makes you wonder why they have not produced this level of performance more often this season, but this display came in the nick of time.
If they deliver this sort of quality once again on Saturday against Motherwell, an escape might just be possible.
This was the first taste of defeat for interim Dundee manager Neil McCann. The one piece of solace will lie in the fact they were already assured of their Premiership place.
Dundee were all over the place in those opening stages. Defence is an area McCann has highlighted all along and he's been largely happy with that since his arrival, but not here.
His side did respond initially with a multitude of corners, and Darren O'Dea nodded over when he should have hit the target.
Ryan Esson denied Marcus Haber with a fabulous block after Nick Ross intelligently played his team-mate in on goal. It proved their best chance.
It was a disappointing home display off the back of an impressive run since McCann took over.
They did have spells of pressure but simply could not seriously trouble the Inverness back line.
A disappointing night but McCann had already delivered the main prize - a Premiership place for next season.
