The Lionesses showed grit in a game of few chances in Tilburg, notably when Lucy Bronze blocked from Ellen Jansen.
Mark Sampson's side improved after the break, and Toni Duggan produced a low save from Loes Gurts.
And after a spell of Dutch pressure, Jordan Nobbs' long ball sent Taylor racing clear to lob the winner.

Sampson joined his squad late for the fixture having returned from the birth of his first child.
The England boss had explained he wanted this fixture to test his side - who do not play again until a friendly with Italy in April - as they prepare for the European Championship in July.
His decision to introduce Taylor to offer more support to the often-isolated Duggan proved key, and he should be pleased with how his defenders restricted a side seeded ninth for next summer's tournament.
England have now conceded just one goal in eight matches, defensive form which has set up their best run since an 11-game unbeaten sequence between March 2012 and June 2013.
England, seeded third, will be heavy favourites to progress from a Euro 2017 group also featuring Scotland, Spain and Portugal.
The fact Sampson made just two changes from October's friendly win over Spain suggests he is getting closer to knowing his best side but still there are some questions to be answered.
In deploying Karen Carney behind lone striker Duggan, England lacked cutting edge and it was only when Taylor came on as a second striker that they created their best two openings.
Chelsea striker Eniola Aluko's omission from the squad also prompts questions. The Women's Super League's top-scoring English player has not added to her 95 England caps since April.
England's players must also get used to a new schedule next year, in preparation for the domestic season switching to September-May.
But the national side's excellent form leaves them well placed to perhaps end Germany's run of six straight European titles.
Former England forward Sue Smith on the BBC Red Button: "I think England can be happy, given they have a lot of key players missing. I think they are in a good position going into the Euros.
"The Dutch made it hard for them, but England managed to solve the problems the Dutch created. They have ground out a win, which is sometimes what you need to do, especially in tournament football."
