[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Fleetwood Town have signed striker Shola Ameobi on a contract to the end of the season following his release by Bolton.

The 34-year-old former Nigeria international left Wanderers last month as they were unable to offer him a new deal due to their financial problems.
Former Newcastle man Ameobi spent time at Turkish side Gaziantep BB and Crystal Palace before he joined Bolton.
He is available for Fleetwood's game at Port Vale on Saturday at 15:00 GMT.
"In January we signed a number of younger players and it was vital to the group that we brought in a player with experience," boss Steven Pressley told the club website.
"We certainly couldn't get any more experience than Shola and we are absolutely delighted with that."
