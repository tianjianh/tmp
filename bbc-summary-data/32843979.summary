[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacqueline Carol Lloyd, 46, was struck by the out-of-service bus on Butts Lane, Southport on its way back to the depot on Sunday night.
The bus driver, 56, from Burscough, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and later bailed.
A statement described the mother-of-two as "a very private individual, but at the same time a true people person".
"Nothing mattered more to Jackie than her family and friends, to whom she gave her endless energy," the statement said.
"At the same time, Jackie devoted her life to a major blue chip company and had advanced to senior global management roles during her service of over 30 years."
