[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Wood died on 16 February following the crash in on A4113 Bridge Street in Knighton.
His family said he liked to go for his "constitutional" walk from his care home to a bench he liked to sit on or to get a newspaper.
They said he was "a regular figure on that route... waving to the folk who knew him and with a word for everyone".
Mr Wood moved to the area in the early 1970s and was a keen photographer and painter of the surrounding countryside.
In a tribute, his family said: "Anyone who knew him will miss his knowledge of music, the arts, history and current affairs.
"Renowned for his cheery, gentlemanly and optimistic nature, he will be sadly missed by his family, friends and the many people in the community who knew him."
