[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 1-1 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brett Pitman scored a late penalty to save a point for Portsmouth in a 1-1 draw with Walsall at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The away team took the lead two minutes after half-time when Luke Leahy was able to slot home a James Wilson cross.
The lead was cancelled out when Pitman's powerful penalty beat the outstretching arms of Mark Gillespie.
Walsall captain Adam Chambers was lucky to stay on the pitch after his reckless tackle on Portsmouth's Adam May in the second minute and had the home fans calling for a red card.
Referee Brett Huxtable disagreed and only awarded a yellow. Both teams were attacking but both failed to break the deadlock.
Walsall could have taken an early lead but Leahy saw his 30-yard powerful shot fly wide of the goal.
Pompey had to wait until the 31st minute for their best effort of the first half.
The home side could have won it in the dying moments but Pitman failed to get his chance on target, sending the ball just over.
