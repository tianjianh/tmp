[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield Town 2-1 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Chris Holroyd goals in six second-half minutes gave Macclesfield a 2-1 win over Dover at Moss Rose in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Each team had an early chance before Dover captain Jamie Grimes' looping header put the visitors ahead in the eighth minute.
Macclesfield keeper Scott Flinders, making his first appearance after signing from York, misjudged a free-kick, allowing Grimes to nod in.
Flinders saved a curling James Hurst effort and Dover had a goal ruled out just after half-time.
Those missed opportunities came back to haunt Athletic when Holroyd got on the end of Danny Whitaker's shot to level in the 69th minute before bursting through and scoring again soon after.
Flinders atoned for his early error by brilliantly keeping out Moses Emmanuel's late volley as Macclesfield held on for a victory that moves them to within six points of promotion-chasing Dover.
