[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than a third of England's 4,000 nursing homes are failing on safety, according to inspectors.

Drug errors, lack of staff and falls were highlighted by the Care Quality Commission in its review.
Safety was also a major issue in other services for the elderly and disabled, including care homes and home help.
The CQC said the failings were "completely unacceptable", as it unveiled the full findings of its new inspection regime for the care sector.
The new "tougher" system was launched in 2014, amid concerns problems were going undetected.
The CQC has now completed inspections for all 24,000 services in the sector, which provide care to one million vulnerable people.
More than 200,000 of them live in nursing homes, which had the most serious problems.
Some 37% of homes failed on safety, with inspectors noting they had a particular problems recruiting and retaining nurses.
Just below a quarter of care homes and home helps were rated not safe enough, while in community support, including sheltered housing, 17% fell short.
The CQC highlighted poor care inspectors had found, including:
Overall, inspectors have successfully prosecuted five care providers and another 1,000 have had enforcement action taken against them, from being closed down to handed warning notices.
All the services deemed to be failing would continue to be monitored and re-inspected, the CQC said.

Chief inspector Andrea Sutcliffe said funding remained an issue for the sector and a "long-term solution" needed to be found but lack of money was "no excuse".
"There is still too much poor care, some providers are failing to improve, and there is even some deterioration," she said.
"This is completely and utterly unacceptable."
Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the findings were "alarming" and vulnerable people were "effectively playing Russian roulette when they need care".
She added: "Taken as a whole, this report is a graphic demonstration of why older people desperately need the government to follow through on its commitment to consult on proposals for strengthening social care later this year."
Margaret Willcox, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said councils and providers would be "re-doubling our mutual efforts to ensure older and disabled people and their families get the reliable, personal care they need and deserve".
