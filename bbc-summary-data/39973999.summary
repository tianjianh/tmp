The Reds are fourth in the Premier League and host Middlesbrough on Sunday (15:00 BST) knowing victory will earn Champions League football next term.
They last played in the competition in 2014-15 after finishing second.
"The world is not full of players who will make us better immediately but clearly there are a few out there," said German Klopp.
"We have spoken to them.
"We have a really good side when our first 11, 12, 13, 14 players are fit."
The Anfield club have reportedly had a Â£64.6m bid rejected for Monaco striker Kylian Mbappe and been linked with moves for Roma winger Mohamed Salah, Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk and Fulham left-back Ryan Sessegnon.
Liverpool were top of the table in November and in contention for the title at the turn of the year, but injuries to key players - such as Sadio Mane, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana - at various stages derailed their challenge.
They suffered a shock defeat by Wolves in the fourth round of the FA Cup in January and were knocked out of the EFL Cup at the semi-final stage by Southampton.
But Klopp, in his first full season in charge after replacing the sacked Brendan Rodgers in October 2015, said a return to Europe's elite club competition by finishing in the top four will be a "successful" campaign.
A third-place finish would earn direct qualification for the group stage, while finishing fourth will mean they would have to contest a two-legged play-off match.
Klopp added: "The Champions League, for different reasons, is a wonderful competition.
"You can earn a lot of money there - that is money we did not have last year. That is very interesting and is one part of it, but we are already in a good position.
"We are a club without financial problems and we have money to spend, but it makes sense to think before we spend and that is what we are doing."
