[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 1-1 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe's play-off hopes were dealt a blow as League Two title-chasers Plymouth rescued a draw at Adams Park thanks to a header from substitute Nathan Blissett.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side looked to be heading for all three points thanks to Myles Weston's first goal of 2017, but Blissett's maiden Plymouth goal since arriving from Torquay saw the spoils shared.
In a cagey opening, Wycombe seized the first chance out of nowhere from Adebayo Akinfenwa's 30-yard lob, which dipped just wide with Luke McCormick well-beaten.
Gareth Ainsworth's side snatched the lead in the 17th minute when Weston ghosted in from the left and buried an inch-perfect cross from Michael Harriman.
Plymouth could have been level soon after when a Jamal Blackman double-save thwarted Jimmy Spencer, and Jake Jervis from the rebound.
In the second half, a dangerous Weston delivery was put on a plate for Dominic Gape, who could only nod his header straight at McCormick.
The impressive Blackman was required again to tip over a Jervis volley but Plymouth equalised from the resulting corner as substitute Blissett pounced to guide it home with 15 minutes left to play.
