[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queen's Park slipped to defeat by Clyde but still managed to win on aggregate and gain promotion to League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Spiders won the first-leg 3-1, and Clyde found the hope they were looking for with a Scott Linton penalty in the first half at Hampden.
The hosts played the better football, with teenage midfielder Liam Brown outstanding.
They were also helped by Clyde being reduced to 10 men with Michael Bolochoweckyj's second-half dismissal.
The task for Barry Ferguson's Clyde was clear enough, but their play initially seemed cluttered and heavy footed.
It might have been understandable that a two-goal lead from the first leg allowed Queen's Park to perform with a sense of freedom.
The home side were composed and slick in their passing, with so much of their play shaped and cajoled by the excellent Brown. The 17-year-old, whose jersey seemed several sizes too big but whose ability and assurance allowed him to command all of those around him, was irrepressible.
Gus MacPherson's side attacked with measured intent and created several scares in the Clyde penalty area. The visitors' tall, strong but occasionally plodding in their movement of the ball, were obliged to use their wits just to stay in the tie.
By not panicking, they found the means to assert themselves. When Steven Brisbane slung a cross into the Queen's Park penalty area, John Gemmell steered a header towards goal and the ball landed on the roof of the net.
And, from another Gemmell header, Ryan McGeever handled.
From the resulting penalty kick, Linton stroked the ball into the corner of the net. Queen's Park still had a goal lead in their favour, though, and they were not unnerved.
The second half began in the same manner as the first, with the home side playing with verve and confidence. Brisbane had to scoop the ball over almost from the goal-line after David Galt crossed for Paul Woods.
There was intricacy in the way that Vincent Berry, Brown and Woods all moved the ball around, but Clyde could be bluntly effective. Jordan Kirkpatrick saw a shot from distance saved, while substitute David Gormley's volley was tipped over by Queen's Park keeper William Muir.
In between those efforts, though, Bolochoweckyj was dismissed, receiving his second yellow card for a foul on Galt.
Clyde continued to be game, and sent Marvin Andrews on to play up front but they could not create another clear chance, and Queen's Park earned the result that took them up into the third tier after a seven-year absence.
