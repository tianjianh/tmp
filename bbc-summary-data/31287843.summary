Union members will be balloted on a new pay offer, which has been negotiated between Metrolink and Unite at Acas.
Staff had threatened to walk out for 24 hours on Wednesday, when United are due to play Burnley at Old Trafford.
In the last Metrolink strike in 2004, office staff, who had been trained as drivers, kept the network running.
