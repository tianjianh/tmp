Campbell, who is in Beijing co-commentating on the World Athletics Championships for BBC Sport, briefly gave up athletics for football in his early 20s before returning to the track.
Since retiring from running, the Manchester United fan has worked as a sprint coach with several Premier League clubs.
You can make your predictions now, compare them to Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, including three perfect scores.
His score of 140 points saw him beat actor and comedian Jack Whitehall, who picked five correct results with no perfect scores, for a total of 50.
For the second week running, the Premier League team top of the Predictor leaderboard after week two is Leicester, with an average total score of 194 points, while the 16-24 and 35-44 age-groups have the highest average total score of 181 points.
We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).
