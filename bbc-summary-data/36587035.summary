[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A funnel cloud spotted over South Yorkshire surprised weather experts in the county.

The clouds are created when rapidly rotating winds form beneath heavy shower or thunder clouds.
BBC weatherman Paul Hudson said it was "a surprise" to see one forming "on a day when weather conditions across Yorkshire are relatively settled".
He said: "There must have been just enough energy and rotation of the air within the cloud to create it."
Nigel Taylor, in Wath upon Dearne, said he saw it forming and thought he was going to need to "take cover in Greggs!"
Earlier in June, a funnel cloud lifted an inflatable slide into the air at a country show in Lincolnshire.
