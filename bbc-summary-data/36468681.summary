A 1966 Dalek is among a huge collection of film and TV props and memorabilia expected to attract bids from around the world when sold at auction.

The 67 items all belong to one man, whose wife said he needs to get rid of them so they can downsize.
Auctioneer James Lewis said it was the best collection of film memorabilia he had ever seen for sale.
Other Doctor Who props up for grabs include a Cyberman from the 19th season and a Tardis from a stage show.
Mr Lewis said: "I think the Dalek would have been back in use exterminating its owner if he hadn't agreed to sell his collection."
His wife said: "There's no way that we can accommodate all of these things. The last thing I want is a Dalek in the bedroom.
"Everything has to go. We don't want any of it back.
"I'm locking my husband in a straitjacket in the garden shed so he can't bid on any of it again."

Mr Lewis said the collection took over the cellar of the couple's house.
"They are incredibly rare, to get a genuine Dalek from that period," he said.
"I've never seen one coming up for many, many, many years."
The collection also includes oversized props from The Borrowers and Mr Cadbury's Parrot.
The collector, from Hertfordshire, amassed the items over 25 years.
He is not expected to be at the auction, which is taking place at Bamfords in Derby later.
"I don't think he can bring himself to come," Mr Lewis said.
"He had lots of collections of lots of different things but it's this collection that's just so huge.
"In terms of film memorabilia this is probably the best sale that we've ever had, the best sale that I've ever seen as an auctioneer."
