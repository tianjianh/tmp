The lake frontage at Waterhead, a popular tourist destination, is home to a ferry pier, hotels, shops and cafes.
A Â£250,000 scheme aimed at improving it for pedestrians includes new seating, resurfaced walkways and an information board to identify key landscapes in the Lake District.
Local businesses and residents have until 1 February to comment.
Councillor Giles Archibald, portfolio holder for town centres and small business, said: "Waterhead is a magnet for visitors and locals alike and offers superb views of the lake.
"It deserves a high quality, attractive promenade in keeping with its spectacular surroundings."
