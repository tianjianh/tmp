The film took £5.9m over the weekend - bringing its overall UK total to £52.1m.
On the last day of 2016, the movie overtook Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them to become the UK's highest grossing film of the calendar year.
Disney said the film took £50.7m up to and including 31 December, just enough to beat the Harry Potter spin-off.
Official UK box office figures for 2016, which will be released later this month, are expected to show Rogue One and Fantastic Beasts were the only two films to cross the £50m threshold in the course of the year.
Their success is particularly notable for the fact both films were released late in the year. Rogue One in particular achieved the feat in less than three weeks.
Over the New Year weekend, Rogue One took more than twice its closest competitor - the Bryan Cranston comedy Why Him?
The film, which also stars James Franco, entered the chart at number two after taking £2.2m on its first weekend of release.
Passengers, which stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, was the third most popular film, taking £1.9m.
Sci-fi film Monster Trucks debuted at number four with £1.7m, while the animated children's film Moana rounded off the top five, taking £1.6m.
The only other new entry in the top 10 was Collateral Beauty - which stars Will Smith, Keira Knightley and Dame Helen Mirren.
The film, which has received poor reviews from critics, took £1.2m to debut at number seven.
