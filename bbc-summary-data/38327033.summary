Catherine Johnston, 39, was reported missing on Tuesday. Her car, a white Seat Leon, was later found at Ballintoy Harbour.
A major air and sea search, involving the coastguard and PSNI, is continuing along the north coast.
Coleraine police have now asked for anyone who was in the area and took pictures, to come forward.
"We are appealing to any visitors that attended Ballintoy Harbour on Tuesday 13 December and took pictures of the scenery," Insp David Burns said.
"We would like to review your photographs to try and establish the movements of missing person Catherine Johnston."
Ms Johnston is described as being approximately 5'9" tall, of average build and with light brown shoulder length hair.
Her family said on Wednesday that they were becoming increasingly concerned for her safety.
