The Welsh county eased to a seven-wicket win over Surrey in Guildford, the first time since 2010 that they had won three four-day matches in a row.
Glamorgan reached their target of 247 with a session to spare, with Will Bragg making 83 and Ben Wright 68.
"I can tell you we will be pushing for promotion," Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport.
"I've played for Yorkshire in the first division and I've got a good idea what it's about.
"I've said to the guys from the start that if we can get onto a run, we've got the makings of a team that can play in the first division."
The top two teams are promoted to Division One.
Surrey stay second in the table but Glamorgan have a game in hand and remain the last unbeaten side in the division.
Bragg, who also top-scored last year in a 50-overs win in Guildford, paid tribute to his captain.
"It's not about ifs and buts, we're here to win whatever the situation in the game," said Bragg.
"A lot of people and the media write us off but we know how good we can be and we've got a strongly-knit team.
"With Jacques Rudolph coming in as captain, he's been fantastic and we're making big strides."
Rudolph admits Glamorgan are dependent on keeping their frontline players fit with a relatively small first-team squad facing a hectic schedule of four-day and T20 games.
"It's going to be tricky to keep the guys fit but they are up for the challenge.
"At the moment no-one's injured so we've been very fortunate.
"It's going to be tough but the guys are well aware of that, and as long as they keep managing themselves well and I'm managing the amount of overs they bowl, we should be ok."
Glamorgan move straight to Essex for a T20 Blast game at Chelmsford on Friday, and entertain Sussex at the SSE Swalec Stadium on Sunday, 21 June, before hosting Leicestershire in the Championship the following day.
