A year ago, nearly 9,000 people died and more than 20,000 were injured when an earthquake struck the country.
The event, organised by Lakeland Mountain Guides, will see the spine of Catbells lit by people's head torches.
Matt Le Voi, one of the organisers, said the "euphoria" once they reach the top will be "absolutely incredible".
The Catbells Festival of Light aims to get the Nepal Earthquake back in people's minds, organisers said.
John Brooks and Mr Le Voi organised the event as they have both visited the country, and last year the group raised Â£5,000 for Community Action Nepal by climbing Blencathra.
Mr Le Voi said: "[Nepal] has firmly cemented itself within our hearts as an amazing place to be. On top of this, we both have Nepalese friends, many of them Sherpas, who would have been directly affected by the earthquake.
"Immediately after the earthquake myself and John knew we had to try and do something to provide funds for the Nepalese people.
"We're expecting about 500 people to be with us, so imagine Catbells with 500 people with their head torches on all raising money for this great cause - it's going to be electric."
The event on Catbells near Keswick, will see a photograph taken in darkness which will then be sold to raise funds.
