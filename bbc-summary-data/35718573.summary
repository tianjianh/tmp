Colin McDonald was jailed for life on Monday for the manslaughter of Dominic Doyle, 21, who was stabbed to death in a brawl in Greater Manchester.
McDonald, 42, of Denton, had already served jail sentences for manslaughter and causing death by dangerous driving.
MP Jim McMahon said the justice system had failed the families of the victims.
Speaking in the House of Commons, The Oldham West and Royton MP said McDonald was "a criminal with little regard for human life", and called for a "meaningful debate" about how he was allowed to serve some of his most recent sentence in the community.
He added: "The parents want answers. How can a justice system that's meant to give people confidence do this to people."
Mr McMahon raised the case on behalf of the family of Wayne Leary, of Failsworth, who died in a hit-and-run collision in 2011.
McDonald was jailed for the killing, and had previously served a sentence for the 1997 manslaughter of accountant Jonathan Tripp, who drowned after McDonald pushed him into a canal in Manchester.
Dominic Doyle died after he was stabbed in a fight outside Hughes' Bar in Denton on 7 June last year.
McDonald's 15-year-old stepson was also involved in the attack and was jailed for murder.
The court heard McDonald was "an extremely dangerous individual" who encouraged his stepson.
House of Commons leader Chris Grayling agreed the stabbing was a "tragic case" and urged Mr McMahon to raise the matter with a minister for the justice department.
