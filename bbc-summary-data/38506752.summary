Eyewitness Simon Crowcroft, from Jersey, told the Islington Gazette he came across the "strange scene" on Upper Street while in the city on Tuesday.
The Met Police said officer Dan Smith was helping a man who had collapsed. He was treated at the scene.
A force spokesman said the officer's horse, Invictor, was "showing he's a team player".
The Met said its mounted horse unit carries out day-to-day patrols and is tasked like any other unit.
A London Ambulance spokesman added: "We were to reports of an unwell person on Upper Street. We treated a man at the scene but did not take anyone to hospital."
