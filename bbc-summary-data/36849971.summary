The bodies of 22 people have been found on a migrant dinghy in the Mediterranean, the aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has said.

The 21 women and one man were found "in a pool of fuel and water" at the bottom of the boat, off the coast of Libya.
They had been on the dinghy "for hours", the aid group said.
More than 200 survivors who were on the dinghy have been transferred to a boat operated by MSF. It is unclear where they were travelling from.
The survivors were among more than 2,000 migrants rescued from the water in different operations on Wednesday and taken to Sicily. Vessels from the Spanish and Italian navies and other humanitarian organisations were involved.
Thousands of migrants have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean this year, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration.
MSF works together with another group, SOS Mediterranee, to patrol the Mediterranean in three rescue vessels - the Dignity 1, the Bourbon Argos and the Aquarius.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
