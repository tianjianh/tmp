Lee Selby: IBF featherweight champion expects fight in USA

Britain's Lee Selby says he is likely to defend his IBF featherweight title against Jonathan Victor Barros in mid-December in the United States.

The Welshman has not fought since his second successful title defence against American Eric Hunter in April 2016.
Argentine Barros is the mandatory challenger after beating Satoshi Hosono of Japan in a split decision in a world title elimination bout.
"Sadly I think it's going to be in America," said Selby, 29.
"I'd love to fight back home in Wales in front of my home fans. Of course home advantage always helps against the mandatory challenger."
Selby hopes fighting in the US, where he previously defeated Mexican Fernando Montiel in his first IBF title defence, will lift his profile.
He signed a three-year deal to work with leading American adviser Al Haymon, who also advises Floyd Mayweather Jr, and says he wants to become a "worldwide star".
"The British boxing fans have seen me and now I'm trying to show that worldwide," Selby told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
Selby was at Barros' recent victory over Hosono in Tokyo and described the 32-year-old as a "dangerous opponent" - but he hopes beating him will set up a "big fight" against Northern Ireland's Carl Frampton.
WBA champion Frampton's trainer Shane McGuigan has said a world featherweight unification fight was possible.
Frampton is set for a rematch against Mexico's Leo Santa Cruz, but Selby would be keen to face the 29-year-old at Cardiff's Principality Stadium and draw "great numbers".
"He's a big draw, a massive draw in the UK," said Selby. "That's the dream for all Welsh fighters - to headline a show at the Principality Stadium."
