[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 2-2 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere squandered a two-goal lead as Bromley rescued a National League draw with a late equaliser at Prenton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andy Cook gave the hosts an early lead, heading home Ben Tollitt's corner, before he took his tally for the season to 15 goals by adding his second just seven minutes later.
Tranmere made things hard for themselves when Adam Buxton was sent off in the 56th minute, and Bromley's Brandon Hanlan set up a nervy finish with his 64th-minute strike.
It looked like the hosts would hold firm to claim back-to-back wins, but Jack Holland snatched a point for Bromley with an 88th-minute tap-in.
