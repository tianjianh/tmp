Glory Days sold 96,000 copies in its first week on sale, beating Metallica and Bruno Mars to the top spot.
The record is now the second fastest-selling release of the year, after David Bowie's Blackstar, which shifted 146,000 copies in January.
Little Mix have also achieved the highest first-week figure for a UK girl group since The Spice Girls' Spiceworld notched up 192,000 sales in 1997.
Metallica's Hard Wired... To Self Destruct has entered at number two, while Bruno Mars's 24K Magic has debuted at three.
Just below them, at number four, is Michael Ball and Alfie Boe's album of duets, Together, which has been certified gold in just two weeks, denoting 100,000 copies sold.
Other new entries come from UB40, whose unplugged album has landed at number 17, while YouTube singer-songwriter Dodie has crept into the chart at 35 with her debut album Intertwined.
Elsewhere, Adele's 25 has climbed 10 places to number 23, thanks in part to the album being discounted by some retailers.
Last week's number one, 24 Hrs by Olly Murs, has dropped to six in this week's countdown.
In the singles chart, Clean Bandit have fought off a challenge for the number one spot from US hip-hop act Rae Sremmurd.
The Cambridge-based dance act have notched up a third week at number one with Rockabye, a dancehall song about a single mother struggling to support her baby.
It has notched up more downloads (31,000) and streams (4.3 million) than any other track this week, forcing Rae Sremmurd's Black Beatles into the runner-up's position.
There have been minor shuffles elsewhere in the top 10, with Maroon 5's Don't Wanna Know reversing its sales decline to reach number five, a new peak.
Lower down, R&B star The Weeknd has scored two new entries, led by the Daft Punk-featuring I Feel It Coming at number 18. The title track of his new album Starboy enjoys a comfortable eighth week inside the top 10 at number eight.
Other new entries have come from DJ Tom Zanetti, whose single You Want Me has jumped from 72 to 24, while dance act Sigma have scored a collaborative hit with folk singer Birdy. Their song Find Me has made its first top 40 appearance at 36.
Finally, John Legend has scored his sixth top 40 single with Love Me Now, which has climbed eight places to number 37.
