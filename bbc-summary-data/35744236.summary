The Magpies remained in the drop zone following their 3-1 defeat by Bournemouth at St. James' Park.
"In some moments we are not a team, we are not as one. Something has to change," Perez, 22, told BBC Newcastle.
"It's not enough - we have good quality in the dressing room, but during this season we have not shown it. We need to be a team."
The former Tenerife forward scored Newcastle's only goal in the 80th minute in a defeat that followed two wins and a draw in their three previous home games.
"We have been playing good football at home - winning games," the Spaniard continued.
"That has been key for us - playing at home.  I don't know what happened but we have to change something."
With only 10 games remaining Newcastle are level on points with Norwich, and a point behind 17th-placed Sunderland and safety.
"We have to think that we have 10 finals," said Perez. "It doesn't matter how, we have to be a team and try to get points as soon as possible because we are in trouble.
"It's our turn, we have to give [the fans] something special because Newcastle, the club, and the fans don't deserve the situation."
There has been widespread speculation about Steve McClaren's position as head coach since the defeat, but Perez insisted the players are behind him.
"He is our manager, we have to be with him," he added.
"If something changes, I don't know what's going to happen - but right now we are with him because he is our manager."
