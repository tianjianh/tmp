Millwall winger Gregg Wylde has had his contract terminated by mutual consent.

The 26-year-old joined the Lions last summer but made just 10 appearances and moved on loan to fellow League One side Northampton.
The former Rangers and Plymouth man played 12 times for the Cobblers before needing surgery on a groin injury.
"Unfortunately Gregg's opportunities here have been limited but I hope he can go on and succeed elsewhere," Millwall boss Neil Harris said.
