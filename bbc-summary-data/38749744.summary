The crash happened at about 13:00 GMT on the A607 in Waddington.
Police said the ambulance was responding to an emergency call and had its blue lights on when it was involved in a collision with the two cars. There was no patient onboard at the time.
Four people, including the two ambulance crew, were taken to hospital in Lincoln.
Insp Simon Heads from the Lincolnshire Police serious collision investigation unit said "the two ambulance crew are uninjured".
He added that a female passenger from one of the cars who was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham was "not as seriously injured as was first feared".
East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust has confirmed one of its ambulances was involved in the crash.
The trust said it was "working with Lincolnshire Police to support their investigation".
