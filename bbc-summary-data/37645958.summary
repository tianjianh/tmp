Ex-Newport County midfielder Michael Flynn is joining the club's coaching staff under new manager Graham Westley.

Since his appointment, former Stevenage, Peterborough United and Preston manager Westley has appointed Dino Maamria as his assistant.
Sean McCarthy, who was in caretaker charge following Warren Feeney's sacking in September, has left the League Two's bottom club.
"He [Flynn] knows the football club," said Westley.
"One of the most important things when you come from afar is someone really close who's on your side, who is helping you run the football club and make sure you don't make basic errors."
Newport-born Flynn enjoyed three spells at the Exiles as a player before being appointed first team coach at the club in October last year under John Sheridan.
In the summer, he moved to a newly-created role of Football and Business Director, but Westley has moved swiftly to add him to his backroom team.
"The club asked me to put together a framework for management," Westley added.
"There are certain financial aspects for what you can and can't do at any football club so for certain people to arrive, certain people have to go.
"There's nothing personal in any decision that gets made in these situations.
"I've met Michael, I knew Michael and he's coming in to work with us as well so we've got a strong team there."
