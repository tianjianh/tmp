Ernie Crouch is thought to have been caught by a gust and blown off the pavement near Finchley Central station on Saturday.
Emergency services were called, but Mr Crouch died at the scene a short time later.
Fans said he had been on his way to Arsenal's match against Sunderland.
Arsenal tweeted: "Everyone at Arsenal Football Club is saddened to learn of the passing of lifelong fan Ernie Crouch. May he rest in peace."
According to fans on social media, he had supported Arsenal since 1934.
Pat Hale of Arsenal Supporters Club told BBC Radio 5 live: "He travelled to every away game with us and always had his regular front seat.
"It is going to be very upsetting next Sunday morning [Arsenal play Aston Villa away] to get on the bus and he won't be there.
"Football was just his life. He promised his son not to go to any more away games when he turned 90, but last week we saw him at Norwich.
The TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted: "RIP Ernie Crouch. Followed Arsenal for 80yrs. Died yesterday when high winds blew him into a bus on way to game."
