Nacer Chadli: Tottenham Hotspur winger faces six-week lay-off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham winger Nacer Chadli will be out for about six weeks with an ankle injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old Belgium international, who joined Spurs from FC Twente in July 2013, damaged ankle ligaments in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Liverpool.
He was taken off after eight minutes following a collision.
Spurs are already without Ryan Mason, who has a knee injury, Nabil Bentaleb, who has an ankle problem, and Son Heung-min, who has an injured foot.
