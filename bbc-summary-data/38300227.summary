Two of their co-owners, former Manchester United stars Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville, spoke at a two-hour planning meeting at Salford Council.
"The hard work starts here," said Neville afterwards.
"We have heard the local community issues and now we must deliver on the promises we have made."
The former Manchester United players heard numerous objections, including that they were turning Salford, who play in National League North, into a "commercial monster".
At one point Neville was presented with a black bin bag of rubbish by an objector as an example of the additional litter Salford's proposal would create.
He promised that, if needed, he and the Salford first team would go outside to clear litter after matches.
Neville also said any instances of anti-Semitism in an area where 40% of the local population is Jewish would be dealt with in the strongest available manner.
The planning permission was granted subject to a number of conditions, particularly with relation to traffic.
David Mintz, spokesman for the local Kersal Moor residents association, said: "The council has been wowed by celebrity. A thousand residents were consulted. The vast majority objected and this has been ignored."
Mintz said the objectors would now consider asking for a judicial review.
Salford have been promoted in successive seasons since a high-profile takeover involving Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville in 2014 and last year reached the FA Cup second round for the first time.
