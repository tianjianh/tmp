Cathie Sabin, of Much Wenlock, Shrops, became the first woman to take on her role in 2013 - the LTA's 125th year.
She said she was passionate about supporting young people and volunteers.
Reacting to the news of her OBE, Mrs Sabin said: "For me it's a recognition of the volunteers because sometimes they're not valued enough.

"It's about recognising that people who do things voluntarily are worth looking after."
The former PE teacher at Idsall School played Shropshire county tennis and is a member of Bridgnorth Tennis Club.
Also honoured was Sue Broughton, founder of charity Deaf Education Through Listening and Talking.
The 66-year-old from Apley, Telford, was appointed MBE for services to children with special educational needs.
She said: "I was proud, elated but also very humbled, because it's the charity that's the wonderful thing, it's not about any individuals.
"You get a lot more out of it than you put in. I've met the most amazing young people who have become extensions of my own family because I met them when they were babies and now they're in their 20s and achieving the most astonishing things."
Jane Tomkinson, from Whitchurch, was appointed OBE for services to NHS financial management.
The chief executive at Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: "I have been a part of the NHS finance profession since 1990 and during those 25 years I have worked with many exceptional patients and people across all professions in the NHS.
"They have given me advice and support and without this, I would not have received the award."
