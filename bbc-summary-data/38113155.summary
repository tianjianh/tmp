Paul Hayes headed the Chairboys in front before Kashket slotted in a second to make it 2-0 before half-time.
Chesterfield's Jon Nolan was sent off for a late tackle on Dominic Gape, and Kashket scored his second soon after.
Anthony Stuart volleyed in to make it 4-0, before Kashket's placed shot completed the rout late on.
The result caps a good week for Wanderers, who were able to pay off their debts to previous owner Steve Hayes on Thursday, thanks to money received from a sell-on clause triggered when Jordan Ibe moved to Bournemouth from Liverpool.
Gareth Ainsworth's side, who are seventh in the League Two table, have now won five straight games in all competitions,
The Chairboys also reached the third round of the FA Cup last season, taking then-Premier League side Aston Villa to a replay before losing 2-0 at Villa Park.
