British star James Corden will host the 2017 Grammy Awards, it has been announced.

The actor and comedian, who hosts The Late Late Show on US television, replaces rapper LL Cool J, who has presented the show since 2011.
Corden's appointment comes off the back of his successful Carpool Karaoke series, which has featured stars like Adele, Elton John and Lady Gaga.
The former Gavin and Stacey star said he was "truly honoured".
"It's the biggest, most prestigious award show in music and I feel incredibly lucky to be part of such an incredible night," he added.
Corden, 38, has ample experience of hosting music awards, after helming the Brits from 2011 to 2014.
With Adele expected to receive multiple nominations for next year's Grammys, he will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the 2012 Brits, where he was forced to interrupt the star mid-speech as she accepted her award for best British album because the show was over-running.
The singer, who was clearly annoyed at being cut off, walked off stage holding up her middle finger to the camera.
Corden later said he was "furious" at being "put in a horrible position" and had apologised to Adele in her dressing room immediately after the show.
Since moving to America to host The Late Late Show last year, Corden has seen his profile rise exponentially.
He won plaudits for hosting the Tony Awards - which recognise achievement on Broadway - earlier this year; and his chat show won an Emmy Award in September.
But Carpool Karaoke has proved to be his biggest success, racking up more than two billion plays on YouTube alone.
A recurring segment on his show, it sees famous musicians hitch a ride in Corden's car, while singing along to their biggest hits.
Madonna and Bruno Mars are set to be his next guests and the concept is being turned into a full stand-alone series.
"Thanks to Carpool Karaoke, we've all been on some incredible rides with James," said Neil Portnow, chief executive of the Recording Academy, which arranges the Grammys.
"He's got big shoes to fill after the magnificent run we had with LL Cool J, but James Corden is a commanding, dynamic showman who, we believe, is perfect to host the Grammy Awards."
Pop star Meghan Trainor will announce the nominees for the four main categories - record of the year, song of the year, album of the year and best new artist - live on US breakfast show This Morning on 6 December.
The remaining 80 categories will be revealed on social media immediately afterwards.
Beyonce, Drake and David Bowie are expected to receive multiple nominations. However, R&B star Frank Ocean deliberately refused to submit his songs for Grammy consideration, saying the awards typically overlooked black artists in the album of the year category.
"That institution certainly has nostalgic importance," Ocean told the New York Times last week. "It just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down."
He added: "I think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated. I'd rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience."
Kaepernick is a quarterback for American Football team the San Francisco 49ers, who gained notoriety when he refused to stand for the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality.
The winners of the 2017 Grammy Awards will be revealed at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday 12 February.
