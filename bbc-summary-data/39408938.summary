The 30-year-old is in his second spell with the Saints, having returned after two years with Hibernian in 2015.
He first moved to Perth on loan from Falkirk in 2007, signing a permanent deal the following year.
Craig has scored five goals in 35 appearances this season for Tommy Wright's side.
The midfielder told the club website: "I'm delighted that, having been back for two years, the club has shown this kind of commitment to me and I'm looking to have as much success over the next two years as we are currently enjoying.
"I think everyone knows my feelings for the club and it is great to have my immediate future sorted."
St Johnstone team-mates Zander Clark, Richard Foster, Joe Shaughnessy, Brian Easton, David Wotherspoon, Steven MacLean and Aaron Comrie have all recently agreed new deals.
