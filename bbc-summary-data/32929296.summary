New Dumbarton manager Stevie Aitken has moved swiftly into the transfer market to sign defenders Gregor Buchanan and Grant Gallagher.

Buchanan, 25, joined the Scottish Championship club after being released by League One outfit Dunfermline.
He made 36 appearances for Athletic after joining from Airdrieonians last summer.
Gallagher, 24, follows Aitken from Stranraer, where he has spent his whole career, playing 44 times this term.
Both players have signed one-year contracts with the Sons, who appointed Aitken on Wednesday to succeed Ian Murray, who moved to St Mirrern last week.
