Hamza Choudhury, who has played 13 Championship games for Burton this season, got the opener from the spot.
Spanish striker Raul Uche and Romanian Alex Pascanu scored the other goals for City.
"Some of our football was really good and really brave, especially through the middle of the park," Cassidy said.

"I'm so proud of the performance and attitude - they gave it everything, and if we keep giving them games like that we'll keep getting attitudes like that.
"We knew our performance had to be at a decent level so we start to look like a team that are playing together, and we definitely got that."
Jersey created numerous chances of their own, with striker Craig Russell going close, Kieran Lester seeing his shot cleared off the line and Max Thompson's deflected effort hitting the crossbar.
Cassidy's side were using the game as part of their preparations for the upcoming Muratti against rivals Guernsey and the Island Games in Gotland.
"We're still trying to work out whether we need to play with two up front, or whether we just try and be strong and compete in the midfield," he added.
"We need to start adding goals to our game, that's a definite - that's a few games now that we're not scoring as regularly as we'd like."
