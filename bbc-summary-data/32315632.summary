Secret 'housebreaking code' spotted in East Kilbride

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A secret "Housebreaker's Code" has been used to target properties in the west of Scotland, police have warned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers have now issued a key to the code, which they said had recently been spotted in East Kilbride.
The characters scrawled on houses and sheds by criminals can indicate whether a property is alarmed, has vulnerable occupants or has been robbed before.
Police Scotland has urged members of the public to report any sightings of the symbols.
