Leicester Tigers will follow the advice of Leicester City boss Claudio Ranieri in their bid to reach the European Champions Cup final, says Mathew Tait.

City are five points clear at Premier League summit with four games left.
And Tigers face Racing 92 in their Champions Cup semi-final on Sunday.
"For us it's been great to see how they cope with pressure," said Tigers centre Tait. "Claudio Ranieri speaks very well about taking it game by game and the players seem to respond to that."
Talking to BBC East Midlands Today, Tait continued: "It would be nice if we can show that same composure come Sunday."
Tait said it would be a "fairytale" if the Foxes went on to win the Premier League.
Tigers themselves are still in the hunt for an 11th English championship of their own, while also still pursuing success in European rugby's biggest club competition.
"It's great for the city," Tait said. "It's the sporting capital of the UK at the minute.
"Both clubs are bouncing off each other with their success."
Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill says the fortune of the city's top sports club, including newly-crowned British Basketball League champions Leicester Riders, has created "a buzz" in Leicester.
He said: "The football have gone enormously well. Let's hope they kick on and become Premiership champions.
"Basketball have already done it themselves and the Tigers have the opportunity to do that in two competitions.
"Hopefully it will be a good end to the season for everybody."
