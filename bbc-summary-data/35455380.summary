[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were chances in the 90 minutes and in extra-time but the match in the Rwandan town of Rubavu ended goalless.
Abdoulaziz Keita proved to be the hero for Guinea as he saved a spot kick before stepping up to score the winner.
Guinea are now through to face DR Congo in the semi-finals on Wednesday in Kigali.
The opening ten minutes set the tone for the rest of the game as both sides started slowly and neither managed a shot on target.
Both sides then sent headers wide first from Guinea's Kile Bangoura and then minutes later by Zambia captain Chris Katongo.
With 20 minutes left to play Guinea's Ibrahima Sory Sankhon saw his free kick deflected onto the woodwork.
Captain Chris Katongo thought he had won the game with six minutes left to play but his effort was disallowed for offside.
One of the better chances in extra-time fell to Zambia's Adrian Chama as he took the ball into the area but was denied by a good save from Abdoulaziz Keita in the Guinea goal.
With neither side able to break the deadlock the game was decided by penalties.
Katongo, who scored when he helped Zambia win the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, had his effort saved by Keita.
Guinea then scored their first effort and Buchizya Mfune then got Zambia on the board.
Things were then levelled up when Jacob Banda saved Sankhon's shot, both sides then scored to keep things level.
Zambia's Stephen Kabamba and Guinea's Mohamed Youla put the ball over the bar.
The next four penalties were all scored as the shootout went into sudden death.
Keita then saved from Daut Musekwa before the Guinea keeper stepped up to score the winner.
Earlier on Sunday in the other quarter-final Mali came from behind to beat Tunisia 2-1 and set a semi-final against Ivory Coast.
The final of the tournament for locally-based players only, will be in Kigali next Sunday.
