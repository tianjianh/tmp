[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 4-4 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yoann Arquin snatched a point for Mansfield with a last-minute goal as an incredible game ended 4-4 at home to bogey side Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Frenchman raced onto a Hayden White flick and crashed in a dipping half-volley from 25 yards to send the home fans wild.
Mansfield, unbeaten in eight games, had not beaten Stanley in their previous 11 league meetings and twice the visitors earned two-goal leads.
In a rip-roaring first half, Stanley went ahead after only five minutes when Omar Beckles was allowed to steer home from eight yards from Sean McConville's free-kick.
More poor home defending in the 29th minute saw Lee Collins fail to clear and Shay McCartan turned to fire in number two.
Mansfield were back in it within two minutes as a Krystian Pearce header from a corner was blocked on the line and the referee ruled Rhys Bennett had forced the ball over before it was cleared.
The pick of the goals came in the 44th minute as Billy Kee beat Bennett out on the right and turned to send a spectacular dipping shot under the far angle of post and crossbar.
But the Stags stayed in touch in stoppage time as White headed home a Joel Byrom corner.
Beckles headed against the right-hand post but it was 3-3 after 64 minutes when Shaq Coulthirst sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the penalty spot after Seamus Conneely had fouled Pearce.
Pearce then blocked off Kee to concede a penalty two minutes later and the burly striker sent Jake Kean the wrong way.
After both sides had hit a post it was left to Arquin to steal a late leveller.
