Police say the gunman who killed a professor at the University of California Los Angeles had a 'kill list', which led them to find a woman dead in Minnesota.

Professor William Klug, 39, was shot dead at UCLA on Wednesday.
LA police believe the gunman, identified as Mainak Sarkar, then killed himself.
Sarkar may have believed the professor had stolen his intellectual property, said police chief Charlie Beck.
Police said Sarkar, who was in a research group with Klug, drove from Minnesota to Los Angeles to kill Klug before killing himself. A gun was found at the scene.
On a list found at Sarkar's home in Minnesota was a woman found dead in her home, Klug, and another UCLA professor, who is safe.
A blog post appearing to be written by Sarkar calls Klug a "sick guy" and said the two had personal differences, according to the AP news agency.
"Your enemy is your enemy. But your friend can do a lot more harm. Be careful about whom you trust," the blog reads.
The UCLA campus remained under lockdown for hours on Wednesday as a massive police operation took place.
Officers found what could be a suicide note, the LA police chief said.
Colleagues of Klug's said he was a married father of two and described him as a kind, gentle person.
The Los Angeles Times reported that he was trying to develop a computer-generated virtual heart.
Staff and students barricaded themselves inside buildings during the lockdown on the massive UCLA campus.
About 43,000 students are enrolled there.
Classes were cancelled on Wednesday, but were expected to resume on Thursday.
