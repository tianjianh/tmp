[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gangmaster arrested during migrant worker raids in Fenland will not face any criminal charges but has had his licence revoked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nine people were arrested in a joint operation by Cambridgeshire Police and the Gangmaster Licensing Authority (GLA), on 15 October.
Roberto Mac, of March, was among them and has now had his bail cancelled.
The GLA said it had revoked the licence of his firm, Roberto Mac Ltd, for breaches of standards.
Mr Mac told the BBC he would appeal against the decision and complain about the investigation's impact on his family and staff.
A total of 13 people have been arrested under Operation Endeavour, which is investigating the exploitation of migrant workers.
Juris Valujevs, 35, of Turbus Road, King's Lynn, has been charged with acting as an unlicensed gangmaster; fraud by false representation; conspiring to commit immigration offences and blackmail.
Ivars Mezals, 27, of Conference Way, Wisbech, faces charges of acting as an unlicensed gangmaster, blackmail and fraud by false representation.
Both are due to appear at Cambridge Crown Court on 7 February.
