Alberto Cavasin: Leyton Orient 'not demonstrating quality' in League Two

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient manager Alberto Cavasin believes his side are better than their recent results in League Two suggest.

Orient lost to fellow strugglers Exeter on Tuesday, with only goal difference keeping them above the bottom two.
Asked by BBC Radio London if the O's are in a relegation battle, Cavasin replied: "Certainly, the table says so.
"We have to realise the fact that things aren't going well and understand the reasons to give more potential to the team and allow it to win."
Orient have become just the second side in Football League history to lose nine of their first 10 home league games in a season, matching Newport's run in 1970-71.
Italian Cavasin, who had been out of work for five years and had never previously worked in England before his appointment at the Matchroom Stadium, has won just two of his 10 games in all competitions since taking charge.
"Results on the pitch have not demonstrated the quality of the group," the 60-year-old said.
"I take responsibility for my role and my job is shared with all the group."
