Derby City Council chief Roger Kershaw dismissed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior Derby City Council officer, who was suspended for undisclosed reasons, has been dismissed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strategic director for resources Roger Kershaw was suspended in 2014 but an email leaked to BBC Derby has revealed he has been sacked.
The council has now confirmed the move but also said Mr Kershaw had appealed against it.
The authority has again refused to clarify why he faced disciplinary action in the first place.
The email from Labour council leader Ranjit Banwait said: "The strategic director for resources has been suspended and, following the IDC meeting on March 28, 2015, has now been summarily dismissed."
Acting chief executive Paul Robinson had overseen a senior management restructuring and should be appointed the "newly defined" chief executive - which includes the duties of Mr Kershaw's post - on a permanent basis, the email revealed.
The council has not commented further but opposition groups have criticised the idea of only having one candidate for the chief executive role.
Conservative leader Philip Hickson said the proposed appointment was "both inappropriate and highly questionable".
He said: "It should be advertised and a selection made on a fair and open competitive basis. It is potentially illegal."
