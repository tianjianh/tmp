Highland Council consults on public toilet charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Communities are to be asked whether a 50p charge should be applied for using Highland Council-run public toilets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Many of the conveniences can be used free of charge while others, including sites in Aviemore, Fort Augustus and Inverness, cost 20p.
The council has been making cuts in its public toilets budget without having to close sites.
But it has warned that toilets may have to close next year if it cannot achieve a fresh round of savings.
The local authority operates 102 toilets and 27 comfort schemes, which involve pubs, hotels and other businesses offering their facilities to the public, at an annual cost of Â£1.2m.
Community services committee chairman Allan Henderson said communities were being given a say in how toilets in their areas should be managed.
He said: "It is essential that the agreed savings are achieved and this cannot be done without raising charges, closing toilets or a combination of both.
"This is something that is important for local communities to consider and decide what is best for their community."
