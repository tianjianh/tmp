RSPCA rescuers abseiled down Nant Peris in Llanberis, Caernarfon and managed to grab the animal from where it was stranded 50ft (15m) from the top on Thursday.
They then returned to the surface, hauling the animal up in a sack.
Once back on land, the sheep was checked over and was deemed to be fine, although it was hungry and thirsty.
RSPCA inspector Chris Dunbar, who was the rope team leader, said it was a successful rescue.
"The top of the area where we set up was quite steep so extra precautions had to be taken," he said.
"The sheep was very thirsty and started to eat and drink straight away when we released it, but was fine."
