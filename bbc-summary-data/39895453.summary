Nadal, seeded fourth, beat the Belgian ninth seed 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 after Djokovic earlier had a walkover when Kei Nishikori withdrew with a wrist injury.
In the other half of the draw, Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas will play Dominic Thiem.
Third seed Simona Halep beat Anastasija Sevastova 6-2 6-3 in the women's semis.
The Romanian defending champion goes on to face France's Kristina Mladenovic - who saw off Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-4 7-6 (7-3) - in the final.
Nine-time French Open champion Nadal has lost his past seven matches against Djokovic stretching back to 2014, and trails the head-to-head 26-23 in their 49 meetings.
However, the Spaniard will go into Saturday's semi-final as the form player after taking his record on clay this year to 13-0 with an impressive win over Goffin.
Nadal, 30, broke the Belgian's resolve in the first-set tie-break and could have won more comfortably had he converted more than just two of 13 break points.
Djokovic is into his first semi-final since he won his opening tournament of the year in Doha, while Nishikori is struggling to be fit for next week's Rome Masters and the French Open in 10 days' time.
"I will plan to play Rome, but we'll see," said the Japanese player.
"I cannot promise to play or pull out right now. The French is more important."
Unseeded Cuevas is through to his first Masters 1000 semi-final following a 3-6 6-0 6-4 win over Germany's Alexander Zverev.
