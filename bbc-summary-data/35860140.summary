The 56-year-old man, from Essex, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash in a field off Burrows Lane, in the Middle Stoke area, on Sunday.
His next of kin have been informed. No-one else was in the aircraft.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) attended and are investigating the cause of the crash, which happened at about 16:18 GMT.
Louise Holloway, who lives nearby, was outside in the garden when she heard a "huge bang" and saw "a massive orange flash right across the sky".
"One man ran across the field but there was no way the pilot could have got out. It's really sad," she said.
Representatives from UK Power Networks and fire crews also attended.
