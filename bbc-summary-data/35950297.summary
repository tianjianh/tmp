Former Hearts and Kilmarnock midfielder Scott Robinson is hoping to rekindle his career after signing for Dunfermline Athletic as an amateur.

The 24-year-old had been released by Kilmarnock despite having signed a three-year contract in 2015.
"It gets me out there where people can see that I am fit enough to play, but my main objective is to do well and stay here," he told the Pars' website.
"If a contract is here to sign, I will be more than happy to sign it."
Robinson came through the youth ranks to become a first-team regular at Hearts but was released after their promotion to the Scottish Premiership last summer.
He was recruited by former Hearts manager Gary Locke at their top-flight rivals last summer but made only six starts and seven substitute appearances for Kilmarnock and played his last game as a late substitute against Motherwell in February.
"I left Kilmarnock through mutual consent - both parties were happy," said the former Scotland youth international.
"The manager that signed me unfortunately got the sack, which is really unfortunate for him, and it turned out that I wasn't wanted there either."
Dunfermline boss Allan Johnston had been impressed with Robertson's display in a development league win over Hamilton Academical.
"It just gives us a chance to look at him," he said. "He has played in the Premier League and at 24 he is still at a really good age as well."
A newspaper report had lined 17-year-old Dunfermline striker PJ Crossan with Celtic, Brighton and Nottingham Forest.
"Obviously agents put stuff in the press sometimes," said Johnston of the teenager who has only made two first-team appearances so ar.
"PJ is somebody that we want to keep. He is a good young player.
"He is still young and has still got a lot to learn, but we feel that this is the right place for him.
"You can see how much we like him and that is why he has been involved."
