Sebastian Zuchlinski was found injured in Davenport Street, Bolton, on 6 February and died at the scene.
He was dragged from a car and attacked by three men with machetes and knives as he lay on the floor, police said.
Tomasz Bubrowski, 39, was ordered to serve a minimum of 31 years in prison after being found guilty of murder at Bolton Crown Court.
Police said Mr Zuchlinski, known as Seba, was with his girlfriend's sister who was going to drive him home to change his footwear when their car was blocked by a Honda Civic.
Bubrowski, of Cavendish Gardens, Bolton, and two other armed men jumped out of the Honda and dragged him from the vehicle, the court heard.
Mr Zuchlinski endured a "sustained attack" which would have continued if it had not been for the bravery and intervention of a passing witness, police said.
A fourth man drove the trio away from the scene.
Det Insp John Mulvihill said it was "a savage and unprovoked attack that took the life of an unarmed man, who had made plans for a fun evening out with his girlfriend and her sister".
"The loss of Seba was one that his loved ones felt deeply and they still feel the impact of his death and miss him dearly," he added.
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said officers were still seeking the other men involved in the attack.
