Blackburn Rovers 4-2 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn came from a goal down to beat fellow strugglers Rotherham and earn their first league win of the season.

Danny Ward slotted the Millers in front but Rovers levelled when Craig Conway found the top corner from 20 yards out.
Conway teed up Marvin Emnes to stroke the hosts ahead before Ben Marshall bent in to double their lead just 15 seconds into the second half.
Ward headed his second at the near post to apply pressure but Emnes set up Sam Gallagher to tap in and seal victory.
The points lift Owen Coyle's side off the foot of the Championship table on goal difference, just a point below Rotherham who slip to 21st.
Ward's strikes were the first away goals of the season for Alan Stubbs' team, who also hit the bar when a Blackburn player headed on to his own bar from Greg Halford's long throw.
Rovers also struck the woodwork when Gallagher powered a header against the bar from a Conway cross.
The Millers' wretched record at Ewood Park continues, losing on 13 of their last 15 league visits - their last victory there coming in September 1979.
Blackburn boss Owen Coyle: "The most important thing today was to win.
"It was important we got the three points, but it was the manner of the performance and how we won.
"We started the game brilliantly, we could have been two goals up, and from that we concede a counter-attack goal from two very good players.
"It would have been easy to feel sorry for yourself but we continue to play the same way, whether we're 1-0 up or 1-0 down. Even at 3-2, it would have been easy to get nervous but they picked themselves up and we scored a wonderful fourth goal."
Rotherham manager Alan Stubbs: "First and foremost, we have to cut out basic, fundamental mistakes that we're making.
"I can't think of any goals that we've conceded where teams have completely cut us open. We're significantly contributing to our own downfall by making basic mistakes and we're getting punished.
"It's the manner of the goals that's the disappointing thing. You're just asking defenders to do their jobs."
