The 23-year-old moves to St Andrew's on a four-year deal having been under contract at Luton until next summer.
Blues manager Harry Redknapp bemoaned the lack of fit strikers as a "crazy situation" after losing Che Adams in Saturday's victory over Bristol City.
Vassell will go straight into Redknapp's squad for the home match with Bolton on Tuesday.
Having moved to Luton on a free transfer last summer, Vassell - a cousin of former Aston Villa and England striker Darius Vassell - scored 10 league goals for the Hatters in 42 appearances last season.
"I don't think any defence enjoy facing pace," said Vassell. "That's my main asset - getting in behind and being a defender's nightmare."
He will provide Redknapp with another option up front with Lukas Jutkiewicz also missing with a calf problem.
Vassell, who graduated through the youth ranks at Plymouth, becomes Birmingham's fifth summer signing.
"The club tried absolutely everything to keep hold of him," Luton boss Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio. "We had been in negotiations, trying to get him to sign a contract and we turned down a number of offers.
"But when a player has one year left on his contract it's difficult to let it run down - we would have turned down pretty much any offer, unless it was absurd, if he had more than one year left on his contract.
"It's not something we wanted to do, but it got to a point where he categorically said he wasn't going to sign a contract."
