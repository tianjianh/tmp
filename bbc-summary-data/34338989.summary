The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) grant is a major contribution to the Kirkcudbright Art Gallery project.
Kirkcudbright's town hall will be redeveloped to house "nationally significant" collections.
Work by artists including the Glasgow Boys and the Scottish Colourists could be among the exhibitions on display.
A Viking hoard of more than 100 items of gold and silver, which was found nearby, may also join the collections.
The overall cost of the project is expected to be just over £3.1m. The HLF has agreed to a £931,200 grant.
Lucy Casot, head of the HLF in Scotland, said the "transformational" plans would give Kirkcudbright a gallery worthy of the "exceptional" art works it will house.
She added: "The future of the historic town hall has been secured and not only will it attract more tourists to the area but will benefit the wider community as they're encouraged to explore and enjoy the area's rich art heritage."
Work is expected to start on the gallery in spring 2016 and it is scheduled to open in summer 2017.
Councillor Tom McAughtrie, of Dumfries and Galloway Council, said: "Given the growth of cultural tourism, the Kirkcudbright art gallery project offers our region significant, long-term and sustainable economic impact.
"This award from the Heritage Lottery Fund is very exciting as it will enable us to develop a fabulous facility for the people of Dumfries and Galloway and for visitors to our region."
