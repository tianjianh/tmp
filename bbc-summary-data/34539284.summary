Port Vale keeper Jak Alnwick says his mum will not be able to watch when he faces a Peterborough United side with elder brother Ben in goal.

Jak and Ben will be on opposing sides for the first time on Saturday.
"My dad switches and goes to the game closest to Newcastle, so for us to be on the same pitch he'll be delighted," 22-year-old Jak told BBC Radio Stoke.
"My mum won't be coming as she gets too nervous. She'll have a heart attack with both of us on the same pitch."
He continued: "It'll still be a special day, even for those that aren't coming, just to see both the names on the same teamsheet."
Jak has made 16 appearances since moving to Vale Park from Newcastle United and signed a two-and-a-half year contract on Thursday.
His 28-year-old brother commended Jak's character for "making a career for himself", but said he is more focused on the result than playing against his sibling.
"I'm trying not to think too much about it," the Peterborough keeper told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. "I don't want to get wrapped up in it or because it's my brother or having to do anything different.
"It's another game for me, I still want to win, nothing changes - but it'd be nice if Jak could do well and we could still get the win."
Former Sunderland and Tottenham youngster Ben, who has played for 12 clubs in his career, joined Posh in 2014 after leaving Leyton Orient for personal reasons.
And Jak says he looks up to his elder brother for career advice, the pair speaking to each other after every game.
He added: "As a lot of people will see he's made a lot of mistakes in his career and life - he passes that down and I don't have to make those mistakes.
"Every game he'll ring me after we've seen the goals, and we'll discuss little things. It's nice for him to pass it down."
