Team Muirhead defeated Lauren Gray's rink 8-4 before brother Glen was part of the victorious men's rink.
The victory in Perth means Team Muirhead will represent Scotland in the World Women's Curling Championships in Canada next month.
"We were unbeaten all week, we came out with a really solid second half in the final," Muirhead told BBC Scotland.
"That's when you need to play well, these championship games."
It's the sixth time Muirhead has become Scottish champion, and the fourth time Brewster has won the title. Team Brewster will represent Scotland in the World Championships in Switzerland in April.
Brewster said: "We knew we had a hard game there, we knew we had to bring our A game, and we did. We didn't miss much in that game.
"Five years ago I took three of the boys I've just played to the World Championships and we won silver, and none of us had World Championship experience. I've got that experience and hopefully we can go there and do ourselves credit."
