Severe flooding has caused widespread disruption across parts of central England, with rail passengers stranded and many schools shut.

British Transport Police formed human barriers in front of the main concourse at London Euston after trains between Rugby and Milton Keynes were cancelled.
Passengers were warned people could be killed as some had fallen from earlier trains on Wednesday.
A total of 46 flood warnings are in place across England and Wales.
More heavy rainfall is expected in the Midlands on Thursday, with 5-10mm forecast.
Train operator London Midland said the severe flooding in several areas had caused problems with signalling and electrical equipment, leaving it unable to run trains between Rugby and Milton Keynes.
A London Midland spokesman said: "Once the floodwater subsides we are still faced with trains and train crew out of place across the network."
Network Rail said flooding on train lines around Daventry, Rugby and Wolverton had delayed services between Birmingham New Street and London Euston.
Trains on the West Coast Mainline were also running at reduced speeds due to heavy flooding.
Fourteen schools were closed in Warwickshire and and a number of people were rescued from trapped cars by firefighters due to rising floodwater.
Rose Plumbley, headteacher of Leamington Hastings C of E Academy in Rugby, said many pupils and staff had not managed to get into school.
"We're in the Leam Valley and it's flooded on both roads into school," she said.
"Some pupils did manage to get in but it became very clear that many weren't going to make it in. We decided to close so that the children can get home in daylight safely."
Firefighters rescued drivers from stranded vehicles in Great Alne, Wolston, Baginton and Princethorpe.
There were also reports of cars stuck in Kenilworth Ford.
Flood warnings are in place for the River Dene at Walton, River Sherbourne at Allesley, River Stour at Mitford Bridge, Shipston on Stour and Tredington, River Stour from Halford to Clifford Chambers and River Alne at Bird in Hand.
