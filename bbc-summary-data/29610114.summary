'I blacked-up, but I'm not racist'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"If you came from outer space and you saw blacked-up Morris dancers you would think, 'they are mimicking black people', but it is a knee-jerk reaction to call it racist."

Meet 26-year-old Melanie Biggs who has spent the last 15 years of her life Morris dancing, sometimes wearing black paint on her face.
On occasions the dance groups she has been a part of were labelled "racist", but Melanie has claimed they were not being "disrespectful" because it is an English tradition.
"I never felt bad. I just felt that people were being ignorant," she said.
It is not often Morris dancers are in the news, but that was before a photograph emerged showing the Prime Minister David Cameron standing with his young daughter and a group of blacked-up Morris dancers.
Anti-discrimination campaigners have told Newsbeat that the practice is "out of date" and "deeply hurtful" to the millions of black people living in modern Britain.
Mr Cameron's official spokesman has refused to answer questions about the picture, which was taken at the Banbury Folk Festival on Saturday.
However, people like Melanie insist blacking-up has no racial connotations.
"In the 16th Century, Morris dancing was banned," she explained. "This was a big problem for many poor people who were out of work and used to dance for money.
"The beggars started covering their faces in soot so they could continue dancing without being recognised. Blacking-up is now commonly accepted as a form of disguise."
"I have danced with people from all sorts of cultures including an Arab man who didn't black up because he didn't need to.
"Some teams have chosen not to black-up their faces because of political correctness, but I believe it is a part of English tradition which deserves its place in history."
However, while the charity Show Racism the Red Card has accepted the importance of celebrating traditional events it has said blacking up is no longer "relevant".
A spokesperson said: "The use of blackface is an out-of-date practice demonstrating that public attitudes have moved on and crude caricatures of black people should be considered unacceptable in modern day Britain."
When asked about the Prime Minister's decision to pose for a photo with blacked-up Morris dancers, Melanie was not concerned.
"I just think it's a storm in a teacup," she said. "The Prime Minister is just having a photo with his family."
The UK's leading independent race equality think-tank has said blacking-up is an example of the UK not doing enough to break down racial stereotypes.
Dr Omar Khan, Director of the Runnymede Trust, said: "The racist stereotypes associated with blacking-up may be less explicit in 2014, but inequalities in education, the labour market, and criminal justice indicate that racial discrimination persists.
"If we are serious about offering equal opportunities, we must do more to combat stereotypes, whether that is blacking-up or in employment."
