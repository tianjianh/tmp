The islands in the South China Sea are claimed by several Asian countries.
One song, entitled "This is the man I want to marry", tells the story of a soldier working on land reclamation projects.
The character had to postpone his wedding so many times that his bride came to the island to marry him.
The footage is taken from a television report and the audio drops out a short way in.
