Denbigh Victorian hospital put on market for £2.25m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of a former Victorian asylum in north Wales have put it on the market for potential redevelopment with a £2.25m price tag.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes after Denbighshire council was granted permission to compulsorily purchase the former North Wales Hospital in Denbigh.
Owner Freemont (Denbigh) Ltd had opposed the compulsory purchase.
There has been a long-running dispute between both sides concerned about the future of the historical building.
The Rightmove website advert said the council "does not intend to develop the site but to work with a third party/developer that will".
The council had agreed to pass ownership of the building to the North Wales Building Preservation Trust, a non profit-making organisation which will receive support from the Princes Regeneration Trust.
The property is set for auction later this month.
A Denbighshire council spokesperson said the owners had the right to try to sell it as the hospital site has still not been transferred into the ownership of the council.
He said the authority would still continue with the compulsory purchase process.
"The High Court's ruling in March means that we are one step closer to handing over the site to the trust.
"However, there are many issues to be resolved before the council can take ownership and for the council to pass the ownership on to the trust.
"If the site is sold in the meantime, the council would need to negotiate with the new owner."
