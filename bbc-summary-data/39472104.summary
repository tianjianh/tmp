Nicola Sturgeon said the move by Xilinx Inc would create 12 new jobs and protect 30 existing roles.
The venture is being supported by a Â£1m research and development grant through Scottish Enterprise.
Ms Sturgeon made the announcement as she prepared to visit the US to promote trade and investment.
Xilinx Scotland will develop communications technologies, particularly around 5G, and aims to establish itself as a centre of excellence.
Ms Sturgeon said: "The USA is Scotland's top source of inward investment and Xilinx Inc is another example of a leading technology company harnessing our highly educated and skilled workforce.
"This is fantastic news for this specialist sector in Scotland with new jobs being created and existing ones protected.
"It also demonstrates our strength and expertise in developing these state-of-the-art technologies."
She added: "We are committed to building on these successes and attracting more companies to invest and expand here.
"That is why next week I'll travel to the United States to promote trade and investment between our two countries."
