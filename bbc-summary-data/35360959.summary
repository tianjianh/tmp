Defender Ward, 31, joins on a two-and-a-half year contract and links up with Paul Lambert after a spell at Norwich.
Graham, 30, is expected to feature against Charlton on Saturday, but the striker is ineligible to play in the FA Cup fourth-round fixture with Oxford.
"I hope we can get off to a flying start," said Graham.
"The transfer embargo has been lifted, so they want to sign players and move the club forward," Graham he told the Rovers website.
Rovers have now signed four players in the January window, along with Simeon Jackson and Elliott Bennett.
Their transfer embargo for breaking Financial Fair Play rules was lifted by the Football League at the start of December 2015.
Ward, who spent three years at Carrow Road before joining Bournemouth in 2013, said he was looking forward to working under Lambert again.
"Paul Lambert demands standards and he definitely brought mine up a few notches at Norwich and that's something I want to get back to on a regular basis," he said.
