The Cowes floating bridge worker was taken to hospital with suspected head and leg injuries just before 19:00 BST.
The driver of the car, who is believed to have accelerated by accident on to the bridge, was treated by paramedics at the scene.
Isle of Wight Council said the chain ferry was "currently suspended until further notice".
The statement added that it was "due to the vessel being damaged by a vehicle that drove into it".
The floating bridge provides a foot passenger and vehicle link across the River Medina between Cowes and East Cowes.
The closure is expected to cause disruption for the start of the annual Cowes Week on Saturday.
