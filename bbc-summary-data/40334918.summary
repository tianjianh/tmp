All-Ireland SFC qualifiers: GAA state no grounds for Antrim replay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The GAA have confirmed there will be no replay of Antrim's All-Ireland SFC qualifier defeat by Sligo despite a query over the number of subs used.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were reports Sligo used seven substitutes, one more than is allowed, during their six-point win over the saffrons in Saturday's first round tie.
However GAA spokesman Alan Milton told BBC Sport "nothing untoward" had taken place on the Sligo bench.
He explained one of the Sligo changes was officially listed as a blood sub.
The times and venues for Round 2A of the qualifiers, including Derry's trip to Mayo, will be confirmed on Tuesday.
