[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former head teacher 'abused boy during reading lessons'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former East Yorkshire primary school head teacher abused a boy during reading lessons, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clifford Stott, 69, of Rise Road, Skirlaugh, is accused of abusing two boys during the 1970s at Paull Primary School and Sproatley Endowed School.
One alleged victim told Hull Crown Court he was indecently assaulted as he sat on Mr Stott's lap while reading.
Mr Stott, who denies eight sexual offences, is also said to have got into bed with the boy during a school trip.
One of the two alleged victims told the court how Mr Stott would take individual children to a reading corner and sit them on his lap.
He said that during these sessions the teacher indecently assaulted him on more than one occasion.
The witness also said he was made to share a twin bedroom with Mr Stott while away on a school trip.
Asked by prosecutor Patrick Palmer what he thought of the alleged demand, he replied: "I just did what I was told."
Another witness, not an alleged victim but giving evidence to the court, said he too had been made to share a bed with Mr Stott during a school trip, while Mr Stott was head teacher at Sproatley Endowed School.
He said that after he fell ill on the trip he went to ask for help and Mr Stott had taken him back to his bedroom and got in to bed with him.
"I didn't think that at nine years old it was appropriate," he said.
Asked by defence barrister Bernard Gateshill whether he could have been mistaken, the witness said: "No, I told my mother that it had happened."
Mr Stott denies five charges of indecent assault against one child, two charges of indecent assault against a second child and one charge of indecency.
The trial continues.
