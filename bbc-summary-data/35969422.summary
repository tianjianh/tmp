[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cattle attack widow Glenis Freeman awarded compensation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A walker who was seriously injured in a cattle attack that killed her husband has been awarded "significant" damages.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glenis Freeman, from Leicestershire, was attacked in a field in Stanford-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire in 2010. Her husband Roger, 63, died in the stampede.
Mrs Freeman was hospitalised for three weeks with broken ribs and a ruptured spleen.
The owner of the cattle was found not guilty of manslaughter.
A spokesman for Nelsons Solicitors said the settlement was for a "significant" amount.
A bull named Moonriver Zac Pi, which was held in the field along with a herd of cows, was destroyed immediately after the attack.
But the trial was told there was some confusion over whether the couple were attacked by the bull or a cow.
Mrs Freeman told police she believed an animal with horns attacked her after she tried to defend her husband from it, however the court was told the bull did not have horns.
She said the attack was "like a nightmare".
"I didn't know what to do. I tried to help Roger but the bull butted me in the chest.
"I woke up a week later in hospital where I was told that I had needed to have emergency surgery. My children told me that, although I had escaped, Roger hadn't made it.
"If only there had been a sign up saying there was a bull in the field, we wouldn't have gone into the field, and Roger would still be alive today."
