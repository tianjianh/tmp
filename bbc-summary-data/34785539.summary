The dairy farmer from South Petherwin played 13 seasons at Polson Bridge and has been helping coach the club's colts section for the past few years.
Tucker's appointment comes a day after Mike Lewis stepped down from the job after being offered a different role.
Lewis, who took over in the summer after Neil Bayliss left due to budget cuts, led Launceston to eight defeats from eight games in National Two South.
"I'm kind of thinking what the heck have I let myself in for, but I shall be very proud when I lead the team out for the first time. I'm determined to 're-Launceston-ise' Launceston Rugby Club," Tucker told the club website.
"I want the boys to put some pride back into their shirts and do themselves justice and try to draw back some excitement from the town and the rugby community. I want to bring back some old spirit - but let's call it new spirit.
"As a player I was up for any challenge. My mind doesn't work around the word 'relegation'. As a coach I'm taking that challenge on. If we can avoid going down a league that would be a supreme achievement. That's not a challenge given to me by the club, that's a challenge I have set myself."
