[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Burgess made a winning return to rugby league in his first competitive game since the rugby union World Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cross-code convert impressed for South Sydney Rabbitohs in their 42-10 victory over Sydney Roosters in the National Rugby League.
The 27-year-old, who played for Bath and England in 2015, said: "It's good to be back. I'm happy to get the win."
Sam's namesake Joe Burgess, a former Wigan Warriors player, scored two tries on his debut for the Roosters.
Sam Burgess rejoined the Rabbitohs after cutting short his time in union following England's ill-fated World Cup campaign.
He was part of the squad eliminated at the group stage, playing in the tournament hosts' crucial 28-25 defeat by Wales.
Burgess returned to rugby league because his "heart wasn't in" union and he felt he was fighting a losing battle in the 15-man game.
He played 21 times for Bath after joining them from Rabbitohs in October 2014.
