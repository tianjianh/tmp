The 30-year-old Wales international's previous deal was set to expire at the end of the season.
Edwards has made 22 appearances this term and scored four goals, including the first in Wolves' 2-1 win at QPR on Thursday.
"I am both proud and excited to have agreed a deal to extend my stay at this great club," said Edwards.
He told the club website: "It is great that the manager [Paul Lambert] wanted to get this deal sorted out and now it is up to me to reward him on the pitch with my performances."
By signing a new contract until 2019, Edwards should pass the milestone of spending 10 years at Molineux, having joined from Luton in January 2008.
