Richard Alden, 53, from Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, was detained on Saturday when Grace Kinyanjui, 42, died after a gun she was holding apparently went off accidentally, according to his lawyer.
Mr Alden took Ms Kinyanjui to hospital but she was pronounced dead on arrival.
He is being held until Friday while police carry out a murder investigation.
His lawyer Evans Monari said: "From what I hear, she was taking pictures, 'selfies', with a gun and it went off."
He added the incident involved a pistol and that it went off while Ms Kinyanjui was at Mr Alden's house in the Karen district of Nairobi helping him move.
"Richard says he is not responsible," Mr Monari said. "The girl shot herself by accident."
Police launched a murder inquiry after doctors reportedly found Ms Kinyanjui had suffered stab wounds and a broken finger and thumb.
Police have alleged Mr Alden and Ms Kinyanjui, who ran a security firm, were in a relationship. Mr Alden lives in Nairobi with his wife Martine and has three adult children.
Mrs Alden, who was away at the weekend, flew in from London to attend the hearing.
In court, Mr Monari told the judge: "The respondent is very disturbed by what happened because the person who lost her life is a friend.
"She actually shot herself. There is no evidence to date that the accused played any part in what happened."
No charges have been filed in the case.
The results of a post-mortem examination and ballistic tests are expected to be announced in court on Friday.
