The History in Heels project will highlight untold stories of women from Manx history through a series of pop-up displays and events.
An MNH spokeswoman said the 10-month project will let people "follow in the footsteps of the women who made Mann".
It will run at seven MNH site between March and December 2015.
Amongst those featured will be the stories of internees, beauty queens, TT racers and politicians.
Co-curator Jude Dicken said the displays will take a "fresh and surprising approach to some of the remarkable island women and their personal histories".
She said: "We want to introduce these women to our visitors, get them to hear their voices and think about their stories."
History in Heels also marks the centenary of the National Federation of Women's Institutes and celebrates the 65th anniversary of the formation of the Isle of Man Women's Institute.
The first pop-up display will take place at Castle Rushen on 8 March to mark International Women's Day.
