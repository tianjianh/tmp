Jason Gates, 36, who was reported missing on 17 March, was seen in Aviemore and then near Drumnadrochit at Loch Ness.
The latest searches follow earlier efforts involving police, the RNLI and coastguard.
It is believed Mr Gates' dog was found last week near Drumnadrochit.
The dog was taken into the care of Police Scotland after it was involved in an incident at a farm near the village in which three sheep died.
Local residents and visitors to Drumnadrochit and the surrounding area have been asked to look out for Mr Gates.
Ch Insp Jennifer MacDonald said: "Although no public searches are being organised at this time, we would like to thank the public for their support to date and would appeal to local residents in the area to check outbuildings, sheds and holiday homes in case Jason has taken shelter locally.
"Also, we know the area is popular with walkers and would ask that anything that may assist the search effort is reported to police, even if it seems insignificant."
Mr Gates is described as being about 6ft 3in tall, of slim build, with short, cropped, greying hair and stubble.
It is not known what clothes he was wearing, but police said he was known to often wear black jeans, a T-shirt, a black padded jacket or a tweed jacket.
