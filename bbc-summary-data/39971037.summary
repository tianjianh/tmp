[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 20-year-old man has been stabbed to death in a shopping centre car park in east London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Four men were arrested on suspicion of murder not far from the scene, at the Brewery shopping centre car park in Romford.
Police and an air ambulance found the man at 16:30 BST on Thursday. He went to hospital but died an hour later.
Detectives believe there could be a large number of witnesses given the attack happened at a busy time of day.
Det Insp Jason Prendergast said: "The victim was found in the car park at [the] end of the shopping centre next to the cinema and restaurants, and we are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident."
The man has not been formally identified but his next of kin have been informed, Scotland Yard said.
The four men arrested are being questioned by police.
Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
