Plans have been lodged for a Â£3m dementia unit in Kelso which developers claim would create about 30 jobs.

The 18-bed Murray House facility would be built next to the Queen's House nursing home on Angraflat Road.
A design statement said about 30% of the Borders population was forecast to be over 60 within 20 years with rising demand for care services.
Subject to planning permission, it is hoped work could start in August and be completed by autumn 2018.
The new unit would be separate to the current home in order to meet the "different needs" of dementia residents.
The design statement said Queen's House's 60 staff, existing residents and families, as well as neighbours had all been consulted and were favourable to the "new and worthwhile development".
