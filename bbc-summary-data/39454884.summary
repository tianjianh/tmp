They say you can learn almost anything on YouTube these days and Scott Gregory is hoping the video sharing website holds the secrets to a perfect US Masters debut.

Gregory will tee off at Augusta National for the first time on Thursday after securing his place by winning the British Amateur Championship last summer.
Before even setting foot on the famous Georgia course, the 22-year-old from Waterlooville, Hampshire had his eyes glued to hours of footage from the past four years.
"I've watched a lot of clips on YouTube," he told BBC South Today. "I've got clips of all the pins from the past four years from every day.
"I know roughly where the pins will be as they don't change them too much from year-to-year. So, I've had a good idea of what kind of approach shots I need to work on in my practice rounds."
As well as staring at a screen, Gregory has also warmed-up for his Augusta bow with some on-course preparation.
Victory in the Georgia Cup over US amateur champion Curtis Luck following a play-off justified his decision to head out to the States three weeks before the Masters to acclimatise.
Along with Gregory and Luck, the three others amateurs competing at Augusta are Americans Brad Dalke and Stewart Hagestad, and 19-year-old Toto Gana from Chile.
Gregory is hoping for better fortunes than his mixed experience over two rounds of The Open at Royal Troon last July.
Having briefly held an early lead on four under par after 11 holes, he faded to shoot a first-round 78 and then missed the cut after a 73 in the second.
"I'm fortunate enough to have got all the excitement and hype of being at a major tournament out of the way," Gregory reflected.
"It's more normal now, so you just have to make sure you turn up and play golf and the sooner you get the thought of loads more people watching you, the easier it gets."
Gregory also hopes some wise words from 2013 US Open champion Justin Rose, who also learnt his trade as an amateur in Hampshire, will give him another invaluable Augusta insight.
"I'm hoping to pick up some tips from Justin," he said. "He's been great for my development being from the same area of the country and just seeing what he's gone on to achieve.
"I'm hoping to play the Par Three tournament with him before Thursday and he's out there doing what I want to do for the rest of my career."
