[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flash flood swept through the Borders town of Jedburgh as weather conditions deteriorated in parts of Scotland.

The town's square and High Street were submerged in floodwater when the Skip Running Burn burst its banks on Saturday evening.
About 40 firefighters were called to the scene from divisions across the Lothians and Borders.
The flooding came as forecasters warned that Scotland could expect more severe weather just before Christmas.
Scottish Borders Council issued flooding advice following heavy rainfall over Friday night and Saturday afternoon.
A number of homes and commercial properties were affected, although only one resident had to leave his home.
Flooding caused damage in the town when the burn previously overflowed in August 2012, but the council said this incident was not as severe.
In a statement, the local authority said: "Following the flooding in August last year, the council's work, including post incident assessments, clearly showed that flash flooding such as this can occur and the Skip Running Burn is particularly vulnerable to this type of event.
"SBC has plans in place to invest in improvements at the culvert mouth and it will continue to progress these."
Other areas have also been affected by poor weather conditions.
On Sunday, police closed the snow gates on the A9 south at Dalwhinnie for several hours, while motorists were advised to check with Traffic Scotland for up-to-date travel advice.
Forecasters expect to see rain still moving from south to north on Monday.
A yellow "be aware" warning is in force for snow, across high ground to the north of the central belt.
Forecasters said there could be some sleet or perhaps wet snow at lower levels at times.
The strongest winds are now likely on Tuesday, with gale or severe gale force south-westerly winds expected for the west coast, from Argyll northwards.
The current yellow warning for wind will now be in place for Tuesday only.
Christmas Day and Boxing Day are expected to be relatively calm, with showers in the west and the odd flake or sleet still possible at lower levels.
