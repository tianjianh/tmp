Rochdale 3-2 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One leaders Scunthorpe United suffered their third defeat of the season as Rochdale held on to win at Spotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron scored twice in the last 10 minutes to make a contest of it, but they left themselves with too much to do, having fallen 3-0 down midway through the second half.
The visitors were fortunate to go in only a goal down at half-time, a Dale lead deservedly earned in the 41st minute when Joe Thompson side-footed home Joe Bunney's delivery.
But Rochdale had also seen an Ian Henderson finish ruled out for handball, while Iron goalkeeper Luke Daniels had brilliantly saved Harrison McGahey's shot.
Keith Hill's team doubled their lead in the 53rd minute through Ollie Rathbone and appeared to have made the result safe when substitute Calvin Andrew made it three with 15 minutes remaining.
Substitute Tom Hopper's 81st-minute close-range finish offered Scunthorpe a glimmer of hope.
Graham Alexander's men then set up a tense finale when Josh Morris' free-kick was side-footed home by Neal Bishop shortly afterwards, but Rochdale hung on for a deserved victory.
