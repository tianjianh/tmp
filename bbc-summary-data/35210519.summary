Police were called by the ambulance service to an address on Dundonald Street at around 15.45 GMT following reports a man had been bitten by a dog.
The 22-year-old, yet to be officially identified, was treated by paramedics at the scene but subsequently died from his injuries, Lancashire Police said.
Police have not specified the breed of dog involved in the attack.
DI Jane Webb from Preston CID said: "This is a tragic incident in which a man has sadly died. Enquiries are on-going to establish the exact circumstances and my thoughts very much remain with his family, who are being supported by specially trained officers at this time."
Bunches of flowers were left at the scene, including two bouquets tied to a nearby lamppost.
The dog was taken from the address and put down by a vet.
