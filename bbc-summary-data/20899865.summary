The storm has led to power cuts in more than 60,000 homes, French TV reports.
Cyclone Dumile is sweeping southwards between Reunion and Madagascar. Winds are reaching 180 km/h (112mph).
Reunion's air traffic and shipping are at a standstill. So far there are no reports of serious injuries, but some roads have been flooded.
The storm is expected to intensify on Reunion later on Thursday, though the eye of it is forecast to remain offshore.
