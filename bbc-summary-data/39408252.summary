Police believe Roger and Christine Solik, from Abercynon, Rhondda Cynon Taff, were killed in an armed robbery at their farmland estate in the Kwazulu-Natal province in February.
The suspects are due before magistrates on Monday.
A 43-year-old man has already appeared in court charged with the couple's murder as well as kidnap and robbery.
The body of Mrs Solik, 57, originally from Mountain Ash, was found bound in the Inzinga river in Impendle, 50 miles (80km) from her home on 17 February.
Mr Solik, 66, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, was found dead almost two miles (3km) downstream from her three days later.
South African police said the latest arrests were the result of a "breakthrough" on Friday night.
They said the main suspect was arrested in Umlazi and further investigation led them to Impendle where two other suspects were arrested.
Police said they were found in possession of suspected stolen property and two unlicensed firearms, which will be sent for ballistic testing.
The Soliks moved to South Africa in 1981 after getting married in Wales the previous year.
