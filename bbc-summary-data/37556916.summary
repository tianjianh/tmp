Mark Venus: Coventry City caretaker boss says no time limit to finding the right man

Coventry City caretaker boss Mark Venus says there is no time limit in finding the right man to succeed Tony Mowbray.

Venus has so far enjoyed two wins in four days, since stepping up to take charge following Mowbray's departure.
It is a role he performed for three games when Mowbray left his previous club Middlesbrough - but it is not yet clear whether Venus may stop at City.
"I don't want to just go for the job if I can't do it properly and give them what they need," Venus told BBC Sport.
"There's no time schedule. It's however long it takes to get the right person. The board will take due diligence on the all the applicants.
"I'm privy to all the conversations with the board. I'm very much included. It's an ongoing process. We just have to take our time and pick the right candidate."
A suspension of betting by bookmakers triggered rumours of an announcement, but City have advised that will not happen this week.
Until coming to Coventry, Venus had not had a day-to-day coaching role since his brief caretaker role ended with Aitor Karanka's appointment following Mowbray's departure from Boro in October 2013.
When Mowbray then returned to football at Coventry in March 2015, his long-time number two Venus joined as technical director, in a scouting, not a training ground role.
"I've been out of the grass for two and three quarter years," Venus told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire. "I need to feel if I can be of benefit to the club. That's something I need to find out before I decide whether I can take the club further.
"It was really one of the low points of my career when Tony decided to resign. I'd hoped he could turn the club round that I'd maybe have a different role and that we'd build this club up again.
"It was not to be but, on a professional front, you have to readjust. It's a difficult time, but we have to move forward. The players have given me maximum effort. I can ask no more that."
After City's first League One win in 11 attempts this season, to lift themselves off the bottom of the League One table, Tuesday night's 3-1 win over former landlords Northampton Town saw them qualify for the second round of the EFL Trophy.
Following the postponement of this weekend's scheduled home game against Chesterfield due to international commitments, Coventry do not play again until visiting 18th-placed Charlton Athletic on 15 October, followed by successive home games against Oxford United and Rochdale.
And Venus hopes that, at a time when City's long-suffering fans remain disenchanted with the club's owners, they may have turned a corner.
"I understand the feelings the fans have got," he said. "But I want them to support the club. Everyone needs to get together. If we can get positive vibes, then they can enjoy their football."
