[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gatwick Express train death man 'next to warning notice'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was killed when he leaned out of a train window and hit his head on a gantry was standing next to a warning notice, a report has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Brown, from West Sussex, died on the Gatwick Express on 7 August.
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said it would investigate the clearance between the train and the signal gantry and measures to control risks from leaning out of windows.
It said a notice read: "Do not lean out of window when train is moving."
A preliminary report said the train from Gatwick Airport to London Victoria was travelling at about 60mph.
It said Mr Brown, 24, originally from East Grinstead, sustained fatal injuries near Balham in London.
The report noted witness evidence indicated Mr Brown was standing at a door, intended for the use of the train guard, which opened inwards and had a droplight window.
The notice was above the window, it added.
The RAIB found the distance between the train and gantry post to be 26cm (10.25in).
British Transport Police is treating the death as non-suspicious.
Mr Brown was described by friends as a "lifelong railway fanatic", had volunteered on the Bluebell Railway as a child and was working as an engineering technician with Hitachi Rail Europe in Bristol.
