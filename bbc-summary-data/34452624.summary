Valaya is one of India's best known designers and his clothes are often inspired by the opulence of the royal courts.
For this series of photographs, he made his models wear grand costumes designed by him and put them in "unstaged" chaotic settings of contemporary Delhi.
"The Indian capital has always been a seat of power and has a long history as the pivot of several empires. Today's Delhi... shows that its magic lives on its streets," Mr Valaya says.
The exhibition, titled Revisiting Beauty, is on at Delhi's Threshold Art Gallery until 20 October.
