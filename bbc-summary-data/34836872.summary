Worcester Warriors reserve full-back Ben Howard says he will keep showing director of rugby Dean Ryan he is worth a starting place in the first team.

The 22-year-old excelled in Saturday's 19-3 European Challenge Cup win over Stade Rochelais.
Chris Pennell, capped once by England, is Worcester's first-choice full-back.
"I haven't started a game this year and we're all just trying to show Dean what we can do," said Howard. "There's a lot of frustrated guys in that (cup) team."
Warriors' academy graduate and England Under-20 international Howard, who made his top-flight debut in September 2012, has come off the replacements bench in Warriors' last three Premiership matches.
"I've been lucky enough to be on the bench a few times which has been good - you're still around the squad all week," Howard told BBC Hereford & Worcester.
"A lot of the guys haven't even had that which is very tough - training all week and on a Friday and Saturday doing extra fitness rather than playing rugby."
When Pennell was injured last season, Howard took his chance, scoring six tries in 20 games as Warriors won promotion from the Championship.
"I'm aware I've got Chris ahead of me and know what a great player he is," said Howard.
"I've been used to that for a few years and I've got to just keep developing and continue to try to push my way to a starting spot."
