Neil Warnock's side are 20th in the table, just three points above the relegation zone.
But Gunnarsson insisted he and his teammates were far from troubled ahead of a busy festive period.
"There's no concern or panic about it right now," Icelandic international Gunnarsson said.
The Bluebirds face a tricky run of fixtures over the festive season with trips to Brentford on Boxing Day and high-flying Brighton on Friday, 30 December before Aston Villa visit Cardiff City Stadium on Monday, 2 January.
Cardiff supporters have seen some signs of improvement since Warnock succeeded Paul Trollope as manager in October but the Welsh side remain at the wrong end of the table.
Gunnarsson is confident of survival but warned it would take time and that consistency was key.
"We just have to keep working towards our aim and our aim is to push away from the relegation places," Gunnarsson added.
"It may take time, it probably will, but games are coming quickly now and we are going to have to get results if we are going to push away from the situation we are in.  We are desperate for points.
"But confidence is growing amongst the lads and since the new gaffer has come in, he's brought in some new players who are settling in. It's all about us pulling together and being more consistent.
"A lot of the lads are feeling more confident now than they were at the start of the season. The new manager has brought that with him, he has experience."
Gunnarsson believes Peter Whittingham will be vital in Cardiff's bid to escape relegation to League One.
Whittingham, 32, will have been a Cardiff player for a decade on 11 January and Gunnarsson said his experience would be important over the rest of the campaign.
"He's a legend at this club," Gunnarsson added.
"He's another player with experience and we have to rely on his input to pull out of this situation we are in.
"He's not the kind of guy who talks a lot, but he says the right things when they are needed. He's been here a long time, he knows what's expected of a Cardiff City player."
