The double-decker had been carrying 76 pupils on an end-of-term theme park trip when it reportedly took a wrong turn in Staines, Surrey.
It had been due to take the children to Thorpe Park, in Chertsey, when it crashed about two miles away.
None of the children on board the bus were seriously injured.
However, South East Coast Ambulance Service reported one person with a suspected back injury and a further 10 with minor injuries were taken to local hospitals.
A further 58 passengers were assessed and treated at the scene.
The bus had been carrying pupils from St John's School in Epping, Essex.
A statement on the school's website said the trip had been a reward for pupils awarded a high number of house points.
"We have spoken to a number of staff and we are able to confirm that there are no serious injuries although some students may have suffered some cuts and bruises," it said.
Reports of the crash, at the junction of Riverside Drive and Chertsey Lane, were first received just after 10:00 GMT,
The road is expected to remain closed for a significant period of time and motorists have been advised to avoid the area if possible.
Bus owner Galleon Travel said it was arranging for return travel to the school for some children, while some parents had already collected pupils.
