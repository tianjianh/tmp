Cases of scarlet fever in Wales have soared over the past three years, figures from Public Health Wales have shown.

A total of 1,234 cases were reported in 2015, compared to just 190 cases in 2013, but down slightly from 1,375 in 2014.
The infection comes into its peak season typically between late March and mid April.
Public Health Wales urged people to be aware of its symptoms.
These include a pink-red rash, high temperature and a red, swollen tongue, with the disease most common in children under 10.
Cases of scarlet fever in England and Wales taken together are now at their highest level for almost 50 years, according to Public Health England.
In Wales, 283 cases have been reported so far this year.
Dr Chris Williams, consultant epidemiologist for Public Health Wales, said: "Most cases of scarlet fever will clear up on their own, but it is still best to seek medical advice."
