Borders Railway: Future goals for new route drawn up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A list of proposals has been drawn up to enhance the long-term future of the Borders Railway - including extending the line to Carlisle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Borders Council is being asked to endorse the response to a consultation by Network Rail.
The Scotland Route Study will inform future infrastructure provision around the country between 2019 and 2029.
The council has drawn up a string of suggestions on how rail routes in the region could be improved.
They fall into a number of "key elements".
The proposed response to the consultation reiterates the council's support for extending the Borders Railway beyond its current terminus at Tweedbank.
It said that would build on the success the line has enjoyed since it opened.
The report added that such a development would provide "additional resilience" for East Coast and West Coast Main Lines in the event of problems.
It also stressed the move could give "further economic opportunities and social benefits for the south of Scotland".
Concerns about "service resilience" have also emerged over the first months of operation of the railway with reports of delays or cancellations.
The council is being advised to recommend the construction of "dynamic passing loops" to improve reliability.
This echoes a concern raised by the Campaign for Borders Railway about the constraints imposed by the amount of single-track on the route.
Parking provision at Tweedbank station and, to a lesser extent, Stow have also been raised as an issue.
An overflow car park has been provided at Tweedbank in an adjacent industrial estate but a longer term solution could "encourage further patronage".
Improvements to wi-fi provision have been flagged up as another area for investment.
The existing service has been described as "intermittent" and failing to "fully encourage" mobile working.
"The tourist market is very important to the Scottish Borders," the report stated.
"Every opportunity to enhance the tourist offering should be exploited," it added before listing a number of areas for improvement.
They include:
The final part of the proposals renews the council's backing for two new stations on the ECML at Reston and East Linton as "transformational for local communities".
It also recognises the success of the Borders Railway as encouraging hopes of reopening other lines.
It said some might not be suitable for redevelopment but cited the former route between Edinburgh and Peebles as one worth considering.
The full report will go before Scottish Borders Council on 22 March.
