Midfielder Lewis Cook, forward Max Gradel and defender Brad Smith all missed Saturday's 6-1 win against Hull.
Cook rolled an ankle while playing for England Under-20s, Gradel damaged a hamstring on Ivory Coast duty while Australian Smith has a foot injury.
Howe also confirmed Cook, 19, will see a specialist as part of his recovery.
The former Burnley manager had not revealed which players had been injured playing for their countries before the weekend's Premier League game against the Tigers.
"Lewis Cook was caught in a nasty-looking tackle through no fault of the opposing player," Howe told BBC Radio Solent.
"Scans have revealed it's quite a nasty one, so we're not sure on time-frames just yet and he is seeing a specialist.
"We don't think Max's hamstring pull is too serious and Brad took a really nasty whack on his foot, which we feared may have been broken.
"At the moment, it looks like it's possibly not, so we'll wait and see."
