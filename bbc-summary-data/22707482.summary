[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hurricane Barbara has been lashing parts of Mexico's Pacific coast after making landfall in the town of Santo Domingo Zanatapec, in Oaxaca state.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two people have been killed in the state, the authorities say - an American surfer and a young Mexican swept away by flood waters.
Fourteen fishermen were also reported missing at sea.
Barbara quickly lost strength over land but drenched coastal areas with rain, leading to flooding in some areas.
The hurricane came ashore some 130 km (80 miles) east of Salina Cruz, home to Mexico's biggest oil refinery.
A warning was issued for the stretch of coast between Puerto Angel and Barra de Tonala.
Thousands of people in Chiapas and Oaxaca states have been evacuated.  Roads have been closed and sea traffic suspended in the area.
The storm that preceded the hurricane caused floods in many coastal areas, including the resort city of Acapulco, further north.
The hurricane is expected to dissipate in the next 24 hours.
