Brian McKandie murder: Police follow new lines of inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the murder of Aberdeenshire handyman Brian McKandie have said they are following new lines of inquiry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes after an operation to question people in the area two weeks after he was last seen alive.
The 67-year-old was found beaten to death with a "heavy weapon" in his home in Rothienorman on Saturday 12 March.
Officers are still trying to trace two men seen with him at his home the previous day.
On Friday evening, officers from the murder inquiry team stopped cars in the area asking drivers to fill in questionnaires.
Earlier that day his brother made an emotional plea during a press conference for anyone with information about Mr McKandie's death to come forward.
William McKandie said: "We are finding this whole situation really hard to come to terms with. We have lost our brother and we just want to know what happened and why."
Detectives have released an image showing Mr McKandie at a bank in Turriff on 11 March.
Two men were reportedly seen speaking to Mr McKandie between 13:00 and 14:00 on the Friday before his body was found.
One of the men was said to be in his 50s and heavy set. The other was a younger man.
They were beside a burgundy or maroon estate car, possibly a Saab or Volvo.
Officers have also appealed for two men seen talking to Mr McKandie between 17:00 and 18:00 on the Friday. One was described as in his 20s, and the other in his 30s or 40s.
