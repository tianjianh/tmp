After Katie Zelem's first-minute opener for Liverpool, goals from Karen Carney, Fran Kirby, Drew Spence and Eniola Aluko put Chelsea 4-1 up at half-time.
Caroline Weir and Emma Lundh's second-half strikes gave the visitors hope.
But Kirby and Spence both added goals to restore the three-goal lead and keep pressure on leaders Manchester City.
Zelem, who netted twice in Liverpool's 3-2 loss at Notts County last time out, stunned the defending champions with a fine strike from range in the early stages.
But the floodgates opened after England winger Carney rounded the goalkeeper to level and the scoreline could have been bigger as Carney struck the crossbar with a free-kick late on.
Chelsea - who won 2-1 at Liverpool in their previous match - remain second, three points behind first-placed City, who have played a game more.
Emma Hayes' side face Arsenal in the Women's FA Cup Final at Wembley on Saturday, looking to defend the trophy they won for the first time last season.
Chelsea Ladies midfielder Drew Spence: "It was a bit like a basketball match, the way the goals were going in for both sides. I was pleased with my two goals.
"But we're disappointed we didn't manage the game better after coming from behind to go 4-1 in front by half-time. We've got to learn how to not concede before we turn on the gas.
"That's something for us to work on in training this week in the build up to the FA Cup final.
"We beat Arsenal 2-0 in the league recently but we can't have any complacency because of that, it's going to be a tough game."
Liverpool Ladies midfielder Caroline Weir: "Scoring three goals is fine, but if you concede six you can't expect anything out of a game.
"We made too many defensive errors and that's just not good enough against a team as good as Chelsea.
"This is a tough place to come, but it was so disappointing for us after making a great start with a brilliant goal by Katie Zelem.
"We conceded some poor goals after taking the lead, and going in at half-time 4-1 down we knew that wasn't good enough."
