Judo: Natalie Powell & Sally Conway win bronze in Paris

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Commonwealth champion Natalie Powell has won bronze at judo's Paris Grand Slam.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25 year-old from Merthyr Tydfil beat her British -78kg rival Gemma Gibbons in the head-to-head in France.
Powell's first Grand Slam medal will give her a further rankings boost over Gibbons as she bids to be Team GB's sole -78kg representative at the Rio Olympics in August.
Scotland's Sally Conway also won bronze in the -70kg class.
Conway, 29, did not have to fight her last two rounds because of opponent injury and disqualification.
