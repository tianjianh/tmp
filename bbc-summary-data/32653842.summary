County Championship: Wessels rescues Notts against Durham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Riki Wessels made 117 to save Notts from total collapse on the opening day of their Championship game at Durham.

They were reduced to 75-5 at lunch, and then 102-7, as the Durham pace attack fully utilised the helpful conditions.
But Vernon Philander (41) helped add 110 after being dropped at gully and Wessels hit 17 fours before he was last to go as Notts were all out for 245.
Chris Rushworth and John Hastings took three wickets each for Durham, who replied with 69-3 at stumps.
Notts chose not to include seam bowler Andy Carter in their side, despite his successful recent loan spell at Glamorgan, with Brett Hutton given only his second Championship opportunity by the club.
But he could only watch from the pavilion as their top order crumbled after the in-form Rushworth had Brendan Taylor and Alex Hales lbw with the new ball.
Mark Wood, recently in the Caribbean with England, capped an excellent morning for Durham with a rising delivery which had Samit Patel caught behind for 16.
But after Callum MacLeod failed to hold a difficult chance offered by Philander, he provided the support which was badly needed by Wessels, who was caught behind off a Wood no-ball on 32.
They were together for 32 overs before Philander fell to Hastings, but Wessels brought up his hundred off 153 balls shortly afterwards, the 16th of his career in first-class cricket.
Durham made a positive start to their innings before Mark Stoneman (44) was leg-before offering no stroke to an inswinger from Hutton (2-21), who won another lbw decision against nightwatchman Wood with the final ball of the day.
Nottinghamshire batsman Riki Wessels:
"I got great support from Vernon (Philander). He's so experienced and he took the pressure off.
"I've felt in good form and have had a few starts, so it was time I delivered.
"I got 90 here last year and have had 98 against Durham at Trent Bridge, so it was good to get over the line."
Durham seamer Mark Wood:
"It was disappointing to bowl that no-ball and to get out at the end when I wanted to do my job as nightwatchman.
"It has been a great experience being with England and I can understand why I didn't get picked (for the Tests).
"I felt a bit rusty at first after not playing, but I felt I got into a good rhythm later and hope to push on from here."
