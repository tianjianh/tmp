T in the Park plea to dump drugs in 'amnesty bins'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
T in the Park organisers are urging anyone with drugs at the festival to dump them in special bins around the site.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They said people who got rid of their drugs would not get into trouble.
The plea follows the deaths of two 17-year-olds at the festival campsite in separate incidents.
Police Scotland said the deaths were not suspicious. Officers are looking into the possibility that they were drug-related.
The 17-year-olds, named locally as Megan Bell from Seaham in County Durham and Peter MacCallum from Lochgilphead, Argyll, died on Friday.
Ch Supt Angela McLaren warned all festival-goers that there was "no safe way of taking drugs".
By Saturday afternoon, Police Scotland said there had been 23 arrests at the three-day event at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire. More than 80,000 people are expected to attend.
The teenagers who died are a 17-year-old male from the west of Scotland and a female of the same age from the north of England. They have not been named.
Festival organisers said they were "shocked and saddened" by the news.
There have been deaths in previous years at the festival, which moved to its new location in Perthshire last year.
A 36-year-old man was found dead in the toilets in 2015, and a 24-year-old man collapsed and died during the night in 2010.
