Mark Cookson, 42, was found dead at his flat in Leicester Road, Wigston on 25 March.
The footage is from an Arriva 48A bus as it travelled down Welford Road near the area where Mr Cookson was seen walking at 18:40 GMT on 22 March.
Police want to speak to any of the passengers pictured in the video.
Mr Cookson was last seen alive at the junction of Hillcrest Road and Welford Road in Wigston, Leicester.
Two men, aged 20 and 24, and a 49-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and released on police bail pending further enquiries.
Det Insp Simon Shuttleworth said: "I am keen to stress that none of the people in this footage have done anything wrong and are in no way under suspicion.
"However, they could have information which may prove vital to our enquiry."
Police said he was believed to have been wearing an olive green zip-up hooded top and blue jeans when he was last seen.
