The Clan had lost 5-2 in the away leg and had also lost both games against Group O leaders Vaxjo Lakers of Sweden.
Petr Taticek gave Ingolstadt the lead but Matt Keith glanced in Stefan Meyer's shot to level before Brendan Brooks added Clan's second.
Tomas Kubalik began a German comeback but Clan finished strongly for the win.
Chris Bruton put the Scots ahead before John Laliberte and Benedikt Schopper moved Ingolstadt in front once more.
But three late goals by Keith, Alex Leavitt and Marcus Gotz secured a historic win for Ryan Finnerty's Clan team.
Finnerty told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound: "It was a pretty emotional night, a pretty good night for the organisation and the incredible fan base.
We are going up against some stiff competition teams with 10-20 times the budget we have.
"We got beat bad in Sweden (10-2) and then we went to Germany and we were 2-2 with 10 minutes left and we lost last week 3-1 to the Swedes.
"We got better as the campaign went on, but it's a tough task playing the number-one rated team in Europe and they showed it that first night but I thought we matched them pretty well on home ice.
"It's exciting to watch the growth over the last few years and it's exciting where it's going."
