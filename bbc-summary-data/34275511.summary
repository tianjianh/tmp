An Afghan man has died after setting himself on fire at a West Australian detention centre, local media said.

The Department of Immigration told journalists a man from the detention centre died in hospital on Wednesday.
He had sustained burns to 90% of his body after setting himself on fire at the Yongah Hill centre the day before.
A refugee visa for the 40-year-old man, named by media as Ali Jafarri, was cancelled last year because of child molestation convictions in Australia.
Refugee advocates last month called for an inquiry into conditions at Yongah, after the death of a 27-year-old Afghan detainee who was attacked in a brawl at the centre.
The centre holds migrants seeking asylum and visa holders facing deportation for committing violent crimes.
Jafarri, who wrapped himself in a sheet and poured accelerant on himself, had been flown to the Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth.
Last year, he pleaded guilty to accessing child pornography at a public library, and had previously been convicted of six counts of an indecent act with a child.
Australia has adopted tough laws regarding people seeking asylum.
Anyone who arrives by boat is held on offshore detention centres in places such as Papua New Guinea and Nauru.
It also has a number of mainland detention centres, such as the one at Yongah Hill.
