A man was killed by a "single blow" to his face in a row at his work's Christmas party, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Wareham, 53, was punched by colleague Bradley Casey, of Thetford in Norfolk, at the end of a Bupa party in Harlow last year, the court was told.
The pair had taken cocaine before a scuffle when they went to look for a taxi, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.
Mr Casey, 21, who denies manslaughter, claimed he acted in self defence and his actions were "fair and reasonable".
Mr Casey and Mr Wareham had both been at the Bupa Healthcare festive party at the Park Inn Hotel in Harrow on 12 December last year.
Prosecutor Peter Clark said: "It turned unexpectedly nasty after both, with another colleague, had decided they would move on to a different venue to continue drinking.
"Initially, there was no problem at all but there came a time when Billy Wareham was punched, a single blow to the face causing him to fall straight backwards, cracking his head on the pavement, knocking him out cold."
An ambulance took Mr Wareham to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, before he was transferred to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, the court heard.
He died on 13 December, the day after the party.
When interviewed, Mr Casey told police Mr Wareham had tried to persuade him to take cocaine and he refused, the court heard.
Mr Casey, formerly of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, claimed Mr Wareham also tried to force a cigarette into his mouth.
The third man, Stephen Boyce, told jurors: "There appeared to be a bit of a scuffle... I saw Billy laying on the floor. He was on his back.
"I couldn't find Casey, I couldn't see him, he'd gone."
The trial is due to continue on Wednesday.
