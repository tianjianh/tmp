[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 0-1 Milton Keynes Dons (aet)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brilliant 25-yard strike from on-loan midfielder Gboly Ariyibi deep into extra-time handed MK Dons a narrow EFL Cup win at Forest Green.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first-round tie looked to be heading for penalties until the 22-year-old, on loan from Nottingham Forest, curled a delightful effort beyond goalkeeper Sam Russell in the 110th minute.
There had been little to choose between the sides in normal time with substitute Shamir Mullings forcing Dons keeper Lee Nicholls into a decent save in the 75th minute before having a header blocked on the line moments later.
For the visitors, Ed Upson fizzed an effort just wide and Aaron Tshibola forced a decent save from Russell.
Extra-time saw Rovers go close to breaking the deadlock in the 105th minute when substitute Scott Laird crashed a header against the crossbar from just eight yards.
And even after the visitors had taken the lead, Mark Cooper's men had enough chances to win the game with Liam Noble and Lee Collins both being denied by the keeper before Mullings pushed an effort inches wide in the final seconds.
