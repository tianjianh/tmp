General Motors is recalling nearly half a million vehicles in the US amid concerns over faulty air bags and other issues, the company has said.

Among the 428,211 vehicles recalled on Friday are the Chevrolet Cruze, Silverado and GMC Sierra.
Problems in the vehicles' air bag mechanism risk shooting pieces of metal into the cabin or keeping the air bags from deploying, the company warned.
In 2014, GM has issued 48 separate recalls for 20 million vehicles total.
"The inflator in the driver's front air bag may rupture and/or the air bag may not inflate during air bag deployment," the company wrote in a statement listing the models and model years subject to the recall.
"A rupture could propel metal pieces of the inflator into the vehicle cabin, possibly striking and seriously injuring the driver or other vehicle occupants. Additionally, if the inflator does not inflate the air bag, there is an increased risk of injury to the driver."
The company said it was aware of one injury stemming from the issue.
Other issues cited in the four recalls announced on Friday include a transfer case failure which could allow a vehicle to lose all power to its wheels while in motion.
On 16 June, GM announced it would recall 3.16 million cars in the US because of ignition switch problems.
Earlier this month, an additional 500,000 Chevrolet Camaro cars were recalled after GM found fault with the ignition system.
In March, 2.6 million cars were also recalled because of a faulty ignition switch.
Earlier in June, the company raised its expected second-quarter charge for recall expenses to $700m (Â£411m), up from $400m.
In May, the company was fined $35m for failing to address defects which have been linked to 13 deaths.
GM has now recalled nearly 20 million vehicles in the US this year - more than the carmaker sold in 2013.
Previous recalls have involved possibly faulty seat belts, transmissions and air bags, as well as potential fire issues.
The company has set up a website where consumers can check if their vehicles have been recalled.
