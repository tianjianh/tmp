Commonwealth Games silver medallist Stephanie Inglis remains in a coma after the accident earlier this month.
She has since developed pneumonia and a decision was made to fly her to Bangkok where there is a hospital equipped to deal with the infection and the coma.
The 27-year-old from Inverness had been teaching in Vietnam.
Following the accident on 10 May, an appeal to raise money to cover the cost of her care has so far raised more than Â£230,000.
Family friend and judo player Khalid Gehlan, also from Inverness, said efforts to fly Ms Inglis to Thailand were hampered by issues affecting two aircraft and a tropical storm.
She has since been put on a flight which was expected to take about an hour and half to reach Bangkok.
The accident is reported to have happened when her skirt caught in the wheel of the motorbike.
She was being taxied by motorbike to a school in Ha Long, where she had been teaching English for the past four months.
Ms Inglis won her silver medal at Glasgow 2014.
