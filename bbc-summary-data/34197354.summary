Liam Sellen, 14, and his 16-year-old brother Tyler pursued Matthew Keough after he left Sally Campion dying in her bedroom in Bishop's Stortford.
At a ceremony at St Albans Crown Court, Judge Andrew Bright QC praised their "public spiritedness and courage".
Tyler said he was "taught to not walk away from bullies".
Matthew Keough, 44, of no fixed address, inflicted 41 separate injuries on Sally Campion, 45, on Bartholomew Road last July. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 22 years.
Liam, Tyler, their mother Susan Brinkworth and other neighbours came out of their homes after hearing loud bangs, as Keough first smashed the front door and then broke the front window and climbed in.
The light was on in Ms Campion's bedroom and they witnessed the blows delivered in silhouette through a blind as her screams rang out.
Soon after Keough left the front door. Tyler, who was 15 at the time, said: "He looked into my eyes, I looked into his. He had no expression on his face like he didn't care.
"I was taught to not walk away from bullies, and I just thought he was another bully."
Tyler and Liam then chased Keough through the town centre before flagging down a police car. He was arrested at the train station.
Judge Bright, who awarded the boys a Â£350 reward, said: "Tyler and Liam showed great courage and presence of mind.
"Liam returned to a street where the defendant's flip-flops had come off and made sure nobody touched them until the police arrived."
The boys' mother, Susan Brinkworth, said: "I'm really, really proud of the boys. It probably was a silly thing to do in hindsight because they could have been seriously hurt, but at least they captured the guy who did this".
