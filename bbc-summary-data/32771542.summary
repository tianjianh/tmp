Boston 'slavery' inquiry needs stepping up, says commissioner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK anti-slavery commissioner says more investigation is needed of what he describes as "modern slavery" in south Lincolnshire's agriculture sector.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Hyland visited Boston to set up a taskforce to tackle the problem after requests from local councils.
He said victims who come forward would be supported and anyone found to be exploiting them will be prosecuted.
Those found guilty can face life imprisonment under the terms of the new Modern Slavery Bill.
Mr Hyland said: "I'm confident that there are cases here in the Boston area but I think there's a lot of investigation to be done.
"We need to actually look at the whole intelligence picture and look at the best way at dealing with these issues."
He said it was likely international organised crime groups were behind the problem.
Mr Hyland said victims tend to be moved around the UK and were often beaten and sexually abused.
