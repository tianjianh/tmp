Real Madrid do not know when Gareth Bale will return from injury - with the Champions League final in his home city of Cardiff just three weeks away.

The Wales international forward, 27, has not played since tearing a calf muscle against Barcelona on 23 April.
La Liga title favourites Real face Juventus in the 3 June European final.
"We have to take it day by day but for now he's not with us and I don't know when he will be, but I hope it's soon," said Real boss Zinedine Zidane.
Real have three La Liga games remaining this season, starting with Sunday's home match with Sevilla (19:00 BST).
They are second to Barcelona - who visit Las Palmas at the same time - on the head-to-head rule, but have a game in hand.
