The cute little baby panda was actually born a month ago and it was all caught on CCTV.
The keepers have been monitoring the pair closely and say the cub is growing well but doesn't have a name yet.
It was announced last month that giant pandas had been removed from the list of "endangered" species.
Take a look at our video to see giant panda, Yaya, holding her little cub.
