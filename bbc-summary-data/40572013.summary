Britain's Murray and Swiss Hingis, who only announced their partnership last week, won 6-3 6-4 against Czech pair Roman Jebavy and Lucie Hradecka.
The match was twice stopped by rain before Murray, 31, and Hingis, 36, won in one hour and 11 minutes.
Next they could face British pair Ken Skupski and Jocelyn Rae.
Skupski and Rae meet 12th seeds Max Mirnyi and Ekaterina Makarova in their third-round match.
Both Murray and Hingis have a rich pedigree in doubles competitions and linked up when she approached the Scot after ending her partnership with India's Leander Paes.

The pair have instantly struck up an understanding and looked at ease - smiling after virtually every point - as they cruised past 16th seeds Jebavy and Hradecka.
Murray won the mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 2007 alongside Serbia's Jelena Jankovic, then went on to claim the men's doubles titles at the Australian Open and US Open last year with Brazil's Bruno Soares.
Hingis has won five Grand Slam singles titles - including at Wimbledon in 1997 - 12 Grand Slam women's doubles and a further five Grand Slam mixed doubles competitions.
