The 21-year-old right-armer took five wickets on his first-class debut against tourists Pakistan last month.
Barbados-born Archer has since featured in four T20 Blast and three One-Day Cup matches, and took 5-42 as Sussex lost to Somerset on Saturday.
"Jofra is an incredibly exciting talent with both bat and ball," Sussex head coach Mark Davis said.
