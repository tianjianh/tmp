[SN]TITLE[SN]
South Cornelly 'rubbish hills' landowner is jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A landowner who changed a village's landscape by creating "large hills" of rubbish 100ft (30m) high has been jailed at Cardiff Crown Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Terrence Davies, 54, of North Cornelly, Bridgend, made Â£277,000 in 14 months by dumping waste on his nearby land.
He was jailed for two-and-a-half years after admitting four charges of operating without consent.
Judge Neil Bidder also ordered him to pay Â£23,517 within six months or face an extra 14 months behind bars.
The court heard police and Natural Resources Wales officers found Davies stuffing Â£5,000 in banknotes into envelopes when they raided the property at South Cornelly, just 500 yards (0.5 km) from a Site of Special Scientific Interest.
Waste dumped there included old mattresses, tyres, plastics and demolition and construction waste as well as hazardous waste like televisions.
He continued taking in waste even after he had been warned not to take in any more, the court heard.
Alex Greenwood, prosecuting, said: "It was a deliberate and flagrant disregard of the law and on one visit environment officers saw 30 vehicles arrive - builders' vans, trailers and tractors all carrying waste onto the site."
Davies traded as Boyd Davies Recycling Services.
Judge Bidder told him: "The mounds of waste were 30 metres high and up to 40 metres wide and resembled large hills.
"Some of it was deposited while you were on bail and after you had been warned time and time again.
"It was outrageous offending. The total volume of waste was huge and the remedial cost will be enormous."
