The 36-year-old former Premier League players are out of contract at the end of a season in which Galaxy were beaten in the play-offs by Colorado Rapids.
Gerrard has suggested he could go into coaching at former club Liverpool.
"We were honoured to have Stevie here as well as Robbie and are hopeful they continue to be part of our club," said Arena.
Former England midfielder Gerrard returned from a lengthy injury absence as a second-half substitute against Colorado, scoring as his side were beaten on penalties.
"If Sunday was his last game, to finish the way he finished with that penalty and the 45 minutes he played after being out for close to two months, was pretty impressive," said Arena.
Former Republic of Ireland striker Keane, he added, had enjoyed "six unbelievable years" in Los Angeles.
"There are very few players who have contributed as Robbie has," said Arena. "Three championships, more than 100 goals. He embraced the league.
"You don't always see that from international players."
However, Arena played down reports linking Manchester United forwards Wayne Rooney, 31, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 35, with the franchise.
"Let me give you a little hint - maybe 90% of the things that you see in the papers are not accurate," said Arena.
