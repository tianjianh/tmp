Alistair Carmichael admits trying to mislead leaked memo investigation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael has admitted that he tried to mislead a Cabinet Office investigation into a leaked memo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Giving evidence for a second day at a special election court, the Lib Dem MP was told that his response to the investigation was "calculated and intended to mislead".
He replied: "Yes, truthfully I would have to say that."
He is being challenged by constituents over whether his conduct broke the law.
Four constituents have raised the court action against him under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
They say he misled voters over a memo which was leaked before May's election.
The MP said he "enormously" regretted his involvement in the leaking of the memo, but denied lying about his role in the release of the document to protect his reputation.
Questioned by his own counsel, Roddy Dunlop QC, Mr Carmichael, said it has been "a difficult few months" for him.
The contents of the memo, published in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the election campaign in April, claimed that SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would secretly prefer Tory leader David Cameron to remain as prime minister rather than his Labour opponent Ed Miliband.
The newspaper said her comments, reportedly made to the French ambassador, undermined claims that she wanted to build a "progressive alliance" with other left-wing parties.
Mr Carmichael - who was Scottish secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election and is now his party's only MP in Scotland - authorised the leaking of a civil service memo by his special advisor.
Both the ambassador and the first minister denied the accuracy of the civil service memo.
At the time of the leak, Mr Carmichael denied any knowledge, claiming in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a reporter.
The court heard how a Cabinet Office inquiry into the leak was launched shortly after the newspaper article was printed on 3 April.
Mr Carmichael told the court he was initially "less than fully truthful" with the inquiry.
Mr Carmichael's lawyers argue his actions were political and did not affect his re-election.
The election court in Edinburgh is hearing evidence from six witnesses over four days. Legal argument was earlier heard in September.
The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years.
The petitioners argue his actions call into question his integrity as an individual and his suitability to represent the constituency at Westminster.
Judges ruled last month the legal challenge could proceed.
September's hearing was broadcast and streamed live online. The evidence from these latest six witnesses will not be broadcast, but the lawyers' closing statements may be.
The two judges, Lady Paton and Lord Matthews, will present their judgement to the House of Commons at a later date.
