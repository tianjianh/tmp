Aberdeen 2-0 Partick Thistle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen moved up to second place in the Premiership with a hard-fought win over Partick Thistle at Pittodrie.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jayden Stockley came off the bench to power in a header from Niall McGinn's corner on 72 minutes.
Fellow substitute Ryan Christie scored his first Dons goal late on, driving home following good work from Stockley.
Thistle midfielder Ryan Edwards nodded wide from close range at the start of the second half and Ade Azeez later clipped the outside of the post.

With Rangers held by Ross County at Ibrox, Derek McInnes's side were able to jump a place on goal difference.
The Firhill men defended well but paid the price for a recurring failure to take their chances.
Christie Elliott, in the first half, and Edwards and substitute Azeez after the break, all squandered golden opportunities.
The visitors have now dropped down to ninth place and have gone 406 minutes without scoring a league goal, taking just four points in 12 matches against teams in the top-five places in the Premiership.
The difference between the sides could be seen in the quality on the Dons bench, and the manager was certainly bold in using the substitutes.
Defenders Shay Logan and Mark Reynolds were sacrificed with Stockley and Christie taking over as Aberdeen switched to a three-man back line.
That adventurous approach paid dividends within eight minutes as Stockley rose to nod in a McGinn corner to break the deadlock after Tomas Cerny had pushed away a Jonny Hayes shot.
Stockley then set up Christie to settle the game in stoppage time.
Aberdeen, who went close through Ash Taylor and Kenny McLean in the first half, play their game in hand on Rangers against Motherwell on 15 February at Pittodrie.
Given the depth of the squad he has to call on, McInnes is in a good position to go on and clinch that runners-up spot for the third season in a row.
Aberdeen's Derek McInnes: "It was a tough afternoon as we struggled to get any real momentum or rhythm in our play but I'm delighted we dug in to get the win, especially after a tough game at Celtic Park.
"We asked the players at half time to get the tempo in our play and we changed the shape and got good quality players on the park.
"Ryan Christie started finding those pockets of space in what was a good display and it was a real bonus for him to get a goal as well as it's important for him to show what he can do for the team.
"Jayden Stockley deserves a lot of credit too as he works so hard for his opportunities and he took his goal well so it is great to have the options we have available."
Partick Thistle assistant Scott Paterson: "That has been the story of our season so far as we put so much into the game but end up with nothing.
"There were a lot of positive to take out of it again but it was really disappointing to lose a goal from a set-piece having defended very well for most of the day.
"Fair play to the players as we have been creating chances all season and they do keep going but we have to take them when you come to places like Pittodrie.
"They are showing character but the season is getting on now and we have to start taking these chances before it comes back to bight us on the backside."
