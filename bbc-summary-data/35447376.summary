[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burnley celebrated boss Sean Dyche's new contract by beating leaders Hull City to close within a point of them.

Both teams had first-half openings, with Clarets defender Michael Keane twice unable to keep headers on target, while Hull's Robert Snodgrass failed to beat Tom Heaton with a volley.
Moses Odubajo forced another save from Heaton at the start of the second half.
Tigers keeper Allan McGregor spilled Joey Barton's shot to Sam Vokes and he kept his cool to slot home the rebound.
The result meant the third-placed Clarets are one point behind both the Tigers and Middlesbrough, but have played more games than both.

Hull hammered Dyche's men 3-0 when the two sides last met on Boxing Day, but a repeat of that never looked likely with the hosts deserving their narrow win.
Barton came close to opening the scoring after half an hour when his skidding free-kick forced a low save from McGregor before the keeper denied the same player from a header.
The pivotal moment in the game came in the 77th minute when Wales international Vokes reacted quickest to McGregor's save from another Barton effort.
Hull substitute Chuba Akpom had a shot saved but he could not prevent his side suffering a first defeat since 28 December.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
"I always knew it was going to be tight, but looking back I think we controlled the quality of the game overall.
"Hull are a very strong defensive side with a real depth of experience, but we've managed to breach them one more time than they breached us.
"We're right up there in the hunt, but nothing will be decided yet."
Hull manager Steve Bruce:
"There was loads of heart and endeavour out there, and that from two top-class teams. It was never going to be a classic in weather like that.
"We carved out some great chances, but maybe we just missed that killer instinct in front of goal that you need.
"We've lost, but you just have to accept the result and move on. And we will do.
"We've played well in really difficult conditions. It's been an opportunity missed for us to create a bit of daylight at the top, but I couldn't fault the players."
