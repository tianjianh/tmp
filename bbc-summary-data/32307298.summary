[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager "obsessed" with knives who bragged about stabbing a boy in south-east London has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Giovanni Dixon, 17, of Norwood, stabbed James Hunter in the heart after the 18-year-old tried to protect his friend.
The Old Bailey heard Dixon and his friends had set upon Ezekiel Andrews with knives last May and Mr Hunter stepped in to protect him.
Dixon was found guilty of murder and wounding and was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years.
The court heard Mr Andrews, 18, who was described as a "tall and somewhat awkward boy", was punched to the ground, kicked and stabbed three times in the buttocks, following a perceived slight to the gang's friend Jacob Ayoade in the weeks before.
Mr Hunter, 18, suggested they fight "one on one" but Dixon rejected that idea and instead stabbed him in the heart on Wells Park Road.
The court heard Dixon "jovially" described what he had done as he made his getaway on a bus with his friends Jerome Catterall, 18, Jason Odumusi, 17, and Benedict Leka, 16.
Judge Rebecca Poulet QC said the boys' behaviour demonstrated a "preoccupation almost bordering on obsession with knives".
Catterall, of Sydenham and Odumusi, from Catford, were cleared of murder but convicted of wounding and sentenced to four and a half years each while Leka, from Forest Hill, who was 15 at the time, received four years for the same offence.
Ayoade, from Forest Hill, was sentenced to three years for encouraging the offence and possessing a knife.
Judge Poulet lifted a ban on naming all the defendants in light of their convictions.
