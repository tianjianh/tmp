Ukraine 2-0 Slovenia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ukraine built a comfortable lead over Slovenia in their Euro 2016 play-off as Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen Seleznyov scored in a 2-0 win in Lviv.

The Euro 2012 co-hosts took the lead when Yarmolenko seized on goalkeeper Samir Handanovic's unconvincing punch.
Seleznyov slid in to convert the overlapping Artem Fedetskiy's cross after the break.
Josip Ilicic wasted a fine chance for Slovenia, but his side were fortunate not to fall further behind in the tie.
Seleznyov side-footed a tame shot against the post after Denys Garmash had directed a powerful header straight at Handanovic under little pressure.
Ukraine have lost in five previous qualifying play-offs for major tournaments - including a 3-2 aggregate reverse when they played Slovenia for a place at Euro 2000.
With former heavyweight boxing champion, now mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klitschko watching on in the stands, there seemed little chance of a repeat as Yarmolenko - the target of an unsuccessful bid by Premier League side Everton in August - and Yevhen Konoplyanka pulling the strings.
Despite a spell of late pressure, Slovenia, who picked up two of five yellow cards in a tetchy encounter, will have to show more adventure in the return in Maribor on Tuesday.
