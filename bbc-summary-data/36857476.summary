Veteran Crewe Alexandra striker Ryan Lowe says his partnership with Chris Dagnall is working well and they are relishing the chance to unleash it on League Two this season.

Lowe, 37, and Dagnall, 30, joined the Alex this summer and will be key figures if the club is to challenge for promotion in the forthcoming campaign.
"I've known Daggers since he played at Tranmere with my cousin," Lowe said.
"We're building our partnership and hopefully we can score some goals."
The two Liverpudlians live only a few miles apart and have been travelling together to training during pre-season.
And Lowe, who is in his third spell at Gresty Road, says the fact that they have scored 315 goals between them in their careers should stand them in good stead when the season kicks off next month.
"We've shown a few signs of what we can do - we've scored goals and had some nice link-up play," Lowe told BBC Radio Stoke.
"We're paid to score goals and potentially get us out of this league and we're relishing it."
Despite all his experience, Lowe knows there is decent competition for places in the Crewe squad, with players such as Callum Saunders and Daniel Udoh looking for an opportunity.
"There's four of us fighting for two places but whoever's playing the best will probably play," he said.
"You got try to get these combinations together - whoever it's with."
The arrival of Alex Kiwomya from Chelsea on loan has bolstered boss Steve Davis's attacking options and Lowe says the 20-year-old has an important role to play.
"He brings something new - he's direct and will hopefully supply some crosses," Lowe added.
"Hopefully he's got a bit of a natural striker to him too - when I was at Crewe the first time (then manager) Dario Gradi turned me from a striker into a goalscoring winger and I'm sure the gaffer will teach him the same and he'll even get a few goals himself."
