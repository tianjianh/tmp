O'Briain announced in January he was stepping down after five years on the show, to spend more time on his comedy.
Dee will preside over the experts and audience as they pick apart Alan Sugar's candidates, and the outgoing contestant, each week.
Comic Romesh Ranganathan will also join the show as a regular panellist.
Dee has his own experience of the main show after taking part in Comic Relief Does The Apprentice in 2009.
He said he was "very much looking forward to hosting You're Fired" and hoped "that the luckless candidates will see me as the friendly face at the end of a difficult time in their lives".
Romesh Ranganathan said he was very excited as he is a "massive fan" of The Apprentice.
"I love You're Fired and am looking forward to putting all the questions to the candidates that people at home want to see asked.
"I also have a number of business proposals of my own that I think Lord Sugar will be pretty interested inâ€¦"
The Apprentice and You're Fired return later this year.
The main show will also have a new look, as Nick Hewer has departed from his role as Lord Alan's right hand man.
He announced in December he would be stepping down after 10 years on the series.
His replacement will be Claude Littner -  a former Amstrad director, who viewers will know as the interrogator who ruthlessly tears apart candidates CVs during the interview stage of the reality show.
