Mutlu Kaya, 19, is in a critical condition after being shot on Monday in Diyarbakir province, a conservative region in south-east Turkey.
A gun was fired from the garden and through a window of her house as she rehearsed.
Her ex-boyfriend, identified as Veysel E, has been charged with attempted murder.
Local media reported he had denied the accusation, although he admitted to being "opposed to Mutlu Kaya's participation on the show".
The 26-year-old was one of three men detained by authorities, but the other two were later released.
Ms Kaya had reportedly received death threats for singing on Sesi Cok Guzel - roughly translated as Sounds Beautiful - a popular song contest similar to shows like Britain's Got Talent and The Voice.
Her father, Mehmet Kaya, told the BBC's Turkish service his daughter remained unconscious in hospital.
He said the shooting took place in the early hours of Monday morning, while he was asleep.
Ms Kaya "was busy practicing her song" with her sister when "there was a knock on the window".
The attacker had previously knocked on the door but "my kids didn't answer it," he continued.
"When they again didn't open the window, he broke it, drew the curtain and shot my girl in the head."
"He had bothered my girl three or four times before, insisting 'you will marry me'," Mr Kaya said. "The girl was clear, she wouldn't marry him. I hope God will help us."
Ms Kaya had been mentored on the TV show by Sibel Can, one of Turkey's best-known folk singers.
After the shooting, she posted a picture of the teenager on Instagram, writing: "My beautiful girl Mutlu, how could they wound you? I am very sad."
The Posta newspaper reported on Sunday Ms Kaya had received death threats after appearing on the show.
It suggested they had come from members of her father's clan, something which he strenuously denied.
"The media portrayed our situation badly," he told the BBC. "They are claiming her father did this.
"Yes I am in a tribe. But we don't have any of this honour killing nonsense. I enrolled my daughter into school myself. We are knowledgeable. We are a family that believes in democracy. Would any father do anything like this to his daughter?
"I am proud of her. And then am I to hurt her? There is no truth to those claims."
Ms Kaya's uncle described the shooting as "violent barbarity".
"It can't be described in any other way," Mehmet Nesih Gunes told the BBC.
"She was so young. Beginning her career. To try to kill someone like that is to kill humanity."
