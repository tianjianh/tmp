[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Families in a North Somerset village have marched along the road where a seven-year-old girl was killed last week to lobby for safety measures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
April Reeves was hit by a car on the A371 while out cycling with her mother and brother in Locking on 28 May.
Campaigners want the 60mph speed limit cut and new pedestrian crossings built.
There is currently one concrete bridge with steep steps which is inaccessible to anyone with buggies, bicycles or wheelchair users.
The A371 divides the village with the former RAF base and the new Flowerdown housing estate on one side and all the village facilities including the school, post office, park and shop on the other.
The campaigners wore pink - April's favourite colour - in her memory.
They were joined by members of the road safety charity Brake.
North Somerset Council said road improvements were already under way and it hoped to add in wider cycle paths.
The council said design work had also begun for a traffic light junction on the A371 which would include a speed limit and pedestrian crossing.
