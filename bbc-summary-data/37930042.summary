The Woodhead Mountain Rescue Team was called to search for the lost walker on moors near Langsett, South Yorkshire.

The man had strayed from a path around Langsett Reservoir at about 18:40 GMT on Tuesday. It was dark and snow was falling.
Due to the poor weather a Coastguard helicopter had had to withdraw.
After he was found, the rescued man's stretcher was carried more than two miles (3.2km) for about 90 minutes by a team of 18 volunteers.
The rescue lasted six hours from the alarm being raised to the lost walker reaching an ambulance.
