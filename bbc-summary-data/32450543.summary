Three police officers have denied stealing £30,000 during a raid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The South Wales Police officers are accused of taking bundles of notes from the home of a suspected criminal.
Former Det Sgt Stephen Phillips, 46, of Swansea, and PCs Christopher Evans, 37, of Llangennech, Carmarthenshire, and Michael Stokes, 34, from Glynneath, Neath Port Talbot, deny theft by a serving police officer.
They were bailed to reappear at Cardiff Crown Court in June.
The court heard they were arrested as part of an ongoing investigation carried out by the force's professional standards department.
