Heavy rain and winds will sweep across large swathes of the UK on Monday, forecasters have warned, putting a dampener on the Bank Holiday for many.

Temperatures plummeted overnight and Northern Ireland suffered its coldest August night on record at -1.9C.
The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for rain on Monday - indicating people should "be aware" - for Wales and most of England.
The forecaster said the rain was caused by a "complex area of low pressure".
It said the conditions could cause problems for motorists, with surface water and spray predicted.
BBC weather presenter Darren Bett said that following sunshine on Sunday, increasing cloud would then bring heavy rain.
Temperatures on Monday will struggle to get above 19C (66F), forecasters said.
Scotland, where it is not a bank holiday, is expected to have the best of the weather.
The Met Office said strong winds would be an additional factor, as well as rain, close to southern coasts and in north-west England.
In Northern Ireland, the forecaster said temperatures would not exceed 15C and there would be cloud and patches of rain, becoming heavier and more persistent across the southern border.
In the early hours of Sunday morning, the temperature dropped to -1.9C at Katesbridge, in County Down - which set a new record for the coldest August night in Northern Ireland. The previous low of -1.1C was set in 1964.
In Scotland, the mercury in Eskdalemuir fell to 0.8C overnight. In southern England, Bournemouth saw a low of 2C.
The lowest August temperature ever recorded in the UK was -4.5C in Lagganlia in the Scottish Highlands, registered in 1973.
Low temperatures are expected again in Scotland overnight on Sunday, but the rest of the country will be less cold, BBC forecasters said.
The Met Office warned people across the UK to be aware that there may be "some impacts to holiday traffic and other outdoor activities".
A spokesman said: "A complex area of low pressure will bring an unpleasant day's weather to much of England and Wales on Monday.
"Rainfall amounts are likely to exceed 15mm (0.6in) quite widely, while a few places could see more than 30mm (1.1in). There will be a lot of surface water and spray on roads, and winds will be locally strong and gusty, for instance over parts of north-west England."
Tourism agency Visit England said more than five million people were planning an overnight stay away from home over the weekend.
About one million people are expected to attend London's Notting Hill Carnival, one of Europe's biggest events of its kind, which takes place on Sunday and Monday.
