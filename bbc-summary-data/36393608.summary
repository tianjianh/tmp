FA Cup quarter-final replays scrapped from next season

FA Cup quarter-final replays have been scrapped from next season.

The Football Association said the decision was part of its "ongoing review" and would help to "ease English football's congested fixture schedule".
Semi-final replays were phased out after Manchester United beat Arsenal in 1999 on their way to the treble.
Replays in earlier rounds remain, which means lower-league clubs still have the opportunity to earn lucrative second matches against higher-ranked clubs.

FA chief executive Martin Glenn said the change "adds excitement".
He added: "While fully respecting tradition and history, this new development will help the cup retain its status as a much-loved and world-renowned competition."
Manchester United beat West Ham in a replay in this season's quarter-finals before going on to lift the trophy in the final at Wembley.
