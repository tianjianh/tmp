The bid to secure Protected Food Name (PFN) status for Cambus O'May cheese was launched at the Aboyne Games.
Food Secretary Richard Lochhead is backing the campaign by the Ballater-based Cambus O'May Cheese Company.
If successful, Cambus could join Orkney Cheddar and Traditional Ayrshire Dunlop Cheese in having its provenance and authenticity guaranteed.
Made to a family recipe, the unpasteurised cheese is the only one of its kind in Scotland. It is hand-pressed using two different curds and has a creamy texture.
Alex Reid, from the Cambus O'May Cheese Company, said: "Achieving PFN status will not only put our company firmly on the world cheese map, but also the north east of Scotland.
"The cheese was lost for a generation in the 1960s but PFN status would more than herald its successful return."
Mr Lochhead said: "Scotland is world-famous for our wonderful food and drink, and people want to know they are buying the real deal.
"Achieving PFN status for Cambus O'May cheese will ensure that consumers at home and abroad have a 100% guarantee of the product's authenticity."
Orkney Scottish Island Cheddar was granted protected status by the European Union in 2013.
Traditional Ayrshire Dunlop Cheese was granted Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status earlier this year.
