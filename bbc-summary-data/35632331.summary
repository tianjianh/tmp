The 21-year joins immediately but will return to Bristol at the end of April and will be available for the runaway Championship leaders in their expected play-off challenge.
England Under-17 and U20 international Genge has played 26 first-team games at Bristol, scoring six tries.
"I'm grateful to the club for showing understanding," he said.
"I'd like to thank everybody at Bristol Rugby for their continued support and look forward to contributing to the promotion challenge later in the season."
Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: "We've been looking to add to our pool of props available for the remainder of the season and Ellis is a young man who has gained some useful experience with Bristol."
