Teachers in strike threat over pay and workload

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teachers could be set to strike if they fail to get a "satisfactory outcome" in talks over pay, union leaders have warned.

Members of the EIS union will raise the prospect of industrial action at their annual general meeting this week.
Teachers will also consider action if workload issues remain unresolved after a survey claimed the average teacher worked 46.5 hours a week.
EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan, said: "These issues must be tackled."
A Scottish government spokesman said they were working with teachers' representatives, local authorities and other partners "to address concerns around workload".
EIS members in Dundee have said that the union's council must "campaign for a restorative pay deal for teachers which does not link an increased salary with detrimental changes to conditions of service".
Their motion adds: "If no satisfactory outcome is forthcoming, members are to be balloted for industrial action up to and including strike action."
Other motions to be debated at the conference, which will take place in Perth from Thursday to Saturday, could lead to industrial action as a result of changes to the exam system.
The East Ayrshire local association has put forward a motion calling for a "ballot for a boycott of all SQA-related work unless SQA assessment can be managed within the 35-hour working week."
Mr Flanagan said: "Despite the fine words of politicians on the need to support schools and teachers, the evidence from both the recent EIS workload survey - which highlighted an average teacher working week of 46.5 hours - and the range of motions to this year's AGM indicate that excessive workload remains a huge issue for teachers and, therefore, for our schools and our pupils."
He insisted: "The message to the Scottish government, to local authorities and national education bodies could not be clearer - you must take action, now, to lighten the load on our schools and our teachers."
A call for the EIS to "investigate and report on the impact of teacher shortages" will also be discussed at the conference, along with a motion condemning "budget cuts which have been inflicted on Scottish education in recent years".
A Scottish government spokesman said: "We are committed to making sure councils have the right number and highest quality of teachers in our schools, which is why we have offered councils Â£51m, including an additional Â£10m over and above last year's settlements to support teacher numbers.
"Education and closing the gap in attainment between children from the most and least deprived communities is a top priority for this government."
