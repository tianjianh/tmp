SNP accuses Theresa May of pursuing a 'little Britain Brexit'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP has accused Theresa May of pursuing a "little Britain Brexit" which could lead to 80,000 job losses in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The claim by nationalist MP Angus Robertson came during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons.
The PM said she wanted a good deal for the UK and that the Scottish government's Brexit plans would be discussed.
A speech by Mrs May made clear the UK would leave the EU's single market.
The Holyrood administration's post-Brexit plan, published in December, argued for a "flexible" approach that would take into account the needs of different parts of the UK.
Mr Robertson, who is the SNP's Westminster leader, quoted the PM's commitment that Scotland was an "equal partner" in the UK.
He went on to ask: "Does she still believe this is true, or is she just stringing the people of Scotland along?"
Mrs May said she was committed to working with the devolved administrations to "ensure their voice is heard, that their interests are taken into account as we proceed along this path of negotiating our exit from the EU".
Mr Robertson went on to reference economic experts who said "real wages" in Scotland would fall by Â£2,000 per year and that 80,000 people may lose their jobs as a result of the "hard Tory Brexit plan of the PM".
He asked: "Does the PM believe that this is a price worth paying for her little Britain Brexit?"
Mrs May responded: "We will be working to ensure we get the best possible deal in terms of access to the single market and continue to cooperate in partnership with the member states of the European Union."
