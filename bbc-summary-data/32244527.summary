LinkedIn is trying to boost the business content it offers to its 300 million users.
Lynda, based in California, has made hundreds of videos that teach subscribers everything from coding to business skills.
Subscribers pay $375 per year to access the tutorials.
Although the company was founded nearly 20 years ago, it has expanded rapidly in the past two years, adding several languages to its video offerings and increasing outside investment.
"The mission of LinkedIn and the mission of lynda.com are highly aligned," said LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner in a statement.
"Both companies seek to help professionals be better at what they do."
Shares in LinkedIn rose more than 1.5% on the New York Stock Exchange after news of the acquisition was released.
