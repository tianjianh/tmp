Live on television, the draw was declared void when one of the team names popped out of the plastic ball in which it had been contained.
A spokesman for the SFA said they would be happy to discuss an alternative system with its broadcast partners.
Numbered balls are used in draws done for the Scottish League Cup.
The League Cup is run by the Scottish Professional Football League.
Dundee United had been drawn at home to Celtic before the loose team name was discovered.
The re-run resulted in Celtic hosting Morton and trophy holders Inverness CT travelling to either Hibernian or Hearts.
The winners of the Rangers and Kilmarnock replay at Rugby Park will take on Dundee or Dumbarton, while Ross County entertain Dundee United, with the ties to be played over weekend of 5 and 6 March.
