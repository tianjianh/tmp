Arc21 Glengormley incinerator decision may be appealed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The decision to refuse planning permission for a waste incinerator at Glengormley, on the outskirts of Belfast, may be appealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arc21, the organisation that wanted to build the Â£240m facility, is asking for the decision to be reviewed.
Environment minister Mark H Durkan refused permission last month, despite a planners' recommendation to approve.
He said he believed it would hinder efforts to increase recycling rates.
Mr Durkan also raised questions about the impact of the proposed project on human health.
The proposal was controversial from the start, more than 3,500 objections were lodged with planners.
Supporters said the facility was needed to deal with black bin waste from six super council areas.
They said it would help Northern Ireland to meet its targets on diverting waste from landfill and prevent hefty EU fines.
A spokesperson for Arc21 said: "Arc21 can confirm that it has requested the Department of the Environment to refer the recent planning notification regarding new waste infrastructure at Hightown Quarry to the Northern Ireland Planning Appeals Commission."
The decision to lodge the appeal was taken by a committee which includes three councillors from each of the six super councils.
However it's understood a final decision to proceed with the appeal will require the full approval of all six councils.
It's also believed that if the appeal goes ahead, the decision of the Planning Appeals Commission would not be binding on any future environment minister.
