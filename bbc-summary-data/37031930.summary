Comments: Which Olympic sport would you do?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With the Rio Olympics in full swing, there's been a lot of talk around the Newsround office about which sport we would do if we were competing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ayshah says: "I'd do gymnastics. I can't stop watching it. They're so incredible. Simone Biles is something else. But I wouldn't be any good, I think I last did a cartwheel when I was 10!"
Jenny says: "The heptathlon for sure. There are seven different events, so surely I'd be passable at one of them?! Jessica Ennis-Hill is my hero."
And Martin says: "Boxing because my family all like it and my idol is Muhammad Ali, who won an Olympic medal over 50 years ago. I always thought if he competed at a games, then it must be awesome."
You told us what sport you would do and why.
I would like to run in either the 100 or 200m races. This is because I like to run and when I grow up I want to inspire children.
Medhavi, 11, Essex
I would be a diver because I feel good in the water.
Isla, 6
I would like to do gymnastics and kayak slalom. I have been doing gymnastics in a club for 2 years already and I practice lots at home. I love watching the Olympics.
Josie, 8, France
I  would do running because I'm the fastest in my family and I might be able to do the Olympics in Tokyo because I'll be thirteen when it happens.

When I am older I would like to be a professional footballer and I would play for team GB.

I would like to do shooting in the Olympics. I entered my first ever competition at the weekend and I came 3rd.

I want to compete in rhythmic gymnastics or synchronised swimming because they are both really graceful and beautiful sports. My sporting idols are the Downie sisters.
