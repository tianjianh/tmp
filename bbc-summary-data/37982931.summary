[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 1-0 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Mansfield boss Steve Evans made it two home wins in four days as substitute Danny Rose netted a late winner to secure a 1-0 win over Blackpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goalkeeper Sam Slocombe could only parry Matt Green's low effort and Rose was on hand to turn the ball home at the far post two minutes into added time.
Mansfield, who put three past Crawley in Saturday's win, started the night at full pelt and carved out two good chances in the first nine minutes.
But Ashley Hemmings headed wide from seven yards from a Pat Hoban cross in the fourth minute, and shortly afterwards Hoban cut in from the left and warmed Slocombe's hands with a fierce shot he was forced to parry.
The rest of the half was an even affair with no real chances and littered with numerous whistles for a string of fouls.
Blackpool improved after the break and goalkeeper Scott Shearer had a save to make after 55 minutes when a free-kick was rolled to Brad Potts and his firm shot was on target from 25 yards.
Six minutes later he turned over a Potts header from a Jack Payne free-kick.
Slocombe had to get down to turn away a 20-yard Chris Clements volley 20 minutes from time before he was finally beaten at the death.
