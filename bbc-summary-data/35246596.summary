Charlie Hebdo: Holyrood to mark terror attack anniversary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Parliament is to mark the anniversary of the terror attack on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
SNP MSP Christian Allard - who is a French national -  will lead a debate to commemorate the victims of the Paris attack, which left 12 people dead.
Another five people were also killed by Islamist gunmen over the next two days.
Mr Allard said the right to free speech was essential, and an attack on cartoonists and journalists was "an attack on us all".
He added: "The tragic attack on Charlie Hebdo was not just an attack on one magazine. It was an attack on the principle of free speech.
"Charlie Hebdo has responded to this attack in the best possible way - to keep on doing what they were doing before. To be outrageous, to mock and to challenge us all.
"One year on, let us make sure that we continue to respond to terrorism by valuing and embracing freedom of speech and our right to disagree. Rather than 7 January solely being an anniversary of terrorism we should celebrate it as Cartoonists' Day."
Cartoonist Terry Anderson will lead a discussion on freedom of expression at the parliament's cross-party group on France following the debate in the main Holyrood chamber.
The Charlie Hebdo attack was carried out by brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, who forced their way into its offices, shooting dead 11 people and injuring 11 others.
They later shot dead a French National Police officer outside the building.
The gunmen said they belonged to the Yemen branch of the Islamist terrorist group Al-Qaeda, which took responsibility for the attack.
Both brothers died on 9 January 2014 after being shot by police following a siege in Dammartin-en-Goele, about 20 miles north east of Paris.
