The 25-year-old, who won the last of his seven England caps in 2012, has agreed a two-year contract.
He will fill the gap left by Scott Dureau, who is to return to Australia after five seasons in Perpignan.
Myler appeared in Warrington's Challenge Cup final win against Leeds in 2012 and also played in their Grand Final defeats in 2012 and 2013.
"It's a really exciting time to be joining Catalans Dragons," said Myler. "I'm looking forward to playing my part with such an ambitious club and embracing the French culture with my family."
Head coach Laurent Frayssinous added: "I'm delighted to sign Richie for the next two seasons. The club has shown its ambition with the capture of such a quality player."
