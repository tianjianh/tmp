A lamb born without a fleece is to be spared the chop.

Skippy, nicknamed because of his resemblance to a kangaroo, was born fleeceless on a farm at Chilton Foliat in Wiltshire last week.
Rejected by its mother, the bald newborn has had to be bottle fed and kept warm in a fluffy fashioned fleece.
Sally-Ann Fisher, who is hand-rearing Skippy, said: "We felt a bit sheepish about his intended career so he's going into grassland management instead."
Ms Fisher, who farms with her partner near Ramsbury, said it had been a "bonkers week" after news of Skippy hit the headlines.
However, despite being born with "everything against him" the 12-day-old lamb was a "survivor", she said.
"We've had a change of heart about Skippy's intended career in the food industry," she said.
"Instead he's going into grassland management and will also be a lead sheep for our flocks of ewes.
"Years ago shepherds used to get a hand-reared male lamb and put a bell around it and it was much easier to bring the flocks off the fells - so he's going to have a similar role."
She added that Skippy was "ewe-phoric about the news".
