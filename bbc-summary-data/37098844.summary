They lost 21-14 21-18 to Chinese fourth seeds Fu Haifeng and Zhang Nan.
The pair will face China's Hong Wei and Chai Biao for bronze on Thursday, bidding to become Britain's first badminton medallists since 2004.
"I'm really disappointed and a bit frustrated. I don't think we really put 100% into that match," Ellis said.
"Obviously we tried but for some reason today it just didn't quite come out.
"I'm not forgetting the occasion that it is but I feel like we could have done so much better," he added.
The Britons, who have performed above their ranking of 22nd in the world in reaching the last four, battled hard in the match but lost to opponents who both won gold medals at London 2012.
Langridge said: "It is frustrating. We gave everything and have to give full credit to them, they are a world class pair and were better than us.
"It's hard for us but the day after tomorrow we have to come back and try and win that bronze medal for Team GB."
