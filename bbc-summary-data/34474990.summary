[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kingussie woman to run world's southern most post office

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman is to take over from her former university room-mate as the operator of the world's most southerly post office.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Laura Martin, from Kingussie in the Highlands, was chosen from more than 2,400 people for the job previously undertaken by Amy Kincaid, from Oban.
Ms Martin did not tell her former room-mate at University of St Andrews that she had applied for the post.
The 25-year-old will start her stint in the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust post office in November.
The office in Port Lockroy, which is part of the British Antarctica Territory, handles mail for scientists and others working in Antarctica.
Another St Andrews University graduate, Florence Barrow, landed the same job in 2012.
Like Ms Kincaid and Ms Barrow, Ms Martin will do other duties while in Antarctica.
