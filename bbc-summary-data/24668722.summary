[SN]TITLE[SN]
Consortium overseeing Dounreay clean up changing its name

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The consortium of international companies that owns and manages Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) is changing its name.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From next week Babcock Dounreay Partnership will be called Cavendish Dounreay Partnership.
The consortium is overseeing DSRL's work decommissioning Dounreay, an experimental nuclear power complex on the north Caithness coast.
The site's original buildings such as its dome are to be demolished by 2025.
The rebranding follows the decision of Babcock International Group, which has a 50% stake in the parent body organisation, to call its civil nuclear business unit Cavendish Nuclear.
The other partners in the consortium, CH2MHILL and URS, as well as the rest of Babcock International Group, are unaffected by the change.
