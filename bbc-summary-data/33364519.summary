An action plan to improve cleanliness and hygiene techniques has been put in place at operating theatres at Borders General Hospital.

The move comes ahead of a report by the Scottish government's Health Environment Inspectorate, which is expected to be critical.
NHS Borders new chief executive Jane Davidson said training and new procedures had been introduced.
She insisted there were no criticisms of cleanliness during surgery.
Ms Davidson said inspectors highlighted issues about cleaning practices like mopping and changing masks and gowns.
She said she was "really disappointed" with the findings.
The chief executive added: "But I wasn't on my own in that, the theatre teams were disappointed.
"While we didn't do ourselves any credit, what I have to say is that staff responded absolutely on the nail, immediately and with patients in mind."
NHS Borders said the inspection and its knock-on effects, including staff training, led to a high number of cancelled operations in May.
More than two thirds of operations cancelled in the Borders in May were called off for "capacity or non-clinical reasons".
A spokesman for the Health Environment Inspectorate said the report on Borders General Hospital will be published at 10:00 on Monday.
