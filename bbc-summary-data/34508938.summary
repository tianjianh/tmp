Borthwick, 36, most recently coached Japan at the Rugby World Cup working as Eddie Jones's assistant.
He played 246 times for Bath and 144 for Saracens, also winning 57 caps for his country in a 16-year career.
"We are delighted that Steve Borthwick is going to be joining us," Bristol director of rugby Andy Robinson told BBC Radio Bristol.
"He is a quality man, and as you can see from the work he has done with Japan, he is a quality coach," Robinson added.
"I've worked with Steve since he was 18 when I signed him for Bath and have a great relationship with him."
Borthwick, who retired as the Premiership's most capped player in 2014, also skippered Bath and Saracens.
He said: "I'm looking forward to joining Bristol Rugby and joining Andy [Robinson]'s coaching team.
"It's an exciting opportunity for me to work with such a talented group of players.
"Bristol prides itself on the strength and dynamism of the forward pack and I'm eager to continue that philosophy."
