Relegated Tranmere Rovers have named Gary Brabin as their new manager.

The 44-year-old has been in a coaching role at Everton since leaving Conference side Southport, who he guided to the third round of this season's FA Cup, in January.
Brabin has previously managed Cambridge and Luton Town, guiding both clubs to the Conference play-off places.
Tranmere, without a manager since Micky Adams departed in mid-April, lost their League status with one game to go.
Alan Rogers and academy boss Shaun Garnett were put in caretaker charge following Adams' departure, but were unable to prevent the club being relegated out of the Football League with a 3-2 defeat at Plymouth on 25 April.
"I have had approaches from other clubs and declined them, but the Tranmere job is special," said Brabin.
"The chance to lead one of the three famous old Merseyside clubs back to where it belongs in the Football League is a fantastic challenge that is hard to resist."
Rovers chairman Mark Palios stated that Brabin was their "main target" to take over, but has not disclosed the length of his contract.
