[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge 0-5 Gateshead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham and Redbridge were humbled on home turf by an invigorated Gateshead, leaving John Still's men 10 points off the automatic promotion pace.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Jones opened the scoring following a clever one-two with Danny Johnson, placing past Elliot Justham.
Mitch Brundle curled in a free-kick to double the lead just after the break, as goalkeeper Justham was left disappointed with his positioning.
It became comical in the Dagenham defence as the excellent double act of Manny Smith and Jones combined, the latter scoring from his team-mate's tidy flick on.
After a Johnson penalty made it four, Smith added further gloss when given far too much space in the box to head home with 26 minutes left.
