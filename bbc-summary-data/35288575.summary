More than 30 players associated with Australian rules team Essendon FC have been banned for doping.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) has upheld a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) appeal after the 34 players - past and present - were initially cleared.
The players, including 12 currently registered with Essendon, are suspended for the 2016 season.
It was alleged the players were administered a banned peptide.
The long-running case has been through several layers of Australian and international sports governance. Essendon coach James Hird was banned for 12 months and the team's sports scientist Stephen Dank - alleged to have administered the banned substance, which promotes muscle growth - is still appealing.
He was previously found guilty of "trafficking, attempting to traffic and complicity in matters related to a range of prohibited substances".
The 2012 investigation examined the club's player supplements and sports science programme.
Essendon chairman Lindsay Tanner said the club was "currently digesting the decision" and would provide a further response shortly.
The Cas panel ruled that the players, including skipper Jobe Watson, Dyson Heppell and Michael Hurley, were "significantly at fault".
Seventeen of the 34 have since retired or been delisted. The Australian rules season starts in March.
