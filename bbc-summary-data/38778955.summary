[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sheffield United 4-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A goal from debutant James Hanson helped Sheffield United return to the top of League One with an emphatic victory over AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Bradford centre-forward opened his account for the Blades after Billy Sharp had earlier netted his 19th goal of the campaign.
John Fleck and substitute Caolan Lavery piled on the misery for Neal Ardley's side with strikes after the interval.
When Sharp opened the scoring after three minutes, AFC Wimbledon must have feared the worst. But even though Hanson extended United's lead during the closing stages of the first half, the visitors remained a threat.
Although Dons keeper James Shea will have been disappointed with his handling for Sharp's opener, parrying Fleck's cross straight into the United captain's path, he was powerless to prevent Hanson netting in the 38th minute.
On that occasion, Kieron Freeman was the provider before Sharp missed a flurry of chances early in the second period.
United need not have worried though, as Fleck made it 3-0 with a delightful piece of skill with 10 minutes remaining.
Lavery then completed the rout deep into stoppage time as the Blades moved two points clear of Scunthorpe, who lost at Southend.
