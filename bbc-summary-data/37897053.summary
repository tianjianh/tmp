[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottinghamshire seamer Harry Gurney has signed a new contract to stay with the County Championship Division Two club until the end of the 2019 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gurney has taken 306 wickets for Notts in all competitions since joining from Leicestershire in August 2011.
The 30-year-old made the first of 12 limited-overs appearances for England against Scotland in May 2014.
His previous contract at Trent Bridge was set to expire at the end of next season.
"Harry has taken massive strides during his time with us and he's developed into one of the most senior players at the club," director of cricket Mick Newell said.
"He bowls in pressure situations, particularly with the white ball, and does it very well - and in four-day cricket he has the knack of getting wickets in clusters."
