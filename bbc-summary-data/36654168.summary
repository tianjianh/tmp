Murray, seeded second, saw off the 22-year-old world number 235 from Stockport 6-2 6-3 6-4 on Centre Court.
It was the first all-British meeting at the All England Club since Tim Henman beat Martin Lee in 2001.
Murray, 29, goes on to face Yen-Hsun Lu of Chinese Taipei in the second round on Thursday.
The Scot needed just one hour and 43 minutes to end Broady's Centre Court debut, the 2013 champion and world number two not surprisingly outclassing a player with just one tour-level win to his name.
Murray might have been playing a familiar face but he was in aggressive mood, dropping just six points on his first serve and winning 18 of 19 at the net.
Having gone 10 years without playing a fellow Briton, he has now beaten three this month following wins over Aljaz Bedene and Kyle Edmund at Queen's Club.
"When we start the match we are both trying to win, but it does not make it any easier," Murray told BBC Sport.
"Liam played better as the match went on and fought through to the end and played some good stuff.
"The crowd is always very fair here, getting behind both players and knowing what a good shot is. Liam got a good ovation when he left court and I'm sure he will have enjoyed that."
Murray, watched by recently returned coach Ivan Lendl at a Grand Slam for the first time in three years, began his 11th Wimbledon campaign with a comfortable win.
Broady, 22, had experienced the Murray game first-hand during practice sessions earlier this year but could not bridge the gulf in class once their first competitive meeting got under way.
Within five minutes he was a break of serve down, and moments later he was literally playing a shot off his knees as Murray ran him ragged.
There was a sense of relief from the Centre Court crowd when Broady got on the scoreboard at 3-1 down but he could make no impression on the Murray serve.
A wayward Broady forehand into the tram lines gave up the first set and a double fault handed Murray a 3-1 lead in the second.
There was little reason for Murray to get fired up but a trademark cross-court backhand brought a shout of "come on" en route to a two-set lead, and it was now a case of closing it out as clinically as possible.
Murray suffered physically in the recent French Open final after getting dragged into two five-set matches earlier in the tournament, and he was determined to avoid a repeat at Wimbledon.
Broady - and the crowd - enjoyed one running forehand pass early in the third set, and the wildcard earned his first break points in game six, but Murray fired down a serve and steered away a volley to snuff out the danger.
A delicate drop shot clinched victory on match point and the value of a quick win was immediately apparent when the rain began to fall as the players walked off court.
