A Belfast pensioner who sexually abused two members of the same family has been given an extended 12 year sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick Toal, formerly of Tollgate House in Bradbury Place, was found guilty by a jury earlier this year of 29 separate counts of sexually abusing his partner's daughter, and her grand-daughter.
The abuse spanned a period of 19 years.
The 71-year-old, who maintains his innocence, was sentenced at Belfast Crown Court on Tuesday.
Telling Toal that he was being handed an extended sentence for the protection of the public, the judge said that after the pensioner has served half his sentence, his release date will then be determined by the Paroles Commission.
In addition to the prison sentence, Toal will spend a further three years on licence when he is released from custody.
He was also made the subject of an Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) for an indefinite period.
The judge said that Toal's actions had left both of his victims suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.
He said Toal preyed on the women when they were vulnerable young girls and that grooming was involved.
The judge said Toal had displayed no insight into the significant harm he had caused to both women.
