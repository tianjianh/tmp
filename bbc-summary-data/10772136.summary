In Pictures: Lara's Way
Lara Croft Way is part of the city's new Â£36.2m inner ring road system designed to improve traffic flow.
The name was chosen from a shortlist by public vote, with 89% of those polled opting for the character devised by Derby-based game studio Core Design.
Another stretch of the network will be named Mercian Way after the local army regiment.
The ring road is part of the Connecting Derby scheme, a long-term project to improve transport links in the area.
Councillor Matthew Holmes, cabinet member for planning and environment, said: "The opening of Lara Croft Way signifies another major milestone of the Connecting Derby scheme which is fast approaching completion after many years of hard work by a great number of terrific individuals.
"Derby is proud of its place in a vibrant creative industry and Lara Croft Way is fantastic way to celebrate that."
The completion of Lara Croft Way will allow drivers to access Burton Road, Babington Lane and Normanton Road via the new roundabout at the junction of Burton Road and Normanton Road.
The Inner Ring Road project is due to be fully completed at the start of 2011.
