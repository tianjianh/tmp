Nottinghamshire police cuts: More than 70 PCSO jobs cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A quarter of Nottinghamshire's police community support officers will be cut despite 21,000 people calling for an increase in council tax to keep them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The force announced it was reducing the number of PCSOs to 251 from 331 because of financial pressures with 44 people facing redundancy.
A petition to increase tax and keep the officers was signed by 21,000 people.
Union Unison said it was "bitterly disappointed" by the decision and that those signatories were ignored.
Nottinghamshire's police and crime commissioner Paddy Tipping, who promised to increase the number of PCSOs when he was elected in 2012, said he had been forced to reduce them because of Government cuts.
When the force began consulting on the future of PCSOs it employed 331 officers, some of whom have since left, meaning 44 face redundancy.
In a statement, Nottinghamshire police said: "This was a difficult decision to make as we recognise the important job PCSOs do in serving our communities. We also acknowledge and are grateful for the public support our PCSOs received.
"However, the financial pressure that the force is under means that we have to work differently and make these decisions in order for us to continue serving the public in the best way we can."
Dave Ratchford, of Unison, said: "The members are bitterly disappointed not just because their jobs are now going to be removed but also because of the service they have provided and the work they have built up over the years in Nottinghamshire communities.
"We believe we have demonstrated quite clearly in a very short space of time that the people of Nottinghamshire want an alternative solution to this."
