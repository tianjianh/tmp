The fresh contracts will keep O'Callaghan, 25, and Copeland, 28, at Thomond Park until 2018.
Centre Rory Scannell, a former Ireland Under-20 star, has signed a senior contract with Munster after impressing in the province's academy.
"Each player has their own individual attributes and are valuable members of our squad," said coach Anthony Foley.
"With Robin and Dave, we are maintaining the services of two hugely physical players who bring different skill-sets to our overall game.
"Both have proven their versatility over the years in playing across the back row and at lock, so we are delighted to have players of their calibre."
Copeland joined Munster at the start of the 2014-15 season and has scored six tries in his 24 appearances.
O'Callaghan, like Scannell a product of Munster's academy, has made 52 appearances for the province but is currently sidelined with a thigh injury.
Scannell, 22, is the younger brother of Munster hooker Niall.
"We are fortunate to have home-grown talent like Rory make their way up through the ranks," added Foley.
"For a young guy who has been playing at the next level for over a year now we are looking forward to seeing Rory's contribution develop."
