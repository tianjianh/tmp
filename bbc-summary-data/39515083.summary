Huddersfield Town midfielder Jonathan Hogg said he feels fortunate to be back playing after fears he had fractured his neck.

Hogg, 28, suffered the injury in a collision with a team-mate in a 4-0 defeat at Bristol City in March and was initially ruled out for the season.
However, after further scans, he was allowed to return for Wednesday's 3-0 win over Norwich.
"It felt worrying - I'd never felt pain like it," he told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I'm a lucky boy to be out there because when the doctors said it was a fracture in my spine I feared the worst.
"I'm so glad I'm able to help the boys out for the rest of the season."
The former Watford man played his part as the Terriers ended a run of successive defeats against the Canaries to go back up to third in the Championship table.
David Wagner's side are nine points off second-placed Brighton with seven games to play - one more than the Seagulls.
Hogg believes Town could still break into the automatic promotion places.
"We're just thinking about the next game. Strange things have happened this season and we are not a million miles off the top two," he added.
"If we can get three points at Nottingham Forest on Saturday it will put real pressure on the top two and pressure can do strange things to people."
