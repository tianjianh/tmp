Blades striker Che Adams nearly broke the deadlock early on, but his thunderous effort rattled the crossbar.
The visitors pressed for an opener and were unlucky not to find one as Rory Donnelly's overhead kick flew over.
Luke Norris went close toa winner for Gillingham, but his effort was blocked on the line by Jay McEveley.
The result meant Gillingham sit comfortably in the play-off places in fifth position, with United nine points outside the top six in 10th.
