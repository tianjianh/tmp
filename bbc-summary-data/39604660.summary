Striker Aaron Wilbraham (knee) is also a doubt, while experienced midfielder Gary O'Neil (hamstring) is rated 50-50 after three weeks out.
Barnsley - 14th in the table - have no new injury or suspension concerns.
Boss Paul Heckingbottom has suggested that he is unlikely to give debuts to youngsters from the academy.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol:
"We have to make sure that we do our bit and perform as well as we can.
"If we get caught thinking we've cracked it at any point then, very quickly, the dynamics can change.
"Peterborough went down with 54 points a few years ago. We can't look too far ahead. We keep the hammer down."
