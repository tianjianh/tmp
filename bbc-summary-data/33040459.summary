The victory for Nigeria ensured they finished second in Group E, and sets up a clash with Germany in the next round.
The Hungarians also qualify as one of the best third-placed teams and will face Serbia in the knockout stages.
Awoniyi scored in each half of their last Group E fixture.
His first goal came in the 33rd minute, volleying in from a pinpoint cross by Saviour Godwin.
He added the second in the 54th minute when Attila Osvath and Akos Cecskes, who had both gone up for the same header, collided near half-way.
That left the ball to Awoniyi who beat a defender and rounded goalkeeper Gyorgy Szekely before tucking the ball into the net.
Brazil finished above Nigeria as Group E leaders and will face Uruguay in their last-16 match on Thursday.
