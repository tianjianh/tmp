[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lukas Jutkiewicz headed in a stoppage-time winner as Birmingham came from behind to beat Sheffield Wednesday.

Jutkiewicz's first goal for Blues - and first since May 2014 - came moments after Adthe Nuhiu had headed against the crossbar for visitors Wednesday.
Gary Hooper had given them the lead going in to the closing stages from Steven Fletcher's clever back heel.
Clayton Donaldson then levelled soon after from the penalty spot after he was brought down by Keiren Westwood.

The game at St Andrew's suddenly came to life in the closing 15 minutes after the main talking point had been Birmingham's appeals for a penalty in the first half.
Former Owls winger Jacques Maghoma appeared to have been tripped by Tom Lees on the edge of the area after he squared the ball.
Birmingham's protests went unanswered and their hopes of taking any points from the game appeared dashed when Wednesday led through substitute Hooper.
They were behind for just five minutes as Donaldson picked himself up to send Westwood the wrong way from 12 yards, having been clipped by the goalkeeper rushing off his line.
It was another substitute who had the final say as Jutkiewicz, on loan from Burnley, suddenly found space to loop his header over Westwood moments after Nuhiu headed Liam Palmer's cross against the bar at the other end.
Birmingham boss Gary Rowett:
"The way we worked hard when we were not playing well certainly gave us the opportunity to do what we did late in the game.
"The changes we made in terms of tactics gave us the chance to get back into the game. Against a team like Sheffield Wednesday you always have to ride out 15 to 20 minutes which I thought we did really well."
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal:
"I am very happy with our form. We are playing fantastic but not scoring. We again had five good chances against Birmingham.
"If we were not playing well I would be concerned. We play to win but we need to improve our finishing."
