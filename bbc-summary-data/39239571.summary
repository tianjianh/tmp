[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 0-0 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall dropped out of the League One play-off places as they were held to a goalless draw by Bury at The Den.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shakers striker James Vaughan had the best opportunity of the first half but when through on goal, Lions skipper Tony Craig made a magnificent last-ditch recovery tackle.
Bury's resolute defence frustrated the Lions as they failed to find a way past in-form goalkeeper Joe Murphy, with the Shakers stopper making a stunning save to deny Jed Wallace in the 51st minute.
Steve Morison thought he had put the hosts ahead in the 68th minute when he finished off a swift counter attack, but his goal was chalked off for offside.
Millwall cranked up the pressure in the latter stages with Byron Webster and Lee Gregory having good chances in front of goal, but Murphy's heroics between the sticks earned Bury a share of the spoils.
The win lifts the Shakers up to 17th in the table, four points above the relegation zone, and maintains manager Lee Clark's unbeaten run away from home.
