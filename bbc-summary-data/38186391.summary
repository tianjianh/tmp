[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was no room for Neymar or Karim Benzema - and Sergio Busquets and Javier Mascherano did not make the cut either.

In the lead-up to Saturday's El Clasico at 15:15 GMT, more than 50,000 BBC Sport users selected who they thought should start in a combined Barcelona and Real Madrid XI .
Six Barca players made the team and, as you would expect, there is stardust all over the pitch - plus the combined experience of 33 La Liga titles and 25 Champions League triumphs.
Barcelona forward Lionel Messi was selected in 94% of teams, making him the most popular player, with Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo featuring in 88% of teams.
Real's Gareth Bale featured in 58% of teams and was the second most popular behind Andres Iniesta in terms of midfield positions.
It was a close call for the goalkeeper spot, with 45% of users selecting Barca's Marc-Andre ter Stegen and 42% opting for Real's Keylor Navas.
In an interview with the BBC in November 2015, Ronaldo labelled himself the best footballer in the world and comparable with the game's all-time greats.
Yet the Portuguese trailed Messi in terms of most selected player.
Despite winning two La Liga titles and one Champions League in Spain, Barca forward Neymar did not fair too well.
He was the eighth most popular player picked overall, but was fourth most popular among the forwards, fifth in midfield and unable to hold down any single position.
Barcelona's players also came out on top in midfield and defence in terms of most popular votes.
Gerard Pique was the most selected centre-back, with Real's Sergio Ramos second most popular.
There was close competition for the left-back spot too - Jordi Alba gained 43% of user's votes, with Marcelo gaining 38%.
In midfield, Barca's Iniesta was the most dominant pick in the centre of the engine room, with Luka Modric of Real just behind.
Toni Kroos and Neymar were next in line to be picked in the midfield.
Trying to pick a combined XI of both sets of players gave plenty of people a headache.
Do you think differently? Don't worry - pick your team now.
Imagine you could pick from the combined squads of Barcelona and Real Madrid - tasty but testing. Who would you choose?
