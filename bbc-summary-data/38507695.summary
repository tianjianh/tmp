The 30-year-old South Africa-born Canada international joined the west Wales region ahead of 2015-16.
Scarlets boss Wayne Pivac confirmed the player will depart when his contract expires in the summer.
Fly-half Rhys Patchell will miss the Pro12 match against Ulster on Friday with an ankle problem, while Scott Williams and Samson Lee are doubtful.
Pivac says Wales centre Williams is "beaten up" after their bruising festive derbies against Ospreys and Cardiff Blues and could be rested.
Wing Johnny McNicholl is also a doubt.
Van der Merwe has been linked with a move to Aviva Premiership club Newcastle.
"He is joining the fire service going forward and has three years left in rugby before he has to make that call because you have to be a certain age (to do so)," said Pivac.
"He is looking at a three-year contract and the money in England is a lot more than here so he is doing what is right for his family and we support that.
"We have got some good young players coming through the system that we are going to put a lot of time and effort into over the next 12 months.
"It is one of those where you have to weigh-up the financial side of things and where the player is at.
"DTH and I have had a long chat and we are on the same page and that's the right thing to do.
"Don't get me wrong, we put an offer to keep DTH, but the money in England is a lot more so when you look over that over three years, it's a no-brainer.
"We have made the decision to back the youngsters."
Patchell could face a long lay off if the injury suffered against Cardiff Blues on New Year's Day is serious.
"Rhys is seeing a surgeon tomorrow to see if he needs surgery," said Pivac.
"It is a high ankle sprain so there will be some weeks involved, it's just the number. We will know tomorrow.
"If surgery is required, it will be 12 weeks. Fingers crossed it's the lower end and not the higher end."
