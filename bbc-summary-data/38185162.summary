City of York Council said it took the decision to close the section between Fishergate Postern Tower and Fishergate Bar over fears of "subsidence".
Engineers are due to inspect it next week and the authority said it would remain shut "for the next few days".
The walls extend for 2.5 miles (4km) and enclose a total area of 263 acres (1.06sqkm).
A council spokesperson said: "We've taken the decision to close part of the city walls.
"The section between Fishergate Postern Tower and Fishergate Bar will remain closed for the next few days on safety grounds as engineers are concerned about the possibility of subsidence. An inspection by a specialist team of experts will take place next week.
"We don't like restricting access to the city walls but our first priority is safety."
