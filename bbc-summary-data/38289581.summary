The four-time world champion, back up to third in the world rankings, lost the first frame but sealed victory with breaks of 64 and 69.
But world number two Stuart Bingham made a shock early exit, losing 4-3 to world number 45 Mark Joyce.
Welshmen Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens and Hong Kong's Marco Fu were other first-round winners.
World number four Judd Trump eased through without dropping a frame against Zhang Yong but Northern Ireland's Mark Allen had to battle back from 3-0 down to avoid an upset from Christopher Keogan.
Anthony McGill enjoyed a good start in his home city, making four 50-plus breaks in his 4-1 victory against John Astley.
Fellow Scot Rhys Clark, ranked 76 in the world, also progressed with a 4-3 win over compatriot Eden Sharav.
There was further Scottish success as Scott Donaldson swept aside Germany's Itaro Santos 4-0 to set up a meeting with Higgins in the second round.
Higgins, seeking a 29th ranking title to move into second place on his own in the overall list behind Stephen Hendry's record of 36, was pleased to overcome his friend McManus.
"Alan has beaten me the last couple of times so I am very pleased to come through," he said. "I feel as if I am into the tournament now and hopefully I can go far.
"I have won two tournaments in Scotland before, I can still remember them and I would love to win this one."
The latest event in the Home Nations Series, the tournament is the first World Snooker ranking event held in Scotland since the World Open in 2010, won by Neil Robertson.
