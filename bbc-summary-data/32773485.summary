South west hospitals fined millions over missed targets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hospitals in the South West are being fined millions of pounds for failing to meet nationally agreed targets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trusts are being penalised for failures over ambulance handover deadlines, accident and emergency waiting times and the speed patients are seen.
Devon hospitals face fines of more than £6.5m and in Cornwall a trust faces a payout in excess of £1m.
Clinical commissioning groups, which levy the fines, say they are in line with "national contract guidance".
Derriford Hospital in Plymouth faced the largest charge of £4.8m but recouped about half the money through compensation for exceptional emergency pressures.
The Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust in Cornwall has been fined more than a million pounds - at a time when it is battling a deficit of £7m.
NHS England sets targets each year with hospitals held to account by their local commissioning bodies.
A spokesman for Cornwall's commissioning group, NHS Kernow, said money from the hospitals "remains in the health system and is reinvested back into schemes that cut re-admissions and help people who are being supported by health and social care".
