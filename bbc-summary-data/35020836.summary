Sheffield Wednesday supporters made the tribute to 18-year-old Caroline Everest in the 18th minute of their home match against Derby County.
Ms Everest disappeared after leaving a nightclub in the city centre on 22 November.
Her body was found in the Porter Brook river two days later.
Ms Everest was a Sheffield Wednesday fan and was studying Biosciences and Chemistry at Sheffield Hallam University.
The cause of her death has not yet been determined after a post-mortem examination proved "inconclusive".
South Yorkshire Police said a 31-year-old man arrested last month on suspicion of rape had been bailed pending further inquiries.
