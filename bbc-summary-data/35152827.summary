The tennis player joked to the BBC Sports Personality of the Year audience on Sunday that the comparison was "a bit harsh on Worthing".
He was speaking after being voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.
Now the official town crier, Bob Smytherman, has invited Murray to find out what the resort has to offer.
He tweeted: "Very harsh on #Worthing but well done Andy Murray on becoming Sports Personality of the Year. You are always welcome in Worthing #SPOTY."
Mr Smytherman then added: "Oyez! Thanks for mention of #Worthing @andy-murray you are welcome to visit us.
"Congratulations on #SPOTY2015 Happy to show you around town."
Murray, who led the Great Britain tennis team to Davis Cup victory, told the audience in Belfast: "I didn't expect this.
"A friend actually sent me a message the other day with an article from a newspaper which said Andy Murray is duller than a weekend in Worthing, which I thought was a bit harsh - to Worthing."
It was the second time Murray had been voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year.
He was presented with the award by Irish boxing legend Barry McGuigan, in front of a sell-out 7,500 crowd at the SSE Arena in Belfast on Sunday evening.
The Pavilion Theatre: One of the premier theatres on the south coast with its position on the promenade at the entrance to Worthing's pier, Visit Worthing says.
The South Downs: Easily accessible from Worthing. The South Downs Way runs from Winchester to Eastbourne and can be accessed at several points around Worthing or Adur.
Waterwise playground: Features seaside themes - a shipwreck, see saw and sand pit area along with rope and pendulum swings.
Kite surfing: "Worthing is a really cool place to live and has become the kite surf capital of the UK," Lewis Crathern, four-time British Kite surfer champion and Worthing resident says.
International Birdman Competition: Ron Freeman won the competition in July with a flight of almost 160m (525ft) in the event which sees people throw themselves off the town's pier in machines and various costumes.
