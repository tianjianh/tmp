All 132 passengers on board the A320 Airbus have left the plane, with 22 taken to hospital for observation and treatment of minor injuries.
Flight AC624 from Toronto arrived shortly after midnight (04:00 GMT) and reportedly hit a power pylon after landing.
Multiple flights into Halifax have been cancelled.
The airport's power was knocked out but Nova Scotia Power say that it has been restored.
There was heavy snow in the area at the time and visibility was poor.
"An aircraft made a poor landing," confirmed Peter Spurway, a spokesperson for Halifax Stanfield airport.
