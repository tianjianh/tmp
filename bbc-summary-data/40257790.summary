Objectors, who expressed their concerns to council planning officials, described the plan as a "threat" to the island.
Tony and Beatrice Porter said they were "aghast" and that the new structure would be viewed as a "carbuncle".
Adrian Bull, who is also against the development, called it "controversial and inappropriate" and said it would "desecrate the scenery and the landscape".
Another local resident, Stuart Watts, described it as a "visually unattractive blockhouse on a highly exposed part of the coastline".
Tony Orchard from the Burgh Island Hotel said: "I felt that the positives, the innovative and exciting design, and the good effects that will have on tourism, outweighed any negatives that would have on the ANOB".
The South West Design Review Panel said it could be "internationally celebrated".
