[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who chased a father with a hammer and left him in the street with "his blood running into the gutter" has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Williams, 31, of no fixed abode, rowed with Russell Peachey, 35, after he saw him arguing with his partner in Grangetown, Cardiff, in August 2015.
He admitted manslaughter, but was found guilty of murder by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court on Tuesday.
Three other men were cleared of Mr Peachey's murder.
The court heard Mr Peachey and his girlfriend Tracey Gill were having a "spirited and animated exchange" on a night out before Williams got involved.
Along with three others, he chased Mr Peachey down the road before attacking him with the hammer.
The father-of-two was later found by a passer-by in the street, with "his blood running into the gutter", the court heard.
Mr Peachey and Ms Gill had been in a relationship for just over a year, but were known to "row a lot".
Vincent Coughlin, prosecuting, said: "When they argued, it seems they didn't much care who was watching.
"The arguments could become physical with pushing."
Dean Beasley, 37, Christopher Smith, 41, of Barry, and Shaminder Singh, 40, of Grangetown, Cardiff, were all cleared of murder.
Jailing Mr Williams for life with a minimum term of 20 years, Judge Keith Thomas said: "Human life cannot be restored.
"No punishment can reconcile a family for their loss. The attack was sustained and savage."
In a statement, Mr Peachey's family said the "suddenness, senselessness and nature" of his death had "shocked and numbed" them.
They described the day he was killed as "the darkest day of our lives", when he was murdered in the area where he grew up, worked and lived.
The former Fitzalan High School pupil had two sons, Dylan, eight and Rylan, seven, while he was stepfather of Ellis.
"He was the kindest person anyone could wish to have in their lives, nothing was too much trouble," the tribute added.
