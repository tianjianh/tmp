Competitors from across the UK, France and Spain took part in the contest at Dunbar last weekend.
Organiser Steve Hill said stone stacking was "the most natural form of street art you can find" and the artists' creations were "breathtaking".
The overall winner was Pedro Duran, of Spain, who managed to balance 33 rocks in one stack.
