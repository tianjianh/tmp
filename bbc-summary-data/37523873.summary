Jamie Clapham: Former Ipswich Town player named Barnsley first team coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Ipswich defender Jamie Clapham has been named first-team coach at Championship side Barnsley on an initial short-term basis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His hiring follows the sacking of Tykes assistant Tommy Wright, who was named in a Daily Telegraph investigation alleging corruption in football.
Wright has denied breaking any law or Football Association and Fifa rules.
Clapham, 40, left his previous role as first-team coach at League One side Coventry on 29 September.
He joined the Sky Blues coaching staff in June 2015, having previously worked alongside manager Tony Mowbray at Middlesbrough.
