The trek from York to East Sussex is due to end on 14 October - the 950th anniversary of the famous clash.
A Saxon-style encampment has been set up in Hyde Park, where there are weapons, food and pottery demonstrations.
The group, which is travelling on foot and horseback, left left York last month.
One actor said: "We've just beaten the most fearsome Viking general the world has ever seen.
"Yes, we're feeling confident."
King Harold defeated a Viking army at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in East Yorkshire, on 25 September, 1066, before travelling south to face the Normans.
On 14 October, he fought and was killed at the Battle of Hastings -the bloodshed of which was later immortalised in the Bayeux Tapestry.
