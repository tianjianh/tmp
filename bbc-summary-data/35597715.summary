[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two of Wales' four police forces have been told they must improve how they keep people safe and reduce crime.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said the Dyfed-Powys and north Wales forces "required improvement".
South Wales and Gwent police forces were ranked "good".
The reviews are part of HMIC's annual inspection of England and Wales' 43 forces.
Police and crime commissioner Christopher Salmon said: "We have more officers investigating the most serious crimes and my Help Hub has increased support for victims.
"There is always more to do but I am confident that Dyfed-Powys is effective and keeping people safe and reducing crime."
Police and crime commissioner Winston Roddick said: "Over five years North Wales saw a 17.4% cut in crime which is better than the England and Wales average reduction of 12.6%.
"The chief constable accepts, as I do, there is always room for improvement and together we must make sure that the improvements recommended by HMIC are carried out as soon as possible."
Police and crime commissioner Ian Johnston said: "It is pleasing to hear that all of that hard work has been recognised by HMIC and that the force has been found to be effective at protecting from harm those who are most vulnerable.
"This report is very good news and the challenge now is to build further still on the findings of the inspectors."
Alun Michael, police and crime commissioner, said: "This report recognises that the priorities set by the chief constable and myself reflect a strong commitment to prevent crime, to support victims and to work in partnership.
"This is set out in our latest Police and Crime Reduction Plan, published last month, which had a strong focus on early intervention and prompt, positive action as well as effective partnership working."
