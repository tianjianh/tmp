[SN]TITLE[SN]
McDonnell rejects 'trivial' tests on Welsh ministers' names

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has said there is much to learn from Welsh Labour ministers - but would not name any, other than Carwyn Jones.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Speaking on his first visit to Wales since his appointment, he said he had been in the post ten days and would not submit to "trivial" name tests.
He said UK Labour could learn about budgets and government administration from Welsh ministers.
Mr McDonnell spoke to BBC Wales during a visit to Merthyr, on Thursday night.
He addressed the Merthyr Trades Union Council later.
Asked who the rest of the Welsh cabinet were, apart from the first minister, Mr McDonnell laughed and said: "I'm coming down to meet them shortly, I'll be going through all of that.
When pressed, he added: "I'm not going into tests of names and all the rest of it, because I'm saying I've been in the post ten days, I'm coming down to meet them all.
"I'm not getting into this sort of trivial politics.
"I want to learn the lessons from what's happening in Wales and I want to listen to people."
Mr McDonnell also said Welsh Labour would decide both his, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's, involvement in the assembly election.
