[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Chancellor George Osborne must set aside funding for a long-term solution to Operation Stack in his forthcoming Autumn Statement, Kent County Council leader Paul Carter has said.

He told the Transport Select Committee that Operation Stack - where parts of the M20 motorway are closed and turned into a lorry park - "decimated" Kent's economy during the summer.
It has been used 32 times in 2015.
Mr Carter said it would cost Â£150m to build a lorry park at junction 11.
Operation Stack was used following strikes by French workers, migrant activity and disruption to rail operations.
The council estimates it has cost the Kent economy Â£45m and Mr Carter said the Kent tourist industry had a 20% drop in business.
Speaking to the committee, he said: "Kent has all the drawbacks of being a corridor to Europe with no advantages - it is a thorough inconvenience to the Kent economy."
David Brewer, from Highways England, said there was a need to find a way to contain up to 7,000 lorries while allowing transport on local roads to flow.
He added that the earlier a solution could be found would be in autumn 2016.
