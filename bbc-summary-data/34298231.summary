Mark Riley, 43, of Heath, Cardiff, died after the collision on Crwys Road, Cathays, at 10:00 BST on Thursday.
In a statement, his family said the plasterer was the "life and soul of the party" who had been expecting the birth of his fourth child and he was due to get married next year.
South Wales Police has asked for witnesses to come forward.
The collision involved a red and white Yamaha R6 motorbike and a blue Nissan Qashqai, with the female car driver also taken to hospital.
Mr Riley's family said he was a keen motorcyclist and passionate fisherman who enjoyed watching rugby.
"Mark was always the life and soul of the party.  His laugh was totally contagious and everybody who met him loved him. He was excitedly looking forward to the birth of his fourth child and was due to be married next year," their statement said.
"Nothing was too much trouble for him - he would literally do anything for anybody."
His family thanked Mr Riley's friends who went to hospital last night to pay their respects in his final hours and the medical staff who tried to save him.
"We are all numb and cannot believe this has happened. 'Once met never forgotten' is a phrase which could have been written to describe Mark," they added.
