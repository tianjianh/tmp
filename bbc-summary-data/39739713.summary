Notts folded on the eve of the Women's Super League One Spring Series season, prompting concern that players would be left without a club for the campaign.
Players told the BBC on Friday that the timing had left them "abandoned".
Four of England's squad for Euro 2017 - Carly Telford, Jo Potter, Laura Bassett and Jade Moore - played for Notts.
A Football Association statement on Thursday said: "The FA can confirm that it has given Notts County Ladies players the opportunity to move to new clubs within England with immediate effect.
"Following Notts County's decision last week to terminate its women's team, the FA has worked closely with the PFA and wider stakeholders to enable players to find new clubs as soon as possible.
"Players are now in a position to sign for new clubs in England. They may also move to leagues in other countries where the transfer window is open."
A statement from the Professional Footballers' Association on Friday had said: "We have also been in discussions with the FA and FAWSL to ensure that players can register with other clubs outside of the transfer window given the exceptional circumstances the players find themselves in due to no fault of their own."
What remains unclear is how many WSL clubs will have contingency within their budgets for the Spring Series to sign additional players.
