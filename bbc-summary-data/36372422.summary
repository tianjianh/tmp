Wales seek redemption for Six Nations England defeat, says Scott Baldwin

Wales will be seeking redemption as well as form when they play England in Sunday's summer tour warm-up match at Twickenham, hooker Scott Baldwin says.

England won 25-21 on their way to a Six Nations Grand Slam in March, outplaying Wales for much of the game.
The teams meet before their respective summer tours to New Zealand and Australia in June.
"It's a chance of redemption and if we win up there it puts us in a good place going into the tour," said Baldwin.
"It's a full-blown test match on Sunday so we've got to be on the money mentally and physically to get a result.
Sunday's game will be the third between the countries - all at Twickenham - since September.
Wales won the first encounter in a World Cup pool match 28-25, before England gained revenge in the Six Nations.
Warren Gatland will be without captain Sam Warburton, France-based Jonathan Davies and Luke Charteris and Exeter prop Tomas Francis who will be on duty for Exeter in the Aviva Premiership final on Saturday.
England coach Eddie Jones has a bigger headache, with six of the squad that beat Wales in March playing for Saracens or Exeter in that final.
It means Wales will face a pack without Maro Itoje, George Kruis and Billy Vunipola and Owen Farrell will be missing behind the scrum.
But Baldwin believes the strength of English rugby means Wales will have to be at their best to get anything out of the game.
"It's almost as if we've had a three-test series against England in the last 12 months so we'll look to leave these shores on a win," he said.
"They are missing a couple of players, but there's a lot of strength-in-depth in England at the moment and the majority of the squad will be there for them at the weekend.
"They have Kruis and Itoje out and they bring in Launchbury and Lawes - they're not inexperienced boys by any means, and they are going to want to put a mark down going forward to their tour to Australia so there are chances for them.
"There are some young faces in there who want to make a big statement as well so I don't think it's going to take anything away from their game at the weekend with their players missing."
Wales play three test matches in New Zealand in June plus a midweek game against Waikato Chiefs.
England also play three games against Australia.
