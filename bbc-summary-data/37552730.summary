A try by Hallam Amos and two by Adam Warren saw the visitors take a 20-7 lead after 35 minutes.
Liam Williams' score just before half-time changed the momentum and Scarlets upped the intensity after the break.
Jonathan Evans scored a superb solo try and Steff Evans added a second to his first half score to secure the bonus point just after the hour.
Sarel Pretorius' try made for a nervy finish and earned Dragons two bonus points, but Scarlets held on for their third consecutive win after losing their opening three games of the season.
The west Wales region move to seventh place in the Pro12 table but Dragons are languishing in 10th, after just one win in six games.
Defensive frailties and patchy quality characterised a game of eight tries and 58 points, but there were eye-catching performances by Dragons wing Amos and Scarlets full-back Williams, both likely to be included in Wales' squad for the autumn internationals.
And man-of-the-match Scott Williams showed glimpses of the form which has made him a key member of Wales squads in recent seasons.
After falling behind to Steff Evans' try within two minutes of the start, Dragons found themselves in control after Amos burst through some weak tackling and Warren scored twice in four minutes - the first brilliantly made by Amos.
Liam Williams' score just before the interval was the turning point, although television replays showed he had knocked the ball on in the build-up to the try. But his finish was typically dynamic.
It took Scarlets until the hour mark to finally get themselves ahead when replacement scrum-half Jonathan Evans exploited slack blind-side defending to dash over from 20 metres.
Scarlets face Sale Sharks in the European Champions Cup next week, while Dragons - promising much but not quite delivering - face Brive in the Challenge Cup.
