Nepal's mountains off limits to farmers and tourists

Silence rings out in the mountains of Nepal as hundreds of thousands of people wait in the valleys, hoping to return to their villages.

They were displaced after the massive earthquake on 25 April, which triggered landslides which buried their families and settlements.
Deep cracks and fissures on mountain slopes have also kept people away.
"Some of the cracks are so big that you cannot just cross them," said farmer Karma Singh Tamang, pointing at a massive landslide which swept away his and neighbouring settlements in Haku village of Rasuwa district.
"If you fell into those cracks, your body will simply disappear deep below, we cannot even think of going back there."
Scientists have already recorded more than 3,000 landslides caused by the earthquake and warn that monsoon rains could cause more.
A massive landslip in Taplejung district caused by initial monsoon rains last week claimed nearly 40 lives.
And Taplejung did not even bear the full force of the earthquake.
Geologists say the impact of rain on mountains that have been directly hit by the quake will be much greater.
The epicentres of the main earthquake on 25 April and major aftershock on 12 May were in the mountains in central Nepal.
Scientists have found that a swathe of the Himalayas in the region dropped by up to 1.5m (5ft) because of the earthquake.
"When that happened to the high Himalayas, imagine what might have happened to the mountain ranges just below them where we lived," said Saraswati Tamang, a local leader of Haku village in Rasuwa district bordering Tibet.
"The landslides and cracks have totally changed our landscapes and we are left wondering how can we go back to those places and build our houses there and do farming again."
Foreign aid workers say flattening the mountain slopes to make them habitable and arable once again has been a major challenge because of the difficult topography.
Tourists were among those killed in the quake, with the highest number of foreigner deaths in Rasuwa district in the Langtang valley, a major trekking destination.
Sangbu Tamang owned the biggest hotel in the valley.
He was away on business when the earthquake struck and destroyed his livelihood.
"We were the biggest donor to Buddhist monasteries in the region and now we are seeking donations so that we can feed ourselves and have shelter," he said in a makeshift camp in Kathmandu.
"I have managed to survive but have now been thrown to the streets by the force of the nature."
The Annapurna region in western Nepal avoided the worst ravages but landslides on some mountain slopes have caused concern.
An aftershock last month caused a massive landslip (a smaller landslide) in the region's Myagdi district which blocked the Kali Gandaki river that joins the Ganges in India.
It threatened settlements and infrastructures downstream but the river found a small outlet and the lake has shrunk.
However, continued landslips are still a major threat and monsoon rains could raise the risk.
"Landslips apart, the earthquakes have also caused cracks in the mountains," said Professor Biswo Shrestha, a geographer with Prithvi Narayan Campus, pointing at one such crack beside the Seti River on the outskirts of Pokhara.
"Due to the loose composition of the mountains in the region, the earthquake has had impacts like that and we need to identify such dangers and keep people safe."
The government has re-opened some Unesco world heritage sites in the Kathmandu valley but the mountains remain off limits as people are too frightened to go back.
The city of Pokhara is a major tourist hub and gateway to the Annapurna region.  It's normally bustling but the streets are now empty with few tourists around.
Aaron McKee from Northern Ireland is one of the exceptions. He has been trekking in the region for the past month and says he has no safety concerns.
"People need to come back to the Annapurna circuit and the Annapurna base camp, they are open and they are all good, it's just bad reporting," he said.
"These areas have not been affected by the earthquake, and the tourism industry needs people to come back."
The Trekking Agents Association of Nepal has sought a scientific assessment of the earthquake-hit areas by top international geologists so it can declare which regions are safe.
"We have bought into that idea and are now working to secure funds to conduct such a comprehensive study," said department of tourism director general Tulsi Prasad Gautam.
The tourism industry is influential given its significant contribution to the country's foreign exchange earnings.
But for the hundreds of thousands of farmers displaced from their homes on the mountain slopes, it may not be as easy.
They will have to wait for what the government and donor agencies can do for them - and also for the mountains to settle.
