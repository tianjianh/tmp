[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham captain Mark Noble has called the win over Swansea their "biggest in a few years", as his team moved eight points clear of the relegation places.

Cheikhou Kouyate scored the only goal at London Stadium, as the Hammers ended a run of five straight defeats.
West Ham are 14th with six games left and midfielder Noble says one more win should secure their top-flight status.
"We haven't been good enough for a couple of months, but this should release the pressure," he said.
Before Saturday's game, Slaven Bilic's side had gone seven matches without a victory and won only one in nine to be dragged into the relegation battle.
There had been speculation about the Croat manager's future, but the club released a statement saying they had "100% faith" in him.

Swansea stay 18th after the defeat, while West Ham next face bottom club Sunderland on 15 April.
"That's our biggest win in a few years," said 29-year-old Noble.
"I thought we played well under pressure. Swansea were only a few points behind us. It was so important.
"One more win should see us safe. Hopefully we've broken that run of losses - games we shouldn't have lost.
"Sunderland away is massive and then we have some tough games."
