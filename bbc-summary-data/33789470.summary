The men used an axe to break through the door of Spaldwick service station in Cambridgeshire at 03:30 BST on Monday, stealing cash, cigarettes and a drinks machine.
They then set the store on fire. A member of staff on duty was shaken but unhurt, police said.
A burnt-out 4x4 car believed to have been used was found later in Corby.
The three men drove up to the station on the A14 westbound carriageway in a dark Honda 4x4 vehicle, Cambridgeshire Police said.
The station was open, but was offering a night-hatch only service, so the men broke in using an axe.
They told a member of staff, who was working alone, to show them where the safe was.
After taking money and other items they covered the rear of the store in an unknown fluid and set it alight.
Four fire crews were called out to tackle the blaze.
"The main building was well alight and heavy smoke was issuing. The forecourt was not affected and fuel pumps were isolated," a spokesman from Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service said.
A burnt-out vehicle was discovered in Northamptonshire at about 05:00 BST.
"We suspect this may have been the vehicle used in the crime so I would appeal for anyone who saw it before or after the crime to contact police," Det Sgt Sarah Sleaford said.
"This was a terrifying experience for the member of staff at the filling station, which was destroyed by the fire."
