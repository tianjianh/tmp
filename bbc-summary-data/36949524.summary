Torquay United 1-0 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ben Gerring's first Torquay United goal was enough to give the Gulls all three points at home to Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The centre back powered home a header from Aman Verma's corner shortly before half-time to seal Torquay's first win of the season.
Adam Cunnington's header just before Gerring's goal was Bromley's best chance, as the Gulls deservedly won.
Brett Williams hit the bar on his home debut while Dan Sparkes and Nathan Blissett went close after the break.
