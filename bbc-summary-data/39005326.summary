A man has been arrested on suspicion of arson over a fire which destroyed a Grade II-listed church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Church of the Ascension in Lower Broughton, Salford, was gutted by a blaze on Sunday night.
A 22-year-old man has been arrested and bailed until 30 March pending further police inquiries.
Det Sgt Karl Dalton said officers want to speak to anyone who may have seen "a group of youths on bikes near to the church around the time of the fire".
The fire, which began at about 23:00 GMT on Sunday, took firefighters several hours to bring under control.
Following the blaze, the top part of the two gable ends of the church, which was built in 1869, were dismantled to make it safe.
