Surrey A22 reopens after weeks of improvement works

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Surrey trunk road has reopened after repairs caused weeks of delays for frustrated motorists.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The reconstruction and drainage improvement works on the A22 Godstone bypass were completed on Tuesday, more than three weeks later than scheduled.
Drivers had complained about unacceptable traffic gridlock in Caterham, Tandridge and Godstone since its closure on 4 January.
The work was held up when the foundations were found to be dangerous.
It was necessary as the bypass was previously subject to flooding.
