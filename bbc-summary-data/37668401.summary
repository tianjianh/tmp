[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elgin City moved to within three points of Scottish League Two leaders Forfar with a 5-0 win away to nine-man Montrose.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They took advantage of Forfar's 2-0 loss to Arbroath, a result that pushed the Red Lichties into the top four.
Edinburgh City are still without a win after a 1-0 home defeat to Clyde.
Cowdenbeath and Annan Athletic drew 2-2, while Berwick Rangers dropped down to fifth in the table after a goalless draw away to Stirling Albion.
Darryl McHardy scored twice for Elgin within the first 20 minutes before Bryan Cameron added a third at Links Park.
If it was not bad enough for Montrose, Gary Fraser received a second yellow card before half-time, and after Cameron and Shane Sutherland had made it 5-0, Callum MacDonald was also red carded.
Bobby Linn hit the bar with a penalty for Arbroath, before Ryan McCord also failed to convert from the spot following Jamie Bain's dismissal.
However, they finally broke the deadlock through David Cox's own goal, and a Martin Scott header sealed the points.
Edinburgh City looked like they were going to secure just their fourth point of the season up until Sean Higgins found the net for visitors Clyde with a right footed shot from a corner kick.
Annan were looking good for three points after holding a 2-0 half-time lead following Barry Cuddihy and David McKenna's strikes.
Kyle Miller's headed Cowdenbeath back into the game, then in the final 10 minutes Nikolay Todorov levelled.
At Forthbank Stirling Albion and Berwick Rangers mustered just one shot on target each, with Kevin McKinlay sent off two minutes into injury time for a poor challenge on Bryan Hodge.
