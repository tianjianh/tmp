Edmund, who reached the fourth round in New York last year, impressively defeated Dutch 32nd seed Robin Haase 6-3 7-5 6-3 in under two hours.
Norrie progressed when Dmitry Tursunov retired when trailing 7-6 (9-7) 6-1.
But Watson was beaten 6-4 6-4 by Alize Cornet before Johanna Konta was knocked out by Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic.
World number 42 Edmund is the highest-ranked British male player in the tournament after the withdrawal of Andy Murray.
The 22-year-old arrived at Flushing Meadows after a semi-final appearance at last week's Winston-Salem Open, meaning his victory over Haase was his eighth match in nine days.
He told Eurosport: "I was very tired this morning. I have played a lot of matches. My coach said today is not about tactics, it's about mentality.
"I had to drink a can of cola to get my sugar up, but then I started to get into the match."
Edmund took the first set in 35 minutes, but encountered more of a challenge from his 30-year-old opponent in the second.
The Briton served for the set at 5-4 but was broken as Haase levelled at 5-5. However, Edmund won the next two games and the set, before racing to victory in the third.
"I managed my game well," he added. "I would have liked to have been more solid, but I saved break points.
"To come and win in three straight sets against a guy like Haase, I am pleased with it."
Edmund will play Steve Johnson in the second round, after the American beat Nicolas Almagro in straight sets.
The pair met in the Winston-Salem quarter-finals, with Edmund winning in three sets.
Watson was broken in the opening game on court four and although she saved three set points at 3-5, her French opponent served out the set.
The 25-year-old twice recovered breaks in the second set but lost serve again at 4-4 before Cornet sealed victory in one hour and 36 minutes.
Watson's serve let her down, with seven double faults, including four in a row in the second set. Her first-serve percentage was only 47%.
She has now lost all seven of her main-draw singles matches at Flushing Meadows.
Cornet, ranked 46, faces two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in round two after the Czech beat 2008 finalist Jelena Jankovic 7-5 7-5.
South Africa-born Norrie's victory over Tursunov will nearly double his 2017 prize money, with a guaranteed $77,000. Another win will double his career prize money.
The 22-year-old, who is ranked 225 in the world - 400 places above Tursunov, won a tight opening set on court 14 before racing through the second.
Tursunov, who called for the trainer while trailing 4-1 in the second set, retired with a knee injury at the start of the third set, handing the British number five his maiden Grand Slam win.
Norrie said: "I was really nervous this morning so I just had to tough out the first set and I relaxed a bit in the second. I'm stoked to be through and in the second round."
He faces Spain's world number 19 Pablo Carreno Busta in round two on Wednesday.
