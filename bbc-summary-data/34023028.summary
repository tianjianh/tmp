Northern Ireland man Kris Meeke's hopes of holding on to his Citroen drive for next season suffered another blow at the German Rally on Friday.

After a promising start, Meeke slid off during stage six and the damage to his car led to him dropping to 25th spot - more than 10 minutes off the pace.
Meeke earned his first World Rally win in Argentina in April but since that has suffered a series of mishaps.
Citroen boss Yves Matton has said that Meeke's seat for 2016 is under threat.
In a recent interview, Matton said that Meeke's crashes in Italy, Poland and Finland had "completely destroyed" the value of his win in Argentina, which was the first victory by a Briton in a WRC event since the late Colin McRae's triumph in Kenya in 2002.
Meeke lost around 90 seconds because of Friday's crash on stage six but after the car initially appeared largely unaffected, problems quickly developed as he lost several more minutes on the next two stages.
By the end of Friday's action, he was 10 minutes and two seconds behind leader Sebastien Ogier.
Meeke was in third spot in the Rally of Finland three weeks ago when he crashed out on stage 16.
World champion Ogier is 9.5 seconds ahead of his Volkswagen team-mate Jar-Matti Latvala after day one with the other member of their team Andreas Mikkelsen in third spot.
