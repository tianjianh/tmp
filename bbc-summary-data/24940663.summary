Oldest person in UK Grace Jones dies aged 113

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The oldest person in the UK, Grace Jones, has died at the age of 113, her MP Simon Hughes has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Londoner, born on 7 December 1899, was the last living British person to be born in the 1800s.
Miss Jones who lived in Bermondsey, south-east London, and was the sixth oldest person in the world, had a fall a few weeks ago and was treated at St Thomas' Hospital.
Mr Hughes said her memory and intellect were "undimmed" until the end.
Miss Jones was engaged during World War One but her fiancÃ© died on active service, said Mr Hughes, Liberal Democrat MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, who visited her with other friends on Wednesday.
She worked as a seamstress and for the government during and after World War Two, until her retirement about 50 years ago, he said.
Mr Hughes said: "Grace's friends and neighbours and the wider Bermondsey community are very sad at the news of Grace's death.
"But we pay tribute to Grace for her wonderful long life, for her commitment to her faith, her family and her community, and we know that a woman of such strong Christian faith faced death with no fear."
He said that although she found her failing strength frustrating, right up until her last week she was mentally "as bright as a button with a brilliant memory".
She lived in her own flat until a few weeks ago and until a few years ago still did her own shopping.
Mr Hughes said enormous thanks were due to her neighbours, Carol and Sue, her friends Ron and Eileen, Joan and Fred and Sandra and Trevor.
He added: "All those who met Grace knew they had met one of London's most doughty individuals and she will never be forgotten."
Miss Jones's death means the oldest living British person is Ethel Lang, from Barnsley, who was born in May 1900.
