[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mayfair squatters granted time to fight eviction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of squatters has been given time to seek legal advice about their fight against eviction from offices in Mayfair.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 40 people have been squatting in 16 Grosvenor Street. Leaseholders Quintain want them removed.
But a spokesperson for the squatters said many of them were "vulnerable".
At the High Court, Mr Justice Henderson adjourned the case until Wednesday while the group see if they have any defence under Human Rights legislation.
Property firm Quintain had asked the judge to grant them possession and order the squatters to leave.
Barrister Katie Helmore told the court the company had become concerned about the situation after a recent fire at the building and one of the squatters had been arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm.
She opposed any adjournment and said the squatters had no defence to the application for possession.
But Jed Miller, 23, who represented the group said it was in the "interests of natural justice" to allow them time to seek legal advice as the occupants were "vulnerable" and some had physical and mental health problems.
The case will resume on Wednesday.
