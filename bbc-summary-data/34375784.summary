Rugby World Cup 2015: England 'united' despite Wales loss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England must stay "united" and focus on next weekend's "knockout" World Cup game with Australia after losing to Wales, says boss Stuart Lancaster.

The hosts squandered a 10-point lead as Wales won 28-25 at Twickenham, and defeat on Saturday could all but end their hopes of qualifying from Pool A.
"We've got a massive game now to build to," said Lancaster.
"There's a lot of frustration in the changing room and that frustration has to be turned into a positive mindset."
England, who led 22-12 early in the second half against Wales, have been criticised for the ill-discipline that allowed Dan Biggar to kick his side back into contention.
Biggar succeeded with all eight of his kicks, seven of which were penalties - including a 50-metre effort that put Wales into the lead in the final minutes.
Lancaster said he was "hugely disappointed" after letting a winning position slip.
"We gave a couple of penalties away which allowed Wales to build belief and momentum. Wales did well to score the points at the end and we didn't close out the game," he said.
England captain Chris Robshaw's decision to opt for touch in the final minutes instead of attempting a penalty kick, which could have secured a draw, has also been questioned.
Lancaster described the 78th-minute driving line-out that followed as "poorly executed", and said he would review the team's decision-making.
"Games are never won and lost on one decision, but obviously that was a big moment," he said.
"Lots of decisions we made were good, but decision-making at the breakdown and to give penalties away, and decision-making as to whether to go for goal or the corner are all things that players have to make in the heat of the battle.
"The one thing I would do is never hang any of the players out to dry for making those decisions. We'll review them privately, not publicly. We stay united."
Injury-hit Wales host Fiji at the Millennium Stadium on Thursday and should Warren Gatland's men secure their third win, England will have to beat the Wallabies to retain any hope of progressing into the knockout stages.
"If we said to the players you can play again tomorrow, they'd play tomorrow because they're so frustrated and disappointed having lost that game having been in such a dominant position so there'll be no problem with the mentality of the players," Lancaster added.
"It's a massive game for us and everyone knows the stakes, so I'll have no problems getting the players ready - 100% we'll be ready."
Number eight Billy Vunipola and lock Courtney Lawes both sustained knee injuries on Saturday and are "50-50" to be fit to face Australia.
Scrum-half Ben Youngs, who injured an ankle, has a slightly better chance, according to Lancaster.
Lancaster said he would announce the team on Thursday to give centre Jonathan Joseph the "best chance" to gain selection after missing the Wales match with a pectoral injury.
"Hopefully Ben Morgan and JJ will be fit again and we can consider them but Ben Youngs, Courtney Lawes and Billy Vunipola are doubts," he said.
"To a certain extent your selection is dictated by your injury situation, but clearly if someone like JJ is fit he's a high-quality player and we'd want him back in the team."
