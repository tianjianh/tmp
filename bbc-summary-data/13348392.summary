The Poppy Calls service, run by the Royal British Legion, aims to help people stay independent in their own home.
Last year, more than 13,000 people across south and mid Wales had a free-of-charge visit by the charity's handyman, based in Aberystwyth.
The charity is also advertising for a second fitter, in Swansea.
The launch of the north Wales service was held in Wrexham on Tuesday.
It is open to anyone who has served or is currently serving in the armed forces as well as widows, widowers, co-habiting partners and civil partners.
Typical jobs carried out range from changing light bulbs and tap washers; putting up shelves, curtain rails and grab rails;  fitting smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors; and fitting and changing door locks and other security features.
Poppy Calls staff can also build access ramps and sheds, and install care phones.
Mike Greenwood, the legion's county manager for north Wales, said 4.4m elderly people in the UK were eligible for the legion's support.
He said: "Many of these people find it difficult to maintain the lifestyle they once had in their own homes and Poppy Calls enables those people to feel safe and secure.
"A service like Poppy Calls is great value to our beneficiaries, especially during economically testing times. It will go from strength to strength as it continues to be rolled out in Wales."
