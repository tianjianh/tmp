[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UKIP's support has plummeted in the town which saw the highest Brexit result in the UK.

Leader Paul Nuttall won just 3,308 votes in Boston and Skegness- more than 10,000 votes less than the party's result in the 2015 General Election.
The Tories won the seat with a 16,500 majority and all others in Lincolnshire, except in Lincoln.
Sitting MP Karl McCartney lost to Labour's Karen Lee who won with a 1,538 majority.
Ahead of the count, Mr Nuttall hit out at Theresa May on Twitter, writing: "If the exit poll is true then Theresa May has put Brexit in jeopardy. I said at the start this election was wrong."

Boston saw the highest Brexit result in the UK during last year's referendum, with 75.6% voting to exit the EU. The town has seen an influx of eastern European workers in recent years.
Conservative Matt Warman was re-elected with 27,271 votes - up 19.8%.
Labour's Paul Kenny finished second with 10,699 votes.
While most seats in Lincolnshire have remained Tory over the decades, Lincoln has regularly changed hands between Labour and the Conservatives.
It is a so-called bellwether constituency, and has mirrored the national swing in British general elections since 1974.
After the count, Mr McCartney, who took the seat from Labour in 2010, declined to comment, but shortly after tweeted: "I lost".
