A cat has been shot in the neck with an air rifle in Liverpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nine-year-old Polly was targeted in the Liverpool Road and Tiger Court Business Park area, in Huyton, on 23 November before 13:00 GMT, the RSPCA said.
She was taken to the vets by her owners after she returned home walking abnormally and bleeding.
A pellet was found lodged in the vertebrae of her neck, which the RSPCA said could have been fatal, and she underwent surgery.
She is now in a stable condition.
RSPCA inspector Claire Fisher said: "The pellet was only 5mm away from severing her spinal cord. Polly must have suffered terribly, but in some ways she has had a lucky escape.
"Many cats shot in this way are fatally wounded and do not survive."
Insp Fisher added: "Anyone caught deliberately using an airgun to injure an animal can be given up to six months in prison and/or a Â£20,000 fine if found guilty under the Animal Welfare Act."
Anyone with information is asked to call the RSPCA inspector appeal line on 0300 123 8018.
