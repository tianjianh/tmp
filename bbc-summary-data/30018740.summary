The man targeted the 57-year-old victim at a newsagent's in Crossways, Hounslow in west London, on 5 November.
He made off with cash and cigarettes after the shopkeeper pressed the panic alarm.
Police believe the robbery may be linked to a similar incident at the same newsagent's on Sunday, and another at a barber's a week earlier.
Police said the suspect is an Asian male, aged between 20 and 25. He is about 6ft and was wearing black clothing but his trainers had red laces.
