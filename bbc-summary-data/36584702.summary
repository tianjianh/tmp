A short while ago the pound was up 0.45% at $1.476, having hit $1.479, its highest since January 4, the first trading day of the year.
On Monday the pound jumped the most in a single day against the dollar in seven years.
The currency market has been reacting to polls which have recently suggested the Remain campaign gaining ground.
Last week the pound was trading close to $1.41, its lowest level since early April.
On Monday, against the euro, the pound gained 0.2% to â‚¬1.301.
Bookmaker Betfair and Ladbrokes show a 73% chance that the UK will vote to remain in the European Union.
Analysts said that a vote to leave the EU would likely lead to a sharp drop in the pound.
"If the UK does leave the EU, there will uncertainty from a political standpoint and a fiscal and monetary policy standpoint. This would drive investors from the pound into other currencies as it loses the safe haven effect it has come to enjoy over the last number of years," said independent markets analyst Brenda Kelly.
On Friday Betfair was predicting a 65% chance of a British exit.
French bank Credit Agricole recommended caution when trading the pound ahead of the referendum, but said a vote to remain in the EU would lead to further strong gains for the currency.
"We are advising our clients to go neutral into the vote, although we remain constructive," said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Credit Agricole.
"If 'Remain' wins we expect sterling to rise to $1.55."
A vote to remain in the EU would reassure investors who were unsettled by the prospects of uncertainty caused by a vote to leave.
The pound had slid sharply over the course of last week, after polls appeared to indicate the Leave campaign was taking the lead.
