Jamie Mines, from Frome, was injured at Kendrick Industrial Estate, Swindon, in December.
The Health and Safety Executive is investigating.
The semi-professional footballer remains in hospital and missed his first Christmas with his five-month-old twins Isabella and Savannah.
His friend Ian Kennedy, who set the page up, initially put a target of £20,000 but after Mr Mines' second hand was amputated, it was raised to £100,000.
On Wednesday, he wrote: "I'm sorry to say that Jamie has now had to have both hands removed along with one of his legs in order to keep him alive.
"We have now increased the target on his GoFundMe page to £100k to help his partner and two young girls."
Mr Mines was placed in an induced coma and also had the toes on his remaining foot removed.
He is recovering in the intensive care unit at Southmead Hospital in Bristol.
Mr Mines is well-known locally as he plays for Frome Town, Radstock, Larkhall and Paulton football clubs and is described as a "goal machine".
Mr Kennedy added: "To have your life change in the blink of an eye is devastating for Jamie and all of his family.
"Our heart goes out to them because we know the road ahead of him is going to be a difficult one.
"We pray he can keep his head up and stay strong and know he has love, support, and prayers behind him."
