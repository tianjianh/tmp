Les Rees, 41, crashed into Terry Hill's BMW on the A4233 bypass in Wattstown, Porth, on 16 June.
Rees, from Ferndale, admitted being under the influence of alcohol and dangerous driving.
He was jailed at Merthyr Crown Court for eight years and banned from driving for 14 years.
The court heard he had 155mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood. The legal limit is 80.
Mr Hill's wife, Joanna Hill, said it had been "a traumatic time" for the family.
She said: "No sentence given by the court would ever replace the loss of Terry or repair the total devastation caused by Mr Rees' actions on that night."
South Wales Police Insp Steve Davies said the family had "shown considerable strength" throughout the investigation.
He added: "It is highly probable that had Mr Rees not consumed alcohol that day, this tragedy would have been avoided.
"We are grateful to the witnesses who came forward to assist us in the investigation that led to the conviction of Mr Rees."
