London 'super head' Greg Wallace resigns after IT contract allegations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "super head" who was suspended during an investigation into IT contracts at five east London primary schools has resigned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greg Wallace, of Best Start Federation schools, was sent home in July amid claims he awarded a contract to C2 Technology, a company run by a man he had a close personal relationship with.
Mr Wallace's resignation will take effect from 31 December.
Hackney Council said its investigation into the allegations would continue.
Mr Wallace, an executive principal, was suspended on full pay in July and, in his absence, the five schools he managed - Burbage, Whitmore, Mandeville, London Fields and Woodberry Down - were run by their individual head teachers and Hackney Learning Trust (HLT).
At the time a statement on the federation's website said Mr Wallace was "always open" about his connection with C2 Technology and the "contract was judged on its value and its quality".
Following his letter of resignation Mr Wallace said his job was the "hardest thing I ever did - but also the best. It is a job I am very proud to have done."
He also said he hoped that under the new leadership all five schools would gain and maintain "outstanding" grading from Ofsted.
Councillor Rita Krishna, Hackney Council Cabinet Member for Education and Children's Services, said: "Our priority is to ensure that children's education is not disrupted.
"Steve Belk, former Chief Executive of The Learning Trust, has been appointed to support Best Start Federation until the investigation process has concluded.
"We will publish the findings of the investigation in due course which will include any relevant disciplinary action in its recommendations."
Previously, education secretary Michael Gove described Mr Wallace as one of a "magnificent seven" head teachers running outstanding schools in deprived areas.
