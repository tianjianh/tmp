Wigan Athletic: Derby's Stephen Warnock to complete move on one-year contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Athletic are to complete the signing of on-loan Derby County defender Stephen Warnock on a one-year contract, to commence on 1 July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The twice-capped ex-England left-back, 34, first joined the Latics on loan until the end of the season in March.
But, having played the final 11 matches to help Gary Caldwell's side return to the Championship, they were keen to make the deal more permanent.
"Bringing Stephen permanently was one of our immediate priorities," he said.
"His experience will be invaluable to the squad in the Championship, a league he knows very well. Everyone saw for themselves his contribution last season."
Ormskirk-born Warnock, who played 40 first-team games for Liverpool after coming through the academy, moved on to Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa and Leeds United before joining Derby on an 18-month deal in January 2015.
Subject to him passing a medical, Warnock will officially become a Wigan Athletic player when his Derby contract expires on the final day of June, having not been offered a new deal.
He becomes the first deal to be done for next season by the Latics since returning to the Championship as League One champions.
Warnock added: "I really enjoyed my time on loan. We achieved something great, so I can't wait to work with the gaffer and this group of players again."
