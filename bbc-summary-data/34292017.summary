Sam Amin, 18, fell into the river after a night out in Bath last September.
Since then safety railings have been placed along the stretch of river where six people have drowned since 2009.
Laurence Tindall, who will design the memorial, said: "We want people to think quietly about the people who lost their lives in the river and how young they all were."
The monument will be placed at the spot where Mr Amin died and will be part of the revamp of Bath Quays, near Churchill Bridge.
Mr Tindall is in talks with Bath and North East Somerset Council to settle on a final design.
A spokesman from Bath and North East Somerset Council said: "The council is working with Sammuel Amin's family to define the most appropriate form and location for the memorial, which is expected to be installed within the new Bath Quays Park by the end of 2016."
Attempts will be made to contact other bereaved families to see if they want inscriptions dedicated to their loved ones added to the artwork.
"We can't approach the families directly, it's a very sensitive area - we have to approach them through the police formally," said Mr Tindall.
"I'm sure it will give them a great deal of comfort to know that there is something permanent, so it will not only remember him but the other young men who have died and to help people to think about river safety and take due care when they're beside the water."
The project is expected to take at least a year to complete.
The family has now opened an appeal to help pay for the memorial costs and the council has agreed to pay for the installation.
Mr Amin's memorial service takes place at St Michael's Church, Twerton on Saturday morning.
