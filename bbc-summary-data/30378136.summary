A Pride event has been planned for Portsmouth, years after the last one took place.

Organisers hope the parade and celebrations next June will "bring the whole community together".
David Lee-Bastable, chairman of Portsmouth LGBT Pride, said he believed the last event took place in 2003.
The festivities will feature a parade starting and ending at Victoria Park and stalls and performances in Guildhall Square.
The organisers are in discussions with Portsmouth City Council, as needs to happen with any event of this size, and it will need to be approved early next year.
Mr Lee-Bastable said: "We want to get everyone involved, not just the LGBT community.
"We felt that the time was right and I think Portsmouth needs it.
"It's a good opportunity for the city to turn around and say 'we support the LGBT community' and it also helps people to come together.
"The idea of Pride is to take away homophobic attitudes. It is just our sexuality that is different, we are trying to celebrate that.
"We want to make sure Portsmouth has a Pride."
The group's members are volunteering their time and Mr Lee-Bastable said they were looking for stewards and a treasurer and asked people to get in touch via their Facebook page.
