The 39-year-old moved ahead of the retired Peyton Manning on the list, which includes regular and post-season games, with Brett Favre third on 199.
Brady, in his 17th season, took 264 career games to set the record, while Manning needed 293 games for his 200.
"That's what it's all about - winning," said Patriots coach Bill Belichick.
Brady, who threw a touchdown pass in Sunday's victory, is a four-time Super Bowl winner and last week became only the fifth NFL quarterback to reach 60,000 passing yards.
"He still comes to work like he hasn't accomplished anything," said Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler.
Brady returned in October after serving a four-match suspension for his role in a scheme to deflate match balls to give his side an advantage.
