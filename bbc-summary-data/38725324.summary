The news was confirmed by Glenavon on Monday night as they revealed Mitchell would move to the club he supported as a boy on a three-year deal.
Dungannon boss Rodney McAree has been resigned to losing the striker.
"Joining the team I supported as a kid is an absolute dream," Mitchell told Glenavon's website.
"I'm really looking forward to getting back to Mourneview and playing from the start of next season."
Mitchell has scored 19 goals for Dungannon this season and he has vowed to give his all for the Tyrone club during the remainder of this season.
"Rodney (McAree) has been absolutely fantastic and everybody at Dungannon Swifts has been very supportive.
"It's been a very difficult decision to make over the last wee while."
Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton expressed "delight" at convincing the striker to move to Mourneview Park.
