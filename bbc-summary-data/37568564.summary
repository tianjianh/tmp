An outbreak of E.coli O157 which affected children in the Carnoustie area has been officially declared over.

NHS Tayside said the source of the initial outbreak has still not been identified but "rigorous action" has been taken to minimise further risk.
A small number of children were affected by the bug and were quarantined in Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, according to the health board.
The outbreak centred on a playgroup and a primary school in the town.
Public health medicine consultant Dr Jackie Hyland said: "The incident management team have formally declared the incident as over.
"Investigations have not identified a source of the initial outbreak but rigorous action has been taken to minimise any further potential risk before a playgroup in Angus, which closed on a precautionary basis, reopens.
"We would like to thank parents and the local community for their tremendous support throughout this investigation, which has helped us manage this incident and ensure the prevention of the spread of infection."
A possible link with a national outbreak in which a three-year-old girl from Dunbartonshire died and 21 other people were infected formed part of the investigation.
NHS Tayside has refused to disclose the number of children affected, citing patient confidentiality.
