[SN]TITLE[SN]
Special school teacher in court over child cruelty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 59-year-old teacher at Parkview special school has appeared before Lisburn Magistrates Court accused of cruelty against children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Downes of Glebe Gardens in Moira is alleged to have assaulted three children on five occasions between October 2010 and March 2011.
The court heard from a classroom assistant who said she had heard thuds, crying and screaming while Mr Downes was alone in a room with a pupil.
Mr Downes denies the charges.
The classroom assistant told the court she assumed from the noises that Mr Downes had pinned the pupil to the ground.
However, a lawyer for the teacher questioned why there had been a delay between the incident and the classroom assistant reporting it.
She said she did not know why there had been a delay.
The case has been adjourned.
