The 2018 National Eisteddfod could be held in Cardiff Bay without the traditional Maes (field).

If the plan goes ahead it is understood that the cultural festival will not have a perimeter fence or charge an entrance fee, BBC Wales has learned.
Organisers are hoping to use buildings such as Wales Millennium Centre, rather than temporary pavilions and marquees, to host the competitions and events.
The Eisteddfod travels to a different location in Wales every summer.
It has traditionally been held inside a perimeter fence, with temporary buildings housing the events, shops and performance spaces for the week-long festival.
Cardiff Bay is one of a small number of sites in the city to make the shortlist, with a final decision expected this weekend.
A traditional Maes on playing fields in Pontcanna is also under consideration, which was the location of the Eisteddfod's last visit to the capital city in 2008.
The Eisteddfod Council will meet in Aberystwyth on Saturday to decide the final location of the 2018 event.
In an interview last year, the Eisteddfod's chief executive Elfed Roberts revealed he would like to try and hold the event in Cardiff without a traditional Maes.
Organisers hope the lack of a perimeter fence in 2018 would attract more visitors, including those who wouldn't ordinarily attend. But any savings made on using existing buildings will need to match the losses incurred by not charging an entry fee
