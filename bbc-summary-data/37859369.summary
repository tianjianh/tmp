Alsop, 20, consolidated a place at the top of the county's batting order in 2016, scoring his maiden County Championship century in September.
McManus, 22, became Hampshire's first-choice keeper during the 2016 season, scoring more than 400 runs in Division One and claiming 26 dismissals.
"It's nice to repay the faith shown in me," McManus told the club website.
