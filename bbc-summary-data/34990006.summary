Chris Nelson, 24, who was from the Midlothian area, was last seen early on Sunday 15 November.
He had been in the city with his fiancÃ©e Stephanie Kollross to visit their friend.
Search crews using sonar equipment found his body in an area around the Oudeschans canal. His family have been informed.
He was last seen by Ms Kollross after he decided to go for a walk early in the morning after complaining he could not get to sleep.
His family, who had received a text message from him about an hour before his disappearance, later travelled to Amsterdam to join the search for him and made an emotional appeal on Dutch TV.
A Facebook appeal was also launched to try to trace him but on Wednesday a message was posted saying his body had been identified.
It read: "It is with the deepest, saddest regret that I have to inform you all that the body pulled from the Amsterdam canal. Is that of Chris Nelson.
"Chris's family would again like to thank everyone for their support but would appreciate some privacy at this time."
