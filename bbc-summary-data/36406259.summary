"It was a great competition." Thomas told BBC Sport. "I think we all did our job there."

Smith, on pommel, and Wilson, on parallel bars, both contributed major scores of 15.966.
There were also scores of more than 15 for Tulloch and Wilson on rings, Purvis on floor and Thomas on vault.
"I think there's a lot we can take from this competition," said Smith, who is optimistic about the British men's team's chances of success at the Olympics in Rio.
"We did 18 clean routines and we're not at full capacity yet. We're eight weeks from Rio so I think we're doing fantastically well."
World pommel champion Max Whitlock withdrew from the team with a virus and was replaced by Tulloch.
On Sunday, all five British men will compete for individual apparatus medals.
