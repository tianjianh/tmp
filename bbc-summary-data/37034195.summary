The Frenchman, 66, was appointed Gunners boss in September 1996 and his current deal finishes next June.
Arsenal have not won the Premier League title since 2004 and Wenger has faced criticism from the club's fans.
"My contract runs until the end of the season. What I will do after will depend a little bit on how the season goes," Wenger told BBC Radio 5 live.
He was linked with the England job before Sam Allardyce was appointed as Roy Hodgson's successor.
However, he said: "I was not available and Sam Allardyce has signed for two years, so the question is not of any actuality at the moment."
Arsenal start their Premier League campaign against Liverpool at 16:00 BST on Sunday.
