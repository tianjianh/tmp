[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish comic Frankie Boyle is to make a special programme for the BBC iPlayer about this year's general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frankie Boyle's Election Autopsy will be available from 17 May and will be similar to his satirical analysis of last year's Scottish referendum.
The BBC said the show, to be recorded at Wilton's Music Hall in London, would see the comedian make "bold and often outrageous statements about the vote".
Matt Berry and Jo Brand will also appear in upcoming iPlayer commissions.
The former will kick off in a new topical comedy series with an "anthropologic look" at the Oxford v Cambridge boat race, available on the iPlayer from 5 April.
The latter, meanwhile, will present a "private view" of Grayson Perry's upcoming new exhibition at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate, available from 23 May.
