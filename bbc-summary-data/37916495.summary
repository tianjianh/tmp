A petition to save a 19-year-old from Cardiff being deported to his home-land of Afghanistan has gathered more than 11,000 signatures.

Bashir Naderi, who has lived in the UK for nine years, had his deportation halted by a judge just hours before his flight on 31 October.
More than 30 friends attended a 'Stand up for Bash' awareness event on Tuesday and his old school showed its support.
"The support has overwhelmed Bashir," said friend Gemma Summers, 24.
"He can't put into words how much it means to him, Bash can't believe all of these people would care so much. He's humbled."
Mr Naderi, who was a painting and decorating student at Cardiff and Vale College until his threatened deportation, is with his adopted family in Cathays.
His solicitors have launched a judicial review and Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens is working with his legal team to keep him in the city permanently.
Mr Naderi's girlfriend Nicole Cooper, 24, thinks the Home Office is deporting him now he is an adult, so launched an online petition to give to Home Secretary Amber Rudd.
The Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases.
Mr Naderi's mother paid for her youngest son to be trafficked to the UK aged 10 after his father, an Afghan police officer, was murdered by the Taliban. He has not spoken to his family in Afghanistan since.
AMs Jenny Rathbone, Julie Morgan and Lynne Neagle will show support to Mr Naderi's cause on the Senedd steps on Wednesday by wearing a blue ribbon - the symbol his supporters have adopted.
"I raised concerns in the Senedd last week about the threatened forced removal of Bashir," said Cardiff Central AM Ms Rathbone.
"Events like Stand Up for Bash are critical in both raising awareness of why Bashir should stay and to show the massive support he has from the community and the people of Wales.
"No family in Wales should have to go through this type of forced separation. Holding a Stand Up for Bash event in the assembly shows he has support at the highest level of government here."
