[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted defrauding his dying grandfather out of Â£50,000 by abusing his position as power of attorney.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said Kevin North, 31, "frittered away" money belonging to 84-year-old Norman Chipman and did not leave enough cash to pay for his funeral.
North, of Tennyson Avenue, Doncaster, was granted power of attorney in 2008 and made trustee of his grandfather's estate before his death in 2011.
He was released on bail to be sentenced at Sheffield Crown Court on 18 June.
Police were alerted in October 2011 by a relative of Mr Chipman, who had died the previous month.
Investigations of his financial accounts after death revealed his bank accounts were empty.
Det Con Matt Dixon said: "This has been a complex and lengthy investigation into the financial abuse of an elderly and vulnerable man by a member of his own family.
"North's actions have been truly abhorrent without any regard for his family, he thoughtlessly spent a significant sum of money, frittering away his grandfather's estate."
