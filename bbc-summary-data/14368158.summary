Many services were cancelled after a water main burst near South Croydon station on Monday, causing a landslip.
Southern said four out of five lines were now available and a full service was planned on Wednesday morning.
A reduced half-hourly Gatwick Express route has operating, and there were restrictions between London Bridge, Uckfield and Reigate stations.
South Croydon and Purley Oaks stations remained closed all day.
There were timetable changes to many First Capital Connect routes between Bedford, London and Brighton, with some trains cancelled.
Travellers have been told they can check details of changes at the National Rail Enquiries website.
Thames Water said it was "really sorry for the disruption", which was caused by a burst main at Water Tower Hill.
"We had a team on site to deal with the burst within an hour," it added.
"Despite the water pipe being buried 4.5m (15ft) below ground, we were able to shut the main off within two hours, without disrupting water supplies to 15,000 customers."
Network Rail said there was a significant amount of water on the track, along with mud and other debris.
Engineers worked through the night to stabilise the embankment.
