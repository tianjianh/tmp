European Challenge Cup: Brive 17-14 Worcester Warriors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester's hopes of European Challenge Cup progress were ended after the Premiership strugglers suffered a dramatic late defeat by Brive.

Marco Mama's powerful run and try put Warriors 7-0 up at half-time.
Twice the Group 3 leaders fought back to level after the break, Fabien Sanconnie the first to go over.
Val Rapava Ruskin then went over for Worcester, only for Fabian Guillaume's try and a last-gasp Gaetan Germain penalty to seal Brive's comeback win.
Worcester, who are just one point above the relegation places in England's top flight, needed to win both their remaining two group games to have any chances of reaching the quarter-finals of Europe's second-tier competition.
Defeat leaves them bottom of their group, with Brive four points clear at the top and on the cusp of a spot in the last eight of the competition.
Worcester boss Carl Hogg had involved himself more heavily in the build-up to the match at Stade Amedee-Domenech, having previously allowed his backroom staff to take charge of a generally under-strength, second-string line-up.
Mama was one of a number of experienced players included for the trip to France to try salvage hopes, but the Top 14 side still managed to condemn Worcester to a fourth defeat in Europe this season.
