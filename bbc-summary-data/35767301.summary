Organisers halted the 168km stage from Cusset to Mont Brouilly after 75km.
No times were recorded, but points from the sprints and climbs will be carried forward.
Race director Christian Prudhomme said: "The road was extremely slippery and safety was no longer guaranteed. It's a pity."
Tomorrow's 195.5km stage takes the riders from Julienas to Romans-sur-Isere.

1. Michael Matthews (Aus/Orica) 9hrs 41mins 46secs
2. Tom Dumoulin (Net/Giant) +14secs
3. Patrick Bevin (NZ/Cannondale) +19secs
4. Jon Izagirre (Sp/Movistar)
5. Geraint Thomas (GB/Team Sky)
