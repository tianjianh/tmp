A man who raped a "vulnerable" woman has been jailed for 24 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ferdos Rabani, 48, currently at HMP Marshgate but formerly of Sheffield, was sentenced at the city's crown court.
Rabani, who is also known as Joshua Abdul, was found guilty of rape in November, said South Yorkshire Police.
In April 2016, he approached a 34-year-old woman, offered her a lift home before he drove to a remote area and raped her.
Rabani had offered her cigarettes, believed to have been drugged to make her drowsy, before the attack.
Several weeks afterwards the woman came forward to report to police what had happened.
PC Jess Hawley said: "Rabani could clearly see that the victim was vulnerable.
"He preyed on her and took advantage of her, leaving her incredibly traumatised by what happened."
