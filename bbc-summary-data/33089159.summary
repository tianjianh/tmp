Brazil legend Zico intends to stand for the presidency of Fifa after admitting the corruption crisis in the sport's governing body has saddened him.

The 62-year-old, whose full name is Arthur Antunes Coimbra, said it was his "duty" to stand.
Current president Sepp Blatter announced he would stand down just four days after being re-elected last month.
It came after twin corruption probes into Fifa were launched by United States and Swiss authorities.
Speaking at a crowded press conference at a football skills centre he runs in Rio de Janerio, Zico said: "It's sad for our sport to see what is happening in football today - the corruption... and the hard work of many other good people wasted - and I see it as my duty to use my experience and knowledge to try and stand for the presidency."
Although he has played and managed in countries around the world, Zico has little experience in football administration at any senior level.
Blatter has said he would step down once a successor is chosen - likely to be in December.
US officials have indicted 14 Fifa officials and associates on bribery and racketeering charges, with seven of those arrested just two days before Fifa members re-elected Blatter.
Swiss prosecutors are also investigating how Fifa awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively.
Zico is regarded one of the greatest players in Brazil's history and appeared at three World Cup finals with the national side, in 1978, 1982 and 1986.
Domestically he won 12 titles with Flamengo before embarking on a coaching career that included spells with Japan, CSKA Moscow in Russia and Turkish side Fenerbahce.
