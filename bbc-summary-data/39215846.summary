[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan to limit the number of dogs that one person can walk in a Hampshire town has been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gosport chiefs voted to cut the number of dogs allowed per walker from six to four on Wednesday.
The borough council said the move was prompted by complaints about dog mess and walkers failing to control their charges.
The Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) comes into effect on 1 May, with a Â£100 fine for ignoring it.
Under the order dogs will also be excluded from children's areas with fixed play equipment, and sports pitches while they are in use for organised events.
The proposal previously triggered a row on social media with some people posting on Facebook that it "interferes with people's right to choices".
Many were in support of the decision however, Jenny Brown posted: "I'm pleased this has come into focus. I've had so many problems when encountering larger groups of dogs."
Facebook user Jackie Black added: "I agree, how do you poo-pick with six dogs? You only have one pair of hands."
Councillor Graham Burgess, chairman of the community board, said: "In a densely-populated borough like Gosport, we do believe new rules are needed."
