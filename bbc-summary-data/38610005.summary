Daniel May, 25, who was quadriplegic, blind and had cerebral palsy following an operation aged six months, passed away during Sunday's 0-0 draw.
His father Kevin, a Plymouth fan, was informed of the death while watching the game at Anfield.
A banner will be displayed at the cup replay between the sides on Wednesday.
Fans will also join a minute's applause on the 25th minute.

The banner was expected to cost Â£150. The remaining funds from the fundraising campaign will go to the Royal Surrey County Hospital, where Daniel died.
In a message to Kevin May, 53, organiser Anthony Grice said: "This is to say we are thinking of you."
The Liverpool businessman added: "What happened to Kevin is every father's nightmare.
"I am a father myself, but even if you are not you can't help but feel sympathy for what he went through."
Mr May was told on the phone that Daniel had died as he watched the game alongside thousands of Plymouth supporters.
The distraught dad, who was taken to a quiet room away from the crowd after receiving the tragic news, later thanked a policeman and staff at Anfield for their support.
In response to the fundraising, he said: "I think it's wonderful and would be a fitting tribute to Daniel and a real comfort to his mum and family.
"When I heard a funding page had been set up for a banner for Daniel, that just made me cry. It's truly outstanding."
Mr Grice said he could not attend Wednesday's replay at Argyle's Home Park ground but the banner would be displayed by other Liverpool fans.
