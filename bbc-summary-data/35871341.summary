Dates have been announced for this year's West End Festival in Glasgow - but there will be no traditional Mardi-Gras style parade along Byres Road.

Organisers said the 21st year of the festival will take place from Friday 3 to Sunday 26 June.
Plans are being developed to bring back the street parade in the years ahead.
The parade was previously dropped in 2012 after the costs of road closures, security and clearing-up could not be met from sponsorship income.
Organisers said the festival would feature more than 400 events, including a festival of singing, a big band concert and a series of rock concerts.
Many of these will be held at the bandstand in Kelvingrove Park.
Festival chairwoman Liz Scobie said "Our 21st birthday is a truly significant milestone.
"We have evolved from a few events to a programme of more than 400 and the participation of hundreds of thousands of people of all ages supported by a small army of volunteers.
"As we take time to develop our new-look festival, we have decided that there will not be a parade in Byres Road this year, whilst making plans for it to return bigger and better in the years to come."
The full programme for the festival will be launched in April.
