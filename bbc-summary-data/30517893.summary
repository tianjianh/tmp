The four-year Lincoln Castle Revealed project draws to a close on 1 April 2015, when the castle re-opens.
It includes a high-security underground vault, where an original copy of the Magna Carta will be displayed alongside the Charter of the Forest.
Lincolnshire County Council hopes the new vault will attract more visitors.
Lincoln's copy of the Magna Carta - one of only four surviving originals - will be stored in the vault as part of a "widescreen cinematic experience", charting the story of the document, which is 800 years old in 2015.
"This will make the castle an attraction of international importance, bringing in many more visitors from near and far," said county councillor Nick Worth.
As well as improving disabled access, new features at the castle, which dates from 1068, will include a medieval wall walk with audio guide and a recreation of the on-site Victorian prison.
