A hospital trust in special measures and facing ongoing financial problems has appointed a new chief executive.

The National Audit Office forecast a Â£40m deficit for North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust this year.
Stephen Eames will run the trust's West Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven and Carlisle's Cumberland Infirmary.
His focus would be on "addressing the on-going, and longstanding, performance and financial issues", he said.
"A long-term and sustainable clinical strategy fit for the future" needed to be agreed, he said.
Mr Eames oversaw the controversial closure of accident and emergency care at Bishop Auckland Hospital and a major reconfiguration of services at the Mid Yorkshire Trust.
The Cumbria trust was among 11 put into special measures after the Keogh review found higher than expected mortality rates.
It has struggled with recruitment and locum costs.
Outgoing chief executive Anne Farrar will now work with trusts across Durham, Darlington and Teesside as part of their Better Health Services programme.
