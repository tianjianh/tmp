Worcester Warriors have completed the signing of hooker Joe Taufete'e on an extended, undisclosed-length deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old former American football player, who made the switch to rugby union in 2011, initially signed for Warriors in December on a deal until the end of the 2016-17 season.
The nine-times capped USA international has made five appearances for the club.
His first Premiership start was in the 41-24 home win over bottom club Bristol, which may keep Warriors up.
California-born Taufete'e, capped nine times by the USA, also came off the bench in the home defeat by Exeter, having scored his first try for Worcester in the Anglo-Welsh Cup win over Harlequins.
His first two appearances for the club were both in the European Challenge Cup, his debut having come in south-west France against Brive, four days prior to Gary Gold's arrival as director of rugby.
"Joe has grabbed his opportunity with both hands in the cup competitions and has been rewarded with a call-up to our Premiership squad," said Gold.
"His work rate has been tremendous and, in his handful of appearances so far, he has looked a real threat with ball in hand while impressing at the set-piece."
Worcester are 11th in the Premiership, seven points clear of Bristol, going into Sunday's trip to fellow Midlands side Wasps (14:30 BST).
