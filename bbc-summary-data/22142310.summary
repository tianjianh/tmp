David Cockburn, 48, his daughters Carley Ann, 21, and Bethany, 18, and Bethany's one-year-old daughter Lacie Jade Stephenson died on Friday.
The fifth person who died has not yet been officially identified.
Emma Spencer, who lived next door to the Cockburns in Ouston, Chester-le-Street, said neighbours could not believe what had happened.
"We're all really shocked and devastated," she said.
"Just last week they were out on the lawn fixing their car and the little girl was running on to our garden.
"The one thing I would say is they were a very close family and they doted on the little girl. They were always together as a family."
The family were travelling to Butlins in Skegness where Carley Ann and Bethany were due to take part in a dance competition when their car collided with a lorry on the A18.
50,000 people have joined a Facebook tribute page.
One person wrote: "So so sad xx dancing with the angels now x R.I.P xxx."
Another posted: "Dance in heaven beautiful angels x."
Three family members died at the scene in Laceby and two others died in hospital. The lorry driver suffered minor injuries.
Humberside Police said it was too early to speculate what had caused the collision.
