[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 1-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An own-goal by Bristol Rovers captain Tom Lockyer earned promotion-chasing Scunthorpe a point at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Under pressure from Paddy Madden in the 73rd minute, Lockyer poked the ball past advancing goalkeeper Joe Lumley after a back-pass from substitute Ellis Harrison had put Rovers in trouble.
The hosts had taken the lead six minutes before the break when Ollie Clarke powered in a header from a Chris Lines corner. Scunthorpe goalkeeper Luke Daniels got a hand to the ball, but could not prevent it crossing the line.
Scunthorpe might have been ahead after just 12 seconds when Lumley blocked a volley from Duane Holmes.
In a frantic start Clarke had a low shot tipped past a post by Daniels before the visiting keeper also saved well from Rory Gaffney, whose follow-up shot came after Clarke had seen his effort blocked.
Both sides had chances in an open second half, Daniels denying Billy Bodin and Lumley saving well from Sam Mantom.
