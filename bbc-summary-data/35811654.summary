Surfing at the Redskins? NFL team consider radical stadium designs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"So, what we're thinking is having a big moat outside the stadium for bathers and surfers..."

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
That is how the conversation might have gone when NFL stalwarts Washington Redskins asked architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group to come up with designs for a new stadium.
As you can see, the Danish firm have come up with something rather quirky.
Notice how the stadium doubles up as a venue for abseilers, watersports enthusiasts and sunbathers. And later in the year - depending on how cold it gets - you can forget Aspen because the moat will seemingly transform into a winter sports paradise.
The reaction on social media was... mixed.
The lease on the Redskins' current home, the FedExField in Maryland, expires in 2027, so there is plenty of time to add water slides and a log flume.
BBC Sport managed to acquire some of the concept design photos from Danish architects. See what you think.
