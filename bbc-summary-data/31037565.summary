The agreement covers MOTD's Sunday morning repeat, MOTD2, Football Focus and a new midweek show on Wednesday nights on BBC Two and BBC Two HD.
MOTD, which is in its 50th year, and MOTD2 have a combined weekly audience of nine million.
MOTD presenter Gary Lineker said he was "thrilled" with the news.
Barbara Slater, the director BBC Sport, called the programme "the most iconic brand in television sport".
She added that it was "very exciting" to be able to add a new midweek show to the mix that would reflect "the continued appetite for Premier League action and analysis".
The BBC's Premier League programmes will also be available on the iPlayer.
Lineker is joined in MOTD studio each week by regular pundits Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage, Danny Murphy and Phil Neville, with guest appearances from Rio Ferdinand and Ruud Gullit.
Reacting to Thursday's announcement, BBC director general Tony Hall said: "Sport matters. It brings the nation together.
"It can break hearts and raise spirits. And because it matters to the public, it also matters to the BBC. That's why it's fantastic news that we have kept the Premier League highlights."
