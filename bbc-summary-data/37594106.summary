[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts moved clear into third place in the Premiership with victory over Dundee at Tynecastle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hearts pressed heavily in the first half with Callum Paterson, Conor Sammon and Tony Watt all going close.
Dundee improved after half-time with Tom Hateley, Kostadin Gadzhalov and Yordi Teijsse all hitting the woodwork.
Callum Paterson finally broke the deadlock when he rose highest to head into the far corner, before Bjorn Johnsen smashed home a late goal.

Hearts created numerous chances, but so too did Dundee.
In the first half it seemed only a matter of time before the home side would find the back of the net. But the simple fact is the Hearts strikeforce are not scoring enough goals - Sammon and Watt only have one goal each this season.
That struggle may last a little longer with winger Sam Nicholson ruled out for three months after going under the knife to fix a knee problem, but Faycal Rherras, who was taken to hospital in Morocco after falling ill on international duty, should return to training next week.
Watt was replaced before the hour, with Robbie Muirhead given his chance. Sammon ploughed on until he was replaced by Bjorn Johnson, who scored the late goal that sealed the win.
It is strange that right-back Paterson is the biggest goal threat. He always carried a danger every time he loped forward, and once again he found the back of the net.
It has just not really happened for the new Dundee strikeforce so far either.
Manager Paul Hartley talked before the match how hard it was to replace the 40-odd goals of Kane Hemmings and Greg Stewart.
It was always going to be difficult to repeat the alchemy of turning lower league players into gold star material.
Tiejsse struggled to make the ball stick up front, but he did have a great chance when he flashed a shot off the post. He also put a header wide of the post.
There were sporadic flashes from Faissal El Bakhtaoui, who won the free-kick from which Tom Hateley grazed the bar. It was probably always going to take time for El Bakhtaoui to make the step up, and he is not there yet.
Dundee, to their great credit, hit the woodwork four times - Hateley twice, Teijsse and Gadzhalov once.
If you are struggling to score goals, you can at least tighten up at the back. Dundee started with a back three which at times was more of a back five.
Overall Dundee looked pretty solid, until Hearts finally found a way through. Kevin Gomis was not perfect but overall he provided a commanding presence at the back. He looks like a top signing by Hartley.
But Dundee need goals, simple as that.
Hearts boss Robbie Neilson: "A good three points, tough game. I thought we created a lot of good chances, but didn't take them which was frustrating.
"Dundee had a period when they were on top and pretty dominant, hit the woodwork a couple of times and it became end to end.

"We made a couple of changes, brought Robbie Muirhead on and he changed the game for us to be honest. He gave us energy, great delivery and allowed us to get a bit more width which I think was key to the game."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "It was a good performance from the players. I thought we were terrific. We should have taken something from the game.
"The amount of chances we created, the set-piece delivery was brilliant and we just weren't clinical enough."
