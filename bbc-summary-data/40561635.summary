The World War Two Mustang "Miss Velma" suffered suspected engine failure during an air show at Duxford on Sunday afternoon and landed in a nearby field.
While it was being taken for repairs, the wingspan turned out to be too wide to fit through a set of traffic lights.
It took more than an hour to get the carriageway clear, police said.
Beds, Cambs & Herts Roads Policing Unit took to Twitter to describe the scene as "carnage".
"Recovered plane just won't fit through gap!" the unit wrote when the vehicle transporting the plane became stuck at about 15:35 BST.
On Sunday, Cambridgeshire Police had to close part of the M11 at Duxford while it dealt with the initial incident.
The pilot had managed to land the aircraft upright in the field and was unharmed. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) confirmed it was investigating.
