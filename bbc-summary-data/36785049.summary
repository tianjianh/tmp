The Royal Voluntary Service (RVS) is one of three organisations set to benefit from a memorial fund set up following the death of Mrs Cox in June.
The Batley and Spen MP 41, was shot and stabbed in Birstall, West Yorkshire.
The latest tranche of fines will also be used to fund D-Day veteran visits to Normandy and to help excavate the HMS Invincible shipwreck in the Solent.

Announcing the donation to the RVS, chancellor George Osborne said: "It is right that funding from those in the banking industry who demonstrated the worst of values goes towards people who display the very best of British values.
"Jo Cox dedicated her life to bringing people together and making a difference.
"She was an inspiration to people across the world and I am proud to give the Royal Voluntary Service this funding in her memory to continue their vital work."
The memorial fund - which is also supporting Hope not Hate and the White Helmets - has raised nearly £1.5m since it was set up.
Full list of donations:
An inquest into Mrs Cox's death was opened and adjourned last month after hearing she died from multiple stab and gunshot wounds.
Thomas Mair, 52, from Birstall, faces charges of murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon in connection with the attack on Mrs Cox.
