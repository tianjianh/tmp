Khan was initially arrested under anti-terror laws and admitted to officers he was a weapons collector.
He had sprayed one of the four canisters of illegal pepper spray to test his own pain threshold, the court was told.

Mitigatin, Aftab Zaroor, said the defendant was held in custody for seven days and "made full and frank admissions" that he purchased the substance but was unaware it was illegal.
