Emin called her design - which features a handwritten message and a patchwork rosette - "really Tracey-ish".
Emin, probably best known for her unmade bed installation, said she wanted 2015's winners to have something "special" at the 25 February ceremony.
The award-winning artist follows in the footsteps of Dame Vivienne Westwood and last year's designer, Philip Treacy.
"You want to do it really well," said Emin of her design. "You don't just want to decorate it.
"You want to make something that is really Tracey-ish, that is special for the people receiving it."
The artist's handwritten message to winners reads: "Congratulations on your talent on your life. On everything you give to others. Thank You."
The 'blank canvas' trophy was previously reworked by Damien Hirst, another so-called YBA - young British artist - in 2013.
Pop artist Sir Peter Blake, best known for designing The Beatles' Sgt Pepper album cover, did the honours in 2012.
Emin's most famous artworks include 1998's Turner Prize-nominated My Bed, which sold at auction earlier this year for Â£2.2m.
The artist, who recently designed the artwork for the Band Aid 30 charity single, was made a CBE by the Queen in 2012 for her contribution to the visual arts.
"Tracey's design is characteristically bold, brilliant, colourful and inventive - everything the Brits stands for," said Brits chairman Max Lousada.
"We're honoured to work with her and delighted to be able to celebrate the achievements of the Brit Awards winners with such a unique and special trophy."
The 2015 Brit Awards will be broadcast from The O2 in London on ITV on 25 February.
