Duntish horses saved after falling in pool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two horses were rescued after falling into a pool in west Dorset.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fifteen crew members from Dorset Fire and Rescue Service pulled the pair out of the water in Factory Lane, Duntish at about 08:45 BST.
A vet was at the scene to sedate the horses, one of whom was called Elvis, while crews had to cut away undergrowth to reach them.
The horses are now said to be "recovering well" in a nearby field.
