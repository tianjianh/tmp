The Royal Mint's five-year programme to mark the centenary of World War One will continue with a £2 coin remembering the community pride that fuelled the rise of the "Pals" battalions, and will bear a design reminiscent of the art deco styling of the time.
Meanwhile, the 1066 Battle of Hastings will feature on a 50p piece - to mark the 950th anniversary of the military action.
Each coin bears the fifth definitive portrait of the Queen by Royal Mint engraver Jody Clark.
