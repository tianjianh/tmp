He enjoyed a 50% success record in the group stage, correctly guessing the outcome of 24 of the 48 games.
The only group he failed to get a single correct result in was Group D, which was surprisingly won by Costa Rica as England finished bottom.
Before the tournament, Lawro chose 11 out of the 16 teams that are through to the first knockout stage, including Argentina - his pick to win the World Cup on 13 July.
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
