Magnus Bradbury went over early for Edinburgh but Ulster hit back with tries from Paul Marshall, Darren Cave, Louis Ludik and Jacob Stockdale.
Stuart McInally touched down before the break to leave it 24-10 at the break.
Damien Hoyland's try and a Sam Hidalgo-Clyne penalty set up a tense finale but Ulster held on for a much-needed win.
Edinburgh beat Ulster in November and they made the perfect start in Belfast as Bradbury ran in at the corner for an unconverted try after just two minutes.
It was an impressive response from the hosts, securing the bonus point in a 22-minute burst.
Marshall darted through for the opening try before Cave finished a flowing move by stretching over on the line.
Charles Piutau was outstanding on the wing and he set up Ludik to sprint in for the third, with Stockdale surging clear for the bonus-point try.
Nelson converted the first and fourth tries and Ulster led 24-5 after 32 minutes although McIlnally barged over for Edinburgh before the break, with Tovey again missing out on the extras.
Ulster failed to capitalise on their pressure early in the second half and they suffered a blow when Piutau limped off injured.
Edinburgh were more clinical with a quick passing move ended by Hoyland touching down in the corner but with Sam Hidalgo-Clyne missing the conversion.
Marcell Coetzee put in a powerful display on his Ulster debut with the South African replaced on the hour mark.
There was also an injury concern for Edinburgh with lock Fraser McKenzie stretchered off following a collision with Tommy Bowe.
Hidalgo-Clyne reduced the gap to six points with a penalty but Ulster held on for the five points to remain sixth.
