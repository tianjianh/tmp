Edinburgh ended the season under interim coach Duncan Hodge after Alan Solomons' September exit, but Richard Cockerill will take over next season.
"We've got the makings of a very good squad," said Berghan. "And there's a lot of talent coming through the ranks.
"It's now about bringing it together and pushing on in the coming season."
New Zealand-born tight-head Berghan joined Edinburgh in 2014 from Crusaders Knights, the development squad of Super Rugby franchise the Crusaders.
"I've loved my time at Edinburgh Rugby so far," he said.
"Front-row is a highly-competitive position and that will only drive standards.
"The battle for a starting spot will be extremely tough but one in which I'll be looking to thrive."
Berghan, who qualifies for Scotland via a grandfather from Stirling, was named in the national squad for the first time for this year's Six Nations.
He made his debut off the bench against France and had further replacement outings against England and Italy.
Berghan also made 13 appearances, 10 of them starts, for Edinburgh this season.
"Simon is another great addition to our pack, especially taking into account his form of late," said Hodge, who will revert to his old role as attack coach under Cockerill.
"He seems to have relished his shot at international rugby and has been using that experience to further develop his game on returning to Edinburgh.
"He's still relatively young for a front-row, so we're looking forward to seeing him develop even further as part of our pack in the coming years."
Lock Anton Bresler is the only out-of-contract player whose future is as yet unconfirmed by Edinburgh.
