[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barcloy Hill wind farm appeal rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal against the rejection of a wind farm which attracted hundreds of objections and expressions of support has been refused.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Renewable Energy Systems (RES) wanted to build five turbines at Barcloy Hill.
The development near Kirkcudbright drew more than 500 objections but also more than 200 expressions of support.
After it was turned down by Dumfries and Galloway Council, the firm appealed against that decision but has failed to have it overturned.
It took the case to the Scottish government but a reporter has now concluded the turbines would have a "detrimental effect" on the landscape and refused the appeal.
