Paul Massey, 55, was found dead outside his Salford home on Sunday evening.
The security boss, who was jailed in 1999 for 14 years over a stabbing, died from a gunshot wound to the chest after being shot four times, police said.
His brother said he does not want "any repercussions", adding: "Let the police do what they've got to do... and I hope people can help them out."
"I'm fed up of hearing about people getting shot in Manchester, Salford, everywhere - we don't need it."
"It wasn't murder, it was an assassination - it was planned. There was no robbery, nothing like that - as far as I'm concerned, it was planned," he said.
He also appealed for "no disturbances" at the funeral, which will be held at a future date.
Several eyewitnesses saw the gunman approach Massey, who unsuccessfully stood to be Salford mayor in 2012, at about 19:30 BST as he got out of his silver BMW.
After opening fire, the shooter left on foot down the side of nearby St Anne's Church, police said.
Officers appealed for a teenager who was standing at a nearby bus stop to contact them.
Massey called emergency services from his driveway in Manchester Road, Clifton, telling them he had been shot.
The gunman was white, slim and wore a hat, which was possibly fisherman style, police said.
He also wore a face covering, a green or khaki long-sleeved top and combat style trousers tucked into black, lace-up boots.
Det Ch Insp Howard Millington said: "We believe this was a targeted attack on Paul and are still working to establish a motive for the murder.
"We are keen to speak to a girl who we believe is a potential witness to the shooting. She was stood at the bus stop on Manchester Road at the time of the shooting.
"She is described as about 16-17-years-old, Asian in appearance and of slim build. I would ask that she comes forward as she may have key information that can help our investigation."
Police patrols are continuing in the area and officers are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
