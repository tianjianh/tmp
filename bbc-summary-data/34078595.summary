[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dominic Birch, 21, was caught after police intercepted a package containing an Uzi heading to his house in Buxton, Derbyshire.
Jurors at Derby Crown Court found him guilty of possessing firearms with intent to endanger life.
He also pleaded guilty to importing firearms and ammunitions illegally.
Judge Nirmal Shant, who sentenced Birch, told him it was a "mystery to those around you as to why you have involved yourself in these matters".
"All describe you as a good, kind son, employer, boyfriend and worthwhile friend, which is in stark contrast to the haul of weapons you stored in your bedroom," the judge said.
Derbyshire Constabulary investigated Birch with the support of the National Crime Agency and the Metropolitan Police's gun crime unit, Operation Trident.
Det Ch Insp Jason Hendy, from the Met, said Birch is "a very dangerous individual who had no qualms about obtaining lethal firearms, including a submachine gun".
But in mitigation for Birch, barrister Adrian Farrow said there was "no evidence that he would have used any of the firearms at any point".
Birch pleaded guilty to an offence relating to the importation of illegal firearms and drugs possession and supply offences, and was due to be sentenced on those charges.
However, while he was on bail, police received further intelligence he had bought more weapons.
They then searched his home and work addresses and seized loaded weapons including a Glock pistol, AK47 type weapon, FEG self-loading pistol and a Skorpion submachine gun.
Hundreds of rounds of live ammunition and a gun disguised as a pen were also found.
