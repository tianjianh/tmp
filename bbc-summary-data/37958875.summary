[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 2-1 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield remain bottom of the League One table after Fleetwood's full-backs fired the Cod Army to victory at Highbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amari'i Bell, playing at left wing-back as Uwe Rosler fielded a back three, swept the hosts in front in the 27th minute following a smart turn and cross from David Ball.
Town had a number of chances to put the game to bed in the first half with centre-halves Cian Bolger and Ashley Eastham wasting free headers.
But substitute right wing-back Victor Nirennold diverted home Ash Hunter's strike at the back post in the 62nd minute to give Rosler's men a two goal cushion.
It should have been plain sailing for Town but Chesterfield got back into it four minutes later as striker Ball tripped Kristian Dennis in the box with Jay O'Shea firing the subsequent spot-kick past ex-Spireites goalkeeper Alex Cairns on the stopper's first league start.
That 66th minute goal paved the way for an end-to-end finish with Fleetwood substitute Devante Cole and Chesterfield's O'Shea wasting the best chances as Fleetwood held on to move up to 10th in the table and send the visitors to an eighth league loss on the bounce.
