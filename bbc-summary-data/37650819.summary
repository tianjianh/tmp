[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carmarthen Ham has been awarded protected name status by the EU, its producers have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The meat now has protected geographical indication (PGI) status, which is one of three protected food name designations.
Brothers Chris and Jonathan Rees, the latest of five generations to produce the ham, said they were "over the moon".
The family makes just 700-800 legs of the traditionally air-dried ham a year.
Melton Mowbray pork pies, Anglesey sea salt and Welsh beef are among the UK protected food names.
The legislation protecting them comes from the EU Protected Foods Name Scheme.
A number of producers have urged the UK government to ensure the status is observed in the wake of Brexit.
Mr Rees said: "It's taken six years and we had a bit of a scare with this Brexit, but we've finally got there.
"We're self-employed butchers, a small cottage industry, but we can put protected status on it from now on."
A Defra spokeswoman said: "Wales is a huge source of pride for Britain's food and drink sector.
"It's good to see Carmarthen Ham receiving recognition and further boosting the British brand at home and around the world.
