The pair have been at the club for four seasons, with Parker playing 80 times and Dancer making 61 appearances.
Former Exeter Chiefs wing Jack Arnott has agreed to join National One side Plymouth Albion, having scored 16 tries in two campaigns at the Mennaye.
Prop Luke Chapman and Edd Pascoe have also departed, while hooker Rob Elloway announced his retirement in February.
Pirates coach Gavin Cattle said: "At the end of a season there's always going to be outgoing and incoming players, however I just want to acknowledge the five for their efforts and thank each one of them."
