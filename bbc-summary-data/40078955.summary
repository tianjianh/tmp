Scarlets, who beat Munster in the Pro12 final, failed to make it out of their pool in the European Champions Cup.
"Next year is going to be interesting, to see if we can build from this," he said.
Shingler believes Scarlets need to recruit well with Liam Williams and DTH van der Merwe both leaving.
Wales back Williams will join European champions Saracens while Canadian international wing Van der Merwe has signed for Newcastle Falcons.
"Losing them two players is disappointing because they are key members of our squad," Shingler added.
"It's going to be a big summer for the Scarlets.
"Obviously we've got to keep the squad together and hopefully add one or two to make it stronger."
Shingler will now join up with the Wales squad to prepare for the summer Test matches against Tonga and Samoa in June, but admits it is a call he did not expect to come.
The 29-year-old, who has eight caps, was called up as a replacement for injured Ospreys forward James King.
"When I was waiting for the squad and I didn't see my name I thought that was pretty much the end of my international career," Shingler added.
"Obviously the boys have gone away with the Lions and if I wasn't going to make this squad then there was no chance.
"I've got a chance now and we'll see how it goes."
