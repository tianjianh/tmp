A French barman has been convicted of manslaughter and given a suspended sentence after allowing a customer to drink 56 shots that led to his death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Renaud Prudhomme, 56, was at the bar with his daughter and friends when he attempted to break its shots record.
Mr Prudhomme was helped home but later taken to hospital, where he died the following day.
Barman Gilles Crepin, 47, admitted he encouraged Mr Prudhomme by displaying the shots record on a noticeboard.
Mr Crepin was given a four-month suspended sentence and banned from working in a bar for a year.
His lawyer, Renaud Portejoie, said he would appeal against the decision.
"It's a decision guided by emotion and the unconscious desire to set an example," said Mr Portejoie,
He told the court that Mr Prudhomme had existing respiratory and alcohol abuse problems.
"We can't ask every customer who buys alcohol to present their medical certificates," he said.
Antoine Portal, who represented Mr Prudhomme's daughter, said the family was "relieved" by the decision to ban Mr Crepin from working as a bartender.
"We want to remind some professionals that it is illegal to serve alcohol to clients who are in an advanced state of inebriation," she said.
