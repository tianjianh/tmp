Scotland, who lost to Australia in their opener, and England - beaten by New Zealand - meet in Coventry.
"You want to play against Australia and New Zealand as well, but a Scotland-England game is mate against mate," said McCormack.
"A lot of these players play against each other every week."
Scotland captain Danny Brough and half-back partner Ryan Brierley will face Huddersfield team-mate Jermaine McGillvary.
Scotland centre Euan Aitken is hoping to get the chance to play against his St George Illawarra skipper Gareth Widdop, while winger Matty Russell will line up against his Warrington captain Chris Hill.
"In any sport, Scotland v England is massive, certainly for the Scots," said McCormack, whose side lost 54-12 to world champions Australia on their Four Nations debut last week.
"Last week's game was fantastic, opening the tournament up, but this week's game is massive for us and that's been reflected by the way we've practised this week."

England, who lost 17-16 against he Kiwis on Saturday, need to win to maintain their hopes of reaching the final, while a big score will boost their chances if points difference comes into the equation.
"There's massive pressure on England," said McCormack. "Everybody is expecting them to get a big score, but we're not here to make the numbers up.
"Both myself and the players were disappointed with last Friday.
"Australia were excellent, but we only started playing after 25 minutes and in this competition you can't do that.
"We know we have to play really, really well. But I know we've got an outstanding team and we can play well on our day.
"We have to play at our best to get anywhere near England. Who knows what can happen if England have a bit of an off day?"
McCormack is planning to make at least two changes to the side that conceded 10 tries to the Kangaroos in Hull.
Brierley, who left the ground with a protective boot on an ankle, has been cleared to play, while Workington hooker Callum Phillips is set to return after missing the Australia game with concussion.
