Shropshire: Skipper Richard Oliver helps Salop make winning start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shropshire skipper Richard Oliver made 148 as his team launched the new Minor Counties campaign with a four-wicket Knockout Trophy win over Lincolnshire.

The visitors posted a challenging 252-7 in their 50 overs at Shrewsbury.
But Oliver shared a second-wicket stand of 194 with Worcestershire's England Under-19 prospect Joe Clarke (78 no).
Teenager Clarke hit the winning boundary with 10 overs to spare as last year's beaten finalists made a good start under new coach Karl Krikken.
Oliver's effort, which included seven sixes and 16 fours, followed up two centuries for Worcestershire's Second XI against Derbyshire last week.
New signing Gurman Randhawa, the former Yorkshire spinner, made a tidy start to his Shropshire career, his 10 overs going for just 29 runs.
Shropshire, beaten by Berkshire in last year's final at Wormsley, now face a trip to Northumberland at Jesmond next Sunday (11 May), followed by a home game with Cheshire at Oswestry and a final group game against Cumberland at Cockermouth.
