Glastonbury 2016: Festival line-up 'is 80% booked'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kanye West played one of the "bravest" sets the Glastonbury Festival has ever seen. There are enough headline acts for at least the next 15 years. Next year's headliners "couldn't be any bigger".

That's according to Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis, who has been reflecting on this year's festival and looking ahead to 2016.
The farm itself may be tranquil as winter draws in - but Emily is are busy booking bands, rearranging the site and planning new areas in preparation for the arrival of the first fans in exactly seven months' time.
The 2016 festival takes place from 22 to 26 June.
"We are currently in the thick of it. It's always busy at this time of year but for some reason we are much further down the line with our line-up this year.
"Everyone's getting in early, about six months earlier than usual. We have booked up to mid-afternoon on most of the main stages. I've also been seeing most of the area organisers over the last few weeks, getting plans in place for next year - that includes creative ideas for different fields, things we are going to do differently as well as budgets and passes.
"The most recent confirmation was our Sunday teatime slot, which is something I'm personally very excited about. It's a major coup for us and a genuine surprise. I don't think anyone has rumoured or guessed this one."
"Lionel [Richie] last year was just incredible, what a moment for us all. I think the Sunday afternoon slot is a fourth headline slot in a way, that's what it has become.
"Lionel had his first number one record in 25 years after that and Dolly Parton was on the front page of every paper the Monday after she played [in 2014]!"
"Yes, 10 years ago we'd be confirming headliners in February or March and then get on with the rest of the bill, but now it's much earlier."
"We are about 80% of the way there already. We are so lucky at the moment to have so many huge bands touring and wanting to play. That's one of the reasons we are doing a festival in 2017 - we already have the headliners pencilled in for that too, which is unusual.
"I feel quite passionately that there are enough headliners for at least another 15 years and that doesn't take into account the new bands coming through, of which there are more all the time. There's so much great music out there."
"Two out of three are confirmed in writing and one is verbally confirmed. One of the headliners I shook hands on at this year's festival, so that was the first confirmation of 2016. We are incredibly lucky to have such great headliners for next year, it couldn't be any bigger."
"We are introducing a new area in the woods, which is going to be really magical. The other change is one that is happening to the John Peel stage, but more information will be coming on that soon.
"We also have some other additional small stages and areas and we're doing a bit of tweaking to one of the markets too. Strummerville had a great year on the hill, so will stay there, and Arcadia have some ambitious plans for next year too."
"I think it was one of the bravest, most individual sets we have ever had on the Pyramid Stage. No guests, completely out there on his own and then rapping whilst climbing on to a cherry picker to be lifted into the pitch black sky - that was incredible.
"Most of the young people in that field were completely blown away by his performance. Some people didn't get it, but that's not a bad thing. You've got to keep surprising people."
"No, we are always open to headliners from any genre and that hasn't changed. We have to keep it fresh and moving along."
"I actually think that there are more headliners than ever, you just have to widen the net a bit.  In the past few years we've had so many great first-time headliners - Florence, Metallica, Mumfords, Kanye, Arcade Fire, Beyonce..."
"We have just organised an auction for the Oxfam refugee appeal which raised over Â£100,000, which is a good start. One of our key litter pickers, Liz Clegg, is in Calais looking after people out there and organising clear-ups and giving infrastructure support.
"We have sent our first aid kits, ponchos, wellies, T-shirts and this week we are sending out a load of bins from the festival so they can have fire pits rather than run the risk of campfires spreading, which has been a huge problem. Pip and Bertie from Arcadia are also fundraising to build the camp a fire engine, which will help enormously."
