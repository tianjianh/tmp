Emmett the cheetah cub was born in Ohio, USA, and had to be looked after by people, because he was unwell for several weeks after being born.
Now, he's at a new home at Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, and is growing up with his Labrador friend, Cullen.
Staff at the zoo say that cheetahs are naturally nervous animals, so Cullen will help Emmett to be more confident and calm.
