Locals in the Kathmandu Valley are being supported with food and water from The Brick Children School.
Headteacher Anita Shrestha said staff have been busy preparing food packages for 50 families.
The school, a charity project founded in Wrexham, has also been turned in to a refuge shelter.
Since the earthquake, the death toll has risen to over 7,000 and the Nepalese authorities have ruled out finding more survivors.
