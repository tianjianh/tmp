Sarries led 13-8 at the break through tries from Mako Vunipola and Mike Ellery, with Josh Bassett replying.
Two penalties from Wasps fly-half Jimmy Gopperth pulled the score back to 16-14 but Jamie George's converted try gave Sarries breathing space.
After Wasps winger Bassett was sent to the bin, George powered over again to secure a bonus point for the hosts.
Relive Saracens' win over Wasps
Saracens are now two points above Wasps, who had won their opening five games, in the table.
Dai Young's Wasps had started the campaign in imposing form but were on the back foot at Allianz Park following's Vunipola's early score.
They worked their way back into the match and looked to be heading into half-time on level terms until Ellery's late score gave double winners Saracens the edge.
Wasps began the second half on top but were not able to take advantage and England hooker George went over from close range to put Saracens clear, before Lozowski added the conversion to make it 23-14.
Once Bassett saw yellow for a high tackle, George was able to touch down from a rolling maul to put the gloss on their victory.
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall (on the upcoming return of fly-half Owen Farrell):
"Owen was with the team for Wasps. He warmed up with them and place-kicked for the first time before the game.
"If everything goes to plan, then hopefully he'll be available for the weekend.
"He's an influential member of the squad and it's good to have him around. He could definitely come straight into the team.
"Alex Lozowski has put his case forward so it's a big shout for us, but Owen is a world-class fly-half."
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
"You have to give Saracens a lot of credit, they really strangled us and didn't allow us to play.
"We've made a really good start to the season, but we've come to the home of the double champions and it was a little too much for us.
"It's not all doom and gloom because it's the first game we've lost, but if you're going to lose to anyone it should be the double winners.
"We're disappointed because we didn't look like we fired enough shots, but that's because of how good Saracens were defensively."
