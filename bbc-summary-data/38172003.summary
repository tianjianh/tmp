John Nisbet, 72, from Cowdenbeath in Fife, brought warmth, humour, generosity and compassion to all he met, his son said.
Mr Nibset was driving his black cab when it crashed with a Peugeot Boxer van at about 00:30 on Sunday.
It happened southbound between Old Craighall and Wallyford in Musselburgh.
The 53-year-old van driver was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for treatment to non-life threatening injuries.
Mr Nisbet's son Eddie said: "It goes without saying that as a family we are utterly heartbroken by my father's recent passing.
"The warmth, humour, generosity and compassion that John brought to the lives of his family and friends is truly immeasurable. His loss has left a void that will be impossible to fill.
"His doting wife, Gaye, will forever cherish their 32 years of marriage after falling in love at first sight. He was her hero, her best friend and ultimately her life - her heart will forever belong to him.
"A huge personality in golfing, taxi driving and snooker circles across the city, he left an indelible mark on a vast amount of people.
"We have been overwhelmed by the depth of sentiment that has been expressed to us over the past days. We are now getting a true feel for just how popular and well-loved he is, which has offered us a huge amount of comfort."
