Hugh Nicol, from Appin, took the image called The Audrey, Loch Creran, while on an evening cycle ride.
The picture won the Jolomo Colours of Scotland Photography Competition, which was launched last year by Scottish artist John Lowrie Morrison.
The runners-up photographs included images taken in the Western Isles.
Mairead Maclennan, from North Uist, was a runner-up with her picture Old School, Loch Portain, North Uist.
The other runners-up were Susanne Wilson, of East Kilbride, for Luskentyre Beach, Harris and Raymond Hosie, from Campbeltown for The Gauldrons, Machrihanish.
Mr Nicol, an estates manager in Argyll, said: "I have no professional photography experience, I'm not even an amateur, but I do like to carry a camera when I can and will take a snap when I have the time."
"The photograph was taken one beautiful, very still, autumn evening when I was out cycling around Loch Creran from my home at Portnacroish in Appin.
"I knew it was going to be a good night for photographs so took my camera with me. When you have somewhere as beautiful as Appin to work with, taking the picture was easy."
Lowrie Morrison, who is known as Jolomo, said: "The entries were superb, making it difficult to judge.
"Hugh's picture is beautiful and stood out from the beginning. It shows the colours of Scotland extremely well.
"In fact, the whole image expresses a real feel of Scotland and a lovely feeling of movement. I love the way he has expressed the landscape through reflection. He has captured a moment in time."
