A message posted by the Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing team on Twitter said: "Crazy speeds over 150mph and undertakes on A47 are mad risks."

The force said an officer on an unmarked police motorcycle spotted the five "high-powered sports bikes" heading westbound at Postwick at about 09:00 BST.
One of the riders was seen undertaking a car at more than 100mph, police said.
The bikers, who were stopped at the A140 junction, told the officer they were going for breakfast then a track day on their bikes.
PC Mark Carter, from the roads policing unit, said: "Although motorcycles can be enjoyable we would ask all riders to be responsible and ride safely and within speed limits."
