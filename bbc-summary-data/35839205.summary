[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A brace from Billy Bodin and Matty Taylor's strike saw high-flying Bristol Rovers overcome Cambridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bodin got his first goal with a low drive from 25 yards after nine minutes.
Midfielder Bodin headed in his second from Daniel Leadbitter's near-post cross nine minutes later to take his tally to eight for the season.
The visitors rarely threatened and Matty Taylor made it three by slotting past U's goalkeeper Will Norris to keep Rovers third in League Two.
The result also dented Cambridge United's play-off hopes, as they drop down to 11th in the table.
