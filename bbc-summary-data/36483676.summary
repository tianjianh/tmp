Ian O'Mara, 55, suffered head injuries after being struck in Manchester last October and died in hospital.
His two-year-old dog Tia was pronounced dead at the scene in Princess Road.
Colin Ayrton, 65, of Brown Lane, Heald Green, was given a 16-week jail term suspended for two years at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court.
Mr O'Mara's widow Glynis said in an earlier statement: "We are relieved that the coach driver has taken responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty.
"However nothing can ever bring Ian back and losing him has had a massive effect on the whole family...Life will simply never be the same for all of us."
