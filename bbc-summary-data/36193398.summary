Brett Rogers, 23, allegedly knifed Gillian Phillips, 54, and David Oakes, 60, dozens of times in a fatal attack at her home in Stansted Mountfitchet.
Mr Rogers, of Stansted Mountfitchet, denies two counts of murder.
Chelmsford Crown Court was told Mr Rogers made a 999 call on 22 July, 2015, saying: "There's been a murder."

The trial jury heard how Mr Rogers had been jailed for assaulting his father Peter Rogers and was on licence at the time of the killings.
Officers found him standing outside his mother's house in Bentfield Gardens "laughing and covered in blood", the jury was told.
Simon Spence QC, for the prosecution, said: "Gillian Phillips was sprawled across a sofa, already dead and covered in blood."
He said Mr Oakes "was lying on the floor face down, his face and neck covered in blood - although at that time he was still breathing.
"There was copious amounts of blood around the room, and in the kitchen, bathroom and upstairs bedroom."
Mrs Phillips had been stabbed at least 41 times in the head, neck and torso, and was pronounced dead at the scene.
Mr Oakes was taken to hospital with 56 wounds to his head, face and neck. He died just after midnight from severe head injuries.
Both victims had injuries suggesting they had been stamped on, said Mr Spence.
Mr Rogers lived with his father and worked as a milkman before he was jailed for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.
He went to live with his mother after his release in March 2015.
The trial continues.
