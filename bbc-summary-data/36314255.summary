Catalans led 14-0 through tries from Justin Horo, Jodie Broughton and Tony Gigot before Ben Jones-Bishop scored either side of half-time to reduce the deficit to two points.
Michael Sio then gave Trinity the lead before Vincent Duport and Broughton's second put Dragons back in control.
But Mickael Simon tied the game before Miller's winning 77-minute drop goal.
Having already squandered three of his five conversion attempts, Pat Richards could have won the game for Catalans just two minutes earlier, but his penalty hit the post.
The Wildcats came into the clash having won six of their last seven league games since Chris Chester took over in March, but they were without a win at Magic Weekend since 2012.
They faced a Catalans side who had not lost at Magic Weekend since 2011 and were also on an impressive run of eight wins in nine league matches.
Dragons, knowing a win would send them top, got off to a flying start, but they were pegged back by a resilient Wakefield side, who pulled level at 24-24 with eight minutes to play.
Following Richards' miss, Miller then lined up from 50 metres out and his stunning half-way line drop goal moved Wakefield up to sixth in the table, just four points off top spot.
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester:
"I thought, 'What are you doing?' I thought he had no chance but he got it through the posts and that just shows the confidence of Milky at the minute.
"He's playing with a lot of confidence, enjoying his rugby and he was very, very good again. On reflection, probably a draw was a fair result but I'll take the two points any day of the week.
"We've not just come back once, we've come back twice. That just shows the belief and spirit. We just found a way to win. We want to consolidate our place in the top eight. Nobody is getting carried away."
Catalans head coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"It happens to all goalkickers. I'm a former goalkicker and you get some days like that.
"I would never blame a goalkicker and I won't blame Pat. He hit the post at the end but we shouldn't have been in that situation.
"I've been really impressed with Wakefield. They work hard for each other and play good footy. Chris is doing a great job."
