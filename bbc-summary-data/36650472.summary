The 24-year-old, who has played for Belgium up to under-21 level, helped Gent to the 2014-15 Belgian league title and played in the Champions League the following season.
Sels, the Belgian goalkeeper of the year for 2015, has signed a five-year deal at the Championship club.
"I'm very happy to be here. It was an easy decision to make," said Sels.
Magpies manager Benitez added: "I am really pleased to welcome Matz to the club. He's a fantastic goalkeeper and many top clubs have been interested in signing him."
Newcastle now have four senior goalkeepers - Sels, Karl Darlow, Tim Krul and Rob Elliot.
Krul, who has been linked to Premier League clubs, missed most of last season through injury, and Elliot is expected to miss the start of the season with a knee problem.
