The fire started at a property in Tower Lane, off Cowbit Road, in Spalding, shortly after midnight.
Lincolnshire Police said the cause of the fire was not yet known, but a joint investigation with the fire service had started.
The force said: "We are not in a position to provide any further details about the deceased at this stage."
Lincolnshire Fire Service said it sent six crews at the height of the blaze. Firefighters are expected to remain at the scene for "some time".
Station manager Matthew Perrin said the huge fire had spread from the ground floor to the first floor area.
Officers had attempted to rescue one of the victims, but failed to resuscitate them.
"The building was heavily involved in fire," he said.
"Crews were quick to enter the property. We located one casualty and removed them, unfortunately we were unable to save them. Then in the early hours of this morning, again we located a second casualty."
