Russell Slade: Cardiff manager plays down move up to second

Cardiff City manager Russell Slade says there is little significance to his side's rise to second in the table but insists promotion remains the aim.

The Bluebirds maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 2-0 win against Huddersfield on Saturday.
But Slade says it is premature to place much importance on the Championship table after only six games.
"Our ambition is to be in the top six come May and that will never change," he said.
"I will look at it [the table] after 12 games because I think that's when things settle down a little bit.
"It's too early to start thinking who's going to be up there and who's going to be down there.
"Obviously three wins and three draws and being unbeaten is a sound start to the season."
Victory against Huddersfield was Cardiff's third in succession in the league, the first time they have done so since winning promotion to the Premier League under Malky Mackay during the 2012-13 season.
Slade has been in charge since October 2014 and oversaw a turbulent last campaign that saw Cardiff finish 11th in the Championship table.
Now in his first full term at the helm, the former Leyton Orient boss feels this is the time for his work to be judged fairly.
"I understand football managers are judged every day, every game," said Slade.
"When I came into the club there was a lot of work that needed to be done. One day I'll maybe tell you everything.
"A lot of things had to be addressed before you move forward and, if you don't get out of that and address it, then the spiral can continue downward.
"It was important to stop that spiral at source as quickly as possible. I think we've done that.
"I think I've given us stability now and I think everyone can look forward and look up."
Cardiff are four points behind Championship leaders Brighton and one ahead of Middlesbrough in third.
The Bluebirds host sixth-placed Hull on Tuesday in a match which pits them against a team relegated from the Premier League last season and have been tipped for an immediate return.
Slade, however, is not too concerned about the promotion race at this early stage of the season.
"I'm firmly concentrating on performance. I just want to see progression," he added.
"We've used the word transition, stability and towards the back end of last season we saw a bit of progress.
"We've seen a bit more progress now, which is what we all desire."
