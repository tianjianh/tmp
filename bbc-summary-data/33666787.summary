Eurotunnel hoping to clear passenger backlog

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eurotunnel says it hopes to clear its backlog of passengers overnight and run a normal service on Sunday.

At one stage on Saturday it said there were delays of up to five hours, partly caused by migrants entering its terminal in France on Friday night.
It says there is now a 60-minute waiting time to board in Kent. Services from Calais are on schedule.
Passengers have been advised to arrive on time when they travel on Sunday, rather than turning up early.
Eurotunnel services have been hit by strikes and migrants trying to stow away on lorries, in their attempts to cross from France to the UK, for several weeks.
Shortly before midnight on Friday, Eurotunnel briefly suspended services after migrants accessed the Eurotunnel terminal on the French side.
The operator said this caused a backlog of delays, on top of traffic issues, which it had been working through on Saturday.
In other travel updates:
John Keefe, Eurotunnel spokesman, told the BBC a normal service was now being run and any remaining delays were being caused by the large volume of traffic to the Eurotunnel site, in part because of Operation Stack.
The operation involves the parking - or stacking - of lorries on the M20 in Kent when cross-Channel services are disrupted.
Mr Keefe said it was also one of the busiest days of the year for travel.
It is hoped the remainder of the backlog will be cleared overnight and a normal service without delays will be run by Sunday morning.
Passengers have been advised to check for traffic updates before travelling and not turn up early, to avoid too many people crowding the terminal.
On the issue of migrants, Mr Keefe said Eurotunnel had already spent 13m euros (Â£9.2m) on security in the first six months of the year - more than its usual 10m euros (Â£7.1m) annual budget.
