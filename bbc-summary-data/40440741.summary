[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two people were left with "life-changing" injuries when a corrosive substance was thrown on to them through their car windows.
Cousins Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar had been celebrating Ms Khan's 21st birthday before the attack.
John Tomlin, 24, is described as white, 6ft tall, of stocky build and with short fair hair.
He is known to frequent the Canning Town area.
Ms Khan, a student at Manchester Metropolitan University, and Mr Muhktar suffered severe burns to the face and body in the attack on 21 June.
"Within seconds, my cousin started screaming. Her eyes were blistered, her face started melting. My face started melting", Mr Muhktar said.
According to police, they had stopped at traffic lights when the man approached them and threw the toxic substance at Ms Khan through the window.
The attacker then circled around the car and threw more of the acid at Mr Muhktar, before eventually fleeing the scene.
Mr Muhktar, 37, had to be temporarily placed in an induced coma to treat his injuries.
"I'm in a really bad way. I'm going to be scarred for life. I can't walk properly, I can't hear properly, I can't sleep", he said.
Police said there was no current information to suggest the attack was racially or religiously motivated.
