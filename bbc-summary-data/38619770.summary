Accrington Stanley 1-1 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Accrington Stanley held promotion-chasing Carlisle United to a draw, despite playing for 78 minutes with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The struggling Reds faced an uphill task from the 12th minute when defender Matty Pearson's challenge on Macaulay Gillesphey was judged high and dangerous by referee Chris Sarginson.
It was the second red card in a week for relegation-threatened Accrington, and Carlisle took advantage on 20 minutes when Gillesphey's cross was flicked on by Shaun Miller and Jason Kennedy bundled the ball goalwards, with unfortunate Stanley defender Omar Beckles getting the final touch.
However, the 10 men replied immediately when Shay McCartan's 20-yard free-kick sailed into the top corner for his first goal of the season.
Carlisle's top scorer Charlie Wyke twice headed over from good positions, Kennedy forced a superb reflex save from Fulham loan goalkeeper Marek Rodak from six yards and unmarked substitute Jabo Ibehre headed off target.
Still Accrington had chances with on-loan Hull defender Harvey Rodgers coming close with a header and Billy Kee testing keeper Mark Gillespie, who then kept out Rodgers in stoppage time.
