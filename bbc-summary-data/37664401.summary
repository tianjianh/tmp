[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 2-0 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry secured back-to-back league wins for the first time this season with victory over Rochdale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rochdale could have taken the lead in the sixth minute after Ian Henderson's mazy run was blocked by Jordan Willis' last-ditch tackle.
Keith Hill's Dale side kept up the pressure and Callum Camps tested Lee Burge with a 30-yard free-kick.
But Coventry opened the scoring after 28 minutes through striker Daniel Agyei, who had hit the post nine minutes earlier.
Rochdale had the better of the second half and Matthew Lund's 52nd-minute header was cleared off the line by Gael Bigirimana.
Despite offering very little in the second half, Andre Wright made sure of the points for Coventry in the 84th minute as he tapped home a cross from Lewis Page.
