Public briefed on new Belfast Rapid Transit system

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A series of public information days are being held in east and west Belfast to outline the benefits of the city's new Rapid Transit System.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Belfast Rapid Transit system (BRT) will link the city centre with west and east Belfast and the Titanic Quarter.
Work is due to begin on the new public transport system in the coming months - it is expected to be fully operational in three years.
The aim is a fast and reliable service using state of the art larger buses.
They will operate at five to eight minute intervals during peak times.
BRT halts will be raised to facilitate wheelchair users, elderly people and parents with pushchairs.
The halts will be further apart to help speed up services and existing public transport such as Metro buses and taxis using bus corridors will be reorganised to complement the BRT.
New park and rides will be built to encourage motorists to use the new system.
A public information event has already been held in the east of the city over the next two days, they will be held in west Belfast.
The next event will take place in Cult??rlann McAdam ?? Fiaich on Thursday 9 January 2014 between 09:30 GMT and 20:00 GMT and on Friday 10 January 2014 between 09:30 GMT and 16:00 GMT.
This event will provide details of the proposals for the section of the Belfast Rapid Transit Route on the Falls Road between Whiterock Road and Grosvenor Road.
