Election results 2017: Labour takes Warwick and Leamington seat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour has taken the Warwick and Leamington seat from the Conservatives.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matt Western, a Warwickshire county councillor, took the seat from Chris White who held a majority of 6,606 in 2015.
Describing his win as "astonishing", Mr Western said of Labour's manifesto: "We recognised at the time that we had something special, we had a promise."
Nuneaton has been held by the Conservatives with a majority of 4,739.
The marginal constituency is known as a bellwether seat, as it changes hands between Labour and the Tories and tends to go with whichever party forms the government.
Turnout was 72.8% in Warwick and Leamington, which was 2.1% higher than 2015.
The three incumbent Coventry MPs, Geoffrey Robinson, Colleen Fletcher and Jim Cunningham, were all re-elected with increased majorities.
Mr Western gained 25,227 votes, which was a 1,206 majority over Mr White.
His team tweeted: "7.6% swing! 'Astonishing' - 68 on target list!! #LabourVictory".
The Liberal Democrat candidate Nick Solman was third with 2,810 votes.
Mr Western said his "extraordinary" win was partly because of the public's "disillusionment" with the Tory government. In contrast, the Labour manifesto "resonated" with voters, he said.
The Conservatives held seats in Warwickshire North and Stratford-on-Avon.
In Nuneaton, the incumbent Nuneaton MP Marcus Jones was re-elected, securing 23,755 votes.
Mr Jones, who was followed by Labour's Philip Johnson with 19,016 votes, said he was "absolutely delighted".
Of the remaining candidates, UKIP's Craig Carpenter received 1,619 votes, Liberal Democrat Richard Brighton-Knight received 914 and the Green Party candidate Chris Brookes received 763.
Following his win Mr Jones defended Theresa May's decision to call the election.
"[Mrs] May was right to call an election," he said.
"We set out a clear manifesto to take the country forwardâ€¦ and the people of Nuneaton have supported that manifesto."
Warwickshire North, the county's most marginal seat, was held by the Conservatives' Craig Tracey who secured 26,860 votes, a majority of 8,510.
Labour's Julie Jackson received 18,350 votes; Lib Dem James Cox 1,028; and Green candidate Keith Kondakor took 940.
The party also held Stratford-on-Avon with a 20,958 majority for Nadhim Zahawi who secured 32,657 votes.
Meanwhile, Conservative Mark Pawsey held his seat in Rugby, securing 27,872 votes - a majority of 8,212.
