[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
First Half begins.
Lineups are announced and players are warming up.
Leading scorer Glenn Murray is banned after his red card in that game and defender Gaetan Bong (knee) is out.
Cardiff boss Neil Warnock has no new injury worries as he targets a fourth consecutive league win.
Defender Bruno Ecuele Manga is expected back this week from the Africa Cup of Nations after Gabon were eliminated.
Victory would take Brighton to the top of the Championship table.
The match has been rearranged after the scheduled meeting on 30 December was postponed because of fog.
Brighton boss Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex:
"In my time here we haven't had a comfortable game against Cardiff.
"You know what to expect with a Neil Warnock side - a team fighting to get a result. They will be in confident form.
"But we would like to capitalise on the fact we are at home, on the back of a really good home victory on Friday."
