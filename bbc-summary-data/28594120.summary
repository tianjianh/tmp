The five work for Express Motors in Penygroes, which took over some routes from Padarn Bus after its voluntary liquidation in May.
It comes after several people were arrested following an investigation into alleged fraud at Padarn Bus.
There is no suggestion the two investigations are linked.
North Wales Police confirmed the four men and one woman from Gwynedd and Anglesey have been granted bail in the latest investigation.
A Gwynedd council spokesman said: "We are monitoring the situation closely at present and preparing contingency plans that could be put in place if problems arise that could have a sudden impact upon the provision of public transport.
"As this matter is currently being investigated by the police, it would not be appropriate for the council to comment further."
Padarn Bus provided routes across north Gwynedd, Bangor and Caernarfon, and also several services on Anglesey prior to its liquidation, which meant 84 people lost their jobs.
