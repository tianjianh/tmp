Scoot Ferries launches new foot passenger service for Isle of Wight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new foot passenger service between the Isle of Wight and the mainland is to start from August.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scoot Ferries is launching a service between Yarmouth on the island and Lymington in the New Forest.
There will also be a shuttle between Town Quay, Cowes and East Cowes, giving passengers an option to use the chain ferry service.
CEO ZoÃ« Ombler said: "The primary goal is to enhance the ease of islanders getting on and off the island".
It is hoped services between Cowes and Hamble and Cowes and Portsmouth will start in 2016.
A free chain ferry has been running between Cowes and East Cowes since 1859.
Protests about the introduction of a charge were staged at the end of last year, but passengers will have to pay up to 70p for a return journey from 20 July.
