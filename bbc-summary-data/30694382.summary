Forbes unveils its 30 'game changers' under 30 lists

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forbes has released its "greatest gathering of young game changers, movers and makers" under the age of 30.

There are 600 people in 20 categories, taking in everything from Hollywood to finance to science.
Ed Sheeran, Emma Watson and Jeremy Cabalona, the man who vines for Vine, are all there.
You'll recognise a few names but we've also picked out some you might not know too.
This category includes actors, writers, YouTube stars, their agents and even a stunt-fight co-ordinator.
Familiar names include Blake Lively, Ansel Elgort, Bo Burnham and Harry Morenstein from the EpicMealTime YouTube channel.
There are even a few Brits. Keira Knightley is described as "a force in Hollywood".
In the thick of Oscar buzz for her role in The Imitation Game she also produced her own film last year, The Other Typist.
Emma Watson is also in there. Forbes says she has come a long way from Hogwarts, finding her "niche as an actor".
It also points out her new role as UN Women Goodwill Ambassador. Her speech on gender equality at the UN last year went viral.
Forbes says: "It's no longer enough for our list members to be...confined to one genre," adding that "reinvention" is the key.
Emma Watson turned to indie films, Ellen Page took a stand on gay rights, Blake Lively has launched an online store and Zac Efron has "finally found his calling - as a comic actor".
New rule this year - no repeats. So no Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars or Wiz Khalifa as they appeared on last year's list.
Regardless, the rundown still reads like a top ten chart. Sam Smith won more Grammy nominations this year than any other artist, Ed Sheeran was Spotify's most streamed artist of 2014 and Iggy Azalea is singled out for having had 400 million YouTube views in her debut year.
Hozier, the Irish singer and writer of Grammy-nominated Take Me To Church, is also on the list as are the BBC's Sound of 2013 winners Haim. Forbes applauds them as a band with "hipster goddess status" with "mainstream success".
The judges decided to keep ten places on the list reserved for non-performers.
The Swedish producer Shellback is on there, he produced nine songs on Taylor Swifts 1989 album. Hit-Boy, who signed a production deal with Kanye West's G.O.O.D music label age 24 also features. He later launched his own Interscope imprint.
If you think Sam Smith's rise was meteoric, how about this, a website launched last year to capitalise on the internet's love of animal gifs has just got another $4.7m (Â£3.08m) investment to expand. That's why founder of The Dodo Izzie Lerer features.
The man who vines for Vine is listed too, Jeremy Cabalona, 25, runs all their social media. Greg Mara is also there, the 26-year-old runs the algorithm on users' Facebook feeds.
The youngest of them all is Mark Gurman. At the age of 20 he's a senior editor at the Apple product news website 9to5Mac - and he's been there almost 5 years.
