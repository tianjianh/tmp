Scenes for this summer's movie, BFG, were shot on the Isle of Skye.
The local authority unit helped with inquiries about locations on the island, according to a report to Highland councillors.
Most of the council officers' report deals with future funding of the unit and similar projects at the council.
However, it does mention that productions handled by the unit included Spielberg's BFG.
The officers have recommended not making any significant reduction in funding to the unit because of the benefits it brings to the area.
Next week's planning, development and infrastructure committee will consider the report.
