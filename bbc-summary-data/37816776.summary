He was pulled over by police in Northampton on Saturday while driving the white Toyota at about 12:00 BST on Wellingborough Road.
Officers, who seized 30 cars that day as part of a road policing operation, said it was an "interesting concept".
PC Dave Lee said the driver would likely be fined or face a court appearance for the misdemeanour.
"Interesting concept for this Toyota that was driving along. #PeePo," PC Lee wrote on Twitter.
Northamptonshire Police added: "Our central ticket office will write to him giving him various options from a fine through to a court appearance."
