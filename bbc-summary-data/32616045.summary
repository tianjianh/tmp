[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gavin Tainton's jail term increased for Maesteg robbery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A window cleaner who tied up an 88-year-old woman, threatened her into silence and stole Â£15 has had his "significantly too short" 10-year sentence increased to 14 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Constance Davies, 88, was at home in Maesteg, Bridgend county, when Gavin Tainton burst in demanding money.
Debt-ridden Tainton, 32, was jailed in February after being convicted of robbery at Cardiff Crown Court.
His sentence was increased at the Court of Appeal in London on Wednesday.
Lord Justice Fulford, sitting with Mr Justice Spencer and Mr Justice Holgate, noted the "extreme frailty" of Tainton's victim - who is 5ft 2in and weighs barely seven stone.
He said: "This vulnerable and elderly lady was brutally attacked in her own home.
"Her injuries, given her time of life and her frailty, were significant and the impact of this offence - both physically and psychologically - will be permanent."
His case reached the Court of Appeal after lawyers for the Solicitor General, Robert Buckland QC, urged the three judges to increase his "unduly lenient" sentence.
