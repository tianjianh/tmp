Both riders ended the event in Switzerland with three gold medals.
Trott, 23, had already won gold in the scratch race and women's team pursuit - alongside 21-year-old Archibald.
GB topped the medal table with six golds and three bronzes as Ciara Horne came third in the individual pursuit.
Double Olympic champion Trott easily won the six-discipline omnium after the points race, having led overnight.
Earlier, she finished second in the time trial and first in the flying lap to build a commanding lead.
It was her 10th European track title overall, making her the competition's most successful rider.
"I am super happy with that - I absolutely love the Euros," Trott told British Cycling.
Team-mate Archibald, meanwhile, retained her individual pursuit title.
She clocked three minutes 32.832 seconds to win gold from the Netherlands' Elise Delzenne.
After the event, Archibald said she was "pretty happy, pretty sweaty - all the things you'd expect".
Horne's bronze was her second medal of the event after she was part of the team pursuit squad alongside Trott and Archibald.
