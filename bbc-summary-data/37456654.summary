Belfast City Councillors signal end of big screen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors in Belfast have signalled the end of the big screen in the grounds of city hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the strategic policy and resources committee have unanimously voted to place the equipment on the council's Asset Disposal Register.
It means the big screen, which has been operating at city hall since 2011, will be put up for sale.
It will remain in place until it is purchased by someone or until it becomes obsolete.
Whatever happens, the screen will not remain after 2019.
It currently needs an upgrade that would cost about Â£120,000, which is part of the reason why councillors unanimously voted against holding on to it.
The screen only has temporary planning permission until 2019 and councillors felt that investing in an upgrade would not represent value for money.
Some councillors also believe it is not attracting enough people to make investing in it worthwhile.
This decision is still subject to ratification by the full council, which next meets on 3 October.
