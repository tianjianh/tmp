The market is centred around Victoria Square and Birmingham's Council House - and with more than 100 stalls, organisers claim it is the biggest authentic German market anywhere in the world other than in Germany and Austria.
Traditional food and crafts are on offer, as well as a festive atmosphere.
As BBC Midlands Today's Ben Sidwell found out, the man who brought the market to Birmingham, Kurt Stroscher, took his inspiration from the city's twin - Frankfurt.
