Mackie has scored twice in 33 Championship games for the Rs since rejoining following his release by Nottingham Forest in June 2015.
The 31-year-old found the net 18 times in 94 games in his first spell at Loftus Road between 2010 and 2013.
Meanwhile, midfielder Karl Henry, 34, will leave the club after not being offered a new contract.
Henry made 118 appearances for the Rs after signing from Wolves for an undisclosed fee in July 2013, but had not featured since December.
