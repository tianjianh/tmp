[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted loan shark who kept thousands in cash in pillowcases under his bed has been ordered to pay three of his victims £66,000 in compensation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gareth Jenkins, 63, was jailed for 15 months for illegal money lending in June 2015.
When officers raided his Caerphilly home, they found £30,000 stuffed in the pillowcases and recovered £61,000 from two bank accounts.
The order for compensation was made at Cardiff Crown Court on Monday.
The total of £91,073, which includes a further £25,000 recovered by Proceeds of Crime officers, has to be paid in full in 28 days, or Jenkins will have to serve a further nine months in prison.
The hearing was brought to court by the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit (Wimlu) after Jenkins was convicted of four offences of loan sharking over a 10-year period.
Stephen Grey, investigations manager for Wimlu, said: "We are very pleased with this result, as this is the first time we have been able to use seized assets to provide significant sums of money to compensate the victims directly.
"If anyone thinks that a loan shark is operating near them, please call us and we can use this intelligence to investigate."
