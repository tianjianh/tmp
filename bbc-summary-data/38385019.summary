Cardiff Crown Court was told that Stuart Bailey, 54, of Ynysybwl, Rhondda Cynon Taff, and the mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, planned the sex attack via text messages.
The mother sent Bailey a naked photo of her daughter and bought sleeping tablets to drug her, the court heard.
They were found guilty of conspiracy to rape and will be sentenced in January.
Bailey was also found guilty of encouraging the distribution of indecent photographs of a child, and encouraging the sexual assault of a child.
Prosecutor Jim Davis said Bailey sent the mother messages asking, "let me do as I please".
He denied any wrongdoing and told the court it was a "thrill" sending out "vile and disgusting" messages.
The mother alleged she was being blackmailed and bullied by Bailey who had threatened her with physical violence.
The judge, Recorder Eleri Rees QC, remanded the pair in custody.
After the verdict, Det Insp Dean Llewellyn, of South Wales Police's Major Crime Unit, said it was a "harrowing crime".
"Our work to protect vulnerable children will not let up and today's verdict is further proof that those who engage in this type of criminality will be caught and brought to justice," he said.
