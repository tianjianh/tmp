[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 1-3 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth earned an impressive victory at fellow League Two promotion hopefuls Luton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors were close early on as Matt Clarke's header was hooked off the line by Alan Sheehan before the Hatters took the lead on seven minutes, top scorer Danny Hylton thundering a header into the net.
Hylton had a second ruled out for offside, and Pompey equalised through Michael Smith's wonderful angled side-footed finish from 20 yards.
Michael Doyle sent his effort into the side-netting for Pompey, and Christian Walton saved well from Gary Roberts' drive, with David Forde repelling Hylton's effort from distance.
Pompey were in front on the stroke of half-time, when a corner was not cleared and Gareth Evans fired into the net.
In the second period Portsmouth missed two glorious chances, Christian Burgess nodding against the bar and Evans glancing wide from eight yards out.
Luton almost had a leveller when Forde made a mess of James Justin's cross and Sheehan's follow-up was kicked off the line by Burgess.
However, Pompey sealed their win with four minutes to go, sub Kal Naismith lashing home from an acute angle.
