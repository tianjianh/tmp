Many rural bus services have been affected and a small number of schools have been closed in County Down and parts of counties Tyrone and Antrim.
Several roads that were blocked by fallen trees during gale force winds on Thursday remain closed on Friday.
A list of road closures is available on Transport NI's Trafficwatch website.
They include the Hillsborough Road, Lisburn, County Antrim, where a man was killed when his van was hit by a fallen tree on Thursday morning.
The public transport company Translink said there was disruption to some of its services in counties Armagh, Down, Londonderry, Tyrone and Antrim on Friday.
It said there were reports of "treacherous road conditions" around Claudy, Dungiven, Strabane and Omagh and school bus services in these areas would be affected.
It said most "back road" rural bus services in Armagh would not operate on Friday morning due to to heavy snow.
The company added that no bus services were operating in or out of Rathfriland bus depot in County Down.
Full details of public transport changes are available on the Translink website.
BBC Northern Ireland weather presenter Geoff Maskell said the snow showers were forecast to ease through the morning to leave some brighter spells.
However, he said the sleet and snow showers are expected to return on Friday evening and weather warnings for snow and ice remain in place.
The severe weather over the last few days has created dangerous conditions in several parts of Northern Ireland, especially for motorists and pedestrians.
Two teenage girls were blown against a bus in Belfast during high winds on Thursday morning. They were taken to hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.
In the east of the city, three people including a child of three and a 75-year-old woman were injured when a pallet blew off a lorry in Connswater.
Meanwhile, emergency repair crews have worked throughout the night to restore power to customers who lost their electricity supply during Thursday's storm.
A total of 7,000 homes and businesses experienced power cuts over the last 24 hours as gale-force winds caused damage to the electricity network.
Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) said incident centres in the affected areas stayed open to co-ordinate the effort.
By 07:00 GMT on Friday, only a handful of customers were still without power.
A NIE spokeswoman said about 12 households were waiting on repairs, but their supply was expected to be restored shortly.
