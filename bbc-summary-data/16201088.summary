Tajikistan profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The media have greater freedoms than in some other Central Asian states, but officials dictate editorial policy at the state media and obstruct critical outlets.

The authorities silence dissent by intimidating journalists and by using "exhaustive" litigation, says the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Self-censorship is commonplace.
Television is the most popular medium. The State Committee for TV and Radio operates four national networks and regional channels.
There are more than a dozen private TV stations. Russian TV is widely-watched. Radio can be the sole source of information for those living in very remote areas.
The newspaper sector comprises government-owned and private titles. Most of these publish weekly and circulation figures are low.
There are nearly 1.4 million internet users (InternetLiveStats.com, 2014).
The authorities routinely block websites and social media platforms, including Russia's Odnoklassniki, Facebook and YouTube. But users are adept at using proxies to get around this. Opposition websites operate mainly from abroad.
