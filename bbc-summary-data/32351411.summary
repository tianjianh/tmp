Our bond with our furry friends has a lot to do with their puppy dog eyes.
That's because when a dog owner looks their pooch in the eye it often causes an increase in a chemical in their bodies which creates feelings of love.
The chemical, called oxytocin, helps parents bond with babies when they look at them.
Researchers had the lovely job of collecting wee from dogs and their owners before and after a 30-minutes together
The samples showed that those pairs who gazed at each most had the greatest amount of oxytocin in their wee.
The research was done by scientists at Azabu University in Japan.
The scientists say if you want to get the best out of your pet you need to look into their eyes rather than just telling them what to do.
