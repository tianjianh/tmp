The shooting of Lavontay White and a 26-year-old man were captured on Facebook Live by the woman who was also injured in Tuesday's attack.
Police say White and his uncle were shot in the head while riding in a car with his uncle's girlfriend.
The shooting is the latest in a wave of gun violence that has gripped the city.
Authorities are yet to identify the man, a known gang member who appeared to be the intended target, and his girlfriend.
Lavontay White, identified by the Cook County Medical Examiner's office, was later pronounced dead in hospital.
The woman and her unborn baby were both listed in fair condition at Mount Sinai Hospital.
The chilling footage purported to show the three victims in a car when another vehicle pulled up and a gunman got out and opened fire, according to officials.
No arrests have been made but investigators have "very optimistic leads", according to police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.
Authorities were also reviewing the footage.
The killings come on the heels of the shooting of two girls, ages 11 and 12, who were both hit in separate incidents that took place less than 30 minutes of each other on Chicago's South Side on Saturday.
Two girls shot in head in Chicago
Takiya Holmes, 11, was sitting in her family's minivan when she was shot in the head.
Less than an hour later, Kanari Gentry-Bowers, 12, was also struck in the head while playing basketball at her primary school's playground.
Holmes was pronounced dead on Tuesday while Gentry-Bowers remains in a critical condition.
Chicago has seen a spike in gang-related violence that has garnered national attention from both media and President Donald Trump.
The city had 4,000 shooting victims and 762 homicides last year, according to police statistics.
The violence has continued this year, with at least 76 homicides reported so far in 2017.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel released a statement on Tuesday ,saying that when children are caught in the crossfire, "our consciences are shaken and our hearts are broken".
