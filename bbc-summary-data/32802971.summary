[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-MP George Galloway referred to police over parliamentary expenses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A complaint against former Respect MP George Galloway over his use of parliamentary funds has been referred to the police, the parliamentary standards watchdog has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Galloway's former parliamentary assistant Aisha Ali Khan reported him to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority earlier this year.
She has alleged she was required to run personal errands for him.
The former Bradford West MP said the claims were "news to me".
Following an assessment of Ms Ali Khan's claims, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Aurthority (IPSA) compliance officer Peter Davis has passed the case to the Metropolitan Police.
An IPSA spokesman said: "IPSA'S compliance officer has completed his assessment of the George Galloway complaint and has passed it on to the Metropolitan Police Service."
Mr Galloway lost his Bradford West seat at the General Election earlier this month.
Ms Ali Khan alleged that, during her six-month stint as his taxpayer-funded assistant in 2012, she was required to help plan Mr Galloway's wedding, shop for underwear, sort out his laundry, make his breakfast and work for the Viva Palestina charity.
Her lawyers said this amounted to a breach of the requirement to use funds for parliamentary purposes.
In a statement Mr Galloway said: "This is news to me. According to the media IPSA have had a complaint but they haven't informed me who has complained or exactly what the complaint is about.
"And then, without even a call, an email or a letter, they appear to have handed it on to the Met and gone public about it.
"If IPSA's compliance officer has completed some kind of investigation without asking for any response from the person complained about, or even letting him know who has complained and what the complaint is about, then that is surely a breach of natural justice, and undoubtedly inspired by Kafka.
"When I know officially what this is all about I will respond more fully."
