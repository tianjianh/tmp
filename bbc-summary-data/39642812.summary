Moeen is available for the County Championship Division Two match against Northamptonshire, starting on Friday.
And, despite last weekend's eight-wicket win over Glamorgan, Rhodes has confirmed that Moeen, 29, will play.
"Whoever misses out, it's special circumstances. They understand that," Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester.
"We love having Mo in our side - he's a wonderful character. His attitude is brilliant when he comes back to play for us."
As well as his one-off Championship appearance against Northants, Moeen has been made available by the England and Wales Cricket Board for Worcestershire's first three One-Day Cup matches - against Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Northants.
"We've got good young players who have played quite a bit now so hopefully we can all gel together this year and surprise a few people. And they've made a good start," said Moeen.
"The Championship game is very important from a Worcestershire point of view. And also from a personal point of view to get some form and bat some time.
"But the three one-dayers are also something I'm definitely looking forward to, and hopefully opening the batting again."
Moeen played three early season Championship matches for Worcestershire last summer, scoring 273 runs at an average of 91, but he took only one wicket with his off-spin.
It will be his first Worcestershire appearance since making 81 in the the nine-wicket One-Day Cup quarter-final defeat by Somerset at Taunton last August.
