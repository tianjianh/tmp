The Mercedes driver edged one ahead of the seven-time champion with his fifth career win at the Hungaroring on Sunday.
Hamilton said: "When you think that I grew up watching Michael, so to now have had similar, or one more, than he had here is just incredible.
"I wouldn't have [achieved it] without the great people I have worked with."
He paid tribute to both his current team and McLaren, with whom he took three of his four previous wins in Hungary, in 2007, 2009 and 2012.
He also won in his first year with Mercedes in 2013 but before Sunday the team had not claimed victory at the track since the introduction of hybrid engines in 2014.
Hamilton's victory on Sunday was the 48th of his career, which puts him only three behind Alain Prost as the second-most successful driver of all time in terms of wins.
Schumacher, who Hamilton replaced at Mercedes at the end of 2012, has 91.
Schumacher remains in recuperation from severe head injuries suffered in a skiing accident in December 2013.
He has not been seen in public since the injury and the extent of his recovery is unknown. His manager Sabine Kehm said in February that she hoped "one day he will be back with us".
Hamilton's win on Sunday moved him into the lead of the world championship for the first time this year  - he now leads team-mate Nico Rosberg by six points, having gained 49 points on the German in the last six races.
Hamilton said: "I honestly feel we are in the strongest position we have been all year in terms of our performance and how unified we are."
