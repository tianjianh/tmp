The Perth hurdler helped the women's quartet to Great Britain's 66th medal in Rio, surpassing the 65 from their home Games in 2012.
Golds for rower Heather Stanning, in the women's pair, cyclists Callum Skinner - in the men's team sprint - and Katie Archibald - in the women's team pursuit  - and tennis star Andy Murray had already helped Scots surpass their previous best for an overseas Games of eight medals from the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.
Two relay silver medals for swimmer Duncan Scott and a fifth Olympic medal for 40-year-old rower Katherine Grainger were also among the highlights as Scots surpassed the target of 10 set by Mike Whittingham, performance director for national agency Sportscotland.
Callum Skinner also picked up a second medal when he took silver behind GB team-mate Jason Kenny in the men's sprint final.
There were 50 Scots - the largest ever contingent in a Great Britain team for an overseas Olympics, surpassing the previous record of 31 in Beijing in 2008 - competing in 15 of the 42 sports in Rio.
Heather Stanning (Rowing, women's pair).
Gordonstoun-educated Stanning, who lives in Lossiemouth, and partner Helen Glover were unbeaten in the women's pair since 2011, and led the final from start to finish to successfully defend their Olympic title.
