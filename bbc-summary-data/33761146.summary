Social work delays can put children at risk, says Ofsted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vulnerable children in England could be at risk because of delays in social workers' assessments of the care they need, Ofsted has said in a report.

Overall the assessments were improving but were "not timely enough" in about 25% of cases, the watchdog found.
Inspectors visited 10 local authorities and examined 123 cases in a survey commissioned by Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw.
Progress was "encouraging" but there was still more to do said Sir Michael.
Earlier Ofsted reports, among them the 2012-13 annual report into children's social care, identified poor quality assessments by social workers, particularly in the weaker local authorities.
Ofsted says good assessments are crucial to building an accurate picture and ensuring "decisive, effective action to protect children".
The 2012-13 report found only four in 10 local authorities were "good" or better for safeguarding.
Poor assessment was a key theme.  In particular, the report said, the views of children and families were rarely considered.
In the latest survey inspectors noted steady progress in the quality, efficacy and timeliness of assessments.
"A greater proportion of assessments resulted in children and families receiving the right help and support at the right time," they found.
But the report says delays in assessment sometimes still leave children "at potential risk of harm".
"The improvement in the quality of care assessments is encouraging," said Sir Michael.
"However there is still more to do before we can be assured that all children and families are receiving the high standards of care required."
David Simmonds, deputy chairman of the Local Government Association, said the progress was "testament to the hard work of local authorities" but agreed they could do more.
"Councils acknowledge the need for improvement in children's mental health services, provided by the NHS, which has for a long time been a 'Cinderella service' without the capacity to meet need.
"With councils taking the reins of public health work we are beginning to see progress in partnership with local GPs â€Žas inadequate national services are redesigned locally."
He said care assessments for vulnerable children were "only a small part of the bigger picture".
He added: "Councils need a million eyes and ears in the community if they are to protect children effectively.
"This depends on other agencies including the NHS and police and we look forward to Ofsted bringing in a more effective focus on partnership working in future inspections."
