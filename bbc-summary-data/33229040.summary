[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The governor of South Carolina has called for the removal of a Confederate flag from the state capitol's grounds.

The flag, emblematic of the south during the US civil war, was embraced by the man accused of killing nine people in a black church last week.
To prolonged applause, Governor Nikki Haley called for the "removal of a symbol that divides us", a move that paves the way for a vote this week.
The Sons of Confederate Veterans says it will fight attempts to remove it.
The confederate group says it symbolises their heritage and history, not hate, and has offered condolences to the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where the attack took place.
At a news conference, South Carolina Governor Haley acknowledged that point of view but said to many others it was a "deeply offensive symbol of brutal oppression".
The flag was originally the battle flag of the southern states in the civil war when they tried to break away to prevent the abolition of slavery.
Only the South Carolina's state legislature may remove the flag, according to a deal hatched when the flag was moved in 2000 off the capitol's dome to the memorial where it now stands.
A vote could take place this week and could bring to an end many years of bitter arguing about the prominent location of the flag.
The latest debate over it was prompted by the shooting of nine black worshippers during a bible study group at the church in Charleston.
The suspect, Dylann Roof, has been pictured holding the Confederate flag.
State leaders have held crisis meetings as they have tried to find a solution but some leading Republicans have called for action.
"Last week's terrorising act of violence shook the very core of every South Carolinian," House Majority Leader Jay Lucas said in a statement.
"Moving South Carolina forward from this terrible tragedy requires a swift resolution of this issue."
Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, a Democrat, said: "The flag got appropriated by hate groups. We can't put it in a public place where it can give any oxygen to hate-filled people".
Republicans who have held majorities in the state for about 25 years have pushed back on previous calls to remove the flag. However, there's no apparent consensus between them on how they should respond this time.
The flag seen today on houses, bumper stickers and T-shirts - sometimes accompanied by the words "If this shirt offends you, you need a history lesson" - is not, and never was, the official national flag of the Confederacy.
The design by William Porcher Miles, who chaired the flag committee, was rejected as the national flag in 1861, overlooked in favour of the Stars and Bars.
It was instead adopted as a square battle flag by the Army of Northern Virginia under General Lee, the greatest military force of the Confederacy.
It fast became a potent symbol of Confederate nationalism.
Why do people still fly the Confederate flag?
