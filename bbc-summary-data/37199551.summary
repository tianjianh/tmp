Andrew Coogan was found dead at the scene of the fire in stables at Shorrocks Hill Country Club in Formby.
An investigation began, but police have now confirmed it is not being treated as a suspected crime.
Mr Coogan's family described him as "a devoted uncle" who "helped many people and was a pleasure to be around".
"We will miss him dearly," they added.
Firefighters said Mr Coogan's body was found in a caravan and the dead horses in a stable.
Merseyside Police said a post-mortem had taken place but the cause of death had been withheld until toxicology tests had been completed.
