Career of Evil is one of six books shortlisted for this year's Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Novel of the Year.
Also on the shortlist are Eva Dolan, Mark Billingham, Clare Mackintosh, Adrian McKinty and Renee Knight.
Val McDermid will receive the award for outstanding contribution to crime fiction on 21 July, when book of the year will also be announced.
Previous recipients include Lynda La Plante, Ruth Rendell, PD James and Colin Dexter.
Broadcaster Mark Lawson will host the awards ceremony on 21 July on the opening night of the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival in Harrogate.
One of the judges, Simon Theakston, said: "We're particularly delighted to be honouring Val McDermid this year. On a personal note, Val had the vision to create this festival with Harrogate International Festivals back in 2003.
"Thanks to her far-reaching passion and generosity for crime fiction - for writers and readers alike - it has become the biggest celebration of the genre in the world. As a writer, she is rightfully known as the queen of crime. Val is very deserving of this accolade in the pantheon of legendary crime authors."

Two debut novels have made the shortlist - Knight's Disclaimer and Mackintosh's I Let You Go.
It will be a hat-trick for Billingham if he triumphs, having previously won in 2005 and 2009.
