The song, which is nominated for an Oscar, features in the hit animated film Despicable Me 2.
The track is only the third to reach number one on three separate occasions, the last being Guy Mitchell in 1957 with Singing the Blues.
Happy first made number one in December, and its return saw Sam Smith's Money On My Mind toppled.
The track also passed the million-seller mark this week, matching the glory of his collaboration with Daft Punk on Get Lucky.
"I am beyond grateful for the amount of love and support I've received in response to Happy - it is overwhelming," he told OfficialCharts.com.

"I've always respected the great taste of the UK, and I'm honoured to have my music embraced in such a positive way. I am so thankful."
His song with Robin Thicke, Blurred Lines, has also racked up sales of more than one million, putting Williams in a select group of three acts to have released three million-selling singles. The Beatles achieved six, while Rihanna has three to her name.
Other singles in the top five included Clean Bandit's Rather Be at three, Katy Perry's Dark Horse at four and Christina Aguilera's A Great Big World at five.
In the album chart, Brit Award winners Bastille managed to hold on the number one spot with Bad Blood after a close run race.
They held off the Arctic Monkeys, who won album of the year at the Brits with AM, while Ellie Goulding climbed to third place.
US singer Beck was a new entry at number four with Morning Phase, his highest UK chart placing.
