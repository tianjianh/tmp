[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales and Ospreys flanker Dan Lydiate is set to miss at least the start of the Six Nations after sustaining knee ligament damage.

The injury will also rule the 28-year-old out of the Ospreys' remaining European Challenge Cup group games and the Pro12 Christmas derbies.
"It's not great, there's definitely some ligament damage," Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy told BBC Wales Sport.
"It will be a bit more than a couple of months."
Lydiate was taken off on a stretcher during Wales' 27-13 autumn series win against South Africa on 26 November.
"It's off the back of some bad luck with injuries and he was starting to come back into a bit of form," Tandy added.
"I'm just disappointed for the boy, whoever he was playing for - Wales or Ospreys."
Lydiate was making his 60th appearance for Wales when he suffered the injury.
James King is likely to take over as first-choice blind-side for the Ospreys, while Ross Moriarty or captain Sam Warburton is likely to start at six for Wales.
