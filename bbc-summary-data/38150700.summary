[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £50m arts and innovation centre in Gwynedd has sold more than 76,000 tickets in its first year.

Work on the Pontio centre at Bangor University began in 2012 and it opened last year after a delay which cost £1m.
The university said it was also liaising with contractors over concerns about holes in the roof.
But Pontio directors said they had a successful first 12 months and they were confident they could build on their experiences.
They told the Newyddion 9 programme ticket sales for their first year saw about 35,000 sold for live performances, 39,000 for its cinema and about 2,500 for conferences and other events.
