[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rescue pugs Jasper and Jasmine get married in Australia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jasper and Jasmine got married in front of a crowd of 350 human guests and 60 pugs in St Kilda, Australia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pugs were adopted 18 months ago by a couple who own a pug rescue and adoption charity.
The charity's founder, Joanna Herceg, said a lot of other charities held dinners to raise money, but she thought they needed something with a difference.
"So I thought let's do a pug wedding!
"Weddings are happy things and we are all about happiness."
The wedding has got a lot of attention, with the pair even having their own social media accounts.
There was "a puggy treats bar" full of dog food for the pugs to eat.
Human guests enjoyed drinks, canapÃ©s, wedding cake and music.
