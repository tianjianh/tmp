Arthur France launched the annual Caribbean-themed extravaganza in 1967 after becoming homesick for his native St Kitts and Nevis.
The carnival, believed to be the oldest event of its kind in Europe, contributes up to Â£10m to the local economy each year.
Mr France was given the award earlier.
He told BBC Look North: "I feel very honoured, Leeds is my adopted city and I'm very proud to be given this degree."
Mr France, who remains at the helm of the organising committee, was awarded an MBE in 1997 for his work in the community.
He was given a Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Leeds, which described him as a "generous, compassionate and energetic advocate for the city's West Indian Community".
The three-day carnival, now in its 48th year, takes place over the August Bank Holiday weekend.
It culminates with a parade on the streets of Chapeltown and Harehills, with an attendance often estimated at about 150,000.
