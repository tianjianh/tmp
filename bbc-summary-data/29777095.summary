Wilfried Bony scored both goals as Swansea ended a five-match winless run in the Premier League.
Swansea's first win since August saw them climb to sixth in the table, but Monk was just relieved to get back to winning ways.
"There was a little bit of pressure on us when you don't win in five games," Monk said.
"It was about getting three points as we could feel that little bit of pressure on us within the crowd and amongst the players."
Bony opened the scoring after a fine exchange of passes with Gylfi Sigurdsson, the Ivory Coast striker tucking past Foxes keeper Kasper Schmeichel.
The 25-year-old made it 2-0 by side-footing Jefferson Montero's cross home, his fourth goal in the last three games.
Monk said Swansea were deserving winners and the 35-year-old praised his side's hard work in keeping a clean sheet.
"The goals that we scored were very good goals and warranted the three points," Monk added.
"All of the players are contributing well. After a harsh few weeks, they got their just rewards with a clean sheet and two goals.
"It was never going to be easy, especially when Leicester threw caution to the wind, and we could have controlled the ball a bit better in the second half, but I thought we deserved it.
"We limited them to shots from distance which is credit to the shape we've been working on and how hard defensively we've been working.
"Three goals we've conceded in the last two games - two against Newcastle and the second one against Stoke - has not been the standard we've set but we got back to that to keep a clean sheet."
Swansea face Liverpool on Tuesday in the Capital One Cup fourth round tie against former manager Brendan Rodgers' current side.
"It's always fantastic when you get to play at Anfield - it's a special place," Monk said.
"We've got nothing to lose. They will be favourites to win the games."
