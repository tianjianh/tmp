Edith Varley, from Leicestershire, celebrated her birthday two weeks before going under the knife at Leicester General Hospital in December.
According to Guinness World Records, the previous oldest patient was 102-year-old John Randall.
The retired clerical worker from Oadby had her right hip replaced 30 years ago but recently it came loose.
After discussions with her orthopaedic consultant Richard Power it was decided she was fit enough to undergo surgery.
Mrs Varley said: "I am delighted with the success of the surgery and so grateful to Mr Power and his team for freeing me from the dreadful pain I have suffered for so long.
"I am now practicing my walking and exercise to achieve the best mobility possible to enable me to continue living independently."
Her daughter Jenifer Quelch, said: "Her age was a concern ahead of the operation but we were told there are people in their 60s who aren't as fit as her.
"She was on the high dependency unit for just one night and one day before being transferred to a regular ward to continue her recovery."
Mr Power, who led the team behind the operation, said he believed she was the oldest woman to have such an operation.
"Modern anaesthetic techniques made this possible and the operation was performed in just over an hour with the patient awake under spinal anaesthetic," he said.
Although Mrs Varley could be the oldest person to have a full hip replacement she is not the oldest to have a hip operation.
Last year, Gladys Hooper had an operation on her hip aged 112.
