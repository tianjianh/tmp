The pair dominated Sunday's race but it was Jonny who took silver, finishing 12 seconds behind his older brother.
And it was the 27-year-old who received the ITU's written congratulations for his "triumphant win".
Jonny posted a picture of the letter on Twitter with the message "#awkward".

The Leeds race was the Brownlees' first together since Alistair carried stricken Jonny over the line in last year's World Series finale in Cozumel in Mexico.
Their one-two finish repeated last year's achievement of first and second at the World Series event in their home city.
On Sunday the pair opened up a sizeable gap in the cycle before 29-year-old Olympic champion Alistair ran clear with 2.5km left to win in one hour, 46 minutes 51 seconds.
