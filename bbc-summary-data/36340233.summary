The rapper's hit One Dance spent its sixth week at number one, while album Views climbed three places to the summit.
Elsewhere, the first new single from the Stone Roses for more than 20 years, All For One, entered at number 17.
The song had been at number four in the midweek charts following its surprise release last Thursday evening.
Justin Timberlake has also slid from his midweek position.
His single Can't Stop The Feeling had been at number one in the midweeks after a well-received Eurovision performance, but entered the singles chart at number two.
It was a close race for the top spot: One Dance notched up 105,000 sales, while Can't Stop The Feeling sold 99,000.
About 75,000 of Drake's sales came from streams rather than purchases, about 71% of the song's total.
Calvin Harris and Rihanna's This Is What You Came For drops a place to number three this week, while Sia's Cheap Thrills and Mike Posner's I Took A Pill In Ibiza remain at numbers four and five respectively.
A second Drake song - Too Good, featuring Rihanna - also appears in the top 10, climbing 15 places to number eight.
Further down the chart, X Factor alumni Reggie 'N' Bollie land at Number 26 with New Girl. The track is the duo's first since finishing second place on last year's series.
On the album chart, Drake's Views spent a second week at number one.
His closest competitor was Beyonce's Lemonade, which landed at number two. Views outsold it by just under 800 chart sales.
Meanwhile, Norwegian DJ Kygo is this week's highest new entry at three with Cloud Nine.
Last week's number one from Radiohead, A Moon Shaped Pool, dropped to number four, while Meghan Trainor's new album Thank You debuted at number five.
Justin Bieber's Purpose dropped to number 12 - the first time it has fallen out of the Top 10 in the 26 weeks since its release.
Corinne Bailey Rae's third studio album The Heart Speaks in Whispers is a new entry at number 14 - her first appearance in the album chart for six years.
Other new entries included Pierce the Veil, who scored their first top 40 album with their fourth collection Misadventures, which entered at 17, and Foy Vance's The Wild Swan, which debuted at number 28.
Kanye West's The Life Of Pablo made its debut at Number 30 following an Official Charts rule change which makes albums that are only available on streaming services chart eligible.
