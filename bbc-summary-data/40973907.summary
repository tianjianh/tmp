Diego Costa: Chelsea are demanding 'impossible' fee from Atletico

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Diego Costa says Chelsea are demanding a fee Atletico Madrid "can't get near" for the Spain striker to complete his desired move back to his former club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Costa, 28, remains in his native Brazil after being sent a text in June by boss Antonio Conte telling him he would not be part of the squad this year.
The Blues signed Costa from Atletico for a reported Â£32m in July 2014.
"When I came to Chelsea they paid a lot less compared to what's being offered to them," Costa told ESPN Brasil.
He added that if Atletico do not make a "big effort" to sign him then he "can't keep on wanting" to play for Diego Simeone's side.
"I know that this [big effort] will happen, but if it's to pay the amount that Chelsea want it won't be possible," he said.
