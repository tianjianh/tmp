Conrad Balatoni had a dramatic impact on his Ayr United debut as they and Hibernian moved into the Scottish Challenge Cup's last 16.

The defender, who signed on Friday after being released by Kilmarnock, headed the winner in extra-time in a 3-2 win over Airdrieonians.
Balatoni had earlier been debited with an own goal for the Diamonds.
Goals from Fraser Murray, Brian Graham and Martin Boyle gave Hibs a 3-0 win away to Turriff United.
Murray fired low into the far corner to give the Scottish Championship leaders a 16th-minute lead and Graham headed the second from close range five minutes later.
Highland League side Turriff rarely threatened to recover from those early blows and only the woodwork and saves from Kevin Main prevented the visitors extending their lead before Boyle clipped over the goalkeeper with 15 minutes remaining.
At Somerset Park, Ryan Conroy gave Airdrieonians a 14th-minute lead with a 25-year free-kick, but Craig McGuffie's fine turn and finish drew the Championship side level before Alan Forrest volleyed the hosts ahead on the stroke of half-time.
A Kieran MacDonald strike four minutes after the break deflected off Balatoni past goalkeeper Greg Fleming and no more goals were scored in normal time.
The 25-year-old Balatoni, who had spent a season with Kilmarnock after leaving Partick Thistle, headed the winner from a corner.
The League One visitors' disappointment was compounded when striker Iain Russell was sent off for violent conduct.
