[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 5-2 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andrew Tutte hit a hat-trick as Bury came from 2-0 down to thrash 10-man Colchester United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The U's, who are now 10 points from safety, led through early strikes by Chris Porter and Gavin Massey.
But Tom Eastman was sent off on 33 minutes for a second caution and Ryan Lowe pulled a goal back with a header from the free-kick that followed.
Tutte slid in his first and made 3-2 with a deflected strike, with Craig Jones and Tutte sealing victory.
A remarkable burst of four goals in 12 second-half minutes began when Tutte netted twice inside a minute.
Jones made it 4-2 with a header from Tom Pope's cross and Tutte completed his treble for mid-table Bury with a strike from the edge of the box.
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"This was a massive potential banana skin. I said to the players 'don't get complacent, make sure that we make it difficult for them' but all that went out of the window in the first 15-20 minutes.
"The players showed great resolve in coming back and we scored at a good time.
"The sending off was completely the right decision.
"We really took advantage of them only having 10 players."
