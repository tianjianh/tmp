Anthony Kennedy, 32, fled from officers who were investigating reports of a man with a gun, said a spokesman for the police force.
He was quickly captured, and police then discovered that he is wanted for several other suspected crimes.
The baby has been placed in the care of a relative, police say.
According to local media, the one-year-old child is a boy.
Police were called on Friday afternoon to the West Side of Chicago where they found Kennedy "to be in the possession of a handgun" outside his home.
"As officers approached, Kennedy fled and [the] handgun as well as cannabis were discovered in a baby stroller," said Anthony Guglielmi.
Mr Kennedy has been ordered by a judge to be held in lieu of a $100,000 bond as he awaits trial, according to court records.
He is scheduled to appear in court again on Friday.
