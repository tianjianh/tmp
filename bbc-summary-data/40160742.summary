Rangers fraud trial: 'Cool head' call over Whyte verdict

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jurors in the trial of former Rangers owner Craig Whyte have been urged to keep "cool heads" as they prepare to retire to consider a verdict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Whyte, 46, denies acquiring the club by fraud in May 2011. He also denies another charge under the Companies Act.
The Crown alleges he pretended to have funds to make all the required payments for a controlling stake in the club.
Judge Lady Stacey addressed the jury after the closing speeches in the case at the High Court in Glasgow.
Advocate Depute Alex Prentice QC had told the court that Mr Whyte did not have authority over the funds used in the takeover.
Defence QC Donald Findlay described the accused as "the fall guy" in the case.
In his closing speech on Monday morning, Mr Findlay told the court former Rangers owner Sir David Murray wanted to protect his legacy at the club but was "badly let down" by others who advised on the sale.
Lady Stacey will complete her legal directions on Tuesday before the jury is sent out to consider its verdict.
