Foxes fans attending the home game could redeem the offer before the match to celebrate the club owner's birthday.
Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, whose birthday is on Monday, would like to thank fans for their "fantastic support" throughout the season.
Leicester moved seven points clear at the top of the Premier League after a 1-0 win at the King Power Stadium.
Each ticket holder could collect a complimentary bottle of beer or bottled water and a doughnut from points outside the stadium.
Susan Whelan, the club's chief executive, said Mr Srivaddhanaprabha arrived to the UK from Thailand "just to be with us and to support the team" for the game.
"There are many special bonds that exist at our football club - between the players, the staff, the owners and the fans - and that's been vital to the incredible season we've had," Ms Whelan said.
"Everywhere we go, people are talking about it.
"We're entering the run-in to the end of the season now, so that bond is going to be as important as it's ever been in the next games, and the support of our fans is an essential part of the final push."
Leicester will win the title if they win four of their remaining six games.
