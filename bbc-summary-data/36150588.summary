Joe Marler and Owen Farrell receive two-week bans after European citings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harlequins prop Joe Marler and Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell have both been handed two-week bans after incidents during European fixtures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marler, 25, was found guilty of kicking hooker Arnaud Heguy in his side's 30-6 win over Grenoble in the Challenge Cup.
England team-mate Farrell, 24, was cited for a dangerous tackle on scrum-half Dan Robson in Sarries' Champions Cup semi-final victory over Wasps.
Both players have the right to appeal against the decisions.
The duo will miss the end of the regular Premiership season, but will be free to play in their club sides' respective European finals in Lyon and England's game with Wales in May.
Marler, who has 42 international caps, was playing his first game since being banned for calling Wales' Samson Lee "Gypsy boy" during the Six Nations.
The forward admitted to committing an act of foul play but told a disciplinary hearing he did not accept the incident warranted a red card.
He was charged under Law 10.4 (c), which normally carries a low-end sanction of four weeks, a sentence which would have ruled him out of the Challenge Cup final against Montpellier.
Farrell received a yellow card for his incident but did not accept that he committed an act of foul play.
He was given a low-end sanction of two weeks, with an extra week added as a deterrent. However, the European Rugby disciplinary panel opted to reduce the ban back down to a fortnight because of Farrell's clean record.
Meanwhile, Wasps prop Simon McIntyre has also been suspended for two weeks after he admitted to kicking Saracens and England lock Maro Itoje in the Champions Cup defeat by Saracens.
