[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A reality show about Caitlyn Jenner becoming a transgender woman will no longer be shown in Africa following complaints from viewers, its South African broadcaster said.

Multichoice said "I am Cait" would be dropped out of respect for customers' views and Africa's diverse regulatory environments.
The move came after a request from Nigerian authorities, reports said.
Multichoice's DSTV service broadcasts to the whole continent.

Caitlyn Jenner was a gold medal-winning Olympic athlete as Bruce Jenner before announcing her decision to become a woman in April 2015.
Some parents in Nigeria had said they did not want their children to watch Ms Jenner's show, Nigerian media reported.
It is the second time the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has asked pan-African broadcasters to stop showing transgender-related material, South African media said.
Last October, the NBC asked Multichoice to stop broadcasting "I am Jazz", a show about a transgender woman, Channel 24 reported.
Critics say the decisions risk setting a precedent where a single country can effectively decide what TV viewers across the whole continent can watch.
