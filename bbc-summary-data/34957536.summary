The permanent facility would provide a space for young people and volunteers to gain skills in food, farming and conservation, the trust said.
Currently people are trained in a temporary classroom at Gosling Sike Farm in Houghton near Carlisle.
It is hoped the project will safeguard the future of the county's wildlife.
Development officer Michelle Waller, said: "There is an important role for Cumbria Wildlife Trust to play in passing on knowledge and skills to the future guardians of wildlife in Cumbria.
"The current skills gap in conservation is huge, yet opportunities for people to access these skills have been disappearing over recent years. Gosling Sike Farm is an opportunity to change this."
The trust said it needs to raise a total of about £1m for the construction and running of the building.
