Reading 2-1 Rotherham United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading came from behind to beat relegated Rotherham and solidify their place in the Championship play-offs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Adeyemi gave Rotherham a surprise lead in the 19th minute when he turned in a rebound from keeper Ali Al-Habsi.
Lewis Grabban swept in a powerful volley to level against his former club just two minutes after coming on.
The hosts completed the comeback when John Swift turned in Chris Gunter's cross at the back post to move past Huddersfield into third place.
The Terriers will have a chance to reclaim their position when they play Derby at 17:00 BST, but with Sheffield Wednesday and Fulham both winning, this was an important result for Jaap Stam's side.
Reading were made to work for their win, with Rotherham, who had taken just one point from their last 22 away league games, going in front when Adeyemi bundled in a rebound from Josh Morris' initial header.
The hosts responded with Yakou Meite threatening and Millers defender Semi Ajayi producing a goal-saving challenge on Swift to keep out a rebound off goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell.
Roy Beerens, Yann Kermorgant and Swift all had chances before the one-way traffic finally told; Grabban running onto Garath McCleary's deep cross to smash it low past O'Donnell.
Gunter then overlapped and squared for Swift to tap in and make it 2-1, extending Rotherham's rotten form and keeping Reading in the mix for promotion.
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"We need our fans even more when we are behind. They need to know that they should support their team, not boo them, when they come off the pitch.
"Compared to what the team has done in the past two seasons, they should appreciate what the players are now doing for them. But if they react like that, I'm not very happy with it.
"The fans need to stick with their team and help them out."
Rotherham manager Paul Warne:
"We tried to keep it and cause Reading problems. To go in 1-0 up at half-time was a good thing.
"I thought that if we could ride the first 20 minutes of the second half, we might be able to get a positive result and then Grabban comes on and scores a worldie and Reading put a lot of pressure on us.
"We didn't keep the ball as well in the second half. We didn't have the ball a lot and when we did get it back, we were a bit fatigued."
