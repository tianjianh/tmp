[SN]TITLE[SN]
Winston Churchill's War Rooms clock sold to collector

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A clock that was used by Winston Churchill in the Cabinet War Rooms has been sold to a collector after failing to sell at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The desk clock was given to George Rance, clerk and custodian of the rooms, at the end of the war in 1945.
It failed to reach its by guide price of Â£400 at auction in Chichester, West Sussex on 20 November.
Peter Parker, of Stride and Son, said a collector then contacted them after reading it on the BBC website.
"We have had a flurry of inquiries from interested parties who only seem to have become aware of its existence after the auction," said Mr Parker.
The buyer was "thrilled with their purchase," he added.
Prior to the auction, Sir Nicolas Soames, the Conservative MP and grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, said he could imagine seeing the clock on his grandfather's desk.
