[SN]TITLE[SN]
Avon and Somerset police officer cleared of rape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A married police officer who had a "turbulent" affair with a 19-year-old escort girl has been cleared of repeatedly raping her.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sergeant Peter Lower, of Hill Path, Banwell, North Somerset, met the teenager as he had a "non-existent sex life" with his wife.
At Bristol Crown Court he was convicted of one charge of actual bodily harm.
He did not pay the girl but helped her with what proved to be an unsuccessful application to join the police force.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, later joined the special constabulary.
Lower, 52, contacted the girl on an escort website in February 2009 and embarked on a "quite turbulent relationship".
He was cleared of three charges of rape, one charge of assault by penetration, one charge of sexual assault, two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a single charge of false imprisonment.
The jury was undecided on one further charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two charges of assault by penetration.
The Crown Prosecution Service will now consider its position over those three outstanding charges.
During his evidence, the custody sergeant with Avon and Somerset Police insisted the woman had encouraged him to engage in "rough sex" during their relationship.
Lower told the court: "I loved my wife, I still do, and I thought it was the least complicated way of fulfilling that need.
"I had elicited the services of an escort for sex and I will regret that for the rest of my life."
He added: "I should have been giving all my attention to my wife and children and I just fell into this abyss of shame and hatred for myself.
"I felt compassion towards her. I didn't want a proper relationship with her - it had been toxic. I can only describe it as an addiction."
He will be sentenced on a date to be fixed.
