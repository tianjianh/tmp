Voting against the tide: 'I feel very much in a minority'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK vote to leave the European Union split the country - with 51.9% voting Leave and 48.1% voting to stay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were significant regional differences with Scotland voting decisively for Remain, and England voting strongly for Leave.
So what's it like to vote against the trend of your area, when many of your friends and family might also be voting the other way?
"I voted stay for a number of reasons, mainly keeping a united front in times of such uncertainty. The result today has shocked and scared me a lot.
I feel very much in a minority. People did not so much try to change my mind as just explain why they were voting out.
My family voted to remain as well. My friends were a mixed bag, which made for an interesting day on Facebook. But nothing to fall out over. I think everyone is just wondering what's going to happen next.
The last thing I would like to add is that even though I'm not happy with result I do respect that the rest of the nation has spoken and that's something we have to live with now. Hopefully it can work out for the best."
"I'm 29 and voted to leave. I'm a patriot regarding the UK. I was up at 4:45 before my shift and felt a sense of relief when I saw the news.
All the scare-mongering by the government and the rest of the world did nothing to dampen the voice of the people - who wanted, and I feel deserved, change from the failed political system.
I'm not anti-Europe but against an unelected bureaucracy that can't be held accountable for their actions.
Most of the people I work with and my friends also voted Leave, so I don't feel that I'm in a minority. If London was mainly for Remain, I think that's because it's what big business wanted."
"I voted Remain. I had the option to study abroad while at university and I work for a European company. I have a lot of colleagues and friends who are European. I'm quite shocked and worried about how this will affect our relationship with Europe and also my job.
I also voted Remain for stability.
The result wasn't a total surprise. I know a lot people where I live were voting to Leave.  A lot of people said it was because the EU is undemocratic.  We also see a lot of immigration in the south east.
The rest of my family voted leave. We have to move forward together - I'm sure we'll be discussing the issue in the coming weeks."
"I voted Leave as I believe that the EU is going beyond what it was set up to do. The Eurocrats have far too much power, are not listening to the public and people feel disenfranchised.
I am pleased we have been brave today, and our future is ours now to make better. Also concerned about what the future holds for the UK and whether there will be an economic downturn.
I feel a sense of guilt to have voted differently if it brings job losses to some and another independence referendum in Scotland.
My children voted to Remain. We do believe in personal choice but debates got heated at times. We need to try and heal the wounds this referendum has caused and work together for everyone's benefit."
"I woke up this morning fully expecting a Remain vote, possibly as much as 70% in favour.  I could not believe my eyes when it was announced that at last we would be leaving the EU.
Honestly I felt like I was 21 again (I'm 62). After all of the negative propaganda being put about, the scare stories of what would happen if we were to 'dare' to go it alone.
The government didn't expect those working class people who usually don't turn out to vote to actually vote this time. Maybe if Cameron had listened to them and got a better deal from Europe then we might've had a different result.
I did speak to people with different views, at work for example. I think a lot of people were voting on party lines or were believing the scare stories put out. I vote with what I think is right, whatever people around me might be voting."
