Dover rise to third while Wrexham are now six points off the top five after Ricky Modeste's second half winner proved decisive in a tense contest.
Modeste fired home off the post after Sam Magri's effort in a game low on quality chances.
James Gray hit the crossbar as Wrexham pushed for an equaliser, while Simon Heslop also came close.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "It's a disappointing day for us and we never really got going. I've said to the players that there's no point in us looking at that now, the final whistle's gone.
"We've got four games left . It's tougher but still doable and we've got to win on Tuesday at Guiseley.
"If we win on Tuesday then we got to Tranmere to beat them to go above them and that's as simple as it is. We battle on."
