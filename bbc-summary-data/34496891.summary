A woman in her 80s has had her wedding ring taken from her hand during an aggravated burglary at her home in County Londonderry, police have said.

Four men entered her house on Queen's Avenue in Magherafelt, at about 19:30 BST on Friday.
Two men ransacked her home while the other two remained with her in her bedroom. They left with her wedding ring and other items of jewellery.
Det Sgt David Halliwell said the burglary had been "loathsome".
"Any crime in which older people are the victims is despicable but taking a treasured wedding band from the hand of an elderly lady is a particularly loathsome act," he said.
"We believe the males involved in this incident were aged in their late teens and were wearing knitted hats with scarves around their faces."
Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them.
