[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple who won nearly £150,000 on the Euromillions doubled their prize after their dog found a second winning ticket for the same amount.

Shortly after Jane and Alan Slater's numbers came up in the draw on 29 September, their dog Ruby disturbed another forgotten ticket in their car.
It was tucked in a catalogue in the car and flew out when Ruby and a second family dog jumped in after a walk.
The two tickets, for the same draw, were each worth £149,089.30.
Mrs Slater, a hospital catering assistant, said: "We had a lovely walk... chatting about the amazing start to the week with our Euromillions win and how lucky we had been.
"As we got back in the car to head home, Ruby hopped on to the back seat with me and disturbed this piece of paper inside a catalogue which gently floated down to my feet.
"I really can't explain the way this piece of paper floated, it was like you see in slow motion in films, as though someone wanted me to notice it."
The ticket was discovered on the labrador retriever's second birthday.
Mr Slater said: "We both burst into tears when we saw the second ticket was also a winner. It all happened in such a magical way, what with Ruby disturbing the ticket on her birthday and it floating so gently right in front of Jane's eyes."
Mrs Slater said they bought tickets for several draws. Her husband had bought the second ticket not realising she had already done so.
She said the winning numbers - 11, 14, 26, 29, 49 and Lucky Star number three - are the same numbers they have used for 20 years of playing lotteries.
Mr Slater, 65, a customer relations manager for Wightlink Ferries, said the win will mean he can retire a few months earlier than planned.
Ruby and the couple's other dog, border collie Kai, will also be getting some extra treats, Mr and Mrs Slater said.
