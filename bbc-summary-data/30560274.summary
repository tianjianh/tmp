A coroner has concluded a woman's death was not connected to the treatment she received from a dentist who is under investigation for poor hygiene.

Amy Duffield died in August 2013 shortly after treatment at Daybrook practice, Nottinghamshire.
Desmond D'Mello has been suspended by the General Dental Council and thousands of his former patients are being tested for blood borne viruses.
Police investigated the 23-year-old's death but found no link.
Mr D'Mello is under investigation after a whistleblower covertly filmed him at his practice in the Nottingham suburb apparently not washing his hands or sterilising equipment between patients.
It prompted one of the largest patient recalls in NHS history and thousands of people are being tested for hepatitis and HIV. NHS England said the risk of infection was low.
The Nottinghamshire coroner's office asked for further investigations into Miss Duffield's death, which was previously determined to be natural, following the announcement in November.
Further tests were carried out before experts concluded there was no link.
"On the basis of this additional evidence and information available at the time of the death, the experts are all agreed that Amy's final illness and death were not linked to her dental care or the visit to her dentist," a statement said.
A temporary clinic set up specially to test Mr D'Mello's former patients will close on Tuesday.
More than 4,300 people have been tested since it opened last month.
