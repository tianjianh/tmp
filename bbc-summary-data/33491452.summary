Greek MPs back bailout reform plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Greece's parliament has backed a government package of economic reforms aimed at ending the country's debt crisis and securing a new bailout.

In a late-night debate, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras admitted many proposals fell short of his party's anti-austerity promises.
But he said there was a "national duty to keep our people alive and in the eurozone".
The proposals are to be studied by eurozone finance ministers later.
EU sources says Greece's creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - believe the plan is positive.
Eurozone officials are also expected to discuss Greek requests for some of the debt to be rescheduled.
While a majority of the 300-member parliament backed the plans in the early hours of Saturday, several government MPs voted against or abstained.
Mr Tsipras is asking for â‚¬53.5bn ($59.47bn) to cover Greece's debts until 2018.
In return, he has given in to demands for a pension overhaul, tax rises and privatisations - measures rejected in a referendum last Sunday.
Greek banks are days away from running out of money and unless a deal is struck the country faces exiting the euro.
The BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens says the Greek reform package is a major climbdown for the prime minister, whose radical left-wing Syriza party was elected on a strong anti-austerity platform.
