Eight weird world records that could be yours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watching the sport, thinking you could never break a world record? Well, you're wrong.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Whether it's blowing peas around, raiding your wardrobe for t-shirts or mashing potato with all your might, you too could be a record breaker.
Yes, it might be silly - but it's also fun!  So check out this list, and take your pick...
Back before smart phones held all the information in the world ever, telephone books were used to list the contact details of everyone not considered famous enough to be exempt. They were also used as platforms for mistletoe kisses in Christmas adverts, but now we're just ripping them to shreds. You'll need some muscle for this as each book must be a minimum of 1000 pages, but it'll be fun to give pure destruction a go in pursuit of glory.
Reckon you've got epic lung capacity? Well this could be the record for you! The record is currently held by Germany's Andre Ortolf and he managed to puff the pea a huge 7.51 metres. You'll need a smooth surface and a standard pea - frozen ones won't fly (or roll) here. Then just imagine it's a really competitive version of blowing out your birthday candles and go for it.
We all hate making the bed, but your mum might have done you a favour when she asked you to straighten up that duvet. Two nurses broke this record in 1993 which might indicate it's a little harder that it seems at first. You'll need one blanket, two sheets, an undersheet, an uncased pillow, one pillowcase, one counterpane and hospital corners - anyone who's worked in a hotel, this one's for you.
Potato's not traditionally associated with competitive eating, but German Andr√© Ortolf wolfed down 266 grams of it to collect his world record. We're unsure of the mechanics in terms of measuring exactly how much he got down, but we trust the folks at Guinness World Records to give us a fair bite at this one.
This one might be more about practice and trust than anything else. Usually if you catch or hit something with a blindfold on, it'll make a noise. Ever heard a lemon whistle through the air? Me neither. Find a thrower you rate highly - you'll need to catch one for every two seconds, but don't be bitter if you fail.
We've all been there and wound up a friend by wearing all their clothes at once. Just us? Well in our experience, you just need to be clever about starting with the smaller t-shirts and working your way up to the XXL - this record attempt will be hampered by not being able to get your 32nd t-shirt over the ones you've got on already.
