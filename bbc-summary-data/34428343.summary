[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Isa Nacewa crossed twice as Leinster battled to a bonus-point Pro12 win over Newport Gwent Dragons in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Once-capped Fijian  Nacewa's two first-half scores helped the hosts to a 20-10 half-time lead.
Scrum-half Sarel Pretorius went over for Dragons and Jason Tovey kicked the rest of their points.
Leinster scored last quarter tries by Gary Ringrose and Cathal Marsh while Nacewa and Fergus McFadden kicked 17 points between them.
The Irish province earned their second win in three starts in the process, leaving the visitors with one win from the first three rounds.
Dragons' offered stubborn resistance throughout, typified by wing Ashton Hewitt's 40-metre pursuit of Ringrose that ended with a try-saving tackle at the corner.
But Leinster proved too strong despite missing a glut of stars on Irish World Cup duty.
Lyn Jones' Dragons have been less affected by World Cup calls with only number eight Taulupe Faletau, centre Tyler Morgan and now-injured wing Hallam Amos absent.
Fly-half Cathal Marsh ably directed the home side's efforts behind a pack that exercised greater control as the game wore on.
McFadden and Tovey exchanged early penalties, the former sending over a second before Dragons scrum-half Pretorius went over for the first try.
Tovey converted but Dragons were soon trailing as Nacewa went over twice in nine minutes with McFadden converting the first and Nacewa the second.
McFadden and Tovey added penalties before Ringrose raced clear.
Marsh added his name to the try-scorers to secure the bonus point with McFadden converting both second-half tries.
