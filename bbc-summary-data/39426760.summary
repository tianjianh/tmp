[SN]TITLE[SN]
Liverpool v Bournemouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool forward Sadio Mane will miss Wednesday's game with a knee injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mane's absence may lead to a recall for Divock Origi, while Daniel Sturridge is in contention after returning to training.
Bournemouth midfielder Andrew Surman is out with a knee injury, so Jack Wilshere may be promoted to the starting line-up.
The Cherries have several other unnamed fitness doubts, while Tyrone Mings is still suspended.
Jonathan Pearce: "Sadio Mane's injury has come at a horrible time for Liverpool. He's been involved in 18 league goals this season - his most productive in England by far.
"Jurgen Klopp has admitted he has no direct "one-for-one" replacement.
"The likely return of Daniel Sturridge is timely but with Adam Lallana and Jordan Henderson also out, their squad looks thin for the run-in.
"It gives Bournemouth a chance. They still need two more wins. They're as likely to get a victory here as they were in the home meeting when Liverpool's attacking brilliance was betrayed by defensive buffoonery.
"That was an open thriller. This will be tighter."
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp on losing Sadio Mane to injury: "Everyone would miss Sadio. Southampton probably still miss him, Red Bull Salzburg miss him.
"It is not about thinking 'how can we play perfect football', we need to get results and the first thing I will think about is how we can defend [against] Bournemouth, not how can we create 27 chances.
"If we are strong and perfectly organised in defence then Bournemouth cannot get confidence in the game.
"We don't think what we miss, we only think what we can do to win this football game."
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "Liverpool will be a really tough test for us. We respect them and their manager. We've done okay at Anfield in recent games.
"The home game against Liverpool was arguably our standout game of the season so far, but it's of no relevance now. This is a new game.
"We want to gather as many points as we can. The challenges in our next three games [Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham] are tough, but ones we have to relish.
"We're in a good place at the moment. We're also aware of how quickly things can change in football."
Bournemouth might try to sit back a bit but the best thing about their team is the way they play when they come forward.
If they go on the attack then that will help Liverpool, and I also think Jurgen Klopp's side have regained a bit of their belief from earlier in the season anyway.
The Cherries will let them play and I think Liverpool will have too much for them.
