An opencast coal site in the Neath Valley is being mothballed for three years with the loss of 70 jobs.

Celtic Energy is closing the Selar site, near Glynneath, next March blaming a 40% fall in the world price of coal.
It said it could not keep the site running along with Nant Helen and the soon-to-be expanded East Pit.
Some of the jobs could go to these sites but most staff expected to take voluntary redundancy.
Will Watson, chief executive of Celtic Energy, said: "We very much regret the impact this will have on our workforce and their families but we are hopeful that the inevitable redundancies required can mostly be achieved on a voluntary basis and we are looking at all possibilities for mitigating the impact by re-allocating people to other sites wherever possible.
"Discussions will also be held with local authorities and the Welsh government to put in place as much support as possible for those affected and to manage the regulatory implications of a temporary cessation of coaling at one of our sites."
