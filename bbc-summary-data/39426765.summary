[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southampton forward Manolo Gabbiadini remains sidelined with a groin strain picked up at Tottenham last month.

Sofiane Boufal is a doubt after pulling a muscle in training but Uruguayan defender Martin Caceres is fit and could make his debut.
Palace are without Scott Dann, who suffered knee ligament damage during the win at Chelsea.
James Tomkins and Patrick van Aanholt are also out but Loic Remy has returned to training and may feature.
Tony Husband: "A Crystal Palace fan cut my hair last week and when I suggested Sam Allardyce would steer them to safety he warned me to take a look at their daunting fixture list.
"Palace still have to play Spurs, Arsenal, Liverpool and both Manchester clubs. So the barber's point, with no disrespect aimed at Southampton, was that three points is a must on the south coast.
"However, that was before the Eagles' stunning win at Chelsea. The low-scoring Saints will want to avoid going the same way as the champions-elect and need a performance in front of their home fans.
"If Palace win, my barber will be singing while he's trimming next time around."

Southampton manager Claude Puel: "It's important to have a good focus and concentration against a strong Palace team.
"It's also important that we score goals from different areas. It is not just the work of the strikers, but the work for all."
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "You'd hope we could target a point, given the form we're in.
"We have to be at 100%. Every player was at their top level on Saturday.
"I told the boys to enjoy the [Chelsea] victory at home. There's no real time to celebrate. There's still a way to go."
I think Palace's unbeaten run will continue when they go to St Mary's but they might have to settle for a point.
