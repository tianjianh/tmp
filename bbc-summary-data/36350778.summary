The 28-year-old Dutch rider finished second behind stage winner Esteban Chaves, 26, to open a 41-second lead over Astana's Vincenzo Nibali.
Colombian Chaves caught compatriot Darwin Atapuma to win on the line.
Movistar's Andrey Amador, the first Costa Rican to wear a Grand Tour leaders' jersey, led heading into the race from Alpago to Corvara.
