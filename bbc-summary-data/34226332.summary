Human rights lessons are to be offered to schools in England in a project designed by US human rights activist Kerry Kennedy.

It will tackle topics such as slavery, religious freedom, political violence and repression.
The aim is to help schools discuss issues such as refugees fleeing Syria.
The scheme is being launched by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who wants it to start debates about "democracy, respect and tolerance".
The project is run by RFK Human Rights, an organisation commemorating Ms Kennedy's father, US politician Robert Kennedy.
The international school project, called Speak Truth to Power, teaches students about human rights activists who have challenged oppression and who have faced imprisonment and torture.
It will be launched in London on Monday, by Ms Kennedy, Mrs Morgan and head teachers' leaders.
Schools in England now have responsibilities to challenge extremism - and the education secretary says she wants the project, which is free for schools, to encourage young people to be "active and engaged citizens".
Teachers will be able to access online material to present the lessons.
"We want all young people to leave school well-rounded, confident and resilient," said Mrs Morgan.
Ms Kennedy, who will visit a London school with the education secretary, says she wants to encourage debate about the rights of refugees arriving from the Middle East.
And in terms of challenging extremism among young people, she says her project aims to show that intolerant views are not acceptable.
She says that at present "hate is the biggest problem" threatening human rights around the world, whether in the form of political repression and violence in Syria, far-right groups in Europe or the oppression of women by groups such as Boko Haram in Nigeria.
At a school level, she says the language of prejudice can still be heard in playgrounds, such as homophobic name-calling or sexist language towards girls.
Her education project aims to teach young people to challenge intolerance. Ms Kennedy says prejudice can be "learnt behaviour, and people have to learn how to stand up to it".
