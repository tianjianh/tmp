Birmingham pub bombings: Families 'may miss inquest'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relatives of the Birmingham pub bombing victims say they may not take part in forthcoming inquests if they do not get public funding for their legal team.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Home Office has been looking at a legal aid funding request for the families ahead of inquests into the 21 deaths and a decision is expected to be made this month.
But campaigners said without legal aid they would not have representation.
A pre-inquest review is due to be held next month.
The relatives want their lawyers, who have so far worked free of charge, to be paid out of public funds, in the same manner as police and other agencies who will be in involved in the inquests.
Q&A: Birmingham bombings inquests
Campaigner Julie Hambleton, from Justice 4 the 21, said: "All families involved in this horrendous atrocity should be able to effectively participate but without funding, without our legal team, we won't be able to do that so we may have to either just not attend or ask for an adjournment."
Twenty-one people died and 222 were injured when the bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush and The Tavern in the Town in 1974.
Six men were convicted and then acquitted of the atrocity and no-one has since been convicted of involvement in the bombing, which is widely attributed to the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
In June, Birmingham's senior coroner ruled there was evidence that still needed to be heard and gave the go-ahead for fresh inquests.
