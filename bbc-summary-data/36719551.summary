Super League: Hull KR 20-19 Huddersfield Giants

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull KR came from 19-6 down to win 20-19 and end Huddersfield Giants' hopes of a top-eight finish in Super League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Brierley, Jake Connor and Jamie Ellis' converted first-half tries gave Giants a commanding half-time lead.
But Albert Kelly and George Lawler crossed to bring Rovers back into the game and Ben Cockayne's late penalty gave the hosts a narrow victory.
Hull KR are three points off eighth spot and need two wins to stand any chance of reaching the Super 8s.
Huddersfield lie 11th, having lost two and won two of their four games since sacking coach Paul Anderson, and are now guaranteed to play in The Qualifiers.
After Brierley's opening score, Matthew Marsh's try had drawn the hosts level before Giants seemingly took control.
When Danny Brough - back in the Giants side after a one-match suspension - added a drop-goal after half-time, an away win seemed increasingly likely.
However, an inspired Kelly helped drag the hosts back into the game and, from a penalty 30 metres out with eight minutes to play, Cockayne kicked the Robins ahead for the first time.

Hull KR assistant coach Willie Poching: "The back end was better from us. After the drop goal we seemed to flick a switch and really got going. We upped the tempo and Albert Kelly started to control things.
"It was not the start we had planned. They played quick on us and we regrouped at half-time because we were going away from the game plan.
"A few of the players spoke and got things sorted. It was more or less a tweak in attitude.
"Both teams looked a bit flat but we are so proud of the players. We still have hope with four points to play for."
Huddersfield coach Andy Kelly: "We feel it was like an implosion. We stopped doing what we did in first half and what we've been good at in last game and a half.
"We were undone by errors and penalties after getting in a position to win the game.
"We lost our way, although the players continued to work hard and they are all beat up and disappointed not to have a fighting chance of making the top eight.
"We need to finish as high as we can so we can get four home games in the Middle 8s."
