The mother of a man who went missing more than a fortnight ago has told how she first heard about his disappearance on Facebook.

Chris May, 28, was last seen at his home in Kelvedon, Essex, on 25 May.
His Volkswagen Golf was found abandoned in the village of Fairstead, according to Essex Police.
Mother Lorraine said it was out-of-character for her son not to remain in contact with family and friends "all the time".
They first feared something was wrong was when a friend posted on Facebook asking whether anybody had seen him, Mrs May said.
The post was made about seven hours after he was last seen.
Mrs May said: "I thought that was strange. That was what started us thinking, where is he?"
By the following day the family had become increasingly concerned and called the police.
Mrs May said: "It is really hard. I am trying to hold it together for the rest of the family because everyone comes to Mum and Mum can normally put it right but this is something I can't fix.
"He's never done anything like this before. He is normally in contact with family and friends all the time."
His sister, Charlene, said Mr May seemed to be in good spirits and was looking forward to starting a new job.
"All we want is to know he is safe," she said.
If there had been an argument or if he needed to go away for a few months he would have told them, she added.
Police said Mr May's car was found in Fairstead, near a popular area for geocaching, a treasure hunt where participants use GPS devices to search for hidden boxes.
The force wants to speak to geocachers who were in the area on 25 May.
