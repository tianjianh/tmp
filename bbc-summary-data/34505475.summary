The 61-year-old joined the Wildcats on a deal until the end of the season in May, with the club having lost 12 of their 13 Super League fixtures.
Smith guided them to fourth in The Qualifiers and helped them retain their Super League status with victory over Bradford in the Million Pound Game.
"I am ecstatic that Brian is staying for another year," Wildcats chairman Michael Carter told the club website.
"He is building a club here both on and off the field. He has committed to us and I have made a commitment to him.
"We have a real chance to build something special here and we need everyone on board to do that."
