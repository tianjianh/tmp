[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 0-1 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carlisle clinched a first win in four games as Charlie Wyke's late header gave them a narrow League Two victory at Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Striker Wyke nodded home Alex McQueen's cross to score his 14th goal of the season and give United the win with 12 minutes to go.
Wyke had earlier glanced a header wide for the away side.
Crawley, for whom Gavin Tomlin had a shot cleared off the line, have now lost six successive games.
