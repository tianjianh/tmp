The Alan Alda Center is an international partner of the Leverhulme Centre, which was officially launched by the Queen on Wednesday.
The actor has worked to broaden public understanding of science.
Mr Alda is best-known for his role as Hawkeye Pierce in the classic US television series and appeared last year in Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies.
He helped found the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University where he is a visiting professor.
In the message, Mr Alda said, "We are very excited to be working with the Leverhulme Research Centre at the University of Dundee.
"The work you are planning in forensic science is so tremendously important to justice.
"We are going to have a great time working together."
Leverhulme Centre co-director, Prof Niamh Nic Daeid, said: "If we are to be successful in our ambitions to raise the whole field of forensic science to a new level then it is essential we are able to communicate effectively with a wide range of partners and also, vitally, with the public.
"Working with the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science will help us greatly in that respect and we are all delighted to have received such a warm message of support from Alan."
