Valencia became the first side to score five goals in the first half of a Europa League match as they thrashed Rapid Vienna 6-0 on manager Gary Neville's 41st birthday.

Five days after Valencia won a league match under him for the first time, Neville saw his players race into a five-goal lead inside 35 minutes.
Santi Mina scored twice and set up three more in a sparkling performance.
The visitors improved after the break but Rodrigo wrapped up the win.
The result matched Steaua Bucharest's competition record.
With a Champions League place at stake for the winners of the Europa League, Neville could end the season on a high despite his side being 12th in La Liga.
"Obviously the result makes it my best night in Valencia," Neville said. "But I've never celebrated victories halfway through the season.
"I hope to start a positive run but it is dangerous to start thinking about turning points."
Earlier on Thursday, holders Sevilla beat Molde 3-0 to take control of their last-32 tie.
Former Juventus striker Fernando Llorente struck twice and Kevin Gameiro added a third as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men were well beaten.
Villarreal will also defend a lead next week after beating Napoli 1-0 thanks to a superb free-kick from Denis Suarez, while Borussia Dortmund took a large step towards qualification with a 2-0 home win over Porto.
Dortmund - who won the now defunct European Cup Winners' Cup in 1966 and the Champions League in 1997 - need the Europa League to complete the set of European trophies and were welcomed by an enormous banner at the Westfalenstadion.
Right-back Lukasz Piszczek put them ahead when Iker Casillas failed to keep out his original effort before forward Marco Reus buried a low shot to finish a clinical counter-attack.
