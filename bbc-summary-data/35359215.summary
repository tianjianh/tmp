So far there are no confirmed reports of casualties, although the interior ministry said they were feared.
The explosion sent black smoke billowing into the sky, with emergency services rushing to the scene.
No group has claimed responsibility for the blast, but the Taliban will be the main suspects as they have launched attacks on the city in the past.
