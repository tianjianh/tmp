[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chairman of a mental health trust has said it is "unacceptable" that children have had to be admitted to adult wards because of a beds shortage.

A Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust board report revealed that in March three people under 18 years were admitted to adult acute wards.
Trust chairman Gary Page said he was concerned about the lack of child beds, the responsibility of NHS England.
NHS England said it had been paying for extra beds for young people.
The report by the trust's director of nursing Dr Jane Sayer said that under-18 admissions appeared to be an "increasing trend".
Mr Page told a board meeting: "Having an under 18-year-old in adult wards is unacceptable."
Trust chief executive Michael Scott told the BBC: "The first concern is for the young people and families.
"Clearly it is unsatisfactory that these young people have to go on adult wards because of a national shortage of children's beds, which is run by NHS England, which is responsible for ensuring there are sufficient beds."
A spokesman for the Campaign to Save Mental Health in Norfolk and Suffolk said: "It is completely inappropriate - indeed, unsafe - for children and young people to find themselves on adult psychiatric wards.
"NHS England has failed to react with sufficient urgency and resources to address a crisis which has been growing for years, not months."
An NHS England spokesman said: "Since August last year we've opened an extra 46 beds for children with the most severe mental health needs.
"Many need this care so while beds are available we have asked services to ensure they have plans in place for any young person with mental health problems to receive the right care, in the right place at the right time to suit their individual needs."
