[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Stoke Mandeville doctor guilty of indecent assaults

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former doctor has been found guilty for the second time in two years of indecent assaults at a hospital where Jimmy Savile abused patients.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Salmon, 81, from Salisbury, was convicted by a jury at Reading Crown Court of 14 indecent assaults at Stoke Mandeville and Royal Buckinghamshire hospitals in the 1970s and 1980s.
Salmon, who was sentenced to 18 years in 2015 for similar offences, was cleared of 11 assaults and one rape
He had denied all the charges.
The court was told the former consultant paediatrician used his position to take advantage of young patients between 1975 and 1989.
Complaints were made by 18 women and one man who are now grown up.
Other girls said they were separated from their parents before he asked them to take their clothes off and touched them inappropriately.
The court heard some of the girls did not realise they had been abused.
The jury was also told Mr Salmon, who will be sentenced next Monday, admitted three charges of indecent assault in 1991.
Savile was believed to have assaulted more than 60 people at Stoke Mandeville Hospital between 1968 and 1992.
His youngest victim was aged eight.
It is not believed any of Salmon's and Savile's offending was linked.
