[SN]TITLE[SN]
GMB to hold strike ballot at John Radcliffe Hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second union is holding a ballot on a possible strike by porters at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The GMB union, representing staff employed by Carillion at the hospital, is to hold a consultative ballot on Wednesday for porters.
Unison members voted to strike in July but the action was postponed and negotiations are continuing.
The dispute is over changes put forward which GMB said could lead to porters losing up to Â£56 a week.
The union wrote to Carillion to try and resolve the issues, but says it has received no response.
In total 56 porters would be affected by the changes.
Carillion has been contacted for a comment.
