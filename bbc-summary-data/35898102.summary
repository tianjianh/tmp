An Indian flight attendant who was injured in Tuesday's suicide bomb attack at Brussels airport is recovering in hospital, her employer Jet Airways says.

Nidhi Chaphekar, 40, suffered burns and fractured her foot in the explosion.
A photograph of Ms Chaphekar taken moments after the blast has become an iconic image of the attacks.
The attacks at Zaventem airport and Maelbeek metro left 31 people dead and about 300 wounded.
The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has said it carried out the attacks.
Ms Chaphekar was one of the two Indian crew members of a Jet Airways flight bound for Newark in the US who were injured in the blast.
Her husband, who flew from Mumbai to Paris and travelled by road to Brussels, has reached the hospital, reports say.
Jet Airways denied unconfirmed reports in Indian media on Friday, which said Ms Chaphekar had been "placed in coma" at the hospital near Brussels.
"The doctor has confirmed that Nidhi is in stable condition and not in a coma,'' the company said in a statement.
"She is resting and under sedation for her comfort."
Ms Chaphekar's photograph - taken by Ketevan Kardava, a journalist with the Georgian Public Broadcaster network - was widely shared around the world on social media sites with the #PrayForNidhi hashtag.
The picture shows her sitting bloodied and dazed with a leg stretched across a seat.
Her yellow blazer is shredded by the force of the blast, her hair is covered with soot and her face streaked with blood.
"She was in shock, speechless," Ms Kardava, who was her way to Geneva on assignment, told Time magazine.
"There was no crying, no shouting. She was only looking around with fear."
