A man has been killed on the construction site of the new bridge over the River Don.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called to the scene in the Danestone area of the city at about 16:45.
Police Scotland initially said they responded to reports that a site worker had been injured.
A spokesman later said: "Sadly, as a result of his injuries, the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Inquiries are at an early stage."
The so-called third Don crossing will link the Bridge of Don and Tillydrone.
It was given the go-ahead last year after the council's ruling Labour party - which had long been against the bridge - dropped its opposition.
The total cost is expected to be about Â£18m.
