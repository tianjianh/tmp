Drake has been named Spotify's most-streamed artist of 2016, with his single One Dance the site's biggest song of the year.

The Canadian star racked up 4.7 billion streams this year, more than half of which were for his album Views.
That's despite the album being withheld from Spotify for two weeks as part of a deal with Apple Music.
One Dance alone was streamed 960 million times. Played consecutively, that would take more than 5,200 years.
The song's popularity on streaming services - including Deezer and Google Play as well as Spotify and Apple - helped it spend 15 weeks on top of the official UK singles chart, the longest run since Bryan Adams Everything I Do (I Do It For You) in 1991.
It is now Spotify's most-streamed song of all time, earning Drake and his co-writers an estimated $4.8m (Â£3.9m) in royalties.
Rihanna - who counts Drake as a collaborator and boyfriend - was Spotify's most-streamed female artist of 2016, while former One Direction star Zayn Malik was the biggest new act of the year.
David Bowie became the most listened-to "alternative" artist, following his death in January. The Beatles, who only released their albums to streaming services last December, quickly became the biggest classic rock act.
