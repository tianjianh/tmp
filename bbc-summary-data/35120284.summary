Statistics show 7,200 vehicles failed to turn up for tests booked between July and September.
The number of missed tests is up by 1,000 or 16% on the same quarter last year.
Armagh had the poorest attendance record with one in 33 appointments missed.
The best was in Craigavon and Newtownards where the figure for missed tests was one in 45.
The full test currently costs £30.50 for a car, a retest costs £18.50.
The statistics are contained in the DoE's Driver, Vehicle, Operator and Enforcement statistics for July to September 2015.
They show that 263,000 vehicle tests were carried out in that period.
The overall pass rate for full tests was 80.3% - slightly down - though the general trend for passes in recent years is up.
Other statistics in the report show just over half of learner drivers pass the driving test, and just under half pass the theory test.
