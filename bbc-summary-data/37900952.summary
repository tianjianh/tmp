A mother and her three children were killed when their home collapsed in the northern city of Cap-Haitian.
Officials said 300mm (almost one foot) of rain had fallen in just 48 hours.
The flooding comes just over a month after Hurricane Matthew devastated large parts of the country and killed more than 500 people.
Many neighbourhoods of Cap-Haitien are flooded.
A man died while trying to cross a river in the city of Perches and a woman was buried under a collapsing wall in Port de Paix.
Three people also died in the beach resort Cormier.
