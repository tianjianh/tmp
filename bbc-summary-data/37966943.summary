[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to write to Donald Trump to congratulate him on becoming US president.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Sturgeon will emphasise the long-standing ties between Scotland and the US in a letter to the president-elect.
The move comes just days after the SNP leader said she would "not maintain a diplomatic silence" in the face of "abhorrent comments" from Mr Trump.
Ms Sturgeon had backed Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House.
The first minister said she would also pen a letter to the defeated Democrat, praising her candidacy.
A spokesman for Ms Sturgeon said: "The first minister will be writing to Mr Trump on his election success and also to Hillary Clinton to acknowledge her contribution to politics and to greatly advancing the cause of gender equality.
"Scotland has deep and longstanding ties of family, friendship and business with the United States, and those links will endure in the months and years ahead."
The first minister, who last year stripped Mr Trump of his role as a business ambassador for Scotland, has faced questions over how her criticism of the president-elect could impact on Scotland following his election victory.
Echoing comments made by German chancellor Angela Merkel, she has said she will engage "positively and constructively" with Mr Trump but will not shy away from "standing up" for the principles of tolerance and diversity.
