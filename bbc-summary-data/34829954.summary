Rikki Neave's sister will appear in an appeal to catch his killer on the BBC's Crimewatch later.
Her brother's naked body was found in woods near Peterborough's Welland Estate on 29 November 1994.
Cambridgeshire Police said it "strongly believed" the key to finding his killer lay with the public.
A reconstruction of Rikki's last known movements will be shown on the BBC One programme, along with interviews with his mother and sister, who has asked to remain anonymous.
"To think that someone has took my brother away - part of my family - and is still walking around living a lie is unbelievable," his sister said.
Rikki was last seen leaving his home in Redmile Walk, Welland, for school at about 08:30 GMT on 28 November, 1994.
He is believed to have been wearing grey trousers, a white shirt, black shoes and a blue coat.
The following day his body was found in a wooded area off Eye Road, close to Willoughby Court, about five minutes' walk from his house. A post-mortem examination found he had been strangled.
A day later officers searching Willoughby Court found his clothing in a wheelie bin.
His mother, Ruth Neave, was cleared of murder but admitted child neglect and cruelty and was jailed for seven years.
In the appeal, due to be screened on Monday, she said: "I wasn't the mother of the year but then again I never killed my son... so who did?"
Det Ch Insp Richard Wall, from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said "significant progress" had been made in understanding Rikki's last movements since the investigation was re-launched in June.
"We hope that this national appeal through Crimewatch will reach someone who hasn't yet come forward but who has information about Rikki's murder," he said.
"We are also revisiting original forensic work and are excited with the progress due to the advances in forensics over the past 21 years."
Crimewatch will be broadcast on BBC One at 21:00 on Monday.
