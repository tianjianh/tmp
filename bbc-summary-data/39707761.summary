[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales' political parties have been setting out their stalls in the run-up to the local elections on 4 May.

To varying degrees, politicians are tailoring their policies according to circumstances in each of the 22 council areas.
But what, in a nutshell, are their general pitches to voters?
The Conservatives say they want to ensure "fairer" council tax bills and value for money for the public while safeguarding services for people in need.
Protecting local high streets and supporting small businesses are also amongst the Tories' top priorities, together with a pledge to "honour armed forces heroes".
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has promised that the party will listen, deliver, and "make sure that we're held to account when we get into county halls across the length and breadth of Wales".
The Green Party is promising to "rebuild" communities, saying renewable energy schemes and "truly efficient" housing could create thousands of jobs and cut fuel bills.
Grenville Ham, leader of the Wales Greens, says the sale of locally-generated renewable energy could "cut out the exploitative middle man in energy production and delivery".
The party says it is focusing on "returning as many hardworking Labour councillors and councils as possible" and "sustaining our Welsh Labour councils' record of delivery".
First Minister Carwyn Jones has said councils run by the party have "built new council homes... helped to deliver the best GCSE and A Level results ever, supported small business and led ambitious regeneration programmes".
Labour says that, with support from Mr Jones and his Welsh Government, the party can continue to "deliver a fair deal for the people of Wales".
Enabling small businesses to "lead their own priorities" and measures to encourage more people into town centres are central to Lib Dem plans to regenerate local economies.
Investing in schools, social care, building more affordable homes and tackling homelessness are also top pledges by the party.
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Mark Williams described his party as an alternative to "complacency, arrogance and laziness rife in our local councils".
"Spreading prosperity throughout the country", cutting senior council staff pay and "boosting ordinary workers' wages" are high on Plaid Cymru's to-do list.
The party also promises to create local jobs and apprenticeships, regenerate town centres, seek high quality education for every child and supply more affordable housing.
Plaid leader Leanne Wood has said she expects to make "significant advances" on 4 May.
UKIP says council tax should be as low as possible "whilst protecting essential services" and argues "immigration must be controlled to relieve pressure of health, education, housing, police and welfare services".
The party also says it opposes "excessive housing development and wind farms" and wants to cut "highly paid executives, not front-line staff and services".
UKIP AM David Rowlands says it wants to "break down this cadre of Labour-controlled councils".
