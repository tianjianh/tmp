Jessie James, 15, was shot several times in the early hours of 9 September 2006, in a park in the Moss Side area.
Police have increased their reward to £60,000 for details leading to the killer's conviction.
Jessie's mother Barbara Reid said: "All I am asking for is justice. We are suffering."
She added: "We are dying for some news, for some good news. We are dying for you to do the right thing, we are dying for you to speak out for us.
"We are dying for you to stand up - stand up and speak out, and let justice reign."
Det Ch Insp Debbie Dooley, from Greater Manchester Police, said the £60,000 reward was one of the biggest offered in the force's history.
"We hope this reward along with the promise of complete confidence, anonymity and support will encourage anyone with any information to come forward," she said.
"Jessie's mum has had to go through pain no parent should have to go through."
Former local MP Tony Lloyd, who is now Greater Manchester police and crime commissioner, added: "Jessie's true legacy is that the shadow of his violent departure from this world spurred local people, police, council and other agencies to come together to tackle gun and gang crime and make our streets safer for future generations.
"But, despite the real hope that came out of this darkness, it is 10 years on and his family has still not seen justice."
