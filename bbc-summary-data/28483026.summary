Referendum round-up: Eight weeks to go

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's eight weeks to go until the referendum and, with the debate ramping up, it can be be easy to lose track - but we're here to help.

Each Friday, we'll give you a round-up of the big referendum stories, the small referendum stories, and the weird ones from the far-flung corners of the internet.
We'll also take a look at what you've been saying on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and other social media sites.
So, here's what's been going on this week.
It's been a fairly quiet week as the #indyref goes.
With the Commonwealth Games in full swing, Alex Salmond has taken a "self-denying ordinance" on talking about independence, as both sides have agreed not to use Glasgow 2014 for political gain.
Although the First Minister did call Glasgow "freedom city" on the day of the opening ceremony, which has caused quite a stir.
Let the games begin...
We had Scottie dogs leading out the teams, Rod Stewart in a silver suit and giant Tunnock's teacakes. The opening ceremony of Glasgow 2014 was largely seen as a success.
However, there was a bit of confusion over the Red Arrows' involvement in the show.
The BBC's James Cook tweeted a picture of the opening ceremony media guide which showed the plan was to trail blue and white smoke.
So, where did the red come from? Well, apparently  the change of colour was confirmed on the day, with the RAF saying no formal request was ever made to have just blue and white smoke.
Two convicted murderers have had their appeals for a referendum vote rejected by the UK Supreme Court.
Leslie Moohan, 31, and Andrew Gillon, 46, argued the voting ban infringed on their human rights.
The pair - both serving life sentences - were attempting to overturn a ruling from Edinburgh's Court of Session earlier this month.
The Scottish government welcomed the verdict.
The Prime Minister visited Glasgow to take in the Commonwealth Games -  but not before a surprise visit to Shetland.
David Cameron's the first PM to visit the islands since Margaret Thatcher 34 years ago.
The Guardian claims he is considering basing himself in Scotland for the final two weeks before September's vote, which Liberal Democrat cabinet colleagues believe could damage the no campaign.
But look, he tweeted a picture of himself petting a Shetland pony. Isn't that cute?
We've had a look at what a Yes vote would actually mean for the rest of the UK.
From analysing population density to looking at life expectancy, there are a few interesting facts and figures to be seen.
We've even got a pie chart.
So have a look at how the UK would fare without Scotland in more detail here.
