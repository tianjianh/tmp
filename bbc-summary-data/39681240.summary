Newport County caretaker Mike Flynn is determined to "finish the job" and keep the club in the Football League.

Exiles' 1-0 win over Accrington Stanley lifted them out of the relegation zone for the first time since November 2016.
They were 11 points adrift of safety when Flynn took over in March and have won six of their 10 matches since.
"I want to finish the job. Getting this close now and not doing it would be heartbreaking for me and the club," Flynn told BBC Radio Wales.
Ryan Bird's goal lifted Newport two points clear of Hartlepool who lost 2-0 at home to Barnet and they could secure Football League football for another season if they win at Carlisle on 29 February.
A week later the Exiles face Notts County at home in their final game of the season.
Hartlepool have matches at Cheltenham and at home to Doncaster to come.
"It's a great three points and I'm over the moon," said Flynn.
"If fingers are crossed and lady luck smiles on us we could be safe, but all we can do is take care of what we can look after and we'll see what happens at five o'clock next week."
He also played down the fact that his record since taking over could lead to a permanent position as manager.
"It's a good record, but there's nothing achieved yet," he said.
"It's not about Michael Flynn it's about keeping Newport County in the Football League and we'll worry about people's views after that.
"It has been a great turnaround and the boys have been fantastic. Again today, their work rate, their application and togetherness was everything that we've asked for.
"I would have wanted a few more goals because I'm going greyer by the minute but I'll take another couple of 1-0 wins before the end of the season, definitely."
