Korean Wang, 21, finished five-under-par alongside Spain's Nacho Elvira to force an extra hole, which was level, before winning on the next.
Robert Rock of England finished in third place, one shot adrift of the leaders on four-under-par.
England's Florentyna Parker let a two-shot lead slip to finish second to Nuria Iturrios in the Lalla Meryem Cup.
Parker, 26, shot a one-over 73 in the final round to finish six shots behind Iturrios at Royal Golf Dar Es Salam.
Spanish rookie Iturrios, 20, closed impressively with a seven-under 65 to triumph in only her third tournament on the Ladies' European Tour.
Liz Young, tied second overnight, was ninth along with six players, including fellow Englishwoman Trish Johnson.
It was the first time the European Tour and the Ladies' European Tour staged simultaneous tournaments at the same venue.
