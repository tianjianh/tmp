Luciano Spalletti: Former Roma coach expected to be named Inter Milan manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inter Milan are expected to name Luciano Spalletti as their new coach next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inter have been without a permanent manager since the dismissal of Stefano Piolo on 9 May.
Inter and Spalletti verbally confirmed a two-year deal today in Florence and the contract will be signed at the beginning of next week.
Spalletti, 58, finished second with Roma this season in Serie A but left on 30 May after 16 months in charge.
Inter's ambitious Chinese owners, the Suning Group, are keen to restore the club's fortunes after a seventh-place finish in Serie A this season.
If Spalletti is appointed, one of his first tasks will be to resolve the future of Croatia winger Ivan Perisic.
Manchester United have spoken to Inter about the Â£45m-rated player but no deal has been agreed.
Perisic scored 11 goals in 36 league appearances for Inter during a troubled campaign, which included the departure of Roberto Mancini during pre-season. Mancini's successor, Frank de Boer lasted only 85 days before he was dismissed.
