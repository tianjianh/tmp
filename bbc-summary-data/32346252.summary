The Airbus 320 was travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf when it crashed with 144 passengers and six crew members on board.
Recordings retrieved from one of the plane's flight recorders appeared to show Andreas Lubitz locking the captain out of the cockpit, while he put the plane in to descent.
It later emerged he had a history of depression and was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists. He had been signed off from work a number of times, including on the day of the crash.
Some 72 Germans were on board the aircraft when it went down, along with 50 Spaniards and other passengers from around the world.
Investigators are still trying to formally identify all of the victims, whose remains were recovered from the crash site near the village of Le Vernet.
