Sheringham's assistant Kevin Watson was also registered ahead of Wednesday's game against Welwyn Garden City.
But the club later posted on Twitter that "contrary to speculation", neither would feature in the match.
"With a number of squad injuries and the FA Youth Cup game just 48 hours before this fixture, both were registered in case they were required," the statement added.
Earlier in the day, Boro had confirmed that registering Sheringham and Watson was "not an uncommon occurrence at the club" as members of previous management teams had played in the county cup competition.
Boro's former goalkeeping coach Dave Beasant was named on the bench for their League Two play-off first leg against Southend United last season at the age of 56.
Sheringham, who scored 11 goals in 51 international appearances for England, originally quit playing at the age of 42 at the end of the 2007-08 campaign.
He was appointed Stevenage boss in May following a spell as attacking coach at West Ham. The club are currently five points above the League Two relegation zone.
