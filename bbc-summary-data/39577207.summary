[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Landsales Direct said the garden in Saline will feature small plots of land in which buyers will deposit mementoes of loved ones but there will be no visible markers.
Instead people will locate the plots using digital technology on smart phones.
It will stream pictures, videos and poetry related to their loved ones.
John MacCallum of JM Planning Services, who is the planning agent representing Landsales Direct, said: "The means of people locating the time capsule for their loved one will be through digital technology so they will be able to access it using a QR code."
