Cloudy weather spells disappointment for Perseid stargazers

Stargazers across Wales face disappointment as cloud cover threatens to obscure the Perseid meteor shower which reaches its peak on Wednesday.

For the first time since 2007, the annual meteor shower will coincide with a new moon, so astronomers were expecting optimum viewing conditions.
But the Met Office has issued a yellow "be aware" warning for heavy rain from 06:00 BST on Thursday.
Cloud cover before the rain was likely to obscure the spectacle, it confirmed.
A spokesman said stargazers in north Wales had the best chance of seeing the meteor shower.
BBC Wales weather presenter Owain Wyn Evans said: "It's likely to cloud over from the south tonight ahead of a weather system which will introduce heavy showers.
"I think northern parts are most likely to remain clear ahead of those showers, dry conditions across mid and north Wales."
The peak of the meteor shower is expected after 23:00 BST. Astronomers were hoping to see up to 100 meteors an hour.
The poor weather conditions are not be putting off Abergavenny astronomer Jonathan Powell.
He said: "Forewarned is forearmed. It's not a complete write-off.
"I will be heading out early to try and beat the weather. I think before 1am we can still expect to see 40 to 50 meteors an hour.
"I would encourage others to do the same, have a go, you will be rewarded."
