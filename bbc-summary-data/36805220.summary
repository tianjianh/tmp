The mother of two young children died on 16 June after she was attacked outside the library in the village of Birstall.
Her killing provoked a wave of shock worldwide and a memorial fund set up by Jo's husband and friends has raised nearly Â£1.5m for organisations she supported.
Ahead of the funeral, Jo's family said: "Knowing that so many people share both our grief and our determination to take forward Jo's legacy is a source of great strength at what otherwise feels like a very bleak time."
