It was a dominant display from City and Daniels followed up to net the opener after Boyle's shot hit the woodwork.
Boyle's crisp finish made it 2-0 after 20 minutes while Bray only threatened for a brief spell in the second half.
Aaron McEneff nearly added a third by smashing a late shot off a post in a win which leave Derry in third spot.
City briefly dropped to fourth when Shamrock Rovers drew earlier on Sunday but the victory moves Kenny Shiels' side two points clear of the Dubliners.
It was all so easy for the Candstripes in the first half and Daniels supplied a cool finish on seven minutes to grab his second goal in two games.
The impressive Boyle, who started in place of the injured Rory Patterson, fired just inside the post to double Derry's advantage.
Boyle, Lukas Schubert and Keith Ward were all off-target with efforts as the hosts pushed for a third.
Bray, who are lying a lowly 11th in the standings, finally came to life after the restart.
Gerard Doherty made an excellent instinctive save to deny substitute Andrew Lewis before Robbie Creevy sent his diving header narrowly wide.
Derry were soon back in control and saw out the remainder of the game with ease to complete a double over Bray after a 3-0 success at the Carlisle Grounds in March.
It was also a first home league win in three games for City, who travel to face Galway United on Friday night.
