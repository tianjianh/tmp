Surrey all-rounder Zafar Ansari hopes he can gain England recognition once he recovers from surgery on his thumb.

The 23-year-old missed the series against Pakistan in the UAE after dislocating his thumb on the day he received his first Test call-up.
"I knew immediately the England stuff was a write-off," he said.
"The thumb is obviously going to be a slow process but it is nice to have got it moving. Hopefully England opportunities will come again."
Surrey have not put a precise time frame on Ansari's recovery from his operation, and he currently has a splint on his thumb for support.
The left-arm spinner was included in England's Performance Programme (EPP) and Lions squad for the winter despite his injury, but his participation remains in the balance.
Ansari had a fine 2015 season for Surrey, scoring 771 first-class runs and taking 44 wickets as they won the Division Two title.
He is keen not to rush his comeback, telling BBC Radio London: "After I did it I overreacted and said something like 'that is the worst injury I have ever seen'.
"At the time it was frustrating but I was thinking more about the health of the thumb and the long-term.
"My priority was to make sure I did what was best for my thumb, and let the cricket take care of itself."
Meanwhile, Surrey wicketkeeper-batsman Gary Wilson has signed a new contract that will keep him at the club until the end of 2017.
