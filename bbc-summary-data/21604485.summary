He will make his 18th appearance against Leinster on Friday, has been rewarded with a new Dragons deal.
"I was given an opportunity to prove myself as a professional and hopefully I have done that," said Cudd.

"We haven't had the best of results this season but I think it is going well for me on a personal front," said Cudd.
