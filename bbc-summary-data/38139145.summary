[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cllr Bob Wellington has led Torfaen council for 13 years.
He will also end his role as leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, a position he has held since 2012.
Mr Wellington, whose political career started in 1978 with Cwmbran community council, was given a CBE in 2014 for services to his community and local government.
"The time is right to step aside," said the Labour councillor for Greenmeadow.
First Minister Carwyn Jones paid tribute and added: "He will be remembered for his years of selfless dedication to the people of Torfaen."
