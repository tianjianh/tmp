Isle of Wight NHS Trust: Maggie Oldham named as chief executive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new chief executive has been appointed to the Isle of Wight's under-fire NHS trust.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The trust was rated "inadequate" and placed in special measures by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) earlier this month.
Maggie Oldham replaces Karen Baker, who resigned ahead of the CQC report.
Ms Oldham was brought in to help improve Staffordshire Hospital in 2010 after care failures there came to light.
The CQC report on the island trust found "unsafe" mental health services, widespread understaffing, a "subtle culture of bullying" and poor leadership.
The trust later apologised for "letting down patients and the community".
A statement from the trust said Ms Oldham was "particularly experienced at supporting NHS Trusts that face significant challenges".
She also worked with South East Coast Ambulance Service on its recovery plan after it was placed in special measures.
Ms Oldham said she would be working with the board and the NHS Improvement director on a "robust and achievable plan for major and rapid improvement."
"It is clear from the recent CQC report that much needs to be done to improve the quality of care, improve performance against key targets, recruit staff to vacant posts and address outdated and bureaucratic practices."
