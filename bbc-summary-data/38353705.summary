[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old woman was walking along Ferry Road Avenue at about 16:30 on Friday when she was approached and attacked by two men.
Police described the assault, during which a four-figure sum was taken, as "cowardly"
The woman was treated for minor facial injuries by an ambulance at the scene. Her children were unharmed.
Police said the attack, which caused the woman to fall to the ground, happened as the woman stopped to tend to her children.
Her handbag, which had been resting on the handle of her buggy, was taken and the pair ran off.
Police described the woman's bag as a black Primark Atmosphere faux leather bag with a sloping top with suede on both sides and a gold bar.
It contained a number of items, including a four-figure sum of cash and baby feeding equipment.
The first suspect was described as being a white male, in his late teens to early 20s, about 5ft tall, of athletic build.
He was wearing a dark hooded top with dark jogging bottoms and two-tone Nike Air Max trainers. He was also wearing a dark face covering.
The second suspect was also a white male in his late teens to early 20s, about 5ft 4in to 5ft 8in tall, of slim build.
He was also wearing a dark hooded top.
Det Con Gavin Howat urged anyone with information to come forward.
He said: "This was a cowardly attack on a woman with her two young children.
"Thankfully she only sustained a minor injury and her children were unharmed, nevertheless she has been left extremely distressed by this incident.
"We believe that two young men in their late teen to early 20s are responsible for this attack and we are eager to trace them."
