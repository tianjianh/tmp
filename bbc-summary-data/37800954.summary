Dean Edwards, 39, also smashed the 19-year-old's head against a mirror and covered her mouth to muffle screams.
Edwards, from Rumney, was convicted of rape and assault causing actual bodily harm following a trial.
Jailing him at Cardiff Crown Court, Judge Michael Fitton QC said he must serve at least eight years in prison.
"She was effectively half your age. She was made to feel real fear by you," Judge Fitton said.
"You do represent a threat of danger and violence to women."
Prosecutor Byron Broadstock told the court Edwards had several previous convictions for assaults, battery and robbery on women.
Judge Fitton said he would impose an extended sentence on Edwards due to his "particular pattern" of offending.
He will spend eight years in jail before he can apply for parole, and if released he would spend the rest of his sentence on licence.
Edwards has also signed the sex offenders' register.
Speaking after sentencing, Det Con Matthew Lindsey described the rapist as a "dangerous and manipulative offender who preys on vulnerable women".
"It took great courage for the victim to support police proceedings in this case and as a result Edwards has been given a lengthy custodial sentence by the court," he said.
"We hope this successful prosecution will give other victims of sexual offences the courage and confidence in South Wales Police to report similar crimes."
