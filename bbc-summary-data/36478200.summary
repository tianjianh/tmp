Weybread case: 'Less likely' Sylvia Stuart is alive

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives searching for a woman whose husband was found stabbed to death say it is becoming "less and less likely" she will be found alive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sylvia and Peter Stuart were reported missing on Friday. The same day the body of Mr Stuart, 75, was found near his home in Suffolk.
Ali Qazimaj, 42, who is wanted over the murder and disappearance, is thought to have boarded a ferry to France.
Police "strongly believe" Mr Qazimaj will help them find Mrs Stuart.
Detectives said they need to know more about him and revealed he uses the alias Marco Costa.
It is thought he is from Kosovo and gained asylum in the UK.
Mr Qazimaj's car was found near the Dover ferry terminal on Sunday, with police confirming they had received "reliable information" he had boarded a ferry unaccompanied to Calais at 19:00 BST on Saturday.
Det Ch Supt Simon Parkes said: "We strongly believe that finding Ali Qazimaj will help us in locating Sylvia, who has now not been seen for nearly 10 days.
"It is becoming less and less likely we will find her alive as days go by," he said.
"Our enquiries continue to learn more about his roots and his links within the UK and overseas.
"We urgently need anyone who knows him, who may have spent time with him over the last few weeks or before this to get in touch and tell us more about his background so that we can trace his movements."
The Stuarts of Weybread, near Harleston, had spent Saturday 28 May with family and were captured on CCTV the following day at a Norfolk farm shop.
Their movements between that day and when they were reported missing on Friday are not known.
Mr Stuart was found dead in woodland surrounding their home on Friday evening.
Det Ch Insp Parkes said efforts to find Mrs Stuart were concentrated on the UK and there was no suggestion she was involved in her husband's murder.
He would not be drawn on whether her passport was missing or had been used.
The couple's son-in-law, Steve Paxman, 61, of Leicester, was arrested on Sunday and released on bail on Monday night.
