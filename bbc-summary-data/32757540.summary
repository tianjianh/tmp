Iestyn Richards-Rees, 28, was bidding to be the youngest Welshman to conquer Mount Everest's North Col when the first quake hit in April.
But he stayed in Nepal to help the relief effort and was in Kumari when the second tremor struck on 12 May.
He returned to Llangyndeyrn after an emotional plea from his mother.
Mr Richards-Rees said: "I got a voicemail from my mother and the voicemail basically said: 'Iestyn, I've asked you to come back since the first earthquake, now I'm telling you that you have to come back'.
"Seeing my mother in the state that she was, and hearing her voice, I realised just how bad this has been for her."
Some of the villagers he met during his relief work died in the second quake.
"You struggle to find words to describe what you feel," he said.
"It's a feeling of complete shock and that you can't really do anything."
"I think its going to take a bit of time to settle back into normal life."
