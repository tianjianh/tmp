[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tesco is ending 24-hour opening at four of its stores in Northern Ireland as part of changes to its operations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move will affect outlets in Banbridge, Carrickfergus, Enniskillen and Antrim Massereene. From 7 November they will trade from 06:00-00:00.
Nightshift operations will also end at a number of other NI stores and they will restock during the day.
The company said in most cases the trading hours at those stores would be unaffected, or subject to minor change.
Staff affected by the changes will be offered alternative roles, either within the store or within another local store.
A spokesman said: "We're making some changes in a number of our stores to help us run them more simply and deliver the best possible service for customers.
"We understand this may be disruptive for some of our colleagues and where there have been changes to a colleague's role we will be working really hard to ensure they are fully supported."
Across the UK, 30 24-hour stores will have their opening hours reduced.
A further 149 stores will have their "night replenishment operation" moved to "daytime replenishment", Tesco said.
