One of the Birmingham arenas that is the subject of a council sell-off has been renamed in a new sponsorship deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The LG Arena - part of the NEC Group - has been renamed the Genting Arena.
The NEC Group is being sold because the council faces a Â£1.1bn bill.
The council said it "could not confirm" whether Genting is its preferred buyer for the group, which also includes the National Exhibition Centre, the International Convention Centre and the National Indoor Arena.
Birmingham City Council had originally hoped the sale would be completed by the end of 2014 but said an announcement was now expected this year.
It faces a bill for a backlog in pay settlements which have been agreed with thousands of employees who, over many years, were paid less by the city council than colleagues - mainly men - who did equivalent jobs.
Genting, a Malaysian-based casino and leisure group, said sponsorship of the arena "will provide an opportunity to build the awareness of the Genting brand across the UK".
It is also developing a Â£150m shopping and entertainment complex adjacent to the arena site named Resorts World Birmingham.
A spokesman for the city council said: "The arena is one of the assets within the NEC group which is part of the sale process we started last year. When a sale occurs, any names and sponsorships will transfer as part of that mix."
