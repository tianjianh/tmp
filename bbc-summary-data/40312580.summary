Essex Police received reports a weapon had been fired at 23:30 BST on Thursday in Sandon, before a second incident at 00:20 in Chelmsford.
The pair, aged 16 and 17, were arrested following a police pursuit on Friday morning in Chelmsford, during which a car was abandoned.
They have since been released on bail.
The teenagers were held on suspicion of firearms and drug offences after police started pursuing a Mazda sports car in High Bridge Road at 11:00, which was then found empty in nearby Widford Road.
Detectives said they believed the "connected" shootings - in which doors were damaged at both Hall Lane, Sandon, and Hobart Close, Chelmsford - were "targeted" attacks.
Det Insp  Danny Stoten, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: "The general public are not at a greater risk and I would ask anyone who saw cars or anyone acting suspiciously in these roads at the times of the incidents to contact the police."
People with any CCTV or dashcam footage of the scenes have also been asked to come forward.
A silver coupe-type car was seen leaving Hobart Close towards Queensland Crescent after the shooting.
Police also carried out a warrant in New Writtle Street in the city on Friday night, but said no-one was arrested.
Officers were first called with reports that a car was damaged by a possible blunt instrument in Rutland Road at 20:15 on Thursday, ahead of the firearms attacks.
