Stadia in Albania, France, Kazakhstan, Israel, Poland and Turkey could also host the game between the Champions League and Europa League winners.
Although Windsor Park has a capacity of just over 18,000, Uefa have shown a willingness to stage the Super Cup at smaller venues in other countries.
Skopje, Macedonia will host Real Madrid v Manchester United later this summer.
The full refurbishment of Northern Ireland's international venue was completed last season and Fifa president Gianni Infantino was present at the official re-opening last October when Northern Ireland beat San Marino 4-0.
Uefa will reveal the 2019 SuperCup venue on 21 September.
