[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Spanish court has dismissed a fraud and corruption case against football superstar Neymar and his father.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case had been brought by the Brazilian investment fund DIS, which formerly owned the transfer rights to the 24-year-old forward.
The company claimed it was short-changed when Neymar transferred from Brazilian club Santos to Barcelona in 2013.
Neymar and his father, who acts as his agent, have both denied any wrongdoing.
In a separate case, Barcelona was forced to pay a fine of 5.5m euros ($6.1m; Â£4.7m) last month because of tax irregularities in Neymar's transfer from Santos.
Since moving to the Nou Camp, he has won two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey trophies, the Champions League, the European Super Cup, the Spanish Super Cup and the Club World Cup.
At Barcelona, he forms a powerful attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez.
In a separate case in Barcelona this week, Messi was sentenced to 21 months in jail for tax fraud.
The Argentine football great has appealed against the court's ruling.
