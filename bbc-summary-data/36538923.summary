Top seed Murray won 6-3 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals - and will next face another Briton in Kyle Edmund.
Murray, 29, last played a compatriot when he lost to Tim Henman in Bangkok in 2006.
The world number two is trying to win a record fifth Aegon Championships title this week.
Edmund, the British number three at 85 in the world, made progress when France's Paul-Henri Mathieu withdrew because of a wrist injury.
Asked if facing another British player had added pressure, Murray told BBC Sport: "Not for me.
"It was better that all of the British players were doing well and I play Kyle in the next round.
"It's been a long time, I'm happy there are more Brits around in the big events now. I actually had a feeling I was going to play one here. It was good."

Bedene had practised with Murray several times over the last year, but the world number 58 could not bridge the gap in class in their first competitive meeting.
After failing to convert a break point in the first game, the Slovenia-born British number two never threatened to upset the four-time champion.
Bedene, 26, held off a possible Murray break with a terrific running forehand in game six but the Scot made the breakthrough two games later.
An ace sealed the set for Murray before frustration early in the second as four breaks points went begging.
With rain a constant threat on another overcast day in London, Murray looked on the verge of a straightforward win when he broke for a 2-1 lead - only for Bedene to hit straight back and level.
The pressure was all one way, however, and a heavy backhand return opened up the court for Murray to put away a volley and grab the decisive break at 5-3.
"Losing in two sets is never great but I hope I showed myself in a good light. I'm happy with my performance," said Bedene, who gained UK citizenship last year.
"It felt like home, playing in front of a home crowd. It was great."

Seventh seed John Isner went out in dramatic fashion, losing 3-6 7-6 (18-16) 7-6 (9-7) to Luxembourg's Gilles Muller.
The 6ft 10in Isner fired down 43 aces and had 10 match points but could not convert, with Muller hitting 26 aces of his own to win in two hours and 25 minutes.
Muller goes on to face Australian Bernard Tomic, who came from a set down to beat Spain's Fernando Verdasco 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 6-4.
Canadian third seed Milos Raonic also progressed by beating Czech world number 68 Jiri Vesely 7-5 7-6 (8-6) to set up a quarter-final with either Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut or American Donald Young.
Bautista Agut had taken the first set 6-4 before play was cancelled for the day because of rain.
