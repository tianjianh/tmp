An hours-long standoff with police in Phoenix, Arizona, has ended with police finding five bodies inside a home.

Police believed the shooting deaths late on Thursday stemmed from a dispute about a family business.
The three male victims were brothers from Morocco and the fourth victim was their mother. The final victim was the wife of one of the men, police said.
Four other people fled the home during the standoff, police said.
Police used a megaphone to try to communicate with the occupants of the home, addressing the family in Arabic.
The Arizona Republic reported that one neighbour said the family owned a transportation service, but another referred to them as "invisible" until Thursday.
The standoff in the residential neighbourhood was shown live on TV with SWAT teams and other police agencies converging on the area.
"Our dispatcher could hear shots fired in the background while that call was coming in,'' police spokesman Sgt Trent Crump said. "A caller had been able to escape the home at that point, get out and start to give us information."
