[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Harbinson, 48, of Sheepwalk Road, Lisburn, has been charged with possession of a semi automatic pistol, a silencer and 28 rounds of ammunition with intent to endanger life.
The weapons were found by police on 21 December.
As a result, Mr Harbinson fled to Dublin and then Cumbria before eventually handing himself in.
Lisburn Magistrates' Court heard that police found the Makarov semi-automatic 9mm pistol in a biscuit tin hidden in the rafters in an outbuilding of Mr Harbinson's farm.
Police claim Mr Harbinson's fingerprints have been found on the inside inside of the biscuit tin lid.
Police said that Mr Harbinson was alerted to the fact that they were at his home, and he fled to Dublin.
After staying there for a few days he got the boat to Holyhead, and then the train to Carlisle.
He then stayed in a caravan behind an old friend's home in the village of Low Seaton in Cumbria.
The PSNI then raided this address, along with Cumbrian Police on New Years Eve, but Mr Harbinson escaped again.
A detective told the court that Mr Harbinson handed himself in later that day, 25 miles away having left his clothes, shoes, money, and passport in the caravan he had been staying in.
The court also heard that between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 worth of clean Bank of England notes, along with a bag of clothes, and a travel itinerary from Dublin to Cumbria were found in the caravan.
The police officer also told the court that when questioned, Mr Harbinson said he could not explain why his fingerprint was inside the biscuit tin as "he didn't like those kind of biscuits anyway".
His defence solicitor said although leaving Northern Ireland had been "stupidity in the highest form", it was simply because he had "gone into a blind panic" like a "kind of breakdown", as he was coming to the end of the license period for a previous crime of sexual offences against a child.
He said that Mr Harbinson, who has a seven year old child, had money, clothes and a passport at his parents house because he has a lot of enemies in the area around his home.
Mr Harbinson was remanded in custody as the judge ruled there were "real concerns" of flight risk, and because of the gravity of the charges.
He is due to appear again in court later this month.
