The Northern Irishman, 25, is world number one after winning back-to-back majors earlier this year.
McIlroy said he had no qualms about being a target for the United States in the match at Gleneagles next week.
2010: Won 1, Lost 1, Halved 2
2012: Won 3, Lost 2
"I was world number one in 2012, but this is my third Ryder Cup and I'm not a rookie anymore. I've got more responsibility," he told BBC Sport.
"There are still a few guys older than me but I'm somewhat of a leader and will try to set an example and lead from the front.
"Hopefully captain [Paul] McGinley puts that trust in me and I can go and lead the team out and hopefully get a few points on the board for Europe."
McIlroy has played with fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell six times in the last two contests but are currently involved in a court case with McIlroy's former management company.
McGinley insists he has no concerns about putting them together again, and McIlroy says he wants to play with McDowell.
He added: "I'd like to tee it up with Graeme. We've done well in the past. [The 2012 captain] Jose Maria [Olazabal] decided to split it up at the end in 2012 and I played with Ian Poulter.
"I get on great with Graeme. We have a great chemistry on the golf course and I'm sure we can team up to win a couple of points for Europe."
