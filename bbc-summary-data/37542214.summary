A man with terminal leukaemia whose wife's online plea to fund his treatment in America went viral appears to be beating the disease.

Mike Brandon, 32, from Bristol, underwent treatment in Philadelphia after UK doctors were unable to help .
His wife Kate said his biopsy results were clear for the second time and doctors said they were delighted with his progress.
The couple have launched a campaign to help patients in a similar position.
Mrs Brandon said: "We have more tests ahead but, right now, we couldn't be happier.
"Prior to starting the trial, Mike's bone marrow was made up of 90% leukaemia cells and he was given weeks to live but thanks to the cutting edge CAR T-cell therapy he received in the US he is now cancer free. "
Prof David Marks, of Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, said: "We are delighted with his progress and remain optimistic about the longer term.
"Mike is doing very well some three and a half months after his CAR-T cell therapy in Philadelphia.
"Bone marrow tests at one and three months after the treatment showed no evidence of leukaemia using sensitive techniques."
But he said more follow-up checks will be needed.
Mr Brandon was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia two years ago.
In May, his wife raised more than Â£450,000 using a social media campaign, to fund his participation in cancer trials at the University of Pennsylvania.
The couple have now started a new campaign called #Donate4TCells to help others who are facing a terminal diagnosis and have no other hope.
Mrs Brandon added: "We were so humbled by the incredible generosity of family, friends and strangers alike that we decided, now Mike is on the road to recovery, that we wanted to give something back.
"The funds raised will help support families whose loved ones are going through T-Cell Therapy like Mike."
