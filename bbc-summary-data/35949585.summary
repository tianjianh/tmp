[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Josh Todd fired Annan ahead but Arbroath soon equalised through Jamie Reid's fierce drive.
The hosts regained the lead 60 seconds later. A mistake from Arbroath goalkeeper Allan Fleming left Lewis Guy a simple finish.
Todd made it five goals in his last three matches with a neat strike before Smart Osadolor sealed the win late on.
