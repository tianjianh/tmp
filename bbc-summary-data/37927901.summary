Police, fire and ambulance services were called to the Carlsberg plant in Northampton at about 12:30 GMT.
In total, 22 people - 11 Carlsberg staff, two police officers and nine firefighters - were taken to hospital.
The man who died was a Carlsberg employee in his 40s, while the victim in a serious condition is a 51-year-old man.
Carlsberg confirmed production at the plant has ceased temporarily.
Julian Momen, chief executive officer of Carlsberg UK, said: "We are deeply, deeply saddened by today's tragic incident and subsequent fatality.
"Our immediate thoughts are with the individual's family, friends and colleagues at this very difficult time and we will support them in every way we can."
In a joint statement, the emergency services earlier said the gas leak was confined to the Bridge Street site and staff from within the building were evacuated.
They said there was "no risk to members of the public outside".
Nine firefighters and two police officers were taken to hospital as a "precautionary measure".
Mr Momen added: "Our further thoughts and support are with our colleagues and members of the emergency services who are being treated in hospital.
"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of everyone working for us.
"We are working closely with the authorities to investigate how this tragic incident occurred and we will be in a position to say more once a full investigation has been concluded."
An air ambulance was spotted taking off from the scene and people were seen leaving with tissues over their mouths.
Northamptonshire Police said six fire engines were called to the scene to "secure" the site, but that no cordons or road closures were set up.
The force said it would work with the Health and Safety Executive to investigate the incident.
