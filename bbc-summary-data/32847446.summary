Paul Flatman banned after Chelmsford chicken heat deaths

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A farmer has been given a suspended sentence and banned from keeping poultry for five years after thousands of his chickens died in soaring temperatures at his Essex business.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 6,000 birds were found dead in August 2012 at Hawksmill Farm in Great Leighs, near Chelmsford.
Paul Flatman, 65, of Church Road, Colchester, had admitted six animal welfare offences at an earlier hearing.
The chickens died in poorly-ventilated sheds during a heatwave.
Essex Trading Standards, which brought the prosecution, said the three sheds housing the birds were also overcrowded.
Alison Lambert, prosecuting, said it was impossible to be sure of the exact death toll "given the scale of putrefaction."
The discovery was made when a government vet visited Flatman's farm after an anonymous phone call reported concerns about how chickens were being kept.
Miss Lambert said when the vet got to the farm "the putrid smell was horrendous".
The vet concluded the birds had "died due to heat stress [which] could have been avoided".
The poultry farm was one of six then run by Mr Flatman, who, in March, admitted charges including not ensuring the chickens were protected from pain, suffering, injury and disease.
Roger Walters, Essex County Council lead member for Trading Standards, said: "This case shows that we will not tolerate livestock being kept in these kinds of conditions."
Flatman was banned from keeping poultry for five years, and handed a five-and-a-half-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months, when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court.
He was also ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work and pay Â£12,500 costs.
