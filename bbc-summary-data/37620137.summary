[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On 21 October 1966 a coal tip slid down a mountain and engulfed a primary school and 18 houses in the village of Aberfan - killing 116 children between the ages of seven and ten, and 28 adults. Half a century on, we look at some of the most powerful images of the tragedy's aftermath.
