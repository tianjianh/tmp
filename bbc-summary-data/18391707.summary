[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Damien was last seen in West Cowes on 2 November 1996 when he was 16.
The 38-year-old man, from Ryde, Isle of Wight, is the last remaining suspect linked to Mr Nettles' possible murder.
He answered a rescheduled bail appointment on Sunday. Police confirmed there was insufficient evidence to charge him with an offence.
A woman, 36, and a man, 45, both from Cowes, were also released from bail on Thursday.
Four other men arrested last year were released without charge in February.
Damien had lived with his family in Woodvale Road, Gurnard, but his mother moved to Texas after her husband had to move there for work.
Damien's body has not been located.
Supt Dave Powell from Hampshire Police said: "Our work to find out exactly what happened to Damien Nettles will be continuing.
"Although we have not charged anyone with a criminal offence, it has been exceptionally important to investigate information passed to us by the local community, which led to these arrests.
"Murder cannot be ruled out at this time because such a wide range of information has been received about Damien's disappearance since 1996."
