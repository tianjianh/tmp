Narth Run told to lose 'Great' title by Great North Run

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is in The Narth - it is a run - what other title do you give it apart from the Great Narth Run?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
That was the choice of charity organisers of the event in - where else? - The Narth, Monmouthshire, which they happily used for two years.
But a solicitor's letter from the organisers of the rather larger Great North Run half marathon in Newcastle informed them they were infringing its trademark.
The race is now the humble Narth Run.
The race was set up in 2013 to raise money for the Narth village hall, and Steve Coppell, one of the committee members, said they had made around Â£100 profit in total in the first two years.
It is mostly run along trails through Maryland Woods by a few dozen runners, with distances of 2k, 5k, and 10k to choose from.
But last September, a letter arrived from Nova (now the Great Run company) telling them they were infringing the Great North Run's trademark.
Mr Coppell said they had to sign an undertaking they would not use the word "great" or anything similar in connection with the Narth Run.
He said, after they got over the "puzzlement that you could trademark a word like great", the news had meant "a fair amount of inconvenience".
As well as taking down and altering a website used for their event, they also discovered they would not be allowed to recycle unused medals from previous years which bore the name "Great Narth Run" to save costs, and would have to destroy them.
But things took a turn for the better when the director of the company got in touch to apologise for the heavy-handed way the situation had been managed.
Mr Coppell said the Great Run Company had made a donation which had more than covered their costs as well as giving them two free entries into the Great North Run next year, which the committee may decide to raffle to raise money.
He added they were also in discussions about the company holding a competition amongst its approximately 40,000 Facebook followers to give two entries to the Narth Run plus a weekend's accommodation in the Wye Valley.
"This was always a bit of fun for us and as the story has run and run, it's become more amusing," Mr Coppell added.
However despite the publicity generated by the story, and a doubled running field this year to around 90 runners, he said the terrain and the logistics would prevent the race expanding much beyond a few hundred runners for safety reasons.
David Hart, from the Great Run Company, said: "Whilst we have a duty to protect our brand identity, for the organisers to receive a letter from our solicitors did seem rather heavy handed in view of the nature and scale of the event. We have subsequently made a donation to the event and provided places for next year's Great North Run as a gesture of goodwill.
"We are also exploring the idea of making the 'Narth Run' an official training event for the Great North Run.
"It could be the beginning of a great partnership."
