[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man accused of trying to murder pharmacist on Belfast's Falls Road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court accused of trying to kill a pharmacist during an alleged robbery in west Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men were treated in hospital after being stabbed during the incident at a Falls Road pharmacy on Thursday.
Patrick Campbell, 26, of no fixed address, spoke only to confirm that he understood the 11 charges against him.
Mr Campbell is accused of the attempted murder of Peter Wright and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on his colleague Peter McDonagh.
He is also accused of possessing a knife with intent to rob and assaulting police.
Mr Campbell faces further charges of robbing a woman of her mobile phone, attempting to steal money from a man and three further counts of possessing a knife with intent to rob on the same date.
No bail application was lodged on his behalf at Belfast Magistrates Court, so a district judge remanded him into custody to appear again via video link on 5 May.
One man, in his 40s, was stabbed in the arm and the second, a man in his 50s, sustained a stab wound to his chest, during the incident on Thursday.
Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.
