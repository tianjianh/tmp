Police Ombudsman: Dedicated team needed for UVF cases

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Police Ombudsman's office has said it needs a dedicated team to deal with four murders by the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lawyer for the ombudsman made the comment during an inquest review hearing into the murder of Craig McCausland in north Belfast in 2005.
Mr McCausland, 20, was shot dead by the UVF in July 2005.
The lawyer told the court the ombudsman's office was "significantly underfunded and under resourced".
He added that the office had provided the Department of Justice with  a business plan to deal with these four  cases in November 2014.
The review hearing heard that Mr McCausland's case is to be linked to the murders of Jackie Coulter, Bobby Mahood and Bobby Moffat.
Mr McCausland was the second member of his family to have been murdered by loyalists.
The killing was blamed by police on tensions within loyalism.
