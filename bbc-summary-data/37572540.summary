The film business is "doubly testing" of women, British actress Rosamund Pike has said at the London Film Festival premiere of her latest screen outing.

"It's not easy being a woman in this business," the Gone Girl star said at the screening of A United Kingdom, in which she co-stars with David Oyelowo.
It is the first time a film directed by a black woman has opened the event.
Pike said it was a "huge" milestone and that director Amma Asante "deserves every success she gets".
The former Oscar nominee also bemoaned the lack of opportunities for non-white actors, saying "there aren't as many roles".
"It's also hard from an actor's point of view to be a person of colour," the 37-year-old told reporters in London's Leicester Square.
"It's fine to be the second lead, but it's not always so easy to be the lead."
The issue of diversity in the industry is being debated on Thursday at a symposium at BFI Southbank, with an opening address from Oyelowo ahead of two panel discussions about opportunities for black talent.
A United Kingdom tells of Seretse Khama, King of Bechuanaland - now modern Botswana - and Ruth Williams, the London office worker he married in 1948.
Speaking on Wednesday, Oyelowo said the film was about "two people who saw beyond race" and "a love that helped them overcome... obstacles."
