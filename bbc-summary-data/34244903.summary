BMW Mini have been granted permission to expand their plant on to facilities currently leased by the club.
The expansion of the Cowley plant is still subject to planning permission, but Oxford City Council will relocate leisure facilities at the site.
"We're being kept in the loop with a number of alternatives being put to us," Ashton told BBC Radio Oxford.
The 24-acre land, earmarked as part of a Â£4.9m deal between BMW Mini and Oxford City Council, is currently home to the Oxford Sports and Social Club and Oxford Cricket Club, as well as the football club.
"We need to find a long-term home for the football club that's for sure," Ashton added.
"That's facilities to accommodate the first team, the academy teams and the Women's Super League side. When you look at it all, it's a hell of a lot of space we use.
"That space just isn't readily available, so we may have to move to an interim solution before we get to where we want to be.
"It's a very, very important part of our football club moving forward."
