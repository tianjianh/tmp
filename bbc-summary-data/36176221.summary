[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City and Birmingham played out a tame draw in Russell Slade's final match as Bluebirds manager.

David Cotterill fired the visitors in front before Anthony Pilkington seized on sloppy Blues defending to equalise.
In a drab second half, Birmingham's James Vaughan missed the best chance as he hit the post when clean through on David Marshall in the Cardiff goal.
The result sees Bluebirds finish the season in eighth place, while Birmingham drop to 10th.
In Slade's last match as Cardiff manager before becoming the club's head of football, there was nothing riding on it for either team.
Cardiff's slim play-off hopes were resoundingly ended by a 3-0 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday the previous weekend, while Birmingham had already fallen out of contention for the top six.
Blues did not seem to lack motivation as Cardiff-born Cotterill gave them the lead with a powerful low strike as his assistant manager for Wales, Osian Roberts, watched from the stands.
Diego Fabbrini hit the post with a shot from the edge of the area as Gary Rowett's side impressed, but they contributed to their downfall as Cardiff equalised.
Jonathan Grounds seemed to have time to clear Scott Malone's cross but dithered, allowing Pilkington to pinch the ball and finish from close range.
The game's intensity dipped in the second half, with Cardiff only mustering a handful of half-chances.
Cotterill was close to scoring a second Birmingham goal, but his dipping free-kick from 25 yards was brilliantly headed off the line by Noone.
The best opportunity fell to substitute Vaughan who, one-on-one with Cardiff goalkeeper Marshall, shot against the post.
Cardiff manager Russell Slade: "I move to my new role with my head held high. We have made progress as a club, we have taken strides to get us on the right track again.
"I don't think it will take an awful lot more progress for this club to get where it wants to be. There is a sound platform for the next head coach to build on."

Birmingham manager Gary Rowett: "In stages we played well, we came on far stronger in the last 25 minutes but our performances have not been reflected in the points we have taken.
"That has cost us but this has been a very positive season for this club and we are moving forward."
