[SN]TITLE[SN]
Abandoned boats in Bristol harbour to be sold at auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 20 boats and vessels neglected and abandoned in Bristol's docks are being sold in an online auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vessels had been impounded and left unclaimed by their owners.
Bristol City Council's harbour authority has organised the sale, which lasts until the end of the month.
Some of the vessels are likely to be broken up for spares because of their poor condition, and the council will remove any vessels left unsold.
The collection includes motor cruisers and sailing boats.
Auctioneer Graham Cockle, of Crown Consultants which is overseeing the sale, said some of the boats will need "a little TLC".
"They are in quite a sorry state, but the biggest vessel we have is a 20 metre ex-survey ship through to 10 or 12 river boats, a particularly nice sailing yacht and some inflatable tenders," he said.
"These sales come up every two to three years and there's going to be some bargains here."
