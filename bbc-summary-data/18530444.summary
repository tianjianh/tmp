A project in Halifax which helps people on the town's streets at night has won a Prime Minister's Big Society Award.

The Street Angel Christian Nightlife Initiative sees volunteers patrolling the streets to help deal with alcohol-fuelled anti-social behaviour.
Running for seven years, the project has been copied by more than 100 towns and cities across the UK.
The group will pick up its award from the prime minister at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street.
Street Angels founder Paul Blakey MBE, said: "To be awarded the Big Society Award is an amazing accolade for the thousands of volunteers who invest time and skills into over 100 local areas across the UK week in and week out.
"The fact that in many of these towns and cities violent crime and sexual assaults have reduced significantly and that the night-time economy has become a better place that can be enjoyed by all is proof that volunteering works and can have a massive positive impact."
Volunteers wear distinctive jackets and work alongside police at weekends reporting incidents of violence and helping people who have become vulnerable during a night out.
They also remove broken glasses and bottles from the streets and lecture on the dangers of binge drinking in local schools.
Prime Minister David Cameron said: "Street Angels shows what can be achieved when communities come together and work hand in hand with their local services to make their towns, estates and streets safer places."
