Hallaton Bottle Kicking matches the Leicestershire villages of Hallaton and Medbourne in an attempt to get small barrels across one of two streams.
Organisers claim its roots go back to Roman times and the muddy chaos was the inspiration for modern rugby.
After the traditional start of eating Hare Pie, favourites Hallaton retained their title, winning 2-0.
Phil Allen, who has been involved in arranging the fixture for more than 42 years, said: "The rules are very simple; there aren't any rules."
Mr Allen said: "We believe that the Hallaton Bottle Kicking is the longest-running sporting event in Britain. We don't think there's anything older.
"It is the origin of rugby. Rugby started here in Hallaton. (William) Webb Ellis came to see his uncle, the rector, and then he went back to school - saw what they did in Hallaton, took the ball and ran with it."
