[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The director of Birmingham City Council's adults and children's services will retire in July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Hay first joined the local authority 14 years ago and became strategic director for people in 2013.
He initially took over children's services "in the interim" after years of criticism and poor ratings from Ofsted.
Mr Hay said it had been "the greatest privilege" to work with "so many very special people".
"I want to continue to pursue my lifelong commitment to social justice in all its forms through the new opportunities that will come in my next stage of life," he said.
"I have had the privilege to lead many talented staff who carry out amazing work."

Previously a social worker, Mr Hay joined the council in 2003 and was credited by the authority in helping its children's services gain a star rating in the 2005 national assessment.
He was placed in charge of the adult and communities directorate when adults and children's services were separated before taking charge of both departments when they were re-merged in 2013.
In 2012 he was awarded a CBE for services to social care and health, and he has also served as president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Care.
Brigid Jones, the council's cabinet member for children, families and schools, said Mr Hay could not have taken on the job "at a harder time" following a string of high-profile incidents.
"He has been personally instrumental in securing a stable and motivated workforce and I shall miss his leadership, professionalism and unreserved support," she said.
