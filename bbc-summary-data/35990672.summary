[SN]TITLE[SN]
Machete sergeant not guilty of attempted murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Army sergeant has been found not guilty of trying to kill a fellow soldier with a machete.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Norwood was cleared of the attempted murder of Lance Sergeant James Warnock.
The jury at Winchester Crown Court is still considering alternative charges of wounding with intent and attempting to wound with intent.
L/Sgt Warnock suffered wounds to his shoulder, hands and wrist after being allegedly attacked by Norwood.
Norwood, of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, said he wanted to "put the fear of God" into L/Sgt Warnock, 24, after the pair had a drunken brawl at a pub in Aldershot.
He said: "I knew I would be the butt of a lot of jokes because I had been beaten by a junior non-commissioned officer (NCO).
"It's unheard of in my line of work for a senior NCO to be beaten up by a junior NCO, I wanted to minimise the jokes by scaring Mr Warnock."
He added that he did not intend to harm L/Sgt Warnock.
The 38 year old, of Priesthill Road, Glasgow, has been accused of "hunting" his victim.
He is also accused of attempting to wound Craftsman Nicholas Wood, 24, whose room Norwood went into by mistake.
He swung the machete on to the bed, "shredding" the duvet but stopping once he realised the room was not L/Sgt Warnock's.
The trial continues.
