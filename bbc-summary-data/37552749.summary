Syria conflict: Spain and France draft Aleppo truce resolution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
France and Spain are trying to get UN Security Council agreement for a resolution seeking a truce in the Syrian city of Aleppo, after the US ended its negotiations with Russia.

The draft text calls for a UN-sponsored truce monitor, an end to all fighting and military flights over the city.
Parties who fail to comply with the truce could face "further measures".
Russia immediately questioned the proposal and the grounding of flights, saying it was unlikely to bring peace.
The besieged rebel-held east of Aleppo has come under intense and sustained aerial bombardment by Syrian government and Russian forces since a truce brokered by the Washington and Moscow collapsed last month.
France's permanent representative to the UN, Francois Delattre, said: "We consider that this is our responsibility to do absolutely everything we can do, everything humanly possible to unite the Security Council behind our efforts to end the martyrdom in Aleppo."
But Russia's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Moscow was "a little bit baffled" by the proposal for a new ceasefire monitoring mechanism when there is already one in Geneva "which has been there for a long time and frankly has not been used very effectively".
"If they were sincere, we can have a resolution, I suppose, which would be more balanced proposal," he added.
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said he deeply regretted the US decision to suspend talks with Russia but vowed "to push energetically for a political solution".
His spokeswoman, Jessy Chahine, said he was "still in intensive consultations on the way forward".
Russian and American officials had been due to meet in Geneva on Monday to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups on the ground in Syria, but the Americans were told to return home.
Suspending the talks, Washington accused Moscow of having "failed to live up" to its commitments under the recent truce deal.
In response, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the US was "trying to shift responsibility on to someone else".
"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo," she said, referring to Moscow's claim that the US was unable to separate mainstream rebel factions on the ground from the al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.
Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo on 22 September.
On Monday, the main trauma hospital in the rebel-held east was damaged in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said.
The Syrian American Medical Society, which supports the facility, said the attack meant only five hospitals remained operational to care for as many as 300,000 civilians, including more than 85,000 children. There were only 29 doctors to treat the overwhelming number of wounded, it added.
