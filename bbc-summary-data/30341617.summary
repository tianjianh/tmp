The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo organisation says the total number of children it has found is now 116.
The group's president, Estela Carlotto, said the young person they found was raised in the home of a doctor.
The junta snatched hundreds of babies from their opponents and gave them to sympathisers to bring up.
The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo was formed to reunite biological parents and grandparents with hundreds of children born in prisons and torture centres.
The organisation said the parents of the "116th child" found were a student couple, named Hugo Alberto Castro and Ana Rubel.
They were kidnapped in 1977 and taken to the largest interrogation and torture centre in Argentina, the infamous naval training school, ESMA, which lies just outside Buenos Aires.
In August, Ms Carlotto announced that she had found her own long-lost grandson. He was born in 1978 to Ms Carlotto's daughter, Laura, a young history student and political activist held by the military junta.
Laura was killed in captivity two months later, one of 30,000 left-wing activists murdered during the 1976-1983 military rule.
