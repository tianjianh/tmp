Scotland: Celtic's Kieran Tierney happy to switch roles for national side

Kieran Tierney says he is happy to test his versatility for Scotland after playing three different positions in his last three international matches.

The left-back played his normal role in the defeat in Slovakia, right-back in the win over Slovenia and centre-back in Saturday's 2-2 draw with England.
"Being told you are playing centre-back and you have not done it too many times, it's hard," Tierney said.
"It's a new challenge, like when I was right-back, but I like new challenges."
Celtic's Tierney played alongside Christophe Berra and Charlie Mulgrew as part of a back three on Saturday at Hampden, head coach Gordon Strachan having adopted a new approach against the unbeaten Group F leaders.
The Scotland defence was breached by second-half substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain before two Leigh Griffiths free-kicks in 87 and 90 minutes had the hosts on the brink of an unlikely win.
England skipper Harry Kane, however, ensured the points were shared with a stoppage-time equaliser.
Tierney was solid in his new role and made one goal-line clearance from the England captain.
"I tried to do my best," said the 20-year-old. "The last five minutes was a roller-coaster - obviously Griff's great two free-kicks and the sucker punch at the end, which left us gutted.
"But I think we can be proud of the effort we put in."
The draw felt like a defeat to Tierney due to the timing of Kane's strike, but he said time may change his perception of a result that left Scotland six points behind leaders England, three behind Slovenia and four behind Slovakia with four fixtures remaining.
"I hope it is the case because the boys put everything into it," Tierney said.
"We trained all week and everyone in the squad gave 100% against England, so it was good that way.
"We will get on with it and look forward to the remaining games in the group."
