The Blues had Nemanja Matic sent off as they were held to a late 1-1 draw at home to Burnley.
Referring to notes in his post-match BBC interview, Mourinho said: "There are four moments of the game where you can write the story. Minutes 30, 33, 43 and 69. Don't ask me more questions.
"I can't go through the incidents. I am punished when I refer to them."
The key incidents:
Burnley keeper Tom Heaton launches the ball forward and Barnes appears to catch Branislav Ivanovic with a knee to the back of his legs as the two challenge for a header. The Blues defender reacts furiously to the challenge but the referee does not award a free-kick.
Ivanovic is at the centre of the action again. Juan Cuadrado pulls the back back for the Serbia defender and he strikes a first-time shot from the edge of the area which hits the raised arm of Michael Kightly, who is turning his back on the ball. Ivanovic claims handball but referee Martin Atkinson is unmoved.
Burnley defender Jason Shackell is dispossessed by Diego Costa and, in trying to make up for his mistake, the Clarets player appears to push the Chelsea striker. Costa falls to the ground but Atkinson again decides against awarding a spot-kick to the home side. Costa punches the ground in anger.
The midfielder is dismissed for a reactive push on Barnes after a late tackle from the Burnley forward. Mourinho said:  "What happened to Matic was in minute 69 and minute 69 had a big relationship with minute 30 because normally that player, if I can call him a player, should have been in the shower in minute 31.
"There wouldn't have been a minute 69 if the person in charge had dealt with minute 30 properly."
Former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin was critical of both Matic's reaction and the original challenge from Barnes.
He said: "You cannot react like that - and Chelsea players have done in the past. I think the tackle by Ashley Barnes deserves a substantial ban though. It was a vile challenge on Nemanja Matic.
"Potentially a leg-breaker."
In January Mourinho was fined Â£25,000 by the Football Association for comments claiming there is a "campaign" to influence referees' decisions against his Chelsea side.
Costa was then handed a three-game ban for stamping on Liverpool defender Emre Can, with Mourinho again blaming TV pundits for being part of 'a campaign.'
After the draw with Burnley, Mourinho said: "A couple of weeks ago when I was here in the press conference after the Liverpool game in the Capital One Cup, the television subtitles had gone on and on about Diego's 'crimes'.
"Well compare Diego's 'crimes' with what happened against Burnley.
"Have I seen a run of decisions like this? I don't remember. I'm happy that I'm not stupid and I understood everything a couple of months ago. I'm not in the mood to laugh."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche defended his players and refused to be drawn by Mourinho's comments.
"I've only seen it as it happened. It looked like a coming together at an odd angle. Then Matic reacts in the way he did," Dyche said.
"I will look back at it again, but I haven't seen it since. But there's more to talk about than that because it was an excellent performance.
"Barnes was involved in something earlier in what sense? Playing football? A charge in the back? Is there anything else? The grass was too short?
"I have total respect for Jose Mourinho, his players and Chelsea. Fantastic manager, fantastic club."
