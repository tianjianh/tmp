The Gunners are close to signing Elneny from FC Basel and Wenger believes all clubs in the top flight will be active.
"We hope to have things done this week. I'm optimistic," said Wenger.
Ex-Arsenal striker Benik Afobe's move from Wolves to Bournemouth for about £10m is the biggest so far this month.
Chelsea's £23m signing of Fiorentina winger Juan Cuadrado was the largest deal completed on transfer deadline day in 2015 as Premier League spending in the January window matched 2014's £130m.
That figure fell well short of the record £225m spent in 2011.
Wenger said: "My prediction is that it could be one of the most active January transfer windows that we've seen."
The Frenchman is anticipating a lot of deals being done in the league over the next three weeks.
"I would say for the media you could have some good news in the January transfer window," he said. "I believe many clubs will be active. You go from the clubs who are down in the table like Villa, who have to do something, to the clubs at the top."
He also tipped Afobe to do well at Bournemouth.
"Afobe has the qualities to integrate into a team like Bournemouth, whose game is based on movement, pace and quick football," he added.
"I am very happy for Benik because he had an outstanding attitude here. Sometimes you have to let people go who are not completely ready for us, knowing they could be successful."
