A Staffordshire man has achieved his "lifelong dream" of becoming the World's Strongest Man.

Eddie "The Beast" Hall, 29, of Clayton, beat 29 other men to the title in the competition held in Botswana.
Mr Hall, who has been crowned Britain's Strongest Man four times, previously told the BBC his life was dedicated to achieving the world title.
His manager Mo Chaudry said Hall worked for a decade towards this "absolutely extraordinary" achievement.
Hall is the first Briton to win the world title since Gary Taylor 24 years ago.
Mr Chaudry said Hall had remained committed to his goal.
"There have been times when people have doubted his abilities to win and in the last two or three years I think it's got harder and harder because the other pros have got better also, and they are all very competitive."
Mr Hall, who tweeted after the contest he was retiring from World's Strongest Man contests, was a lorry maintenance worker before turning professional.
The father-of-two competed in a number of events, including carrying two fridges along a 30-metre course within 60 seconds and carrying five Atlas Stones which increase in weight from 100 kg (15 stone 10lb)  to 160 kg (25st 2lb).
Organisers say the contest is "about stamina, skill, tactics, training and strategy" with every event designed to push competitors to their "absolute limits".
