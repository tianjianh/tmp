Leicestershire all-rounder Ben Raine has signed a new contract that will keep him at the club until at least the end of the 2017 season.

The 23-year-old former Durham player's previous deal had been due to expire at the end of the current campaign.
He has made 28 appearances for Leicestershire in all formats since making his debut for the club in 2013.
"We feel that Ben has a really bright future in the game," chief executive Wasim Khan told the club's website.
"It's further good news for the club after Atif Sheikh, Aadil Ali and Lewis Hill all committed their futures to us recently."
Leicestershire drew their opening fixture of the new Division Two season and are on a 33-match winless run in the County Championship.
