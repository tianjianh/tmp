Officers were called at 20:45 BST on Saturday to a woodland area between Colwick Road and Sneinton Boulevard.
The man, who sustained shotgun injuries to his back and leg, remains seriously ill in hospital, police said.
Det Supt Rob Griffin believes "two shots were fired". A 22-year-old man, arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, was later released on bail pending further enquiries.
A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.
Det Supt Griffin added: "We understand a blue Yamaha R6 motorcycle with two occupants, both wearing helmets, parked on Sneinton Boulevard near to the entrance of Sneinton Wood.
"The movements of this motorcycle leading up to the time it was parked are of interest to us."
He said there would be an increased police presence in the area and additional patrols were planned.
