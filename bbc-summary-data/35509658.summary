Gregory converted from close range in the second half after the home defenders failed to clear the ball.
Rochdale should have been awarded a penalty in the first half when Shaun Williams clipped Ian Henderson.
Midfielder Callum Camps had an early effort saved by Millwall goalkeeper Jordan Archer and Gregory could have had a second but his lob sailed wide.
Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester:

"A draw would have been a fair result. In the first half we had good opportunities and we should have had a penalty, but sometimes you just don't get that fortune.
"We're all unhappy with the result and fans have got to make their own judgements on everything. It's up to me to select the side to actually play against any opposition and that's the sword that I fall on.
"The fans aren't stupid, they're quite intelligent and they'll see that we've done enough today to get something from the game."
Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC Radio London:

"Obviously delighted with the result. I thought it was a very even game, keenly contested.
"It certainly wasn't pretty. The guys really had to dig in and roll their sleeves up.
"You could argue it's one of the most important wins of the season.
"They could easily not have put in that level of performance on this pitch in these conditions after a horrendous journey yesterday."
