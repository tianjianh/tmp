Anderson, 34, was left out of the 16-man party to tour India after missing the tour of Bangladesh with a shoulder injury.
He will not play in the first Test but could appear in the second after making a quick recovery.
"It's a credit to the hunger he has shown to get back," captain Alastair Cook told BBC Radio 5 live.
"There's nothing more he can do, apart from coming out here and getting acclimatised and get some more overs in."
England will play five Tests against number one ranked side India, starting in Rajkot on 9 November.
Anderson, who has taken 463 wickets since making his Test debut in 2003, made six Test appearances for England over the summer.
He missed the first Test against Pakistan at Lord's in July due to a shoulder problem but returned to take nine wickets in the remaining three Tests.
England will not play any practice games throughout the Test series, which Cook described as "not ideal".
"I don't think it matters quite so much now after Bangladesh but maybe during the series, the guys who haven't played or haven't done as well as they like, could play a game away from Test cricket," he added.
Lancashire teenager Haseeb Hameed could make his debut in Rajkot as England look to come back from a batting collapse in Bangladesh that saw them lose 10 wickets for 64 runs.
"If he does get thrown into the cauldron, I think he'll handle it very well," coach Trevor Bayliss said.
"He's very much part of the squad and it feels like he's been here for two or three years."
