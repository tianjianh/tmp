Two new structures, commissioned by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, are being erected as part of a wider Â£5.3m scheme to redevelop the station.
Once completed, both the Argyle and Howard Street entrances will feature glass structures inspired by the Kibble Palace in Glasgow's Botanic Gardens.
Contractor Graham Construction expects to finish the work by summer 2015.
The Argyle Street entrance canopy will be completed before work on the Howard Street entrance begins.
Gordon Maclennan, chief executive of Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, said: "Modernisation of the subway is progressing at pace and the redevelopment of St Enoch Station is one of the most exciting aspects of the project so far.
"Passengers have benefited from the internal improvements made to date and we're confident that everyone using the station will enjoy the striking new look station exterior.
"I'm looking forward to seeing the station completed as it is a stunning design and will, I'm sure, become a striking centrepiece to the wider area."
