Ray Fisher, 75, and his wife Angela, 69, were killed in Sousse a week ago, according to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Their son Adam Fisher, from Redhill in Surrey, had previously told the BBC he had not spoken to his parents since they left for holiday.
Their bodies were repatriated to the UK on Friday.
The last of the attack victims, including Christopher and Sharon Bell, Scott Chalkley, Sue Davey, Eileen Swannack, and John Welch, were flown into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire.
A minute's silence was held across the UK at 12:00 BST to remember the victims.
