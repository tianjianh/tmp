A distraught animal lover took a "dead cat" into a rescue shelter, only to find it was a cuddly dog puppet.

The member of the public brought the feline fatality to the Guernsey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) for identification.
Manager Steve Byrne said a "closer look" revealed the deceased pet was in fact "a very muddy, wet, insect-covered" dog puppet.
"An air of sadness soon turned to laughter," he said.
He said: "When a member of public arrives with what is said to be a dead cat your heart sinks as it is never an easy moment when we aren't able to help an animal.
"There are many rescues and calls that the GSPCA are involved with every week and sometimes they aren't what we expect and this has certainly turned out to be one of the most unusual we have ever seen."

Mr Byrne said he was keen to reunite the puppet with its owners and described it as black and white with a missing nose and a green collar.
