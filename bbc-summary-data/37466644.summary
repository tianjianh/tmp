Star Wars actor Warwick Davis and former Doctor Who and Hobbit star Sylvester McCoy are also taking part.
Those who attended were given the chance to meet the authors of their favourite books or characters from their favourite shows.
The convention, now in its fifth year, has become renowned for fans' enthusiasm for dressing up.
Brian Cooney, managing director of the MCM expo group which organises the event, said: "The whole genre and the fact that people enjoy going out and dressing up is amazing to watch and a big part of the event.
"They like to 'cos play' - they call it that because they like to costume play and don't just put on a costume and go 'look at my costume'. They want to try and play the characters. It's their escape for a day or two where they come and enjoy the fun."
Mr Cooney said Comic Con had become a broad term that embraced pop culture.
He added: "It's totally mainstream now. The fact that the movies have become so successful has led even more people into it, but it was already on the way up before the movies."
