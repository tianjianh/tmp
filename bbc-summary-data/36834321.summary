Caledan, based in Hengoed, Caerphilly county, is backed by £134,000 from the Welsh Government.
It will make steel frame sections for the building industry, mainly using steel from Tata in Llanwern, Newport.
Caledan managing director Chris Morton said Welsh Government support had been "vital" as the project could otherwise have gone to the Midlands.
"We can now take advantage of a gap in the market to purchase and produce the cold steel strip locally for our own uses and to supply the wider construction industry," he said.
"It will result in increased efficiencies and savings for our business and, as we will also be supplying the local market, it will create additional savings on logistics and cut the carbon footprint."
Economy Secretary Ken Skates added: "The Welsh Government is committed to supporting the steel industry in Wales and I am pleased this project aims to do just that.
"The investment not only secures a new venture but will create new jobs and enhance opportunities within the local supply chain."
