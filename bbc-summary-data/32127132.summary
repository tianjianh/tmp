The event will be held at Earlham Park in Norwich on 23-24 May.
Tickets to Europe's biggest free ticketed music event were available on a first come first served basis but were all gone within 40 minutes.
You'll need to have registered in advance to be in with a chance of getting them.
Twenty-five thousand tickets were made available for each day of the event.
The remaining acts on the bill will be announced on Radio 1 on Monday 20 April.
Neil Wyatt, head of live music and events for BBC Popular Music, said: "It is brilliant to see the tickets go so quickly.
"One of the main reasons we are bringing Radio 1's Big Weekend to Norwich is because we know that there is a real appetite for new music and it's great to see the excitement in the city.
"If you weren't able to secure a ticket for the event, we will be revealing information about Radio 1's Academy including the sessions that will be available very soon, so keep listening to Radio 1 if you want to be involved."
Big Weekend this year will feature three stages including the Main Stage, In New Music We Trust Stage and the BBC Introducing Stage.
The majority of tickets (55%) were reserved for people living within the area covered by Norwich City Council.
Another 20% were reserved for residents with a Norwich (NR) postcode, but outside the area covered by the City Council.
