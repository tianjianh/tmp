[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian McKandie, 67, was found at Fairview Cottages in Badenscoth, Rothienorman, on Saturday 12 March.
Two men were reportedly seen speaking to him on the Friday beforehand.
Police Scotland appealed to motorists who may have been in the area between the Friday and Saturday and recorded dash cam footage to contact them.
Det Ch Insp Iain Smith said: "While they may not necessarily think it is beneficial or relevant, let us make that judgement. It may assist us.
"A member of the public has already come forward with dash cam footage and we are grateful for the response from the public. We would appeal to others to do so."
Mr McKandie was described by relatives as "dearly beloved" and a "genial sort of chap".
