[SN]TITLE[SN]
Queens Park Rangers 0-1 Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonathan Kodjia's powerful low shot was enough to secure Aston Villa's second Championship away win of the campaign at strugglers QPR.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker had a first-half penalty saved by R's keeper Alex Smithies, after he was fouled by Pawel Wszolek.
Villa improved after the break, but Smithies stopped efforts from both Kodjia and Leandro Bacuna.
But Kodjia was not to be denied, as his strike squirmed under Smithies to make it five losses in a row for Rangers.
Relive: Villa secure win at QPR
It is the first time Villa have won a league game at Loftus Road since 1991, when Dwight Yorke scored the winning goal.
One positive for Ian Holloway's side was the return of forward Jamie Mackie following an eight-month injury lay-off.
However the R's have not tasted victory since Holloway's first game in charge, and it would have been worse had Smithies not saved his fifth Championship penalty out of the last seven he has faced.
The result leaves the London side just three points above the relegation zone, while Villa are six points from the final play-off place.
QPR manager Ian Holloway:
"I feel just like the supporters I imagine; there was lots of real good stuff, but we got to 65 minutes and went a little too deep.
"The closing and pressing, the way the lads chased and worked, I couldn't ask them to give me any more.
"The longer it goes and the less confident you get, the deeper you go and then you start to worry.
"We need to get someone who can bobble it in off their ear hole. I don't care how ugly the goal is - it doesn't matter, we need to score first."
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce:
"We've had the most outstanding chances, and I thought their goalkeeper was going to get man of the match.
"There was one save in particular down to his right hand side that was unbelievable, then he saved the penalty and you're thinking if it's going to be one of those days.
"Thankfully Kodjia has done what he's done best. The pleasing thing is that he's stuck at it, missing the penalty, and won us the match. It's his eighth goal in 11 games.
"We've still got a long way to catch up, we've got to try and make an impression on the top six, that's got to be our aim."
