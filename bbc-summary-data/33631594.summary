[SN]TITLE[SN]
MI5 letter among child abuse allegation papers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A search for files about historical child sexual abuse claims has uncovered a letter from MI5, which said the risk of "political embarrassment" was "greater than the security danger".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
That letter was one of a number of documents found by the Cabinet Office which detail abuse allegations.
The search came after it emerged some papers had not been given to a review of how abuse claims were handled.
These have been passed to the police and the review's authors.
That review, led by NSPCC head Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC, concluded last year that there was no evidence that Home Office records had been deliberately removed or destroyed.
Both Mr Wanless and Mr Whittam, who examined how the Home Office dealt with files alleging child abuse from 1979 to 1999, say the latest material has not altered their original conclusions.
The MI5 letter, written in 1986 by its then boss Sir Antony Duff, followed an inquiry into a MP alleged to have a "penchant for small boys".
The letter concluded that the MP's denial was accepted and Sir Anthony wrote that "the risk of political embarrassment to the government is rather greater than the security danger".
Other newly disclosed documents make reference to the Kincora boys' home in Northern Ireland, which was at the centre of a child abuse scandal between the 1950s and the 1980s.
Many of the new files found were in a set of previously uncatalogued records called "Cabinet Secretary miscellaneous papers".
It included documents about three MPs - former home secretary Leon Brittan, Sir Peter Morrison and Sir William van Straubenzee - although the contents of those papers is not known.
The supplementary report to the review by Mr Wanless and Mr Whittam includes a written apology from the permanent secretary to the Cabinet Office for the "flaw in the way the Cabinet Office initially responded to your call for a search of departmental papers".
In his assessment of the newly discovered documents, Mr Wanless said that the risk to children was "not considered at all".
Both he and Richard Whittam QC also describe the emergence of the new material as "unhelpful" for public confidence in the proper disclosure of government documents and correspondence.
