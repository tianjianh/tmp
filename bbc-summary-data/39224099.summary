[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ulster Bank to close nine branches in Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster Bank is to close nine of its 64 branches in Northern Ireland from October.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bank said it has made the decision because more of its customers are using digital banking.
It is understood it will affect six branch staff and a further 10 people who work in mortgage broker services.
Sean Murphy from the bank said: "Closing a branch is never an easy decision and one we do not take lightly."
He added: "Ulster Bank still retains Northern Ireland's largest bank branch network."
The branches closing are:
Mr Murphy said the company was "writing to customers of these branches to inform them of alternative branch locations in their area and the range of banking services available on their mobiles, online, telephone and in post offices".
He added: "We are also communicating directly with staff in those affected branches."
Recently, First Trust announced the closure of 15 branches in Northern Ireland.
Branch closures are "not good for customers, not good for staff, and it's not good for the Northern Ireland economy", according to Larry Broderick of the Financial Services Union, which represents staff in the finance sector.
"This is based on the fact that the banks want to be more profitable, and that's not fair to a lot of rural customers who need branches," he added.
Online and telephone banking services would be "no consolation to customers who actually need some place to put cash in", Mr Broderick said.
