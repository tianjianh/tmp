[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kilmarnock 0-0 Albion Rovers (3-5pen)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock were knocked out of the league cup after a lacklustre display saw them slump to defeat on penalties to Albion Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a goalless 90 minutes, Josh Magennis was denied in the shootout by keeper Ross Stewart as the Wee Rovers claimed the bonus point.
Scott McBride scored the fifth spot kick to seal victory for the visitors.
Ryan Wallace thought he had put Rovers in front in the first-half, only to see his effort ruled out for a foul.
In a week when the Killie manager had to deny stories he was about to quit, he looked a frustrated figure as his players turned in a second successive disjointed home performance.
Killie's on-loan keeper from Swansea Oliver Davies produced two moments Des O'Connor used to sing about, notably "Careless hands", as he fumbled when it looked easier to catch.
With the second he was fortunate the referee came to his aid because Wallace took advantage of his slip-up and slotted the ball in the net.
However, Bobby Madden disallowed the goal for apparently a foul on Davies.
Josh Magennis and Souleymane Coulibaly were the main Killie strikers but they failed to hit the target with any of the opportunities that fell their way in the first half.
The first effort on target came from the League One side when Mark Ferry's low strike on the hour mark saw Davies dive low to his right to turn it round the post.
In the last ten minutes Killie's full-time status seemed kick-in with Rovers more on the back foot.
Rory McKenzie fired a volley from 25 yards over the bar before Coulibaly tried an acrobatic back flick with his heel that was stopped on the line.
Miles Addison sent a glancing header wide from a Magennis cross, before McKenzie had a penalty appeal rejected after going down in the box under the challenge of Ross Dunlop.
However, a former Killie player Gary Fisher almost came back to haunt his old club with a late strike which Davies had to be alert to hold.
That meant we headed to penalties, and Magennis' miss saw the League One side prevail in the shootout.
