Salman Butt: Pakistan should recall former captain, says Waqar Younis

Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt should be recalled to the national team having served a five-year ban for spot-fixing, says ex-coach Waqar Younis.

Batsman Butt, 32, was banned along with Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif after spot-fixing incidents during a Lord's Test against England in August 2010.
Amir, 24, is back in the Test team but Asif, 33, and Butt are yet to return.
"He has served his sentence and everyone maybe deserves another go in life," Waqar told BT Sport.
Amir, Asif and Butt were jailed for their parts in the incident in 2010, which saw Amir and Asif deliberately bowl no-balls as part of a betting scam.
Former pace bowler Waqar, 45, was Pakistan coach at the time - and ended his second spell in the role in April after his side's group-stage exit at the World Twenty20.
He says he was "in favour" of left-hander Butt, who returned to domestic cricket in January and made two centuries in a first-class final earlier in December.
"He was playing really well and also he has served his sentence and punishment and I feel personally that everyone deserves a go," added Waqar.
"People are going to have different views. He is a good player, he is playing really well."
