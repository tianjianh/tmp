The structure - made of two huts joined together - was being used as a social room by the Labour Club in Ipswich until its origins were discovered by historian Taff Gillingham.
Now it has been transported to Brook Farm in Hawstead where a Great War Visitor Centre is being created.
It has been rebuilt and will go on show this weekend.
Mr Gillingham discovered it while searching for army huts for his exhibition. It had been earmarked for demolition.
"They (the huts) are rapidly disappearing, 100 years on," he said. "Even in the time we've been restoring this one, and gathering some of the others, we know that plenty have been pulled down.
"We just thought it was really important now, while there are still some left, to gather examples of them and to restore them and put them back up again," he said.
Mr Gillingham said they wanted to hear about more of them, as each is individual and constructed differently.
He said: "The ones we're preserving will be very different, and it will be a proper living archive, if you like, of that really important time."
