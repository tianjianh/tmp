The epicentre of the tremor was detected near Reepham, about five miles (8km) east of Lincoln, at 14:15 BST on Monday.
"People in the area may have heard a bang or felt a shudder for a second or two," said seismologist David Galloway.
Maxine Soroka, of Langworth, said: "I heard it and the house shook, but I had no idea what it was until this morning."
"My parents who live in Reepham said they also heard and felt it," she added.
Lincolnshire Police said it did not receive any reports of damage.
About 250 to 300 earthquakes hit the UK each year, although most go unnoticed by the public, according to British Geological Survey seismologist Mr Galloway.
In 2008, a 5.2-magnitude quake hit Market Rasen - 32,000 times more powerful than the tremor on Monday.
