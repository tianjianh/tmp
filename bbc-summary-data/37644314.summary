Watson, ranked 75 in the world, won three of her four break points but had her own serve broken six times.
She fought hard before the 26-year-old Dane, ranked 53 places higher, won in an hour and 25 minutes.
Earlier, British number one Johanna Konta pulled out of the tournament because of an abdominal strain.
Watson, 24, opened up a 2-0 lead, but a double fault cost her next service game and she was broken twice more in the opening set.
The pair traded breaks in the second, before Watson trailed 4-2 after losing a lengthy sixth game which saw eight deuces.
Watson immediately broke back, but then failed to hold and Wozniacki served out for the match.
