Australia and New Zealand will play their Anzac Test fixture at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday, after a waterlogged pitch forced a postponement on Friday.

Heavy rain in Brisbane also led to the women's Test being postponed.
The ladies' fixture will kick off at 05:00 BST, with the men's match taking place at 07:00 BST (16:00 local time).
"There were a number of considerations for this decision, primarily player safety as well as supporters," NRL head of football Todd Greenberg said.
