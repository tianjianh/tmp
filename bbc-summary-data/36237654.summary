Staff walked out of the jail in Hammersmith and Fulham, west London, on Friday after recent incidents of alleged assaults by inmates.
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "All officers at HMP Wormwood Scrubs have now returned to work and the prison is running a normal regime."
A recent inspection report sparked claims of "Dickensian squalor".
On Friday Mike Rolfe, of the Prison Officers' Association, said there had been a number of assaults on staff and the jail was "flooded with drugs, mobile phones and weapons".
