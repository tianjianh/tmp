[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old was arrested at a business address on Tuesday afternoon.
He was detained on suspicion of "being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism".
The man is being held in custody in a central London police station, while officers search a residential address in south London.
Armed officers were present when the man was arrested, but no shots were fired.
The arrest comes during a period of increased counter-terrorism activity.
Police have been making about one arrest a day in connection with alleged terror offences, and have been conducting hundreds of investigations.
A total of 315 terrorism-related arrests were made in the year ending September 2015, recent Home Office figures revealed - the highest yearly figure on record, and an increase of a third on the previous year.
The data also showed that the number of women and girls being detained had more than doubled compared to the previous year.
