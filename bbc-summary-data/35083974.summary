European Champions Cup: Scarlets licking wounds - Pivac

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac says his team have been left "licking their wounds" after a 43-6 defeat in Glasgow put them out of European Champions Cup contention.

Pivac's side have now lost three games in Pool 3.
Wing Taqele Naiyaravoro ran in a second half hat-trick of tries to earn the man-of-match award.
"He's just big, and on the day guys fell off the tackles, simple as that," said Pivac.
"They'll go away and have a look at that. We're going to have to make sure we go low and put him on the deck."
The two teams meet again at Parc y Scarlets on Saturday, 19 December.
Powerhouse wing Naiyaravoro, who weighs in at nearly 19 stone, made 231 metres with the ball at Scotstoun, nearly three times more than any other player.
The Scarlets missed 31 tackles, many of them on the Fijian-born Wallaby wing.
"After a performance like that, sometimes you have to wait 12 months to rectify it but we've got seven days and we play the same opponents" Pivac told BBC Wales Sport.
"We've got to go away and lick our wounds, I'm not happy with that performance and we need to turn it round pretty quickly."
The Scarlets may be able to field a stronger side in the return, with several players rested or nursing minor knocks.
But centre Michael Collins and flanker Tom Phillips, who was making his first start, will be assessed for concussion.
"It's the nature of the beast, it's a long season. We've got to make sure we're there fighting to the end," said Pivac of his selection.
But the Pro12 leaders now have no chance of progressing in the Champions Cup.
"It's really disappointing with the league form going so well, we're disappointed we've fallen off in Europe," said acting captain Emyr Phillips.
"We've got to play Glasgow again in a short turn-around, so hopefully we can put that right before getting into a big Christmas campaign."
"Everything's going to be about the league now, so hopefully less pressure in Europe and we can rebuild some of that form going back into the league campaign."
The Scarlets have eight wins from nine in the Pro12, going into the Boxing Day derby against the Ospreys in Llanelli.
