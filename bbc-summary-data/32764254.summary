The team said the equipment, worth more than Â£1,300, was taken from outside the man's house in Wavertree, Liverpool, a few hours after it was used in a rescue on Moel Famau on Thursday.
Some of the items taken are clearly labelled "mountain rescue".
A spokesman said the volunteer, a doctor on the team, may be unable to attend callouts until it was replaced.
