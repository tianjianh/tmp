The shop in Belvedere, south-east London, was targeted by a robber wearing a helmet and black clothes on Thursday afternoon.
Nilima Dagar was serving a woman with a young child when the thief entered and pointed the shotgun at her.
The Met said Flying Squad officers were investigating the armed robbery and no arrests have yet been made.
The robber jumped over the till and took the cash while Mrs Dagar, 39, hid behind a safety door.
She said:  "He pulled out out a shotgun from a black holdall, he pointed the gun at me and asked me to open the safe and get the money out.
"I locked myself behind a safety door, so he jumped over and took the money out of the till.
"I was literally shaking".
Mrs Dagar said her children, aged six and 10, were now terrified and did not want her to go back to work.
Returning to the shop, on Lower Road, made her feel "very vulnerable," she added.
"I cannot trust anybody and was looking out the window and at anybody walking into the shop, wondering whether I will be safe."
