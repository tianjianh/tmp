Fifa president Gianni Infantino said "football history" was made after video replays were used for the first time in an international match during France's 3-1 friendly win over Italy.

Video was used when Italy appealed for a penalty after a perceived handball in the box by defender Layvin Kurzawa.
Referee Bjorn Kuipers stopped play while TV replays were consulted and it was decided not to award a spot-kick.
Infantino hopes the technology will be used at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
Trials have already taken place in the United Soccer League - the third tier of football in the USA - and it will also be tested in six other countries in the next two years, including Germany and Italy.
"You could see that the referee stopped play for a couple of seconds and during those seconds the two referees in the truck verified that there was no penalty," Infantino told Italy's Rai TV.
"We've seen football history here," he added. "We're in 2016 so it's about time to try it."
Thursday's match was staged at the San Nicola Stadium in Bari.
