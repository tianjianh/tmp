The small section includes a new roundabout at Craibstone junction and the replacement roundabout with traffic lights at the Inverurie Road/Dyce Drive junction.
The roundabout at the Craibstone junction will connect with a new airport link road.
It opened to traffic on Monday afternoon.
Keith Brown, the Scottish government minister responsible for transport infrastructure, said: "The north east economy needs every stimulus that can be provided and our investment in this project is expected to bring in an additional Â£6bn to the north-east economy and create around 14,000 jobs over the next 30 years.
"We can look forward to the full benefits of these works starting to be realised when the road opens in winter 2017."
