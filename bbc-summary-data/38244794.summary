Olympian Butchart skippers a team that also features fellow Scot Callum Hawkins.
"This is an amazing honour and something I am very grateful to have received," said Butchart.
"It has been a great year for me individually, so it will be a proud moment to captain the team."
Butchart won last month's trial event in Liverpool by eight seconds, ahead of second-placed Hawkins. Andy Vernon, Ross Millington, Dewi Griffiths and Ben Connor comprise the rest of the team.
"I was surprised to receive the phone call asking me to be captain but it was an easy decision to accept it," Butchart added. "We are sending arguably one of our strongest-ever teams to the championships and it is good to see five Olympians in the team."
Fellow Scot Steph Twell races again at senior women's level in Italy, while Josh Kerr makes his bow in the junior men's race.
