Samia Shahid 'honour killing': Suspects held for further 15 days

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The ex-husband and father of an alleged "honour killing" victim have been remanded in custody for a further 15 days by a judge in Pakistan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died in the country in July.
Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel is accused of her murder while her father Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid is being held as a suspected accessory to the crime.
The pair will next appear in court in Jhelum, in the northern Punjab province, on 26 November.
Both were returned to prison following a request by a lawyer acting for Ms Shahid's second husband, Syed Mukhtar Kazim, for more time to review the case.
Neither Mr Shakeel nor Mr Shahid have been formally charged and their lawyers have previously argued there is no evidence against them.
Last month Ms Shahid's mother, Imtiaz BiBi, and sister, Madiha Shahid, were both declared proclaimed offenders in Pakistan meaning police believe they were involved in her death and want to question them.
Arrest warrants were issued by a judge when they did not appear in court.
Police are applying for a red notice - an international alert for a wanted person - from Interpol. The process is expected to take weeks or even months before one is issued.
The BBC understands extradition requests have not yet been made to the UK authorities.
Ms Shahid, a beautician, married Mr Kazim in Leeds in 2014 and the couple moved to Dubai.
Mr Kazim has claimed his wife, who died while visiting relatives in Pakistan, was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage.
Initially it was claimed she had died of a heart attack but a post-mortem examination found she had been strangled.
