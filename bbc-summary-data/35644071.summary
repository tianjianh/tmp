The Dow Jones industrial average fell 188 points, or 1.1%, to 16,431 points.
The S&P 500 lost 1.3%, or 24.2 points, to 1,921.29 points, while the Nasdaq composite fell 1.5% to 4,503.1 points.
Oil prices fell again, with US crude down 4.6% to $31.87 a barrel and Brent crude dropped to $33.27.
Shares in Dow Jones member JP Morgan fell 4.3% after the bank said it would set aside an extra $500m to cover losses from loans to oil and gas companies.
Bank of America slid 3%, while Citigroup dropped 3.4%.
Energy shares were also hit. Chevron fell 4.4%, while Halliburton and Baker Hughes both slipped more than 2%.
Traders said investors remained cautious, with trading volumes far lighter on days the market has risen and heavier on days it has fallen.
That suggested that there was more interest among investors in selling shares rather than buying them.
Ryan Larson, head of US equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management, said: "We aren't seeing the buying interest that you would usually see in a major upward swing in the markets. Although we have come off the bottom, it's still quite volatile out there."
