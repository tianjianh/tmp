Fulham v Tottenham Hotspur

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham have a fully-fit squad for Sunday's FA Cup tie, with Tomas Kalas available after a hip problem.

Former Tottenham youngster Ryan Fredericks is the only absentee as he must complete a three-match ban.
Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino believes Jan Vertonghen could be fit enough to return after missing six games with ankle ligament damage.
Harry Kane suffered a minor knee injury in Thursday's defeat at Gent and is unlikely to be involved.
Guy Mowbray: "After successive defeats at Liverpool and in Belgium, perhaps being relatively close to home will sort out Spurs' away travails?
"Since the end of September, they have won two of 14 away games - form that's put them out of the EFL Cup, the Champions League, Premier League contention (for now) and maybe the Europa League too.
"Manager Mauricio Pochettino has remained calm throughout the 'bad period' so far, but another loss here might change the mood - and it's far from unthinkable against a Fulham team firing in goals galore just as they've dried up for Spurs.
"There have been five goals in each of the last three games at Craven Cottage (all home wins). Another would do nicely!"

Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: "This competition is famous for its surprises. It's a fantastic chance for us, and isn't a moment for us to surrender.
"We don't need any further motivation. I will choose the best XI for the game in front of us. It's one of the top Premier League teams and isn't a time to experiment."
Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino: "We need to assess some players. Harry Kane got a knock in his knee and different players maybe. If we need to refresh the team we will do.
"We will put out a team that aims to win and we will be ready again to compete."
I think Tottenham might struggle to get the job done at Craven Cottage, but I think they will come through a replay back at White Hart Lane.
Prediction: 1-1
