She was found in a flat in Meelmore Drive in the County Tyrone town on Saturday.
A 24-year-old man has been charged with a number of drug-related offences and is due to appear at Enniskillen Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Det Con Una McKenna appealed to anyone who has any information in relation to illegal drugs, to contact police on the non-emergency number 101.
"We know drugs are a real concern for local communities and we understand the misery they can cause to communities, families and to those who get involved in taking them," she said.
"We will continue to disrupt and arrest those involved in the sale and supply of drugs, bring individuals before the courts and work with communities and partner agencies to reduce the threat of harmful and illegal activity. "
