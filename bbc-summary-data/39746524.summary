Richie Barker: Rotherham approach Charlton to speak to assistant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham United have made an approach to Charlton Athletic to speak to assistant manager Richie Barker.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barker, 41, had three spells with the Millers as a player, scoring 13 goals in 153 league games and is expected to work alongside boss Paul Warne.
He joined the Addicks in December 2016 to join up with Karl Robinson, who he assisted when the pair were at MK Dons.
Charlton have confirmed that Barker and coach Simon Clark will leave The Valley at the end of the season.
Rotherham will join Charlton in League One next season after their relegation from the Championship was confirmed earlier this month.
