The African lions had been hidden away in their den being cared for by their mother, Oshana, at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in California.
But on Thursday Ernest, Evelyn, Marion and Miss Ellen went out to the main enclosure.
Keepers say the cubs follow their mum around at the moment but sometimes run off to play in grass or climb rocks.
