The enclosure at Sea Life London Aquarium, in Lambeth, includes two pools, a waterfall and underwater jets.
The penguins were moved to Edinburgh Zoo in February while their London home was refurbished.
Some of the group remain in Edinburgh to raise chicks born at their temporary Scottish home.
Jamie Oliver from Sea Life London Aquarium said: "Whilst they were up there, they had a successful breeding season. They've all laid eggs and the chicks have now hatched and there's no way we'd want to split the chicks from their parents."
