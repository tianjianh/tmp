Euro 2016: Scotland 1-0 Georgia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland kick-started their European Championship qualifying campaign with a deserved, if far from emphatic, win over Georgia at Ibrox.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A powerful shot from Shaun Maloney was saved but then struck Akaki Khubutia to spin into the net for an own goal.
Soon after, an effort from captain Scott Brown deflected narrowly wide.
Georgia failed to test David Marshall but Scotland could not add to their lead, with Giorgi Loria saving from Steven Naismith and James Morrison.
Having lost their Group D opener in Germany last month, Scotland could ill afford a slip-up and set a high tempo, with full-backs Alan Hutton and Andy Robertson eager to get forward.
Brown, favoured for the captaincy with Darren Fletcher on the bench, and Morrison eagerly took turns to win possession and press forward from midfield.
Temuri Ketsbaia's visitors, already beaten at home by the Republic of Ireland, were organised in defence and held firm for almost half an hour but rarely ventured forward.
Hull City's Robertson impressed with a series of early crosses for Steven Fletcher, but whether the Sunderland striker was rusty after a lengthy absence from first-team football or simply too eager, he strayed offside too often.
With Naismith driving them forward from a role behind Fletcher, Scotland's dominance was eventually rewarded - albeit rather fortuitously - when Maloney's low drive was parried by Loria against Khubutia and bounced over the goal-line.
With relief palpable around Ibrox, Naismith had a powerful crack at goal saved, and minutes later his marginally heavy touch from an eye-catching lay-off by Fletcher cost Scotland the chance of a well-worked second.
An energetic run down the right and cut-back into the box from Hutton - another player performing with renewed vigour - caused mayhem in the visitors' defence, the ball finally falling for Brown, whose shot from 18 yards was deflected a whisker wide.
And it was Hutton's combative play that won possession and fed Naismith inside the box in one of the second half's early chances, though Loria saved well from the bustling Everton forward.
Ikechi Anya increasingly found space on the left and was crudely brought down by Murtaz Daushvili when he raced in on goal to meet another exquisite Fletcher lay-off.
For all Scotland's possession, however, chances were not being converted into a bigger lead and, when a long ball over the top allowed Nikoloz Gelashvili to hare in on goal, the home fans held their breath - but the striker blazed over.
With 13 minutes remaining, Fletcher again set up Naismith with a lovely back-heel but the first-time shot was dragged across the face of goal.
Morrison then went close with a drive from eight yards, while at the other end substitute Irakli Dzaria almost made Scotland pay when he scuffed a shot wide of Marshall's goal.
