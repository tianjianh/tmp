[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 2-2 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamal Campbell-Ryce's fortuitous late goal rescued a point for Barnet in their draw with Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Campbell-Ryce's 88th-minute cross was misjudged by Crawley goalkeeper Glen Morris and drifted into the top corner as the Bees hit back twice to avoid a second successive defeat.
Rhys Murphy's deflected shot was cancelled out by Simeon Akinola's spectacular first Barnet goal before Enzio Boldewijn put the visitors back ahead.
Crawley enjoyed a bit of luck for their 31st-minute opener when Murphy's shot from 12 yards took two deflections on its way past Benjamin Buchel.
But Barnet were level eight minutes later as Akinola produced a brilliant overhead kick from Campbell-Ryce's cross.
The Bees were behind again nine minutes after the break when Elliott Johnson was caught trying to shepherd the ball back to Buchel, only for Boldewijn to outmuscle him and slot home.
The home side pressed on for an equaliser with both Akinola and right-back Charlie Clough going close.
And they were eventually rewarded for their pressure when Campbell-Ryce's cross found its way past Morris.
Emergency loanee goalkeeper Buchel was required to make a brilliant low save in stoppage time to earn a point for Barnet, who have still not won at home since 2 January.
