Aberystwyth University's Pantycelyn halls' closure threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Halls of residence for Welsh-speaking students at Aberystwyth University have been threatened with closure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The university has recommended accommodation at Pantycelyn is closed at the end of this academic term.
It said the move was part of a bid to make Pantycelyn "fit for purpose" and said the building would still be used for Welsh language services.
But it is unclear how long it could be closed for.
The latest recommendation was made by the university's finance committee on Friday after "lengthy, rigorous" discussions.
Alternative Welsh medium accommodation could be made available on its Penglais campus from September, the committee said.
The recommendations will now be considered by the university's council in June.
The decision comes after students campaigned to save the halls of residence in April 2014.
Miriam Williams president of the UMCA - Aberystwyth's student union for Welsh speakers - said: "Yesterday's meeting reminds me of the situation facing Pantycelyn residents in 2005, when the University had plans to turn the hall into offices.
"This regression is unacceptable. Pantycelyn has been, and should remain as a Welsh-medium halls of residence."
Bethan Williams from Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (Welsh Language Society) said the university had betrayed the Welsh language and its students.
"What value do they place on the Welsh language? The halls are one of the few Welsh language communities left in Wales. We will not let them do this," she said.
"The University's senior officers have tried to deceive students - they are not suitable to hold public office. Our local branch in Pantycelyn will discuss what we will do to support the campaign to ensure the halls stays open as student accommodation next term."
Pantycelyn has traditionally been where Welsh-speaking students stay at Aberystwyth University, and where Prince Charles spent a term as a student in 1969.
