Arsene Wenger: Arsenal boss predicts use of video technology

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger believes video technology will be used in games to assist the offside rule.

Video technology trials in matches were put back at least 12 months by the game's lawmakers in February.
But Wenger, whose side had a goal controversially ruled out for offside in Monday's 0-0 draw with Liverpool, said: "I'm convinced that video technology will come into football.
"The next step will be to help the offside rule."
The Frenchman, who takes his team to Newcastle for a 12:45 BST kick-off on Saturday, added: "You want justice and the right decisions to be made. The sooner it comes in the better. If it was tomorrow morning you would have my signature."
Replays showed that Wales international Aaron Ramsey was onside when he struck against Liverpool at Emirates Stadium.
The 24-year-old has suggested football should follow rugby's lead on video technology, saying: "You see on the screens, they go up there for 20 seconds and they get the decision right in the end and football can learn something from that."

Centre-backs Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny missed the Liverpool game, through illness and a back injury respectively, with Calum Chambers and Gabriel starting against Liverpool.
Wenger admitted that he may once again be without his first-choice pairing, with Mertesacker still suffering from his illness and Koscielny set for a fitness test on Wednesday.
"The less likely to be fit is Mertesacker," said Wenger. "I would like them to be available but that is part of the season and you cannot complain about it.
In more positive news on the injury front for Arsenal, striker Danny Welbeck is nearing a return following a knee injury and midfielder Jack Wilshere, who suffered a hairline fracture to his right ankle in training on 1 August, is not far behind
"Danny Welbeck is progressing well," revealed Wenger. "He should be available after the international break if all goes well.
"Jack Wilshere is maybe one week behind Welbeck. After the international break he can certainly come back into full training."
The transfer window closes at 18:00 BST on Tuesday, 1 September but Wenger admitted that the club are not currently close to making any signings.
"I am always confident that a last-minute solution is available because of the way the transfer market has been moving in the last four or five days," he said. "But at the moment I can't promise that.
"We work hard and I have a team around me who work day and night to find solutions but at the moment we are not close to signing anybody."
Arsenal have failed to score in both of their home games this season, with Monday's stalemate coming after an opening-weekend 2-0 defeat by West Ham.
They did score twice in their only victory so far - at Crystal Palace - but Wenger feels his side are not yet at peak fitness.
"Maybe we are not firing on all cylinders at the moment and not everybody is ready physically," he added.
"By definition, the finishing is cyclical - finishing qualities come and go and you do not always know why.
"At home at the moment, we want it so much that we try to force it. But teams come and defend very deep when we are at home and it is more difficult to open the defence."
