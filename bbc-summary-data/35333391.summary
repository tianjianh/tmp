[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers have been urged to travel with care in icy conditions after snow swept through parts of Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Overnight temperatures dropped to -11.8C (10.8F) in Kinbrace in Sutherland and were close to -10C in other parts of the Highlands.
Snow could clear at lower levels, as milder air pushes in from the west, with the odd wintry shower possible.
The big freeze came as Scotland's snowsports centres are marking Sunday's World Snow Day.
