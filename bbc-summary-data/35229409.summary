Sian Blake, 43, played Frankie Pierre in the show between 1996 and 1997.
She went missing from her home in Erith with Zachary, eight, and Amon, four, last month. Her silver-beige Renault Scenic was found in Bethnal Green, east London, on Sunday.
Scotland Yard's Homicide and Major Crime Command is leading the search.
Police said this was due to concerns about the family's welfare, although they said the investigation continued to be a "high-risk missing persons" inquiry.
Officers also said they were concerned for the welfare of Ms Blake's partner, Arthur Simpson-Kent, 48.
Ms Blake, who police said suffers from a "serious, life-threatening condition", was last seen on 13 December in Waltham Forest, north-east London.
Mr Simpson-Kent has not been seen since 16 December when officers spoke to him at the family home.
Police said they did not know if the family was still together.
Scotland Yard said the Homicide and Major Crime Command (HMCC) was leading the inquiry and looking into whether the family may have been victims of a crime.
Det Ch Insp Graeme Gwyn said the couple and their children had been missing "for a considerable period of time" and police were growing increasingly concerned.
In particular, he said, police did not know if Ms Blake was "receiving the medication and treatment she requires to keep well".
She was believed to have been in the London area and also has links to Cambridge as well as Colchester in Essex.
Ms Blake is about 5ft 2ins (157cm) tall, of slim build with short black hair, police said. She often wears glasses, but may use contact lenses.
Mr Simpson-Kent is a 6ft 2in (188cm) tall.
