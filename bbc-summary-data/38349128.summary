The arrests were part of a joint operation by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and Dutch Customs (FIOD) officers on Thursday.
The men are aged 36 and 42. A Dutch national was also arrested in the operation.
They remain in custody.
HMRC officers, supported by the PSNI, searched three residential properties and a commercial premises in County Armagh as part of the operation.
A property in County Tyrone was also searched.
Officers seized 30kgs of tobacco, 50,000 cigarettes, believed to be illicit, and 30,000 euros (Â£25,100) in the County Armagh raids. Two vans and computers were also seized.
Steve Tracey, from HMRC, said: "Money laundering facilitates organised crime, and it's something HMRC takes very seriously.
"We use a wide range of tough sanctions and will not hesitate to investigate where money laundering is suspected."
