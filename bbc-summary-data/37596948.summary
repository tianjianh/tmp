Biggar is Wales fly-half while Davies is challenging him for the regular starting spot for the Swansea-based team.
Davies started Ospreys' 46-24 Pro12 win over Cardiff Blues on Friday, with Biggar appearing off the bench.
"We're obviously going to have to share the games and I think that's only going to be good for us," said Davies.
"And I think we both bring something different."
Biggar, 26, is on a dual-contract with Ospreys and the Welsh Rugby Union, who pay 60% of his salary and also limit the number of games he plays during the season.
Davies has started four of Ospreys' six Pro 12 games to date at fly-half with Biggar starting the matches against Ulster and Leinster before his rival returned for the first Welsh derby of the campaign.
Davies added: "It's been brilliant. Biggs wasn't here for the first few games and I just had to play as well as I could and I think, thankfully, I did that.
"I just want to keep the momentum going now and keep playing when my opportunities arise and keep leading the team forward."
Davies also believesrivalries of positions can only assist Ospreys' cause.
"It helps massively and I think we're starting to build a real squad here with some strength in depth," he said.
Ospreys dropped to third in the table as Leinster overtook them to go second by beating Munster 25-14 in Dublin,
Ospreys' European Challenge Cup campaign begins on Friday, 14 October when they host Newcastle in Pool 2, which also includes Grenoble and Lyon.
Biggar said: "We've started this season a lot better so we need to just keep building on our wins and hopefully we'll take that into Europe and see where that takes us in a few months."
