The Foreign Office confirmed it was in contact with Spanish officials regarding the death of a man believed to be British.
Father-of-three Eifion Gwynne, 41, was an electrician who had played rugby for Aberystwyth and Llandovery.
Sources said he had flown to Estepona in the Costa del Sol to attend the funeral of a family friend.
He was killed after being hit by a car, according to reports.
Llandovery RFC president Handel Davies paid tribute, describing Mr Gwynne as "one of the nicest people".
"He is one of those rare people who you feel privileged to have known and a lifelong friend to all who knew him," he said.
"Our heart goes out to his wife and children in their immeasurable loss.''
