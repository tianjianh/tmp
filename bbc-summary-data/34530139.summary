The blaze, on the top floor of the University of Bristol flats in Colston Street, is thought to have started in a kitchen at about 13:00 BST on Monday.
Steve Quinton, from Avon Fire and Rescue Service, said he was satisfied the cause of the fire was accidental.
Nobody was hurt but more than 100 students have had to be rehomed.
Mr Quinton said: "Whilst this was undoubtedly a dramatic and extremely traumatic incident for those involved and affected, thankfully no-one was injured.
"Although the building was badly damaged the presence of the alarms undoubtedly saved lives that day."
Avon Fire Service said the building was unsafe and the street would remain shut for the rest of the week.
