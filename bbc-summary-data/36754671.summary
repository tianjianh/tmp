[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 100 people took part in a demonstration calling for prosecutors to reveal if charges will be brought over the death of a student in police custody.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kingsley Burrell was detained in March 2011 after West Midlands Police attended a disturbance in Birmingham.
Mr Burrell, 29, was taken to a unit in the city and then moved to hospital where he died from a cardiac arrest.
An inquest in May 2015 ruled prolonged restraint contributed to his death.
A year earlier, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute anyone over Mr Burrell's death.
But following the inquest, the Independent Police Complaints Commission asked the CPS to review its decision. No announcement has yet been made.
Saturday's peaceful protest coincided with what would have been Mr Burrell's 35th birthday.
Mr Burrell's sister, Kadisha Brown-Burrell, said: "Justice has been denied. It's been delayed - delayed prosecution, delayed funeral, delayed burial, and now we're wondering if there's going to be any prosecution from the CPS."
She said the wait had been "heart-wrenching" for her loved ones, adding: "It's devastated the whole family, inside out."
Protesters marched from Handsworth Cemetery, where Mr Burrell is buried, to Steelhouse Lane Police Station in Birmingham city centre.
They were joined by members of the Black Lives Matter movement, which had been demonstrating in the city in the wake of the shootings of two black men in America.
The CPS said it was "mindful of the impact this continues to have on the family", adding: "We will be making a decision in due course."
