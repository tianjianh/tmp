Thomas Baker was found badly injured at Stanley Meat Market in the Old Swan area of Liverpool at about 08:15 GMT.
The 44-year-old, from the Everton area, was given first aid at the scene and taken to hospital where he later died.
Mr Baker's family have been informed and a post-mortem is due to take place later, said Merseyside Police, who are carrying out house-to-house inquiries.
It is thought Mr Baker, known as Tommy, had visited Phoenix Gym at the market before being shot as he attempted to get into his car, police said.
Detectives believe his attacker had been waiting outside the gym for about an hour.
He had been parked in a small grey car, next to Mr Baker's black BMW, in the gym's car park, police said.
Following the shooting, the grey car turned right on to Prescot Road towards the city centre.
Liverpool Meat and Fish Market, also known as Stanley meat market, has been sealed off, and officers are looking at CCTV footage taken in the area.
Det Ch Insp Beverley Hyland said: "Our inquiries are clearly at a very early stage, although it does appear that this was a targeted incident.
"I want anyone who saw anything or has information about this case to ring us."
