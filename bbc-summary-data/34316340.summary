Local reports said the man who died was an intruder trying to leave the Algarve property with several items.
The father grappled with the suspected intruder on Sunday morning, while his son helped, reports said. One added the man was alive when police arrived.
Police said it was "normal" for the men to be made official suspects.
Nobody has been detained following the incident at the villa, in the Vilamoura area.
The father is reported to be in his 50s, while his son is said to be aged around 20.
The older man's wife alerted police, reports say. A police source said the family were long-term Algarve residents.
When officers arrived the suspected intruder was alive in a chokehold, but died when police tried to handcuff him, a report added.
The two British men have been made "arguidos"  -  a status in the Portuguese judicial system referring to individuals whom police may reasonably suspect are linked to a crime.
No restrictions have been placed on the family, meaning they are free to leave the country if they choose, the police source said.
The case has now been passed to Portugal's main criminal investigation force, the Policia Judiciaria. A post-mortem will be held to determine the cause of the man's death.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with police in Portugal regarding this incident and our embassy staff are ready to provide assistance if required."
