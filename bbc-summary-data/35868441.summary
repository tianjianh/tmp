Business rates in Northern Ireland 'to be revalued every three years'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Businesses in Northern Ireland are to have their rates bills revalued every three years beginning in 2019, the finance minister has said.

Mervyn Storey said the main business organisations had called for the move.
The last valuation for business rates was completed in 2015, but that followed a 10-year gap.
Decisions on more controversial changes to the system, like ending exemptions for charity shops, are being left for the next Northern Ireland Executive.
Mr Storey said he would like to see the executive keep any increases in rates "at no more than inflation".
"There are no viable alternatives to the existing system," he said.
The Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association welcomed the commitment to valuations every three years.
Its chief executive, Glyn Roberts, said other changes should be "a top economic issue" after the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May.
"With the chancellor announcing last week that many small retailers in England will now be paying no rates at all, the executive has some serious catching up to do," he said.
