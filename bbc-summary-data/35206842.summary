[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flight AI131 travelling to London on Wednesday was flying over Iran when someone on board said they spotted the rodent, reports said.
Passengers continued their journey on a replacement aircraft some time later.
Air India has said that the plane will be disinfected and the presence of a rat was being investigated.
Rats can sometimes get on board aircraft along with food supplies but can be a serious risk if they chew through wires.
