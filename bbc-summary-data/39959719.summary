FA diving ban: What are the new rules for footballers all about?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Football Association rules mean that footballers in England can be punished for "diving" during a match, even after the game has finished.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The rules will start being used from August - the start of the next football season.
Let us explain more.
Not in the pool, but on the pitch! It's a kind of cheating that's been a problem for years.
It's when players fall to the ground, pretending they've been fouled.
It's also known as "simulation".
Catchy, eh?
It's a fancy description for when someone like the referee has been lied to by a player - who has then gained from it, through getting a penalty or getting a rival player dismissed.
If it's believed that something dodgy has happened, then the video footage will be watched by a panel on Mondays.
It'll be made up of one ex-match official, one ex-manager and one ex-player.
That's if all three people on the panel agree.
The Scottish FA has a compliance officer who reviews incidents in matches.
They decide whether a footballer should get a punishment or not, although they can appeal.
