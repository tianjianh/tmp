Caterer Entier expands with acquisition of Wild Thyme

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catering specialist Entier has expanded further into the events and wedding market after buying Perthshire firm Wilde Thyme for an undisclosed sum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aberdeen-based Entier already offers services such as facilities management and onshore and offshore catering.
Wilde Thyme will continue to trade under its existing name but will be integrated into the Entier group.
Wild Thyme, which is based near Comrie, caters for corporate events, private parties and weddings.
It operates at more than 40 venues across Scotland and has previously catered for the Ryder Cup and the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.
Wilde Thyme managing director Andrew Hamer, who is a former executive chef at the Gleneagles Hotel, will continue in his role together with the existing chefs and event management teams.
Entier chief executive Peter Bruce said: "This is truly an exciting opportunity - at a time when bad news is prevalent in our area we have some positive news to share.
"This not only enhances and complements our existing service but positions us strongly within this market across Scotland."
He added: "Separately, both Entier and Wilde Thyme are perfectionists and focused on the pursuit of five star service and food quality, so this acquisition represents the perfect blend for our two companies and is a natural fit."
