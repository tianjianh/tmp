A man who seriously injured five people when he crashed his car at a "cruise" event in Peterborough has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Francis was attempting to "drift" in his Mercedes at the event on 8 August last year when he lost control, ploughing into the spectators.
Several other people suffered less serious injuries in the crash, Peterborough Crown Court heard.
Francis, 21, of Lambeth Walk, Stamford, pleaded guilty to six dangerous driving offences and was jailed for 18 months.
He was also disqualified from driving for two years.
Police were called at about 23:30 BST to an industrial area in Stapledon Road, Orton Southgate, where hundreds of people had gathered, the court was told.
Francis was arrested charged with five counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and one count of dangerous driving.  He pleaded guilty to all the charges.
The car he was driving was made subject of a forfeiture order by the court.
PC Paul Nisbet, who investigated, said: "This was an horrific crash for those injured and for the many people watching and it is only luck that no-one was more seriously hurt or killed.
"The case should send out a clear message that those taking part in illegal events of this kind run a significant risk of being seriously injured, or worse, and if you happen to be driving, a prison sentence.
"We will continue to treat these events seriously and do whatever we can to prevent them happening in the first place."
