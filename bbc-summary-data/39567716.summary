Talal Alkassab, 39, hired the Lamborghini Gallardo in July 2015 but, within hours, Diyaa Lababidi had lost control and crashing into shops.
At Southwark Crown Court, the pair were jailed for four months each.
Restaurant manager Alkassab and club promoter Lababidi, both of west London, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
The supercar hit several bollards before ploughing into the shops, just after midnight on 23 July 2015, causing more than £100,000 of damage.
The two men then ran away, abandoning the car at the scene.
Alkassab, of Holland Park Road, Holland Park, told his friend not to report the incident to police as his insurance would not cover it, the court heard.
Lababidi, of Praed Street, Paddington, was not insured to drive the car at the time.
Alkassab initially told police a stranger had taken his keys, unbeknown to him, and crashed the car while parking it.
However, the story fell apart after detectives uncovered text messages between the pair.
Judge Deborah Taylor said Lababidi had been driving "fast and negligently" and they had then "decided to tell lies about it" to try to get themselves out of an expensive situation.
Prosecutor Richard Job said: "It is plain that attempts were made to pay off the property owners whose building was damaged in the course of the incident."
The court also heard civil claims are being pursued for the cost of the damage.
Lababidi was given an eight-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months for failing to report the collision and was disqualified from driving for six months for driving without insurance.
His licence was also endorsed and he was ordered to pay £714.13 compensation to Westminster Council for damage to the bollards, £85 prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
