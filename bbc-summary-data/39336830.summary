The ceilings in all the rooms collapsed in the smash and engineers had to be called in to make the building safe.
The bus was in collision with a car before it hit the property on Keresley Road, in Coventry, near to a roundabout at about 07:00 GMT on Monday morning.
No-one was seriously hurt and the owners are not thought to have been in at the time.
West Midlands Fire Service crew commander Peter Sheppard said the crash had "knocked the building off its footing", causing the house to move "a couple of inches".

The next door neighbours felt the effects of the crash. Jasmit Kapoor told the BBC she heard a "bang bang" and was very shocked.
"We opened the curtain and there was a bus inside the house," she said.
Bus passenger John Tate said his only concern was for the welfare of the bus driver.
"My main thought was the driver, was he alright. I was a bit scared for him, more than for me...I was walking so I knew I was alright."
The driver suffered a minor injury to his knee.
Emergency services moved the vehicle from the side of the house later that morning.
Only "a handful" of people had been on board.
In a statement, National Express Coventry said staff were "co-operating closely with the authorities in their investigations into this incident".
