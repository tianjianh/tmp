Scot Knox won his first Tour title in Shanghai last week and carded a second successive round of 65 to move into contention for another tournament win.
Overnight leader Graeme McDowell had a round of 70 as the Northern Irishman dropped to joint third with Knox.
Fathauer carded a bogey-free, five-under 66 to move into the lead.
The American is trying to become the sixth consecutive first-time winner on the PGA Tour.
Knox hit seven birdies and a bogey in his round, while McDowell failed to replicate the form of his impressive eight-under 63 in the second round.
His round included a double bogey, two bogeys and five birdies as he aims for his first PGA Tour win since 2013.
