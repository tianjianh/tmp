[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 0-0 AFC Wimbledon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swindon's League One survival hopes took a blow after they were held to a goalless draw by AFC Wimbledon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The point to extend the Robins' unbeaten run to four games leaves them 22nd in the table, but moves them to within two points of safety after Bury were beaten by Rochdale on Thursday.
Wimbledon's Tom Soares could have seen red in the 24th minute after his high boot forced John Goddard off the pitch with blood pouring from his head.
The Dons should have taken the lead in the 30th minute when Tyrone Barnett was gifted a chance but he scuffed his effort into the hands of Lawrence Vigouroux.
Goddard returned shortly afterwards and almost gave the home side the lead when his curling shot from outside the area forced Joe McDonnell into a fingertip save.
Swindon's Bradley Barry tried his luck from long range in the 77th minute, but his stinging shot went just over the crossbar.
Jake Reeves almost won it in the final moments for the Dons when he broke free on goal but he fired his effort straight at Vigouroux.
