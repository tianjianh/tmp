Sir Elton, who has two sons with David Furnish through a surrogate, posted on Instagram that everyone should boycott Dolce and Gabbana following the comments.
It wasn't long until the #BoycottDolceGabbana hashtag was trending on Twitter.
While most of us can't afford their clothes in the first place, the very people who can are getting pretty heated.
It was in an interview with Italian magazine Panorama that the fashion designers said they didn't agree with the idea of gay families.
Domenico Dolce said: "You are born to a mother and a father - or at least that's how it should be.
"I call children of chemistry, synthetic children. Rented uterus, semen chosen from a catalogue."
Ricky Martin has six-year-old twins Matteo and Valentino born via a surrogate. The singer opened up about his sexuality after becoming a dad.
And it's not just the rich and famous making their voices heard.  People with children born through IVF have been posting family pictures across social media.
Stefano Gabbana has now said "it was never our intention to judge other people's choice".
"We do believe in freedom and love," he added.
