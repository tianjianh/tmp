Ryanair has cancelled more than 250 flights across Europe so far, including at least 26 flights in and out of Dublin and Shannon airports.
Easyjet cancelled 118 flights, with two between Belfast and Paris included.
Aer Lingus flights EI522 Dublin to Paris and EI523 Paris to Dublin on Wednesday have both been cancelled.
Air France has cancelled Wednesday afternoon's AF1816 flight from Paris to Dublin, as well as its AF1817 Dublin to Paris service.
Ryanair's cancellations at Dublin airport include flights to and from destinations in France, Spain and Portugal.
George Best Belfast City Airport said it did not expect its flights to be affected by the industrial action.
Customers have been advised to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport.
Irish state broadcaster RTÃ‰ said all other Aer Lingus flights between Ireland and France are scheduled to operate.
"We will notify customers through all available communications channels should this situation change," an Aer Lingus spokesperson said on Tuesday night.
In a statement, Ryanair said: "We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption."
The company added: "It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French ATC [air traffic control] workers."
An Easyjet spokesperson said: "We can assure our passengers we are doing everything possible to limit the inconvenience of this strike on them."
Air traffic controllers in France are due to go on strike on Wednesday.
The SNCTA union of air traffic controllers told the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGCA) that the strike would take place on Wednesday and Thursday.
The DGAC said "disruption is expected over the whole country".
It requested that companies cancel 40% of flights as a preventative measure.
Further strike action is planned between 16 and 18 April and 29 April and 2 May.
