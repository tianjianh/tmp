[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 2-3 Tranmere Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Andy Cook netted a late winner as Tranmere struck back to edge a five-goal thriller at Chester and move second in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side took charge early on thanks to James Alabi's penalty after Michael Ihiekwe brought down Evan Horwood - although TV replays suggested the offence occurred outside the box.
The 22-year-old former Stoke youth player smashed the spot-kick past goalkeeper Scott Davies into the top corner for his 14th goal of the season after just five minutes to hand the Blues the lead.
Rovers started the second half the stronger side and Adam Mekki - who replaced the injured Jake Kirby in the starting line-up - was unfortunate to see his effort saved.
But Mekki's team-mate Jay Harris made no mistake 10 minutes in as he slotted his long-range shot under diving goalkeeper Alex Lynch to level matters.
Ryan Astles headed Ryan Lloyd's corner home with just over 20 minutes remaining to put the hosts back in front, while James Norwood nodded Liam Ridehalgh's cross in in reply after 81 minutes and a late strike from second-half substitute Cook 20 yards out - his 18th goal of the season - clinched maximum points for Tranmere.
