Tate said there had been 143,000 visits since the revamped and expanded modern art gallery opened on Friday.
On Saturday alone there were more than 54,000 visits - around double the usual visitor number and the highest ever attendance for a single day.
A new extension, a pyramid-like tower called the Switch House, increases the size of Tate Modern by 60%.
The structure, boasting panoramic views of London, was part of a Â£260m redevelopment project.
"We are absolutely delighted that so many visitors experienced the new galleries and performances at Tate Modern over the opening weekend," said Frances Morris, Tate Modern's director.
"Although we have almost doubled the number of regular visitors to the galleries during our opening weekend, we have space for it to feel comfortable even when busy.
"There has been a tremendous response from the public and we look forward to welcoming many more visitors over the coming months."
A weekend of special events to celebrate the opening included a specially-commissioned choral work by artist Peter Liversidge, performed on Saturday by more than 500 singers from community choirs across London.
Tate Modern's relaunch is accompanied by a complete rehang of the gallery's artworks which showcase more than 300 artists from about 50 countries. Half of the solo displays are dedicated to women artists.
