The bodies of two men, aged 22 and 42, were found last week, one in woodland off Fenside Road, Boston, the other at a house in Union Road in the town.
Officers arrested a 17-year-old at a property on Brady Street on Friday on suspicion of possession with intent to supply class A drugs.
He has been bailed until 24 May.
In a statement, the force said the men "had both been involved in the use of heroin and one line of inquiry is that they suffered an adverse reaction to a particular batch".
Lincolnshire Police said the arrest was part of a "wider investigation into the deaths."
