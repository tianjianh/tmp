The Cherries were unbeaten in March - with two wins and one draw - as they moved up to 11th in the table and nine points clear of the relegation zone.
"It feels really good," said Howe, who at 39 is the youngest recipient of the award since Garry Monk in August 2014. "It was such an important month for us.
"The fact we picked up seven points and go unbeaten means everything to us."
Bournemouth are at south coast rivals Southampton in the Premier League at 17:30 BST on Saturday.
Everton striker Romelu Lukaku won the player of the month award for his four league goals during March.
Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend's solo effort against West Brom was voted goal of the month.
