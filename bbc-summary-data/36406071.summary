Euro 2016: Mamadou Sakho could play for France as Uefa opts not to extend ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mamadou Sakho could play for France at Euro 16 after Uefa opted against extending a provisional 30-day suspension for a failed drugs test.

European football's governing body confirmed in a statement that Sakho would be free to play from Sunday.
The Liverpool defender, 26, was banned as a result of a test taken after his side's Europa League last-16 second-leg match Manchester United on 17 March.
Uefa added that a decision on the case will be made within the next few days.
In his defence to Uefa's disciplinary committee, Sakho questioned whether the fat burner-type substance which caused him to fail the test should be on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances.
The decision - by the chairman of Uefa's control, ethics and disciplinary body - not to extend the ban means Sakho will be available to France coach Didier Deschamps for the European Championship finals.
Teams have until Tuesday to submit their final squads for the tournament, which starts when hosts France play Romania on 10 June.
Deschamps has lost Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu to a calf injury, with uncapped Lyon player Samuel Umtiti, 22, added to the national squad as his replacement.
Sakho has not played since Liverpool's 4-0 win over Everton on 20 April.
Liverpool have declined to comment on Uefa's decision.
