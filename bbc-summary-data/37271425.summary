Malta 1-5 Scotland: Willie Miller's player ratings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland could not have got their World Cup qualifying campaign off to a better start as they hammered Malta 5-1 in Attard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Snodgrass scored a hat-trick, with Chris Martin and Steven Fletcher scoring Scotland's other goals.
Malta had cancelled out Snodgrass's early opener through Alfred Effiong, but the Scots improved in the second half and their hosts lost their discipline to end the game with nine men.
With Scotland sitting at the top of Group F after the opening fixtures, former Scotland defender Willie Miller give his marks out of 10 for Gordon Strachan's side.
Hull City's new signing was a bit of a spectator. He had no chance for Malta's goal and had one good save from point-blank range, but the boy was ruled offside anyway.
The Hearts 21-year-old was making his first competitive start for Scotland and, for someone of that inexperience and youthfulness, he did well, getting forward and linking well.
The Hull lad was the best of Scotland's defenders. He got himself into forward positions and had a good chance in the first half, when the goalkeeper was out quite sharp to block his shot.
Both of Scotland's central defenders looked rusty, having not played much for their clubs. Martin lost the centre forward for Malta's goal, when the striker played on his shoulder and got in behind him. The Norwich City man will know he should have done better.
There was an awful lot of barging and clumsy challenges from Newcastle United's summer signing. He got himself dragged out of position and put in the kind heavy challenges that you don't want to give away at international level.
The new Scotland captain was not their most prominent midfielder, but the West Brom man showed a calm head when it was required and linked up well with Barry Bannan.
The Sheffield Wednesday man was the better of the two sitting midfielders. He showed composure and good use of the ball.
You have to give the Hull midfielder top marks considering he has come back from a career-threatening injury, scored three goals and, although he missed one other glorious chance, showed fabulous work-rate, good use of the ball and got into good positions, all while being was asked to play in two positions - wide in the first half and central in the second.
It was the best performance in a Scotland jersey from Newcastle United's summer signing. The quality of his delivery from wide areas and set-pieces was excellent and he was influential in Scotland's victory.
Leipzig's Â£13m signing showed a lot of promise in his competitive debut for Scotland. He is the type of player that defenders will not like to play against. Every touch was positive and, although it was a bit heavy at times, he was a threat. However, he still has a bit to go before being the finished article.
Fulham's summer signing would have got less than 7 if he had not scored. He was a surprise starter up front and was anonymous in the first half. Although he won the penalty for the third goal, there was no touch on him from the defender. However, you have to say that he made an impact by scoring the second goal.
The Celtic winger did not have enough time to make much of an impression.
Sheffield Wednesday's summer signing was perhaps a surprise omission and scored Scotland's fourth goal with a powerful header, but he also missed a sitter, hitting the bar after rounding the goalkeeper, with Snodgrass completing his hat-trick from the rebound.
Derby County's new signing did not have enough time on the pitch to make an impact.
