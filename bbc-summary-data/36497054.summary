Det Insp Shaun Egan, from West Midlands Police, said they believed the man was involved in an "altercation" at a nearby church.
"Holyhead Road is one of the busiest in Coventry and I'm sure there are potentially many witnesses who may have seen the incident or the moments before or immediately afterwards," he said.
