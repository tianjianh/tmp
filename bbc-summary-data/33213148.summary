The bodies of Nigel Henderson, 52, and Stacey Henderson, 35, were discovered at a house in Ruffets Close, Chepstow, on Friday morning.
No-one else is wanted in connection with the deaths, which are being treated as unexplained.
Mr Henderson's family said he would be "sorely missed", while Ms Henderson's relatives said she was "much loved".
On Monday, Mr Henderson's family said in a statement, released by police, that he suffered from a "chronic illness" and his death was "untimely".
"Nigel will be sorely missed by his children, his sister, two brothers and all his friends in Chepstow and his hometown of Bristol," the statement read.
Ms Henderson's family said in a separate statement: "Taken from this life too early, our wonderful and much-loved daughter.
"It is beyond belief and she will be forever in our hearts."
Police were called to the address at about 11:50 BST.
