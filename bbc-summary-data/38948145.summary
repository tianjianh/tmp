The two-time major winner last won at the Tournament of Champions in January 2016.
Spieth carded a seven-under-par 65 in the third round to move to 17 under.
Fellow American Brandt Snedeker (67) is second on 11 under, one ahead of Dustin Johnson and Kelly Kraft, who shot 66s.
Spieth started the day in a share of the lead with world number one Jason Day and American Derek Fathauer on 10 under.
Australian Day had a disastrous start with three bogeys and a double bogey in his opening six holes as he fell away with a three-over 75, while Fathauer signed for a 74.
Spieth meanwhile was delighted with a return to form with the putter as he rolled in eight birdies, five on the back nine.
"I hit my lines," the 23-year-old told Golf Channel. "It's been something I've been struggling with this year.
"I've been striking the ball really well but my third and ninth place finishes were off of very average putting on strokes gained."
