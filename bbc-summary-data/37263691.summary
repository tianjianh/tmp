Stevenage 2-1 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stevenage secured back-to-back wins as Tyler Walker's third goal in two games helped them to victory against Crawley at the Lamex Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old, on-loan from Nottingham Forest, followed up his brace against Hartlepool by grabbing the opener with Jack King doubling the advantage, before James Collins' late consolation.
Crawley made a bright start, Collins firing wide from the edge of the box just three minutes in.
The hosts responded well, with Matt Godden denied by the assistant's flag after sweeping his effort beyond goalkeeper Mitchell Beeney.
Boro deservedly went ahead before the break when Walker escaped the clutches of the defence before arrowing a shot across Beeney.
King pounced to double the lead 10 minutes into the second half. Godden raced clear before cutting the ball back to the midfielder, who coolly slotted home.
Collins capitalised on hesitant defending to pull one back for Crawley with five minutes remaining but the home side held on.
