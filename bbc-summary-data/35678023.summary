Ms Bowden, who is the union Unison Cymru's head of health, was selected from an all-woman short list.
Last month, Education Minister Huw Lewis announced he would stand down after representing the constituency for 17 years.
Earlier this month, the all-woman shortlist drew criticism from local councillors.
