Warwickshire Police said officers were called out from 10:30 GMT in advance of the Blue Square Bet Premier League game between Nuneaton Town and Lincoln City.
British Transport Police and officers from the West Mercia and West Midlands forces helped in the operation.
Officers in riot gear began making arrests at The Granby pub from 15:20. A total of 62 people were detained.
They were taken by coach to Nuneaton police station where they were being interviewed.
Ch Insp Adrian Knight, who was leading the response, thanked his colleagues for their work on what had been a "particularly challenging day", adding: "This operation was a true collaboration utilising resources from across the region."
He went on: "It was important to take a positive approach from the start of the operation and as a result of that approach a significant number of people have been arrested for serious offences and will now be processed.
"Warwickshire Police is committed to protecting people from harm, whether they live in the county or are visiting, and we will not tolerate any behaviour which puts them at risk.
"Anyone intent on causing trouble in Warwickshire should be aware that we will deal with them robustly," he added.
Nuneaton went on to win the game 1-0.
