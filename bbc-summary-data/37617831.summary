[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer "did not turn and look what was coming" before being hit by a bus on Swansea's Kingsway, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, was airlifted to Morriston Hospital after the crash in March 2015, where she later died.
Her eight-year-old daughter suffered minor injuries.
The inquest at Swansea Civic Centre was shown CCTV footage on Tuesday of the moments leading up to when Sgt Lucas stepped off the central reservation.
It heard evidence from her best friend, Karen Williams, who was with her at the time.
Ms Williams said she had decided to go into the city centre with Sgt Lucas and her daughter to do some shopping, and were discussing what to buy as they crossed the first line of traffic.
As they walked along the central reservation, Ms Williams said she saw Sgt Lucas had stepped into the road.
She said: "It all seemed clear... Louise wouldn't have known the bus was coming.
"It all happened in an instant."
She said Sgt Lucas's daughter was "swiped" by the bus and had a graze on her side, and she attended to her before rushing over to help Sgt Lucas who was lying on her back in the road a few feet from the central reservation.
Ms Williams said before stepping into the road Sgt Lucas "did not say she was going to cross, she did not turn and look what was coming".
A new one-way system has since been introduced on Kingsway following a number of incidents.
The inquest continues.
