A man who was killed in a fireworks explosion in Cumbria has been named.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Coates, 41, died alongside Polly Connor, 46, after a shed where the fireworks were stored went up in flames on Saturday.
A display was to be staged at a house in Ecclerigg near Windermere following a wedding earlier in the week.
Inquiries into the cause of the explosion, which is not being treated as suspicious, are continuing.
About 70 people had gathered to celebrate the wedding of local insurance boss John Simpson and his partner Nicole Rothwell.
Witnesses said they heard a loud bang at 15:15 BST, followed by smaller explosions.
The fire spread to a neighbouring shed and parked vehicle.
Police said they were working with the fire service, the Health and Safety Executive and Trading Standards to investigate.
Both victims were from Kendal.
