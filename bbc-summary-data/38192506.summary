[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 2-1 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fleetwood recorded their first ever victory over Walsall at Highbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It took a fine solo effort from Ash Hunter to beat Walsall keeper Neil Etheridge and open the scoring in the 42nd minute.
The Fleetwood striker picked midfielder Joe Edwards' pocket in Walsall's half, raced towards the box and curled the ball into the net as Uwe Rosler's men continued their fine record of scoring in every league game.
Hunter was also involved in Fleetwood's second goal as his curling effort was tipped away by Etheridge but only into the path of Bobby Grant, who rifled the ball home in the 66th minute.
Out of nowhere Walsall pulled a goal back in the 77th minute as George Dobson's 25-yard effort swerved past a crowd of bodies into the middle of the goal to set up a tense finish.
The game ended on a sour note as Fleetwood midfielder Kyle Dempsey was carried off on a stretcher in injury time after coming off worse in a 50/50 challenge with Matt Preston.
But despite the injury blow Town held on and climbed to seventh in the League One table.
