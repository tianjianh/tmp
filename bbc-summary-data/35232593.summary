[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cornwall hospital patient wrongly diagnosed with cancer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital has apologised for wrongly diagnosing a patient with bowel cancer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust said the incorrect diagnosis was given in an automatically generated letter sent in November.
The trust, which has sites in Truro, Hayle and Penzance, said it has changed procedures and the mistake was "the result of an administrative error".
The error was revealed in the trust's board papers. The identity of the patient has not been released.
A trust spokesman said it had apologised to the patient and their family.
The spokesman said: "This was an isolated incident and as a result of the error changes have been made to ensure it cannot be repeated in the future."
