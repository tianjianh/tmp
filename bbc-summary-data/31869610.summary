Kate Moss, Victoria Beckham and Bond star Naomie Harris attended the "Savage Beauty" show at London's Victoria and Albert Museum.
The organisers say they've already sold 70,000 advance tickets to the exhibition - which runs to 2 August.
McQueen was one of the UK's top designers when he took his own life in 2010, aged 40.
He grew up in east London. His dad drove a taxi driver and his mum, Joyce, was a social science teacher.
She died from cancer just nine days before the designer killed himself.
