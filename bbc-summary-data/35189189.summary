An emergency fund to help flood-hit lower league cricket teams has been set up by Yorkshire County Cricket club.

Clubs throughout the region have posted photos on Twitter to show the extent of the damage after the flooding which hit the county on Boxing Day.
Many pitches are completely underwater, with a major repair job required before teams can host games again.
Yorkshire, in conjunction with the England and Wales Cricket Board, say clubs who need help can apply for aid.
In a statement on its website, Yorkshire asks clubs to send information about what is insured, which damage is repairable, long-term issues and an estimate of the bill to fix them.
The ECB, which also provides advice and support for clubs affected, will help with the clean-up operation.
Many cricket clubs throughout Lancashire have also been hard-hit, after more than 200 flood warnings and alerts were issued in the aftermath of the heavy rain which hit northern England over Christmas.
