The 24-year-old Dane came off during Saturday's 2-1 friendly win over Wolfsburg after colliding with visiting goalkeeper Diego Benaglio.
It was a very different side to the one that lost 1-0 in Gibraltar.
Manager Brendan Rodgers said: "He's OK. He has spoiled his good looks for a few days, but he is fine."
"There was obviously a clash of heads and he's a bit swollen below the eye," he added.
Rodgers brought on 18-year-old Kristoffer Ajer to play alongside Eoghan O'Connell at the heart of the defence on Saturday.
Following an early deflected strike from Wolfsburg defender Paul Seguin, goals from Callum McGregor and substitute Ryan Christie gave Rodgers' side a win over the German Bundesliga visitors.
Midfielder Nir Bitton missed the game with a hip flexor problem.
"He was in a lot of pain yesterday," said Rodgers. "We didn't have to risk him and we will see how he is for Wednesday."
However, Rodgers insisted that he is more than covered in that area of the pitch as Stefan Johansen has shaken off an ankle complaint.
"He should be able to train on Monday," the manager said of the Norwegian. "He has had an injection in it which has settled it right down.
"The idea is he will make the first steps on Monday and we will see how he is for Wednesday.
"I don't need to worry about losing a midfield player. I think we have another 20 to pick from."
