Mickey Harte: Tyrone rebuff manager's request for immediate deal extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyrone's county GAA board have turned down Mickey Harte's request to grant him an immediate contract extension from beyond 2017 to the end of 2018.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harte's current two-year term is due to come to an end at the conclusion of next season.
Last month, he asked for a further one-year extension but in an unexpected twist on Tuesday night, Tyrone officials did not agree to his request.
This season, Harte guided Tyrone to a first Ulster SFC title since 2010.
Tyrone's provincial success ended a losing sequence at the hands of Donegal as they earned a two-point win in the decider but the Red Hands' hopes of further glory were dashed when they were beaten by Mayo in the All-Ireland quarter-finals.
Prior to the Mayo defeat, Tyrone had produced an eight-month unbeaten run in 2016, also winning the Football League Division Two title, the Dr McKenna Cup and the O Fiaich Cup.
Harte is already the longest serving football manager in the country.
He took over late in 2002, and led the county to its first All-Ireland title in his debut season, adding further Sam Maguire Cup triumphs in 2005 and 2008.
Sean Cavanagh is the only remaining link with the maiden All-Ireland in 2003, but his future remains uncertain.
Cavanagh has yet to decide whether to commit to the 2017 season but has revealed that he is reconsidering his decision that this was to be his last year playing inter-county football.
