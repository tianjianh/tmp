She said she saw "a crowd of people hanging around a lit-up aircraft further into the airbase".

He said he would not comment further "due to the nature of the exercise".
Paul Shanley, 51, who lives just outside Kemble village described the booms as "very disturbing - worrying".
"There was an enormous explosion - really deep explosion - it was enough to wake up my daughter," he said.
Mr Shanley, who lives just outside Kemble, said his family had heard similar booms "three times before this but we've never got to the bottom of what it was".
He said when he went outside to look there was "a lot of action going on over at the airfield" but when he rang police asking what was happening he was told "they weren't allowed to talk about it".
Angie Abingdon posted on Facebook: "Our house shook! There were concerned people standing outside after the first. I think we should have been given some warning."
