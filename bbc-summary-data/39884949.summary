[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicestershire and Northants claimed one point each after their One-Day Cup game at Grace Road was rained off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Duckett was bowled first ball but Richard Levi (59 not out) and Rob Newton (55 not out) helped Northants reach 121-1 before rain interrupted.
The players left the pitch at 15:00 BST after a heavy downpour, but were able to return at just over two hours later with the game reduced to 36 overs each.
But only 20 more balls were bowled and the game was abandoned at 19:15 BST.
The draw leaves Leicestershire two points outside the third qualification place with five points, while Northants remain in eighth place with just one win from seven matches.
