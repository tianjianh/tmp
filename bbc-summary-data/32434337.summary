[SN]TITLE[SN]
Beryl Larkin's caravan home to be demolished in Treuddyn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 71-year-old woman faces seeing her caravan home demolished after a long-running dispute with Flintshire council planners.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beryl Larkin has lived in her field at Treuddyn, near Mold, for 19 years.
The council said she has twice been prosecuted for failing to comply with an enforcement notice dating back to January 2001.
The former nurse said a council letter advises her to remove her possessions by 9 May for the bulldozers to move in.
She said she was told she could make her own arrangements to remove the caravan rather than have it flattened.
Mrs Larkin said she was taking legal advice and hoped the council would have a change of heart.
She said she cannot understand why the council will not grant her personal planning consent so she can end her days in the home she loves.
Planners said she made no attempt to comply with the prior enforcement notice and, in October 2013, the planning committee resolved that direct action should be taken.
The council said it had sought voluntary compliance but Mrs Larkin has been reluctant to cooperate.
