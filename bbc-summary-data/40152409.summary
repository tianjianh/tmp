A small chartered plane landed at Traigh Mhor beach runway with the 14-year-old's coffin at about 12:45 on Sunday.
Her parents Roddy and Marion were on board.
Eilidh was among 22 people who died in the terrorist attack at the Ariana Grande concert on 22 May.
Her friend Laura MacIntyre, a fellow pupil at Castlebay Community School on the island, was also seriously injured in the bombing at Manchester Arena. The 15-year-old is still in hospital in Manchester.
On the arrival of the plane, Fr John Paul MacKinnon performed a blessing over the casket, which was draped in the green and white flag of Barra.
A procession of six firefighters and two other groups of men carried the coffin across the sand to the hearse.
Piper Duncan Nicholson, the son of Eilidh's piping tutor Donald Patrick Nicholson, led the procession with three slow airs she had been learning.
They were Mull of the Mountain, Sine Bhan and Leaving Ireland.
Donald Patrick, 76, who taught her since she was eight years old, said: "She was brilliant, a fantastic girl. It's devastating. I've known her since she was in primary school."
Her body has been taken to the family home in Castlebay.
A crowd of around 50 people were at the airport to observe the ceremony. About two dozen vehicles followed as the family made its way home.
Eilidh's funeral is due to take place on Monday at the Church of Our Lady, Star of the Sea in the village.
