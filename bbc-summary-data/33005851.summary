Adult mental health services in Wales are being boosted by more than £8m from the Welsh government.

More than half the cash will be spent helping dementia patients, including occupational therapy and activity support for older people which spot checks had highlighted as concerns.
Psychological therapies and women with postnatal depression will also be given extra funding.
An extra £7.6m for child mental health services was announced in May.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the investment showed the government's commitment to mental health services.
The announcement came as a row continued over failings in treatment on the Tawel Fan mental health ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital, branded in a damning report as amounting to "institutional abuse".
