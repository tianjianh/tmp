The Scottish 400m hurdler won a ballot of the GB squad, beating defending world champions Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford to the role.
"I was completely shocked when I found out but it's really special," 30-year-old Doyle told BBC Radio 5 live.
"It means so much more because my team-mates have chosen me. I was so honoured."
The World Championships take place from 4 to 13 August and a 78-strong team will be representing Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Doyle was part of the 4x400m GB team who claimed bronze at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.
She also represented Britain at the London 2012 Games and Scotland at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
"I have been fortunate enough that I have been at a home Olympic Games and a home Commonwealth Games," added Doyle.
"I will just try to draw on those experiences of what it meant and how we performed at those championships and use that to, hopefully, get the team fired up for London.
"Even just watching the World Para-athletics Championships, you can see what that stadium and atmosphere does - I don't think we will need too much motivation to go out there and perform well."
All the members of the squad voted for who they wanted as team captain - previously someone was selected by the performance director.
The decision to change the method of selection was made in order to "give the athletes empowerment".
"It will also bring the whole team closer together, because it is something they have all decided upon and had a say in," said Neil Black, UK Athletics performance director.
"It will give the captain a stronger voice and strengthen the post. It shows that the management and coaches have a deep-rooted trust in the athletes."
The initial squad was named on 11 July and will be finalised on Tuesday.
Four-time Olympic champion Farah is aiming to defend the 5,000m and 10,000m titles.
The 34-year-old has not been beaten over either distance at a major championships since 2011.
Laura Muir, who recovered from a stress fracture in her foot earlier this year, is also looking to achieve double success on the track in London having qualified for the 1500m and 5,000m.
Katarina Johnson-Thompson has been selected for both the heptathlon and high jump and heads into the championships in good form. The 24-year-old broke her heptathlon personal best in Gotzis in May and holds the British record in the high jump.
World long jump champion Rutherford, who won Olympic gold at London Stadium in 2012, is in the squad despite currently recovering from an ankle ligament injury.
