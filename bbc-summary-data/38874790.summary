Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes expects "a fight" to secure the runners-up spot in the Scottish Premiership.

The Dons moved above Rangers into second on goal difference on Saturday.
"There's still a lot of football to play, but the table is probably what we thought it would be like," said McInnes after his side beat Partick Thistle.
"There's no surprises. We always felt we were going to be competitive and, as long as we're there in 15 games' time, that's all I'm concerned about."
McInnes' men, who have finished second in the last two seasons, beat Thistle thanks to second-half goals from Jayden Stockley and Ryan Christie.
Meanwhile, in Glasgow, Rangers drew 1-1 with Ross County and the Ibrox side and the Dons now trail Celtic by 27 points.
"There's still a lot of football to play, but we recognise we're in a fight," McInnes said.
"Celtic were going to be ahead of others if they played to their potential.
"A lot of our players are playing, individually, well, but I'm fortunate I've got different players available to suit what's needed.
"We've a settled team, but it's important to stress the ability and capability of the rest of the squad because they're team players, but they're itching to play their part."
Rangers fans voiced their discontent following the Ibrox side's draw, which followed a 4-1 loss to Hearts on Wednesday.
Manager Mark Warburton said: "They are going to boo. They expect Rangers to win at home.
"I thought the support were generally good in the second half. I don't think they can accuse the players of not giving everything in the second half. It was wave after wave going forward."
Jon Toral set up Lee Wallace's equaliser for Rangers, cancelling out Alex Schalk's opener.
The on-loan Arsenal midfielder said: "We need to win these types of games, we know that.
"It is a big club. Everyone expects to win every week and we have to do that and we have to perform at the levels to win the game.
"Obviously we haven't in the last two and we are very disappointed about it."
