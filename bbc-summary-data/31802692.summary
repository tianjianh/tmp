Crufts 2015: Why Irish Setter Jagger may have been poisoned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The apparent poisoning of a dog at Crufts has led to speculation about who could have done it and why.

It's thought the Irish Setter died after eating scraps of beef laced with poison given to him in a holding area while he was waiting to compete.
Jagger finished second in his class behind another dog owned by Aleksandra Lauwers and Jeremy Bott.
Mr Bott thinks the person responsible could have had a grudge against dogs, or Crufts itself, but doesn't think another breeder would have targeted his animal.
Mr Bott also told a dog magazine that Jagger could have been the victim of mistaken identity, saying his Champion Irish Setter, Thendara Pot Noodle, which won its class, may have been the intended target.
Ms Lauwers says Jagger died in her son's arms after returning to Belgium at the weekend.
So why was a dog targeted at this year's Crufts?
The stakes can be high at dog competitions.
Although the best in show winnings are only Â£100, breeders can make thousands more from the puppies of successful dogs.
The offspring of champions can sell for more than Â£1,500 per puppy.
Sponsorship, TV roles and appearances can bring in extra cash.
Shortly after last year's Crufts, thieves broke into a house in East Yorkshire and stole five Chihuahuas, including Xena, who had been named best Chihuahua puppy at the show.
The dogs were found abandoned several days later, more than 100 miles away.
But there are big costs involved in showing dogs, including paying for a handler, transport costs, hotels, grooming supplies, training, show gear, time off work and show fees.
Less extreme ways of making sure a certain dog wins have been going on for years.
In 1996 a breeder was banned after giving a Chihuahua Valium at another show in Blackpool, the year before.
Other dirty tricks in the past are reported to have included chewing gum being put in the coats of competing dogs and slipping laxatives or tranquilisers into their water.
Owners are even reported to have put females in heat into competition in the past without masking its scent, sending male rivals into a frenzy.
This year's Crufts involved almost 22,000 dogs, 2,987 of them from abroad - three times more than six years ago.
The lifting of the six-month quarantine period in 2001 imposed on dogs and cats coming into Britain opened the doors to more foreign contenders.
France led the pack this year with 377 dogs.
But the mix of foreign dogs, from countries as far afield as South Korea, Malaysia, Argentina and Bermuda, has not been universally welcomed.
Some UK breeders have complained that judges are encouraged to hand awards to foreign entrants to keep up the lucrative international interest in the competition.
The Kennel Club says there is no favouritism towards foreign dogs and has defended the competition's global nature.
The poisoned dog Jagger was based in Belgium.
This year's Crufts was won by a US-bred and Russian-owned black Scottish Terrier called McVan's to Russia With Love, or Knopa for short.
The BBC pulled out of showing Crufts in 2008 after a documentary claimed the pedigree breeding process put dogs' appearances above their health and resulted in high levels of deformity and genetic illnesses.
The show is now televised by Channel 4.
The Kennel Club says it has introduced new standards and stricter health checks since 2008.
Dogs from 15 high-profile breeds including basset hounds, bulldogs and pugs must be checked by vets before their awards are confirmed.
But the event is still targeted by animal-rights groups.
The best in show award on Sunday was disrupted when a supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) ran onstage carrying a sign reading Mutts Against Crufts.
Peta director Mimi Bekhechi said that Crufts' promotion of "breedism" was "the dog or cat equivalent to racism".
Organisers say that there is a place for mutts at Crufts.
Crossbreeds compete in skill and agility competitions, and have their own prize, the Scruffts trophy.
Crufts was founded in 1891, 14 years after New York's Westminster dog show.
