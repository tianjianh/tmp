Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta told Spanish media after the 0-0 draw that the 23-year-old Brazilian was subjected to abuse from a supporter.
Neymar is reported to have told TV station La Sexta: "I did not hear anything.
"It is difficult for things to bother me, I just play football."
Espanyol president Joan Collet said: "I was there, just like 30,000 people and nothing happened.
"The whole thing blows up for one shout, but there was nothing generalised, it's a lie."
