[SN]TITLE[SN]
Altrincham 0-0 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Altrincham fell into the National League relegation zone after a goalless draw against Macclesfield at Moss Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With both sides having failed to win a league game since early January, there were few chances on show.
Macclesfield's Paul Turnbull came closest for either side as his free-kick after 20 minutes hit the crossbar.
Halifax's victory meant the Robins fell to 21st in the table, level on points with Boreham Wood but with a far inferior goal difference.
