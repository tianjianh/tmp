Kanye West launches a new website, but what is it for?

A teaser from the self-titled "biggest rock star in the world" is always bound to get people talking.

Kanye West has tweeted a cryptic link to a site called Yeezy.Supply and a time code counting down to 21:00 GMT on 12 February.
The page contains no other clues about what will happen at that time, revealing nothing more than a ticking clock and an industrial sounding montage of buzz.
So what could it be?
Not completely out of the realm of possibility, but it is pretty unlikely.
The post follows recent collaborations with Paul McCartney and Rihanna on Only One and FourFiveSeconds as well as reported leaks of previously unreleased tracks.
West played FourFiveSeconds at the iHeartMedia Music Summit in January, but, at the time of release, there was no indication of whether it will appear on Kanye's or Rihanna's next album.
But if Theophilus London's Instagram feed is anything to go by, the follow-up to 2013's Yeezus is ready to go.
In October the rapper posted a picture with West and wrote: "I only remember Kanye playing his new album three times in a dark room of 20 people last night and moshing drunk with mad babes."
For all we know he could be planning to follow Beyonce with a surprise release but the use of the word "supply" and a recent announcement from Adidas suggest Yeezy has something a little more commercial up his sleeve.
Well maybe not leather black jeans on, probably leather black sneakers on.
It's more likely that Kanye's countdown is linked to his recent announcement that he'd be partnering with Adidas for a new project after cutting his ties with Nike.
Earlier this week, it was reported that his new trainer collection would launch on 12 February at New York Fashion Week - the day the timer runs out.
It's also no secret that the rapper is big on his fashion, especially trainers.
In THAT interview with Zane Lowe, Kanye said he had dedicated the last 10 years of his life to fashion and that "no-one can say that I don't know how to design a guy's sneaker".
With a level of dedication that saw him being "kicked out of class for drawing Jordans" at school, it wouldn't be much of a surprise if Mr West was excited enough by his own trainer launch to make an entire website and start a week long countdown ahead of the release.
