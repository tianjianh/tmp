Chasing 183, Australia were 83-1 when rain arrived after 16 overs, four overs short of the minimum needed for a game.
It is Australia's second abandonment and they now need to beat England in order to reach the semi-finals.
"The groundsmen perhaps could have had more urgency, but I think they did the best job they could," said Smith.
"I was happy to keep playing through the rain. But the umpires are there to make a decision.
"There was a drinks break at the end of that over which probably didn't help. If the game had carried on perhaps they would have had a different opinion. But to be fair it was raining quite heavily."
Australia's first game against New Zealand at Edgbaston was also abandoned but, on that occasion, Smith said his side "got away with one".
Replying to New Zealand's 291, Australia had been reduced to 53-3 after nine overs when the bad weather arrived.
