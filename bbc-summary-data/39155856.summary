Mr Jenkins worked at the pet shop for about a month in 1992, aged 17, on a youth training scheme.
The former army sergeant was arrested at the time of Mr Brumhill's death but was later released. He was re-arrested and charged in May 2015.
"It's been a long two years. It's been two years of not knowing where you are," he said after his acquittal.
His wife Louise said they send their condolences to the family of Mr Brumhill.
"We hope they do get justice," she added.
Northamptonshire Police said they remain "committed" to forensic developments in the case.
DCI Louise Hemingway, who led the investigation, said: "I'm really disappointed for Arthur's family. They have waited for 24 years.
"There was definitely enough evidence to bring it to trial. It was the right thing to do for Arthur, for his family and in seeking justice.
"This was an awful murder. If we do get any opportunities to investigate [further] we will."
