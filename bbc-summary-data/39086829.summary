[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow 0-0 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sutton goalkeeper Will Puddy helped his side to a goalless draw at Barrow with his second straight clean sheet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Puddy, who joined Sutton last week following Ross Worner's injury and Wayne Shaw's dismissal, was kept busy as Barrow asked the Bristol Rovers loanee plenty of questions.
The 29-year-old did well to deny Richard Bennett and then got a slice of luck when Liam Hughes' follow-up was headed off the line.
Bennett went close again after the break, forcing Puddy into a fine save with a low drive after 63 minutes, before Sutton had Roarie Deacon sent off with three minutes remaining.
