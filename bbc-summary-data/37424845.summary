Valencia sack Pako Ayestaran after losing start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Valencia have dismissed coach Pako Ayestaran with the side bottom of La Liga having lost their opening four games of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ayestaran, 53, replaced Gary Neville last March but the Spanish club have lost eight out of 12 games under his stewardship.
His final match in charge was the 2-1 defeat at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.
Salvador Gonzalez Marco, also known as 'Voro', will take over as caretaker coach for a fourth time.
He was previously put in charge when Nuno Espirito Santo resigned in November 2015.
Ayestaran was Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez's assistant at five clubs, including Valencia and Liverpool.
