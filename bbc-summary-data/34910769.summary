Manon Carpenter, 22, said the thefts from Caerphilly, reported to police on Tuesday, mean she will struggle to train for upcoming events.
In total eight bikes and two motorbikes, some owned by her parents, were taken sometime since Sunday.
Gwent Police is investigating.
Carpenter, who won biking's World Cup Series in 2014, told BBC Wales: "You just feel that you work for something and people think they can just walk in and take stuff.
"Luckily it isn't mid-season or it would have been a disaster, but I'm going away at the end of December so I'll have to sort out something for that."
She said: "Someone is making quite a lot of money," adding: "I am just gutted. We thought our garage was pretty secure."
Anyone with information about the thefts can call Gwent Police on 101.
