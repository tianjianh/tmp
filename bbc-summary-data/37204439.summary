Edjenguele, 29, joins from Veria in Greece while Van der Struijk, 31, was at Willem II in his homeland last term.
"We had to be patient with both these signings," manager Ray McKinnon told Dundee United's website.
"We worked on these deals for a good few weeks and I am delighted to get them on board."
United have taken five points from their four Scottish Championship matches this season, are through to the quarter-finals of the League Cup and host Peterhead in the Challenge Cup on Saturday.
Van der Struijk has spent his club career so far in the Netherlands while Edjenguele has played in England, France and Switzerland. Both have made over 200 senior appearances.
"They will add experience and quality to our squad in an area I have been looking to strengthen. Both will play a part in Saturday's game versus Peterhead," added McKinnon.
