Corden is voicing the lead role of Peter, with Byrne playing the female lead, Bea. Ridley's role has not yet been announced.
The announcement comes in the year that marks the 150th anniversary of Beatrix Potter's birth.
Production begins in January, with the film set for release in April 2018.
The Night Manager star Elizabeth Debicki has also joined the voice cast.
'New audience'
The movie will be a collaboration between Columbia Pictures and Penguin Random House UK.
Penguin CEO Tom Weldon said: "We at Penguin Random House UK are delighted to be working with Columbia Pictures.
"As custodians of Beatrix Potter's brand and legacy, we are excited about the opportunity this production will bring to engage a whole new audience with the world of Beatrix Potter and one of her best-loved characters, the mischievous Peter Rabbit."
Potter is one of the best-known children's authors, with her most famous creation, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, having sold in excess of 45 million copies globally since it was first published in 1902 by Frederick Warne & Co - now part of Penguin Random House UK.
