[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£6m development of Shakespeare's New Place marks the 400th anniversary of the Bard's death.
The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust has transformed the Stratford-upon-Avon world heritage site, which was demolished in 1759.
The playwright purchased New Place in 1597 when it was the largest single dwelling in the town.
Diana Owen, chief executive of Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, said: "We're delighted to be re-opening the most important, permanent Shakespeare anniversary project anywhere in the world.
"Visitors can walk in his footsteps and experience a wonderful new imaginative garden on the site."
New Place reopened to the public after Staffordshire University's Centre of Archaeology dug through the site in Chapel Street.
They discovered a hearth, cold storage pit and even a brewery.
The Bard lived at New Place for the last 19 years of his life.
