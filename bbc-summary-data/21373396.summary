Police hope to seize thousands of pounds from a man who grew cannabis in a freight shipping container buried in his back garden.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adrian James used a mechanical digger to bury the container and he also dug a tunnel from his house to his garden.
Cannabis worth up to Â£86,000 was seized from the container and house in Hungerhill Road, St Ann's, Nottingham.
The 43-year-old was jailed for three years on 29 January and police now hope to confiscate some of his profits.
PC Steve Fenyn of Nottinghamshire Police, who led the investigation, said finding the "sophisticated" set-up was "quite a surprise".
He said: "It would have taken significant time and efforts to dig up the garden, put the freight container in and cover it up, then dig a tunnel into the house."
James had set up hydroponics equipment with timer switches and an automatic watering system.
PC Fenyn added: "The automatic set-up inside the container required very little maintenance from James."
He was arrested in October 2011 after officers searched his home.
He pleaded guilty to production of cannabis at Nottingham Crown Court.
Police are trying to establish how much money James made from the operation.
An application to seize the money and other assets will then by made in court under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
