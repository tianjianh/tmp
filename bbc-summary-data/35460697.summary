[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother who took her toddler son to Syria has been jailed for six years for joining the so-called Islamic State.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tareena Shakil, 26, is the first woman from the UK to return from the self-declared caliphate to be convicted of the offence.
Sentencing her, Mr Justice Inman said she had shown no remorse and had known her son's future would ultimately be "as an IS fighter".
He told Shakil: "You allowed him to be photographed next to an AK47."
Shakil, from Birmingham, but formerly of Burton-upon-Trent in Staffordshire, admitted travelling to Syria but denied joining IS and encouraging acts of terrorism through messages posted on Twitter.
Passing sentence at Birmingham Crown Court, the judge said: "Most alarmingly you took your toddler son to Syria knowing how he would be used.
"You embraced your role in providing fighters of the future."
Shakil posed the boy, who was 14 months old at the time, for pictures wearing an IS-branded balaclava, in what the judge described as one of the most "abhorrent" features of the case.
Mr Justice Inman told Shakil she had "embraced Isis", sending messages on the day she arrived in Syria saying she was not coming back to the UK, telling her family it was part of her faith to kill the murtadeen (apostates) and that she wanted to die a martyr.
He said it was clear she had been "radicalised" following online conversations with prominent members of the terrorist group.
Shakil, who was convicted on Friday, maintained she took her son to Syria, in October 2014, to escape an "unhappy family life".
Shakil flew from East Midlands Airport to Turkey, telling friends she was going on a family beach holiday, before crossing the border into Syria.
But once in the war-torn country, she said became unhappy there too and decided to return of her own free will because she realised she had made a mistake.
She said she caught a bus and bribed a taxi driver to take her part of the way before crossing the border back into Turkey in January 2015.
Sentencing her to four years for IS membership, and two years, to run consecutively, for encouraging acts of terror, Mr Justice Inman said she would be entitled to release on licence after serving half her sentence.
As she was jailed, members of Shakil's family shouted that the hearing was a farce.
Speaking after the sentencing hearing, children's charity the NSPCC said: "This is a deeply disturbing case which could have resulted in tragedy for the toddler involved."
