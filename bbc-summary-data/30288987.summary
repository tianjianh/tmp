[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry Wilkins, 71, was attacked at his flat in Norrington Road, Northfield, Birmingham, in November 2013.
Susan Hughes, 48, was convicted of murder in August. Police said she was overheard attacking Mr Wilkins even as she made a 999 call.
On Monday, a judge at Birmingham Crown Court sentenced her to life.
Det Sgt Harry May said: "In a drunken argument she armed herself with a large kitchen knife and violently attacked Barry in the bedroom.
"Whilst she was attacking him she called the 999 system and whilst on the phone she was heard attacking Barry, physically and verbally abusing him."
During the trial, the jury was told Hughes was overheard by an emergency operator saying "I wish I had stabbed your throat, love".
Hughes, previously of Linley Grove, Kings Heath, used a kitchen knife with a 20cm blade to stab Mr Wilkins, who died on New Year's Eve.
Mr May said Hughes had shown no remorse since the attack.
