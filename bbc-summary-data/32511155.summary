Clevedon Hospital was due to be replaced with a new hospital building at Millcross but was scrapped in 2012 by North Somerset Primary Care Trust.
Candidates have also debated how GP shortages can be tackled and the merging of social care with the NHS.
The debate was broadcast on BBC Bristol on Tuesday evening featuring all five election candidates.
David Derbyshire of the Green Party said: "We have to come back to the idea of building a new hospital in Clevedon.
"There is definitely a case to build a new hospital and if I were MP I would be seeking funding to achieve that."
Liberal Democrat, Marcus Kravis, agreed with Mr Derbyshire.
"You've got to make sure with a new building the systems are in place to make sure it provides the right service that the community wants - we've got make sure it improves the care," he said.
Labour's Gregory Chambers said: "The plans are all there, we've spent money on the site and developing the plans - we should get on and build it."
Dr Liam Fox, the Conservative candidate, said: "I don't think there should be a choice between the new Mill Cross site in Clevedon and the current hospital set-up - we can actually use both.
"We could use a new hospital centre at Mill Cross to be a bridge between traditional medical care and step-down care - sheltered housing for example and use the current hospital for increased diagnostic purposes, particularly things like digital X-ray.
"We should not be faced with a choice of either or."
The candidates for the constituency are:
Gregory Chambers - Labour
David Derbyshire - Green
Liam Fox - Conservative
Ian Kealey - UKIP
Marcus Kravis - Liberal Democrat
