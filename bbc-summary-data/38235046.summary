One of the oldest survivors of the Japanese attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor is due to return to Hawaii on Wednesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the attack.

Ray Chavez, 104, says that he is doing so to honour the dead.
Mr Chavez will join other survivors to commemorate the attack, which killed more than 2,300 people and resulted in the US entering World War Two.
A moment of silence will be held at 07:55 local time at Pearl Harbor.
That is the time when the aerial attack on the base began on 7 December 1941.
Mr Chavez - the oldest known survivor - says he is returning because it is important to honour the sacrifices made by those who died.

Remembering the Pearl Harbor attack 75 years on
"I'm honouring them, not myself," he said.
Mr Chavez had just completed a minesweeping mission when the assault began and was woken in the middle of the night by his wife to be informed that it was happening.
His daughter Kathleen told People.com that her father is in good health and eager to go to Hawaii for the anniversary.
"For many years, he couldn't return, because he couldn't bear it. He never talked about that day," she said.
"But now, he is ready. And now he's so proud to have survived this long and to tell his story so that people don't forget about Pearl Harbor."
