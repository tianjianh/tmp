The jihadists are reported to have addressed the congregation for two hours before disappearing into a nearby forest.
They criticised Kenyan authorities and warned people not to pass intelligence to the security forces.
Last month al-Shabab killed at least 148 people at a university in Garissa.
Police commander Caleb Matoke told The Standard 25 militia took part.
The group is based in Somalia but is also active in Kenya.
Al-Shabab says it has been at war with Kenya ever since Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October 2011 in an effort to crush the militants.
