Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes contests one-game touchline ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derek McInnes has rejected the "offer" of a one-match touchline ban for using foul and abusive language towards an official during Aberdeen's game against Dundee United earlier this month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Aberdeen manager was sent to the stand during his team's 1-0 Premiership win at Tannadice.
A hearing date has been set for 24 March.
Aberdeen moved to within one point of league leaders Celtic on Tuesday night with a win over Partick Thistle.
Celtic, however, have a game in hand.
The Scottish Football Association hearing will consider that, during the game against United, McInnes is alleged to have breached Disciplinary Rule 203: "In that on or around the 37th minute of the above match you committed misconduct and used offensive, abusing and insulting language towards the Match Officials."
