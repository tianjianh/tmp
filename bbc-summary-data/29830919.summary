[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This is how Cardiff city centre will look in the future once a multi-million pound renovation is complete.

At the heart of the development is the new 150,000 sq ft (13,936 sq m) BBC Wales headquarters which will move to the site of the bus station in 2018.
The Capital Square development includes a new walkway from Cardiff Central station to the Millennium Stadium and new offices on Wood Street.
The scheme is being delivered by Rightacres Property.
The new route to the stadium, know as the Millennium Walkway, has been designed to cope with large numbers of people for busy events such as Wales rugby internationals.
Rightacres chief executive Paul McCarthy said: "Once we knew we could handle 35,000 people exiting the southern gates of the Millennium Stadium in under 20 minutes we knew the area could handle 7,000 people per hour on a normal day at peak times."
Plans for Wood Street include space to accommodate a metro, should it be built.
