Hampshire have announced the signing of Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal for the latter part of the 2013 season.

The 35-year-old will be one of the side's overseas players during August and September when George Bailey is likely to be involved in Australia's Twenty20 squad against England.
Ajmal previously played county cricket for Worcestershire in 2011.
"He is one of the best bowlers in the world in all forms of the game," said Hampshire manager Giles White.
"He will add real quality to the squad at the business end of the season."

Ajmal was the scourge of England at the start of the year, taking 24 wickets to help Pakistan to a 3-0 Test whitewash against England - who at the time were ranked number one in the world - in the United Arab Emirates.
And he proved similarly effective during his spell at Worcestershire two summers ago when he picked up 17 wickets in three first- class fixtures, including match-winning figures of 6-124 against Sussex,  and 16 in eight Twenty20 appearances
Though nominally an off-spinner, much of Ajmal's success has been attributed to his variations, particularly his use of the doosra and subtle changes in speed and flight.
"I am very pleased to be joining Hampshire to play in the County Championship," said Ajmal.
"I have always enjoyed playing in England and look forward to playing my part in helping Hampshire get promoted."
