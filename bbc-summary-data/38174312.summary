'Jihadi Jack' parents plead not guilty to funding terrorism

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parents of a Muslim convert dubbed "Jihadi Jack" after travelling to Syria have pleaded not guilty to charges of funding terrorism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Letts and Sally Lane are accused of sending cash to 20-year-old Jack Letts, who was suspected of joining so-called Islamic State in 2014.
The Oxford couple, of Chilswell Road, allegedly sent their son Â£1,723 between September 2015 and January.
They denied three counts of funding terrorism at the Old Bailey.
Ms Lane is also charged with two counts of attempting to send payments of Â£500 on 4 January, but was not asked to enter pleas.
Mr Letts, 55, and his 54-year-old wife, were released on bail and are due to go on trial in London on 9 January. It is expected to last up to four weeks.
Jack Letts was suspected of being the first white Briton to join the terror group after he left his Oxford home and travelled to war-ravaged Syria in 2014.
He reportedly now goes by the name Abu Mohammed and married an Iraqi woman with whom he has a son, Muhammed.
