The Jim Clark Museum already has planning permission for the site in Duns in the Scottish Borders.
It has £1.3m pledged towards the £1.6m required to secure the project.
The latest backer of its crowdfunding appeal is former World Rally champion Louise Aitken-Walker, who lives in Duns.
Scottish Borders Council has pledged £620,000 towards the museum celebrating the achievements of two-time Formula One world champion Jim Clark, with a similar sum coming from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Planning permission has been given, subject to the work starting in the next three years.
It is hoped the development could be completed by 2018 - the 50th anniversary of Clark's death at Hockenheim in Germany, aged just 32.
The driver was born in Kilmany in Fife, but raised in the Borders, and was crowned Formula One world champion in 1963 and 1965. He won a total of 25 grand prix races.
