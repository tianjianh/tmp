The council has reviewed the service following a "significant reduction" in users over the past five years.
An option to end the current meals on wheels and direct users to alternative providers was backed by cabinet on Monday.
They include The Food Shed which works in partnership with HMP Parc in Bridgend to deliver freshly cooked meals daily.
The council's meals on wheels service delivers hot meals at home for people who are unable to cook for themselves.
It currently delivers about 45 meals each weekday, compared to an average of 112 in 2012.
Cabinet member for housing, social care and health, Councillor Bronwen Brooks said the fall has been down to a "growing choice of other meal providers" which offer "greater flexibility and choice".
She said the meals on wheels service ran at a financial loss and cost the social services department £50,000 a year.
Cabinet agreed to discontinue the service and direct its customers to alternative options such a The Food Shed.
The Bridgend-based social enterprise has developed a partnership with HMP Parc, which sees the prison produce freshly cooked meals at a cost of £4.75, which includes delivery by drivers employed by The Food Shed.
A report before cabinet said: "From initial discussion with The Food Shed, this organisation is keen to extend its current operation into all areas of the Vale of Glamorgan and currently has capacity to do so."
Ms Brooks said: "Arguably this will be an improvement upon the service we provide as it can operate every day of the week, is open to anyone who wants it, and is freshly prepared.
"For the council it will allow us to protect spending and direct it to some of the more critical areas of adult social care."
