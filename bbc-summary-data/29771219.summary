Ms Cahill claims she was raped as a teenager by a suspected IRA member and said she was later interrogated by the IRA who covered up what happened.
Mr Adams said there was no doubt that Ms Cahill was caused great distress and was entitled to truth and justice.
Speaking in Belfast, he said he did all he could to support Ms Cahill and that Sinn Féin had acted in good faith.
