West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis says the club will "surprise people" with more signings after a poor start to the Premier League season.

The Baggies followed their opening 3-0 defeat by Manchester City with a goalless draw at Watford on Saturday.
The Â£12m signing of Zenit St Petersburg striker Salomon Rondon broke the club's transfer record last week and Pulis is looking to add further.
"If we can do the business we're trying to do, we'll surprise people," he said.
"Last year the main priority was to stay up - this is a season of change."
Rondon made his first appearance at Vicarage Road and Pulis praised the Venezuelan after giving him his debut off the bench.
"He's going to be a good player for us," Pulis told Sky Sports. "He's got everything in the locker that you would want from a striker, and his work ethic is first-class.
"His goalscoring record says he'll score goals - what we've got to do is make sure we get the people in who will provide the service that he needs."
