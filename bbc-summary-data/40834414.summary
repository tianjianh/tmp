Scotland's Russell Knox is a shot further back after a one-over-par 71 on a rain-interrupted day at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio.
Walker went round in 65 to take a two-shot lead from overnight leader Thomas Pieters, who carded a level-par 70.
Heavy rain saw play suspended for a time but everyone finished their round.
After the weather cleared, McIlroy chipped in for birdie from the rough behind the green at the par five 16th, following a wayward approach, to ensure he ended under par for his round.
"Once we got back out there after the delay, I think everybody felt a little flat," said  the Northern Ireland player, who was playing his first tournament since splitting with caddie JP Fitzgerald.
"I didn't help myself by missing a few chances as soon as we came back out. Luckily, I found one birdie coming in,"
