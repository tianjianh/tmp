[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 3-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe were knocked off the top of League One as Southend came from behind to claim a richly-deserved victory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Iron took an early lead when centre-back Murray Wallace headed home but the visitors shipped goals to Marc-Antoine Fortune, Simon Cox and Ryan Leonard as they conceded top spot to Sheffield United, and their woes were compounded late on by Neal Bishop's dismissal for violent conduct.
It had all started so well for Graham Alexander's men, who initially seemed on course for a fourth successive league win when Murray nodded into a gaping goal in the fifth minute after Southend goalkeeper Ted Smith had failed to deal with a deep free-kick from Duane Holmes.
But the Shrimpers hit back to equalise in the 39th minute when Fortune headed home Cox's left-wing cross from close range.
Southend took the lead in the 76th minute when substitute Jermaine McGlashan sprinted down the left wing and delivered a low cross, which was fired home from close range by Cox.
And the home side then sealed their win in the 81st minute when Leonard poked home a left-wing cross from Ben Coker as Phil Brown's side surged into the play-off places.
Scunthorpe's afternoon finished on a dismal note as Bishop was dismissed for kicking out at Jason Demetriou.
