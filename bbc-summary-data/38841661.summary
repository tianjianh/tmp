The partnership said its warehouse in Leith was "no longer suitable to support our growing business".
It is now consulting with the 78 partners affected, ahead of the planned closure this autumn.
John Lewis said it was creating 40 new jobs in Glasgow by "consolidating work" at its distribution site in Lister Street.
It added that redeployment would be offered to staff "wherever possible".
In a statement, the company said: "We are currently speaking to partners about how we can use existing capacity in our distribution sites to make sure our network can be more efficient, while maintaining our high standards of service for customers.
"Our site in Leith is no longer suitable to support our growing business, and by consolidating work in our more modern facility in Lister Street, it will enable us to run a more productive model.
"Our partners are at the heart of our business and we will be listening to their views through consultation on this matter in the coming months."
