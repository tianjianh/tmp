Fran Kirby scored the only goal at Wheatsheaf Park, with Booth saying: "We were undone by a moment of brilliance.
"We knew they would have a lot of the ball, we knew they would be dangerous on the break.
"But my players stuck to the game plan and proved to me how deep they can dig. As a unit we were excellent."
Goalkeeper Lee Alexander thwarted the English league and FA Cup winners with some good stops, while Kelly Montgomery volley over from the visitors' best chance.
"I couldn't have asked for any more from my players," enthused Booth. "They were up against some of the best players in the world, I think.
"Chelsea have a fantastic front line and they have some seasoned pros but we more than matched them at times."
Looking ahead to the return leg in Airdrie on Wednesday, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker admitted City would need to take more risks in attack to reach the last 16.
"I'm satisfied with the result," he said. "We're still in this.
"We know we can be disciplined and sit in. But if we want to get through to the next stage, we'll need to come out and play a bit more.
"I'm really looking forward to the game."
