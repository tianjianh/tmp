Worcester stand-off Tom Heathcote has signed a new, undisclosed-length deal with the Premiership club.

The three-times capped Scotland international, 25, arrived at Sixways from Bath in the summer of 2015, but he has missed the second half of this season through injury.
"Tom is an extremely competent fly-half who enjoyed a fine maiden season," said Warriors director of rugby Gary Gold.
Meanwhile, long-serving flanker Sam Betty is to retire at the age of 30.
Betty, who signed from Cornish Pirates in 2011, has made 120 appearances for the club, the highlight coming in the promotion-winning Championship season in 2014-15, when he scored 18 tries in 22 appearances.
But he has had few first-team chances over the last two seasons, having been hampered by injuries and, taking his lead from Andy Short, he has opted to retire from rugby at the end of the season when his Worcester contract expires.
"Sam embodied the true meaning of the word 'warrior'," said Warriors head coach Carl Hogg. "He has produced whole-hearted performances every time he has pulled on the blue and gold shirt."
"As with all players, I have experienced some real highs and lows during my time at the club," said Betty. "But our Championship play-off final win against Bristol in 2015 is something that will live with me forever."
