Defender Carl Magnay is one of 11 players to leave Gateshead this summer after not being offered a new contract by the Conference Premier club.

Magnay, Colin Larkin, Jack Lester and Liam Hatch depart despite playing in the play-off final defeat by Cambridge.
In addition Ryan Noble, Josh Walker, Luke O'Brien and Jordan Holt will leave on the expiry of their current deals.
Three players who ended the season out on loan - Adam Boyes, Joe Tait and Richard Brodie - also exit.
Gateshead-born Magnay, 25, joined the Tynesiders in January 2012 following his release by Premier League side Chelsea and went on to make 67 league appearances.
He was a regular under both Anth Smith and then Gary Mills last term, scoring two goals in 34 games.
"Would loved to have stayed," Magnay posted on Twitter.
He added: "I didn't negotiate or try getting a few extra quid. Just not in the plans. Look forward to a challenge.
"It's been a pleasure Gateshead. All the best to the club and the fans."
However, Gateshead have offered new deals to the remaining members of the squad - all of whom are out of contract this summer.
