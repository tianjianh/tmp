Police in Mexico have arrested more than 250 people for looting shops and barricading roads amid protests over a rise in petrol prices.

The government raised petrol prices by up to 20% on 1 January as part of a gradual, year-long price liberalisation.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the increase was "a necessary measure".
A litre of premium petrol now costs 18 pesos ($0.85; Â£0.70) in Mexico City.
Following the price hike, the average price of a gallon of petrol is almost as much as the daily minimum wage.
The raise has caused outrage among people dependent on petrol for their jobs such as taxi, lorry and delivery drivers.
Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said 23 shops had been looted and almost 30 barricades set up in the capital.
There were also protests in surrounding Mexico state and in Hidalgo and Michoacan, to the north and east of the capital, and the port city of Veracruz.
"These acts are outside the law and have nothing to do with peaceful protest nor freedom of expression," Deputy Interior Minister Rene Juarez said.
Environment Secretary Rafael Pacchiano defended the price hike in an opinion piece [in Spanish] published in the Excelsior newspaper.
He said Mexico's subsidies had led to the country becoming the world's fourth largest consumer of petrol and had caused environmental damage.
