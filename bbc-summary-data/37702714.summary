London's mayor has accused the government of "dithering" over deciding whether to build a new runway at Heathrow or Gatwick airports.

The government will announce next week which site it would prefer to expand, but a final decision will not be made until 2017-18.
Sadiq Khan said the uncertainty was bad for businesses struggling with Brexit.
But the prime minister has defended the process saying there had been "no delay" over the plan.
A "full and fair public consultation" will be held following the announcement, before a final decision is put before MPs.
Heathrow Airport also insisted there had been no delay, citing an "expected and appropriate political process". Gatwick said the process was what they had expected.
But Mr Khan said: "Now more than ever businesses need certainty and stability in order to make investment decisions.
"Instead they are getting dither and delay.
"Now it's time to get on with building a new runway at Gatwick, which can be built quicker, cheaper, and without the years of legal and political battles that Heathrow clearly faces."
Prime Minister Theresa May earlier told the Commons during Prime Minister's Questions the subject had been "debated, discussed and speculated on for 40 years."
"This government will take a decision. But there is then a formal process that has to be undertaken so that the government will identify its preferred option of site. That will then go to a statutory consultation.
"The government will then consider the results of the statutory consultation and bring forward an airports national planning statement on which this House will vote."
