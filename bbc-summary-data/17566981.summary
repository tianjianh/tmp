[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The service at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle was held for the royal women, who both died 10 years ago.
The Dean of Windsor, the Right Reverend David Conner, also praised their "faithfulness to the nation".
Members of the Royal Family, led by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, attended the private service.
The Queen Mother died in her sleep on March 30 2002, aged 101, while her daughter died the previous month aged 71, after suffering a third stroke.
In his introduction, the dean said: "Each of us here this morning will cherish some special personal memories, memories that awaken once again sentiments of affection and respect."
At the end of the service, senior members of the Royal Family were led to the King George VI memorial chapel where the remains of the King, his wife and their daughter are interred.
A prayer written by Princess Margaret was read.
Also in the congregation were the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, the Princess Royal and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence.
The Duke of York was joined by his daughters, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and the Countess of Wessex.
Princess Margaret's children, Viscount Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto, were also in the congregation.
The Queen Mother's official biographer William Shawcross and horse trainer Nicky Henderson also attended, as did playwright Sir Tom Stoppard and actress Felicity Kendal, who were both friends of Princess Margaret.
