[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington repeated their Challenge Cup semi-final win over Wakefield with another comfortable victory over Trinity in Super League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A fortnight on from their 56-12 win at Leigh, Wire ran in another seven tries.
Trinity scored after four minutes through Jonny Molloy, but Wire responded with first-half tries from Ben Currie, Chris Hill and Ryan Atkins.
Matty Russell then scored twice after the break, while Daryl Clark and Joe Westerman also crossed.
Kurt Gidley kicked five of his seven goals for an individual 10-point haul as the Challenge Cup finalists responded to a narrow home defeat by St Helens to go second in Super League.
Judah Mazive pulled a try back after the break for the hosts, whose other points came from Liam Finn's first-half conversion.
Warrington's 38-10 win leaves them one point behind leaders Hull FC, who have the chance to pull three clear again when they host Catalans Dragons on Thursday.
Wakefield travel to Widnes on 21 August hoping to notch a first win since the regular season ended, but they travel with optimism after a spirited display.
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester:
"We didn't get beat on effort. We caused Warrington some problems in the first 40 minutes but came up with silly errors in key parts of the game and conceded two soft tries before half-time.
"However, we gave it everything and came up short. I wanted a reaction from the Wigan performance and I got one,
"Our young kids really stood up again and James Bachelor deservedly got our man of the match. Max Jowitt probably needs a rest but with the injuries we've got at the minute we had to juggle a few things around."
Warrington head coach Tony Smith:
"It wasn't the prettiest of games and we played our part in that. There wasn't a huge crowd and there wasn't the same type of atmosphere as when we last met.
"But it was important to come and put in a solid performance. I never thought at any stage we would lose. We were never out of control. But Wakefield made it awkward for us in a few periods.
"It was a hot afternoon. I stood out in it for a few minutes and got sunburn, while they are out there whacking hell out of each other, so it was tough for them to handle those conditions."
