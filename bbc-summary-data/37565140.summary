Damir Begmatov, 25, will serve a minimum of 15 years for the murder of Bobir Esanov in Reading on 27 December.
Begmatov claimed to have discovered his housemate dead when he returned to their London Road home in the early hours, Kingston Crown Court heard.
The killer fled to Swindon where he was arrested on 9 January.
The jury at his trial heard the pair had "consumed substantial amounts of alcohol" before Begmatov killed 36-year-old Uzbek national Mr Esanov.
District crown prosecutor Tracey Johnson-Brown said: "This case represents a tragedy for Bob's family and friends who have been devastated by his death.
"I would like to pay tribute to Bob's family, friends and the witnesses for their wholehearted support of the investigation and prosecution."
