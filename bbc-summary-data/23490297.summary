Mikkelsen, who played mayoral candidate Troels Hartmann in cult Danish drama The Killing, will star as Charles Augustus Magnussen.
In Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton, the title character is a blackmailer who extorts money from wealthy nobles.
The Sherlock series stars Benedict Cumberbatch as the famous detective.
Sherlock producer Sue Vertue announced the news of Mikkelsen's role on Twitter on Monday.
The Killing was broadcast by BBC Four in the UK.
Mikkelsen, 49, also starred in the hit show Borgen - his brother Mads starred opposite Daniel Craig in Casino Royale and is currently on TV screens in Hannibal.
Sherlock won three Bafta awards in 2011, including best supporting actor for Martin Freeman, who plays Holmes's sidekick Doctor Watson.
It went one better in 2012, picking up four awards including best writer for Steven Moffat and best supporting actor for Andrew Scott, who played Holmes's nemesis Moriarty.
The first two Sherlock series were equally popular with audiences, with an 7.9 million viewers for the final episode of series two last year.
A transmission date for the third series has yet to be announced.
