After progressing through the academy at Wigan, the 25-year-old had two loan stints with the Vikings before joining permanently in 2012.
He has scored nine tries in seven outings this season, including a hat-trick against Hull FC.
"I see big things in the future and I am excited to be part of it," he told the club website.
Marsh joins Chris Dean, Joe Mellor and Charly Runciman in signing new deals over the past month.
"He has grown with us and year on year he has shown what he can achieve with his hard work and determination," said head coach Denis Betts.
"Stefan's flexibility to play in any backline position is a great supplement to the squad."
