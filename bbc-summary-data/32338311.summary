[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wirral's motorway closes later for 55 hours as part of a project to repair a slip road and install a new bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The work at junction two of the M53 at Moreton will begin at 22:00 BST.
One of the bridges which carry the junction slip roads over the motorway will be removed in preparation for a new bridge deck installation.
The motorway will be closed southbound between junctions one and three and at junction two northbound until 05:00 on Monday.
Highways England said work on the project, which started in February, was due to be completed by early June.
Due to "unforeseen technical issues", however, it is now likely to continue until August.
Drivers are advised to avoid using the Wallasey (Kingsway) tunnel north of junction one and to use the Birkenhead (Queensway) tunnel instead if they are crossing the Mersey.
