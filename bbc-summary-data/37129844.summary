[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicholas Williams' challenge against Andrew Barlow caused the cup match between Cefn Albion and AFC Brynford last October to be abandoned.
Williams claimed it was a freak accident but Recorder Huw Rees called it "shocking violence".
Williams, 26, of Wrexham, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm at Caernarfon Crown Court.
The court heard Mr Barlow broke his tibia and fibula and is still receiving treatment.
Speaking after the hearing, Det Con Rhodri Ifans of North Wales Police said: "This was a particularly callous assault which has had a huge impact on the victim.
"Anyone who commits acts of violence must realise to potential seriousness of their actions and we will vigorously pursue offenders and bring them to justice."
