The 31-year-old first reached the top of the World Squash Association (WSA) world rankings in January 2006.
Although she slipped to number two in April 2006, she reclaimed pole position in August of that year.
Her winning run now includes 77 WSA World Tour titles, a record seven World Championship titles and two Commonwealth Games golds.
"To be the number one in the world for 100 consecutive months is simply remarkable," said WSA chief executive officer Tommy Berden.
"Nicol's achievements are unique within the global sporting community and it's great for the sport to have an ambassador like her."
