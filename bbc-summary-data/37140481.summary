[SN]TITLE[SN]
Everton 1-0 Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ronald Koeman maintained his unbeaten start as Everton manager as his team defeated a Stoke side that remain without a league win this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Everton had efforts from Romelu Lukaku and Ashley Williams cleared off the line before they got a penalty when Williams was tripped by Phil Bardsley.
Shay Given pushed Leighton Baines' spot-kick on to a post but the ball then rebounded off Given's head and in.
Stoke's Marko Arnautovic hit the crossbar, but Everton held on to win.
England manager Sam Allardyce was at Goodison Park and is set to name his first squad since replacing Roy Hodgson for the World Cup qualifier in Slovakia on 4 September.
Allardyce would have been hugely impressed with Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, who produced a man-of-the-match performance.
Barkley, who was in Hodgson's Euro 2016 squad but did not feature in any matches, helped drive Everton forward in a game they dominated.
The 22-year-old midfielder was booked inside the opening 10 minutes, but that did not stop him producing an energetic box-to-box performance that saw him denied three times by Given.
Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross, who won one England cap in 2012, did not do much wrong, nor did Everton defenders Baines and Phil Jagielka.
Mason Holgate, 19, was only making his third Premier League appearance and the England Under-20 international looks a bright prospect for Everton.
He was brave in defence and also attacked when possible, including one link-up with Romelu Lukaku where the Belgian was denied by an excellent Shawcross block.
Stoke have finished in the top 10 in the past three seasons but have now only scored twice in three league games and are bottom of the table.
They can feel hard done by with the penalty decision, which saw Williams fall over after clashing with Bardsley as the pair rushed towards the near post as a corner was being taken from the right.
Nevertheless, it was still a deserved victory for the hosts, who move up to second, with only a fine performance from Given denying them further goals.
However, Stoke could have gained a point when, only minutes after falling behind, Arnautovic's shot deflected off Everton goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg's legs on to the bar.
Stoke opted to pick Peter Crouch after the former England striker scored a hat-trick in their 4-0 win over Stevenage in the second round of the EFL Cup on Tuesday. The forward failed to create any chances, but did produce an overhead kick to clear Williams' header off the goalline.
Ruud Gullit: "He's working hard but looks off-sync. He gets in the right positions and I think it's just a matter of time."
Alan Shearer: "You have to stay strong and have the belief that something will go for you. You have to try to not lose confidence and it will change for him, it is just a matter of time."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman: "If you don't score the second and kill the game then it is always difficult in the last few minutes.
"Today we were not really clinical in the box. We had some good opportunities and need to be more aggressive, but the performance was good, it is a good start to the season and we can build on that.
"Two wins and one draw is very positive, but we can do much better and we need to improve in several aspects."
On the penalty that Everton were awarded, he added: "It is so difficult to analyse that situation. There are enough reasons for Mark Hughes to be angry. If everyone whistles for these situations you would accept it, but one referee does and another one doesn't."

Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "We are disappointed with the award of the penalty. I feared at the start of the season that some teams would not get a fair crack at the whip and that is happening to us. It is a very harsh decision in my view and that is two dubious penalties against us.
"I don't know what the referee has seen in terms of a clash. Ashley Williams is slightly ahead of Phil (Bardsley), ran across his path, there is a clash of legs, he goes down and we are penalised. All we are asking for is consistency.
"We are going to have to consider zonal marking as it is too damaging for us."
The international break means it will be two weeks before these sides are next in action. Stoke will be aiming for their first league win of the season when they host Tottenham on Saturday, 10 September, before Everton travel to Sunderland on Monday, 12 September.
