The Centre for Student Life is part of a multi-million pound investment and will be at the heart of Cathays campus.
It will cover the 1970s students' union building as well as 46 to 49 Park Place.
Construction is due to start in 2017, with the centre set to be completed in time for the 2019-20 academic year.
The centre is a partnership project with the students' union and will be a central hub for student support services.
It will also include a welcome-point for students and the public, a 550-seat lecture theatre, study space and retail outlets.
Vice chancellor Prof Colin Riordan said: "Our students expect world-leading facilities and the Centre for Student Life will meet those high expectations.
"Our students and staff are not the only beneficiaries because this will be a landmark building for the people and city of Cardiff."
Students' Union president Sophie Timbers said it would be "the single biggest investment in the student experience for a generation".
