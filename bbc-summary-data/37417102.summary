Gillingham boss and former Tottenham defender Justin Edinburgh says managing a team against his old club "has always been an ambition" for him.

The 46-year-old spent a decade at Spurs, making 279 appearances, and has been in charge of the League One side for almost 18 months.
The Gills go to White Hart Lane on Wednesday in the EFL Cup third round.
"When it (the draw) came out there were some big cheers in my house," Edinburgh told BBC Radio Kent.
"Once I became a league manager, and once there was a realistic opportunity of me drawing Tottenham in the cup, it was always an ambition and goal, and that's another thing I can tick off my wishlist.
"It's going to be a special moment for me but that will be within myself because it's about the players - but no, I couldn't have handpicked the draw any better myself.
"It's something that I'm looking forward to extremely - it was a big part of my life and my family's life, so I think it'll be a special evening."
Gillingham have gone four games without a win, but have already knocked out a Premier League side away from home in the competition this season, having beaten Watford.
"That's our challenge, to see if we can go and replicate the performance that we produced that night at Watford," added Edinburgh.
"If we can get that balance right and we can stay in the game, the belief will be there because we know that we've achieved that before."
