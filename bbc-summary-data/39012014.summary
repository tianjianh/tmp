[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 1-2 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A stunning Josh Payne free-kick gave Crawley a narrow victory on an emotional day for home club Wycombe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Wycombe player Paul McCarthy died on Monday aged 45 and was remembered before kick-off.
Sam Wood went close to giving Wycombe the lead in the 14th minute, a rasping drive being met with a fine tip over from Glenn Morris.
It was the resulting corner which led to the opening goal, Adebayo Akinfenwa with a back-heel finish from close range.
Crawley responded well and carved out good opportunities, one of which drew a superb point-blank save from Jamal Blackman.
The visitors' pressure told and the Red Devils levelled via a 43rd-minute Joe McNerney header from a corner.
The first action of the second half was a blistering long-range effort from Will De Havilland in the 55th minute which drew a superb save from Morris.
Substitute Payne's 20-yard free-kick six minutes from time was the difference in a closely-fought second half as the Chairboys slipped to a fifth straight league defeat.
