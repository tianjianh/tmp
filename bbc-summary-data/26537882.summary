Police said the student was one of two taken to hospital, but gave no further details.
Witnesses said police used tear gas and batons against around 200 students protesting against escalating violence in the Darfur region.
There has been an upsurge in violence in the region where rebels are fighting forces of President Omar al-Bashir.
Darfur has been wracked by conflict since 2003 when rebels took up arms.
A statement posted on the interior ministry's website on Tuesday did not say how the student had died.
Police "got information that two students were injured and taken to hospital. One of them died," the statement said.
An AFP news agency reporter at the scene said police fired tear gas and beat some of the protesters as they tried to take to the streets outside the university.
Students retaliated by throwing stones. Some chanted: "Peace, peace for Darfur - we want to bring the criminals to the ICC (International Criminal Court)."
Earlier on Tuesday, UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said peacekeepers and aid agencies had been blocked from entering affected areas of Darfur.
On Monday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply concerned about violence in Darfur and he urged all parties to stop hostilities.
The ICC has issued an arrest warrant for President Bashir, accusing him of committing war crimes and genocide against black African communities in Darfur.
He denies the charge.
