European Rugby Challenge Cup: Cardiff Blues v Calvisano

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Warburton and Gethin Jenkins return from injuries to start for Cardiff Blues in their European Challenge Cup clash against Calvisano on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Their returns are a boost for Wales as they prepare for the Six Nations.
National captain Warburton comes in at open-side, while Gareth Anscombe takes over at fly-half from Rhys Patchell, who is on the bench.
Blues can reach the quarter-finals from Pool 3 if they win heavily and other results go their way.
Warburton, who has not played since the World Cup, has recovered from ankle problems.
Anscombe came off the bench in Blues' 34-26 at pool leaders Harlequins in the last round and starts for the region for the first time this season.
Jenkins leads the side and has a chance to press his claim to be Wales' first-choice loose-head prop in the forthcoming Six Nations.
Head coach Danny Wilson has made 12 changes, with Jenkins part of a completely changed pack and recalled Wales wing Tom James back after illness.
Former Wales captain Matthew Rees is set to return from a seven-week ban, imposed for stamping on Harlequins number eight Nick Easter.
Blues beat Italian second-tier side Calvisano 50-9 in November.
Meanwhile, Wales and former Blues centre Jamie Roberts sits out Harlequins' visit to Montpellier in the same group.
The Welsh region need a Harlequins victory to give them a chance of finishing as one of the best runners-up in Europe's second-tier competition.
Wilson said: "A few players deserve an opportunity and they get the chance to impress.
"The outcome of our qualification hopes is now out of our hands, all we can concentrate is our performance and getting the five points we need. We will react to what happens elsewhere."
