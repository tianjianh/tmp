Ceredigion council 'not helping' Awel Deg care home probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ceredigion council has failed to co-operate with an investigation into the closure of a Llandysul residential home, a union has claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unison said the council had failed to provide answers for social care expert Tony Garthwaite, heading the investigation, and that he was not able to complete his report.
Awel Deg care home was shut in February 2014, making 40 employees redundant.
The council said it was working with Mr Garthwaite.
Awel Deg was closed following the suspension of 11 members of staff and concerns about standards of care.
The council said in May 2014 the facility would re-open as a dementia home in spring 2015, but a spokesman said on Wednesday that this could not happen until Mr Garthwaite's investigation was complete.
Jeff Baker, regional organiser for Unison, said the union had written to the council complaining about the wait.
"It is very disappointing," he said.
"Unison understands that Mr Garthwaite cannot complete his report because the council has not taken steps to provide answers to key matters that Mr Garthwaite has put forward."
A council spokesman said it was aware of Unison's comments.
"The council is working with Tony Garthwaite... to ensure that he has access to all the relevant information that he requires in order that he can complete his investigation," the spokesman said.
