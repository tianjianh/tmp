[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former homeless man whose makeshift camp opposite a children's park prompted complaints has been told he faces jail if he repeats his actions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A judge has banned Jonathan Hughes, 48, from an area of Rhos on Sea, Conwy county, using disorderly behaviour and setting up unauthorised camps.
Hughes has since moved into a flat, the court in Llandudno was told.
He received a three-year criminal behaviour order after admitting harassing a seafront cafe worker.
Prosecutor James Neary said police had received 23 separate complaints about his camp in a shelter near the seafront at Rhos Point, including issues about the smell and litter.
He had previously lived rough at Caernarfon, Gwynedd, which had also prompted complaints, the court heard.
Mr Neary said Hughes' behaviour had had an "impact on the community".
Hughes, who represented himself, was given a 10-week curfew between 16:00-06:00 GMT and he was ordered to pay Â£100 compensation and Â£170 costs.
