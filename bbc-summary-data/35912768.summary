Homeowner Sue Abel said she "heard a crack on the other side of the house" at about 00:30 BST on Monday.
The stable - which was empty - had travelled about 50m (164ft) from a neighbouring field, Mrs Abel said.
She told the BBC: "I've never known the winds, in the 10 years I've been here, [to be] at that strength."
Emergency services arrived promptly but the stable was left in place on Monday because the winds were "still quite brisk", she added.
The front of the property suffered some damage, including a number of smashed windows.
