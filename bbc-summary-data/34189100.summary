Speedway rider Darcy Ward faces a long wait to discover "the full prognosis" of his condition after he was injured in a serious crash in Poland.

Australian Ward came off his bike during a meeting on 23 August.
The 23-year-old, on loan to Elite League Swindon from Poole Pirates, was stabilised in hospital and then flown to the UK to continue treatment.
"This is going to be a long haul for Darcy," Poole Pirates manager Neil Middleditch told BBC South Today.
Ward, who recently returned from a 10-month ban after failing a breathalyser test in August 2014, was riding for Zielona Gora against Grudziadz when he clipped the back wheel of a rider in front.
"He went over what we call the high side," Middleditch added.
"Normally, it would be a collarbone-type injury. But, the way Darcy fell was very awkward and he received spinal injuries."
He was transferred to hospital where he underwent a two-and-a-half-hour operation and Ward's parents have been at his bedside daily since he was transferred to the UK, having flown over from Australia.
The last two weeks have also been very tough for Middleditch as Ward has lived with his family since riding in the Elite League.
"It's early days with the injury. In the doctors' words, it's 'angry'," he added.
"We've got to let the bruising and the swelling settle down and then they take a better look and see exactly what the damage is."
