[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Milner, 24, has been with the club for four years and has scored 22 tries in 124 games.
He made 17 appearances last season, scoring three tries as the Tigers finished fifth in Super League.
"The ambition of where this club wants to go has significantly improved over the last two years," Milner told the club website.
"This team is developing and growing all the time, and really building Castleford Tigers into a great club."
Castleford, who drew their opening game of the season against Hull KR, will be without captain Michael Shenton for the rest of the season because of a knee injury.
