[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police searched a property in Cowdenbeath on 29 July as part of an intelligence-led operation.
Several items were found, which expert analysis suggested came from a leopard and a large bear.
The man has been charged under the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations. A report has been sent to the fiscal.
Lindsay Kerr, a wildlife and environmental crime officer with Police Scotland, said: "It is really quite rare, particularly in this part of the world, for someone to be involved in this kind of illegal and very damaging trade.
"However, acting on intelligence, Police Scotland and the National Wildlife Crime Unit carried out a thorough investigation and have arrested a 49-year-old man who is due to appear in court at a later date.
"My advice to anyone who is involved in the illegal sale of protected species is not to take the risk.  It is a criminal offence and we investigate all reports of wildlife crime with the aim of ensuring that those involved in any black market activities are arrested."
