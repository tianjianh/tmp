A Cheshire council leader has called on the government to devolve a greater range of powers to the county.

BBC News understands healthcare, policing and education could feature on Michael Jones's list of requests.
The Conservative leader of Cheshire East Council said: "This is localism first, smaller government and an end to faceless... central government making decisions for us."
Warrington Borough Council Leader Terry O'Neill said the idea was "premature".
In a speech to Cheshire East councillors on Wednesday, Mr Jones said: "I relish the opportunity for smaller central government, a greater involvement in decision-making at a local level.
"I believe we in Cheshire know what is best for Cheshire and that we should have the resources and power to determine where our money goes locally."
He said he would hold meetings with his counterparts at the two Labour-run authorities - Warrington and Cheshire West & Chester Council.
They will be asked about the possibility of an elected mayor covering all three areas, accompanied by a combined authority which would assume responsibility for the devolved powers.
Such an arrangement currently exists in areas like Greater Manchester and Merseyside.
Mr Jones previously caused controversy when he suggested Cheshire should be reunified, with one council covering the entire county, as was the case before 2009.
However, he has stressed that a devolution deal could be done "without boundary changes".
Mr O'Neill said: "The comments from Cheshire East's leader are premature - we have asked for further information and guidance from the government on the potential offer of devolution."
