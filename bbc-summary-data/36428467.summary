Out-of-work manager Paul Lambert says that finding a new job will be "quite seamless" for him.

Lambert, 46, left Blackburn in May and is looking for his seventh managerial job since 2005.
"I'll wait and see. I want to get into it again. I don't find it hard at all to get another job," the former Aston Villa and Norwich boss told BBC Sport.
Lambert, a former Celtic and Borussia Dortmund midfielder, said clubs must "pick up the phone" to hire him.
"It's quite seamless for myself," said Lambert about the process of finding another club. "I can only speak for myself, but I find it no bother at all. There are already one or two things I've looked at."
There were 70 managerial changes across England's top four divisions this season, with a record 56 dismissals - exceeding the previous high of 53 in 2001-02.
League Managers Association chief Richard Bevan descried the figures as "embarrassing".
Lambert - who led Norwich to two consecutive promotions from League One to the Premier League in 2010 and 2011 - says he is looking for another challenge.
He said: "I've worked at some great clubs, but you move on and try to find somewhere else to start a project."
"I don't have any issues of going into a dressing room or taking a club on."
Lambert, who won the Champions League with Dortmund in 1997, thinks his European experience will help him find work in the UK or overseas.
"I'm lucky that I can pick up the phone and have a look at things abroad," said the Scot.
"It depends when someone wants me. They've got to pick up the phone. I want to get into management again."
