The jackets also appear on the iconic album cover of the film's soundtrack.
The comedy drama was directed by Richard Lester and the jackets are from his private collection.
They are part of an auction of more than 200 lots of rare Beatles memorabilia and are expected to be sold for more than Â£50,000 by Omega Auctions in Liverpool next month.
The Help! film saw the group come up against an evil cult and fleeing to the Austrian Alps to seek refuge and Harrison and Starr wore the jackets throughout the five days of filming that took place in the Alps.
Lester, 82, also directed The Beatles' first film A Hard Day's Night.
Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: "As Beatles clothing goes, these have got to be amongst the Holy Grail for any Beatles collector.
"They feature on one of their most recognisable album covers and I have a feeling these could really fly off the block."
The sale, which will also include a large collection of rare vinyl, takes place at Liverpool's Adelphi hotel on 20 March to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of The Beatles' hit Can't Buy Me Love.
