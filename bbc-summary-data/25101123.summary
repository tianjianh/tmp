The 54-year-old won for his portrayal of a teacher with a transvestite alter ego in the Tracie's Story episode of the Jimmy McGovern serial.
The UK also won in the comedy and arts categories at the New York gala, which recognised TV programmes produced outside the US.
French series Les Revenants (The Returned) was named best drama series.
The show, about people apparently returning from the dead in a small Alpine town, was screened on Channel 4 in the UK earlier this year and was picked ahead of Accused in the best drama category.
British comedy Moone Boy, about an Irish boy with an imaginary grown-up friend, gave the UK another of its wins.
"Even in the wildest imaginations of our imaginary friends we never imagined we'd win an International Emmy," said O'Dowd, who co-wrote and starred in the Sky One series. "Such an honour."
UK documentary Freddie Mercury: The Great Pretender shared the award for arts programming with South Korea's Hello?! Orchestra.
Britain's Sheridan Smith, however, lost out in the best actress category to Brazil's Fernanda Montenegro.
Bean's win follows the best actor prize he received for his performance from the Royal Television Society in March.
The first series of Accused received the International Emmy for best drama in 2011 and also saw Christopher Eccleston named best actor.
The honorary International Emmy Founders award was presented to writer and director JJ Abrams.
Abrams took a break from work on the new Star Wars movie to accept the honour for such TV series as Lost, Alias and Felicity.
"I feel genuinely grateful," said Abrams, who paid tribute to both his parents during his acceptance speech. "It's a privilege to work in the television medium."
The ceremony also featured wins for Australian and German TV productions, while Angola and Uruguay featured among the nominees for the first time.
