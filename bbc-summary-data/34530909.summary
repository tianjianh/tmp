The great-grandmother is celebrating her 104th birthday.
Born in Newcastle on 18 October, she says she has had a "very good life".
But, according to her son, Raymond Bethell, she is treating her birthday as "just another day".
"It isn't though," he says.
"How many people have lived through such change?"
On Priscilla's 11th birthday in 1922, the British Broadcasting Company is formed. By mid-1932 the organisation has a new name and a new headquarters at Broadcasting House in London.
Two weeks before Priscilla's 17th birthday in 1928 the latest way of crossing the River Tyne between Newcastle and Gateshead is officially opened by King George V and Queen Mary, who make the inaugural trip in a landau carriage.
The event is reportedly attended by 20,000 schoolchildren, released from school for the royal spectacle.
She will not have appreciated the significance of it at the time but, on Priscilla's 15th birthday in 1926, the guitar-playing African-American singer-songwriter and - let us not beat around the bush - rock and roll legend Chuck Berry is born. She is 47 by the time he writes Johnny B Goode.
Priscilla, who has lived most of her life in or near Throckley, in Newcastle, is one of six children and, after leaving school, looks after her mother while working part time in a general dealers.
Then, aged 25, she marries Walter Bethell, a coal miner, at St Mary's Church, Throckley in 1937, later having two children, Raymond and Don.
Walter dies in 1979.
As Priscilla celebrates her 30th birthday in 1941 Soviet "super-spy" Richard Sorge is arrested in Tokyo, given away by a secret note to his lover found in the street.
Working in Japan during World War Two he uses his job as a journalist as cover. He is tried and hanged in 1944.
Priscilla shares her birthday with world-famous Czech-US tennis player Martina Navratilova. She is 45 when the future legend of the courts is born.
In 1968 Priscilla reaches 57 on the day Beatle John Lennon and his then girlfriend Yoko Ono are arrested on charges of possessing drugs and obstructing the police in the execution of a search warrant. Lennon is later fined Â£150.
Although Priscilla has lived through the first man walking on the Moon, the space shuttle Atlantis is launched on her actual birthday in 1989.
She turns 78 as the Galileo spacecraft is deployed into space as part of America's STS-34 space mission - though she is 84 before it arrives at the planet Jupiter.
But for delays caused by a faulty engine controller, Atlantis would have gone and come back before her birthday candles were even lit.
Emma Keepin, from Brooke House, where Priscilla now lives, says it is "quite incredible" to think she has lived through four monarchs and two world wars.
