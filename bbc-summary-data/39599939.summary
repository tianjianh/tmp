[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a takeaway has been fined £6,700 after an "extensive" cockroach infestation was found in its kitchen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bircan Ozcan of Roe Deer Green, Newport, Shropshire, admitted at Telford Magistrates' Court that his business had contravened food and safety and hygiene regulations.
Newport Kebab House was inspected following complaints from customers and was closed in February 2016.
It was allowed to reopen a month later, after further inspections.
Hilda Rhodes, cabinet member for public protection, safety and enforcement at Telford and Wrekin Council, said: "When our officers visited the premises they saw what they described as an, 'extensive and active' infestation of cockroaches throughout the kitchen.
"During that same visit, the officers saw a customer being served, which led to the business closing."
The council said the owners brought in a pest control contractor following the inspection.
