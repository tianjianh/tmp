The US central bank kept interest rates on hold last month, but the minutes revealed that it was a close call.
They lend further weight to expectations of an interest rate rise by the end of the year.
The Dow Jones and S&P 500 closed slightly higher, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped a little.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day 15.54 points higher at 18,144.20.
The wider S&P 500 index gained 2.44 points to 2,136.73, while the Nasdaq slipped 7.77 points to 5,239.02.
Shares in Apple climbed a further 0.9%. Apple's shares have risen in the past few days on the expectation that iPhone sales will benefit from the problems at Samsung, which has cancelled production of its Galaxy Note 7 after a number of battery fires.
