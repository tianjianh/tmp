Homes plan at Donald Trump Menie golf resort

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning applications for hundreds of homes at Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort have been lodged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Trump Organisation wants to build 850 permanent homes and 1,900 holiday homes at Menie.
It follows applications made last week for a ballroom and a staff accommodation building at the resort.
The businessman previously said a hotel and second course would only proceed if a planned wind farm off the coast was rejected.
Meanwhile, an 18-month refurbishment programme at Mr Trump's Turnberry resort is under way.
The US billionaire bought the course and hotel in Ayrshire last year.
