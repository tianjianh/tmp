Granddad called baby a 'nightmare' day before she died

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his baby granddaughter complained  she had been a "nightmare" the day before she was fatally injured, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, denies murdering Amelia Jones while babysitting in Pontnewydd in November 2012.
On Tuesday, Amelia's mother told Newport Crown Court she had "trusted" Mr Jones with her daughter's life.
She said the baby had previously been "quite distressed" in his care.
Sarah Jones, 26, said her father appeared to have had a difficult evening with five-week-old Amelia when she returned home from a night out with friends on 16 November, 2012.
She said Mr Jones swore and said "Amelia had been a nightmare".
She added: "I didn't think anything of it at the time. I trusted him with my life and my children.
"I had no reason not to. He was my father."
Ms Jones left Amelia with her father at 21:30 GMT the next day, on 17 November, 2012, to go to the cinema.
But she said that within a minute of her sitting down in the cinema, Mr Jones phoned her and said: "Love, love she's not breathing, I can't get her to breathe".
Ms Jones said her street "was lit up with blue" when she got home.
She added: "Amelia was being carried from my front door."
Mr Jones was in tears, saying "I'm sorry", his daughter said.
Amelia was initially treated at the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport, but then transferred to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.
Ms Jones said that when a doctor told her Amelia had a skull fracture she "went into denial" and "thought they had got it wrong".
She told the jury her father said at the hospital: "Whatever you do, don't give up on her, don't allow them to turn her machine off. I'll be there no matter what."
Earlier, Ms Jones told the court Amelia had become "quite distressed" when left in Mr Jones's care in a car during a shopping trip, days before her death.
"Amelia was out of her car seat and sitting on Mark's lap", she said.
"For a normal cry, that wasn't Amelia," she added.
Ms Jones said her father had also made a "shocking" comment a few days before the baby's death, when the youngster's father, Ian Skillern, was leaving the couple's home.
She said it came "completely out of the blue" when Mr Jones said "Even though I don't like her father, I don't hold grudges against a baby".
Ms Jones added: "I was just quite in shock about where that comment had come from."
On Monday, the court heard Mr Jones duped his daughter into thinking he was gravely ill by posing as a doctor in bogus phone calls in a bid to repair their relationship.
Mr Jones claims he dropped Amelia accidentally on the two separate evenings while babysitting on his own.
The trial continues.
