Jim Bentley: Morecambe players need to shed their 'losing mentality'

Morecambe manager Jim Bentley thinks his players needs to shed their "losing mentality" after a poor run of results.

The Shrimps suffered a 2-1 home defeat to local rivals Accrington on Tuesday and have now lost their last five League Two matches to drop to 16th.
The slump comes in stark contrast to an "unbelievable" run of form previously.
"The confidence is a little bit down, whereas in February we had the feel good factor where we couldn't do any wrong," Bentley said.
"We need to break the cycle, even if it's just a point, to get us away from this losing mentality."
Despite a takeover bid causing problems behind the scenes, Morecambe lost just one of 11 games over January and February to ensure their League Two status.
However, they have seen their faint play-off hopes derailed in March, leading Bentley to question his players' recent performances.
"Our confidence is shot at the minute," he explained to BBC Radio Lancashire.
"But you've got to show a little bit more about you, because this game does have the tendency, if you are struggling, to trample all over you.
"First and foremost I want to see a little bit more battle and a little bit more fight out of the players. If we are going to get beaten, I want them to be clapped off the pitch."
Morecambe take on play-off hopefuls Mansfield on Saturday before matches against relegation-threatened Cheltenham and Hartlepool.
