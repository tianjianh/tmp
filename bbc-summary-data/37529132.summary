Malcolm McLaren's body was discovered in the North Lanarkshire town's Clark Street at about 10:25 on Thursday.
Police Scotland said forensic teams have examined the scene and officers were gathering CCTV footage from the area.
They have also been carrying out door-to-door inquiries for any information which could assist the investigation.
Det Ch Insp Paul Livingstone, who is leading the inquiry, said: "Extensive inquiries have been ongoing with specialist officers and forensics teams conducting examinations at the scene.
"We are working to establish a motive for this murder and we are in the process of piecing together Mr McLaren's movements in the days leading up to his death.
"Inquiries so far have revealed that he was in Airdrie town centre around 1500 hrs on Wednesday afternoon before making his way home to Clark Street.
"It's important we establish Mr McLaren's movements from then on, where he went, who he saw, who he met. So, if anyone has any information or was in town centre or Clark Street on Wednesday afternoon, please do get in touch with us. Your information could prove vital in our inquiries."
