Sheringham tidal surge sea defence repairs to cost £804,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council in North Norfolk is set to spend £804,000 to repair coastal defences damaged in a North Sea tidal surge in December last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The west sea wall in Sheringham was built in about 1895 but had become exposed to damage because the beach had eroded and sea levels have risen.
The surge caused 70m of wall to fail, North Norfolk District Council said.
A report for the council said the sea defence repair work will "hold the front line" for the foreseeable future.
The scheme has been recommended for cabinet approval with the proviso that the Environment Agency funding goes ahead.
The North Norfolk coast experienced widespread flooding as the tidal surge came over sea walls.
The Cromer Pier and its Pavilion Theatre were also damaged with the district council picking up the bills for repairs.
