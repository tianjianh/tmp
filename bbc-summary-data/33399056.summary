The blaze in Wadsworth Road, Perivale, began just before 19:00 BST on Saturday.
As flames tore through the two-storey building, a 50m by 20m structure of mixed industrial units, plumes of thick black smoke were visible across London.
About 30 people were evacuated from the warehouse but there are no reports of any injuries.
People living nearby were advised to close windows and doors due to large amounts of smoke produced.
The fire was brought under control shortly before midnight, the London Fire Brigade said.
The cause of the blaze is not yet known.
Vinesh Pomal, 28, who lives nearby, said the fire looked to have "spread to the entire building".
"I can see flames, debris and thick black smoke is just billowing out now as the whole building is on fire. It's just getting worse. I can see the heat from my bedroom window which is quite scary," he said.
"I have never seen so much drama in Perivale before. I have friends from east London messaging me saying they can see it. It's put Perivale on the map for all the wrong reasons."
Station manager Jeff Lisle who was at the scene said: "Crews worked very hard in extremely difficult conditions to bring this fire under control.
"Firefighters used aerial ladder platforms to tackle it from numerous vantage points and to prevent the blaze from spreading to neighbouring warehouses.
"Although not in a residential area the smoke from the fire was travelling quite a distance so we advised locals to keep windows and doors shut as a precaution."
Some 45 firefighters remained at the scene on Sunday damping down the fire.
