Virat Kohli made 235 and number nine Jayant Yadav scored 104 as India thrashed 146 runs in the first session.
England, who spent 14 hours in the field, then slipped to 182-6 at stumps, trailing the hosts by 49 runs.
"When the ball is flying you need to be led by the bowlers and we didn't have that," Anderson told Sky Sports.
"It was probably our worst morning of the whole tour from a bowling point of view and control. We were clawing it back from there."
England's bowlers were easily negotiated by Kohli, who struck 26 boundaries including one six as the spinners finished with combined figures of 8-397 from 118.3 overs.
"You feed off his energy and his mindset. It was a great innings," Jayant said of Kohli's innings.
The tourists' reply began poorly as Keaton Jennings fell for a golden duck, before Alastair Cook was trapped lbw for 18 and Moeen Ali edged to leg gully for a two-ball duck.
Jonny Bairstow's half-century gave England some hope but Ben Stokes and nightwatchman Jake Ball were both dismissed inside the final four overs.
"We have to be positive. There is no point batting for a draw, it does us no good in the series," Anderson added.
