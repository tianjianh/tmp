Jasmine Gregory, of Ulfgar Road, Oxford, had been drinking on the morning her daughter Robyn died in August 2014.
Gregory, 24, said she became distracted while giving the 14-month-old a bath at their home in Grove.
She was convicted by a jury in just over four hours at Oxford Crown Court.
Gregory found the child's lifeless body.
She was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on Friday.
Robyn's father said in a victim impact statement that "every day is torture" since his daughter died.
He said: "She lit up the room, she was the brightest little button you could imagine.
"As a father I couldn't even give her a last cuddle.
"My heart went to the grave with Robyn."
