The 25-year-old has signed a six-month deal at Griffin Park, with the option of a further year.
Jozefzoon joined PSV in 2013 and has made five league appearances for the first team this season, all of which came from the bench.
"Florian is an explosive ball carrier and will bring another dimension to our play," Bees head coach Dean Smith said.
Former Ajax trainee Jozefzoon is Brentford's first signing of the January transfer window.
