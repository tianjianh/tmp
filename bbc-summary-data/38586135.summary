[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman whose body lay undiscovered under rubble for more than 12 years was strangled in a crime of passion, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natalia Wilkanowska, 50, disappeared in 2003 after visiting her ex-husband Gerald Doherty in Luton.
Mr Doherty's brothers, Joseph and Daniel, deny helping conceal her remains and lying to police.
The victim's niece told Luton Crown Court that Joseph believed it to be "a crime of passion".
Gerald Doherty committed suicide in July 2003, about four months after Natalia was last seen by her children when she left her Eastbourne home to travel to Luton.
The couple had separated in 2001 after 23 years of marriage.
Natalia's niece, Allison Diamond-Roberts, told the jury she had later asked Joseph Doherty why his brother Gerald had killed himself.
"Uncle Joe said that he had done something and would have gone to prison for a very long time. I wanted to understand more, but he ended the conversation," she told the court.
Ms Diamond-Roberts said in 2013 she had been to Joseph's farm in Port Glasgow, Scotland to "speak about Auntie Natalia".
"He said it was a crime of passion. My aunt had been strangled. He said my uncle (Gerald) had strangled her."
Natalia's body was found under rubble in Daniel Doherty's garden in Ickniel Way, Luton, in 2015.
Daniel Doherty, 67, of Icknield Way, Luton denies two charges of perverting the course of justice and two charges of obstructing the coroner, by aiding and abetting the concealment of a body and lying to police.
Joseph Doherty, 73, of Old Greenock Road, Port Glasgow, denies perverting the course of justice and obstructing the coroner by giving a false account of her death.
Both men also deny preventing lawful burial.
The trial continues.
