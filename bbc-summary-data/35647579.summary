[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Premiership: Celtic 0-0 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic had no answer to a tireless and buoyant Dundee display as the champions were booed off after seeing their Premiership lead cut to four points.

The visitors were worthy of a point and might have taken all three but Gary Harkins slashed wide late on.
The best players were all in dark blue, with Kostadin Gadzhalov also spurning a chance as he headed over from a corner.
Celtic came closest through Charlie Mulgrew, his shot brilliantly tipped away by Dundee keeper Scott Bain.

But the hosts were booed off after a second successive draw, Aberdeen's 1-0 win at Dundee United narrowing the gap at the top.
The home support was not immediately forlorn, since optimism was evident in the cameos of Patrick Roberts and Leigh Griffiths in the opening stages.
Even if the central midfielders tended to be ponderous, flashes of intent came from Roberts, who has a low centre of gravity and drifting menace that allows him to glide past opponents, and Griffiths, who would shoot at every opportunity.
Dundee were initially subdued, as they looked to establish their organisation and apply their work rate.
It could be considered a weakened starting line-up, since Kane Hemmings, Greg Stewart and Harkins were all on the bench, and Darren O'Dea and Thomas Konrad were missing through injury. Even so, there was no inferiority complex to Paul Hartley's side.
They had moments to endure, with Griffiths driving one effort wide and sending another straight at Bain, who also had to tip over a Mulgrew free-kick from 20 yards.
Dundee, well-drilled and urged on incessantly from the touchline by Hartley, refused to be unsettled.
Nick Ross, Nicky Low and Paul McGowan scurried around midfield closing down space and time, while Julien Extabeguren and Gadzhalov defended stoutly at centre-back.
Bain still had to bundle away a Rogic effort, before Extabeguren had to rush back to clear from Griffiths as the striker broke clear in the penalty area, but these were passing moments in a display that lacked a sense of authority.
Scott Brown and Mulgrew lacked sharpness in midfield, and the whole team looked sluggish as Craig Wighton ran from the halfway line to the edge of the area, cutting inside and out to befuddle Brown and Dedryck Boyata before firing just wide.
That memory would have been fresh in the minds of the Celtic fans as they booed their side off at half-time.
Discontent only grew as the game progressed, not least because Dundee became increasingly self-assured.
Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon had to move smartly to hold a Wighton show low down at his post.
In the final stages, the game became a battle of nerve, as tension and fatigue imposed themselves.
Both sides came close to scoring - Mulgrew's first-time shot on the slide brilliant pushed away by Bain and Gadzhalov inexplicably heading Stewart's corner wide from close range.
Harkins came close again before the end, but Dundee could be satisfied with their night's work and the point gained lifted them to fifth on goal difference above St Johnstone, beaten 2-1 at home by Partick Thistle.
