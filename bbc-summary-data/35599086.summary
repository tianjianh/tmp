[SN]TITLE[SN]
Schools closed as West Dunbartonshire secondary teachers go on strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Secondary schools in West Dunbartonshire were closed on Thursday because of a strike by some teachers over cuts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was the second time in just over a month members of the EIS union in the area walked out over plans to cut the number of principal teachers.
The union has called council proposals to solve the dispute "unacceptable".
The council argues the system it is proposing is similar to one already used in many other places.
In January, all five main secondary schools in West Dunbartonshire were closed after EIS teachers went on their first strike since the 1980s.
The union said the council's new proposals were rejected by 91% of members who voted in a ballot with a 90% turnout.
The EIS said the council's plans were financially driven and would see a cut in the number of deputy head teachers, principal teachers of subjects and pastoral care posts.
The council's plans involve related subjects being managed together in so-called "faculties" with one head.
For instance, a school might have one "head of humanities" in charge of subjects such as English and modern languages.
