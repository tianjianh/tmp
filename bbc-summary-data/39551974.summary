Derry teenager Manus Deery 'totally innocent', says coroner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has said that a Londonderry teenager, who was shot dead by the Army in the Bogside almost 45 years ago, was "totally innocent" and did not pose a threat to anyone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Manus Deery, 15, was with a group of teenage friends when he was shot in the head by a soldier from a sentry post on the city's walls in May 1972.
The soldier has since died.
The presiding coroner, Mr Justice Adrian Colton, said the teenager's character has been fully vindicated.
Mr Colton also said Mr Deery was not a member of any illegal organisation.
