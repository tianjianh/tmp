[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jersey States has revealed a new population policy - to limit immigration to 325 people a year.

The temporary law would give the government more control over the number of migrants coming to the island.
Assistant Chief Minister, Senator Paul Routier, said: "We are controlling the number of licences to non-locals.
"But it is important to keep a level of immigration, so that we have a workforce that can support an ageing population."
Senator Sarah Ferugson, of the Corporate Services Scrutiny Panel, said the States needed to look at the "big issue of inadequate border control".
Islanders have been asked for their input before a 20-year plan is proposed.
