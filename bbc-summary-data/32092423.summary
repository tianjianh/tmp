How England's players rated against Lithuania at Wembley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Roy Hodgson's England side eased to a 4-0 victory over Lithuania at Wembley to maintain their 100% record in Euro 2016 qualifying.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney moved to within two goals of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's goalscoring record for England after he netted.
Arsenal's Danny Welbeck added the second late in the first half before Liverpool's Raheem Sterling and Tottenham debutant Harry Kane sealed the win.
How did England's players fare overall?
Barely touched the ball.
Routine performance for the Southampton defender. Did nothing wrong but was never placed under any stress.
Almost a night off for Cahill. Could have taken a chair out on to the Wembley pitch with him.
Showed good concentration in one rare Lithuania foray into England's half early on, but hardly a game to make a judgement on Jones as an international player.
The Everton man looks a little low on confidence and not as assured as normal with the final ball and set-pieces. Never tested in defence.
Touched the ball 60 times as England dominated the first half. Steady without ever needing to be spectacular.
Brings a sure touch and composure in possession. Timid opposition like Lithuania perfect for him - but did an excellent job.
Another energetic performance from the Aston Villa player, who is forging a place in Roy Hodgson's plans. Almost set up an early goal for Wayne Rooney.
A constant threat to defenders who simply had no answer to his pace. Scored his first goal for England and set up Harry Kane's header with a fine cross.
Missed an early chance but scored one, hit the woodwork twice and set up Sterling's goal. A good night for England's captain.
Deserved to keep his place and made it six goals in this Euro 2016 campaign. Plenty will now call for him to be left out for Harry Kane - but has been excellent for England.
Very quiet in his brief appearance - game won and eased himself through.
The dream continues. Scored with his third touch. The man with the Midas touch in front of goal.
Had no impact in his cameo.
