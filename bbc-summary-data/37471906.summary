Audi, BMW and Mercedes Benz cars fitted with on-board sensors are to share information in real time about on-street parking spaces and roadworks via a digital map service.

They will also gather data on traffic conditions, hazards and road signs.
The service by mapping firm Here, owned by a group of German car makers, will roll out next year.
The platform will record vehicle speed, location and direction, as well as sharp braking and fog light activation.
Video footage of road hazards will also be captured by a forward-facing camera on the cars.
Other brands will join the service at a later date, the firm said.
Owners of cars which incorporate Here's Open Location Platform will not have to do anything to transmit or receive data.
Community mapping service Waze, owned by Google, already crowdsources travel data but users must be logged in via their smartphones.
The parking information service will also provide parking availability predictions for each street as well as details about payment options.
"Here believes that industry collaboration is essential to address the major challenges faced by road users everywhere.
"What we are seeing today is the technology and automotive industries coming together to create services that will elevate the driving experience for billions," said CEO Edzard Overbeek.
Here was sold by Nokia to the car group last year for 2.8bn euros (Â£2bn).
