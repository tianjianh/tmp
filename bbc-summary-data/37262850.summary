[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kris Commons, Efe Ambrose and Kristoffer Ajer have been left out of Celtic's Champions League squad.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Jozo Simunovic and winger Gary Mackay-Steven, who are working their way back from injuries, are included by manager Brendan Rodgers.
Squads for Europe's elite club tournament can accommodate 25 players but Rodgers has listed just 24.
Celtic will meet Barcelona, Manchester City and Borussia Monchengladbach in Group C.
Nigeria defender Ambrose turned down a deadline day move to Belgian top-flight club Standard Liege, while a move for Simunovic to Torino in Italy also fell through.
Croatia Under-21 international Simunovic has not played since suffering a knee injury in January.
Mackay-Steven is recovering from summer ankle surgery, while Commons has not featured this season, having had an operation for a back problem at the tail end of last term.
Ajer, 18, arrived from Norway over the summer but is yet to make a start for the Scottish champions.
