The latest Fast & Furious film took £18.3m (£12.2m), with Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 in second with $15.5m (£10.3m).
Last weekend Furious 7 became the fastest film to make more than $1bn (£669.5 million) internationally.

The latest instalment in Joss Whedon's superhero franchise, starring Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johansson, opens in the US and Canada on Thursday, as well as dozens more countries and territories.
Furious 7, starring Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker, has now made $1.3 billion globally.
It is also the first film to top the US box office for four weeks since The Hunger Games in March 2012.
Despite mixed reviews, fantasy romance The Age of Adaline opened in third place with $13.4m (£8.9m).
It stars Blake Lively as a woman who is forced to stay 29 years old, along with Harrison Ford and Ellen Burstyn.
