Officers called to reports of a disturbance in the street found the 19-year-old with a number of stab wounds and stomach injuries.
He is undergoing surgery after what appears to have been a targeted attack and remains in a serious condition, Greater Manchester police said.

He appealed for witnesses to come forward.
