[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League newcomers Sutton made it three wins in a row with a 2-0 victory at home to Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Doswell's men unlocked the Silkmen in the first half. Ross Stearn pounced from close range after goalkeeper Craig Ross could only parry an earlier effort.
Frenchman Bedsente Gomis made it two, rounding off an intricate passing move. The U's were very much on top, and Nicky Bailey also rattled the visitors' crossbar on the stroke of half-time.
After the break, Dean Beckwith again headed against the woodwork as the Gander Green Lane club continued to dominate. And when Andy Halls was given a straight red card for a nasty foul, Macclesfield's race was run.
