The body of India Chipchase, 20, was found at a house in Stanley Road, Northampton, on 31 January.
Birmingham Crown Court heard Edward Tenniswood, 52, of Stanley Road, Northampton, denies her murder.
Christopher Donnellan QC, prosecuting, said Miss Chipchase's body was found on a mattress at the defendant's home.

Mr Donnellan said Mr Tenniswood turned up outside NB's cocktail bar in Northampton in the early hours of 30 January when Miss Chipchase was in a "fairly pickled state" and could "barely stand up".
"Others nearby thought from the way he spoke to her, he knew her," said Mr Donnellan. "He was overheard by others to say 'not to worry' and he'd get her home safe - he didn't."
The jury heard Miss Chipchase's death "was no dreadful accident" and that Mr Tenniswood "raped and throttled" her at his home in Stanley Road.
"When she resisted he gripped her around the throat and squeezed. She suffered a blunt force trauma to the head and face and appeared to put up a struggle," he said.
After she died, Mr Tenniswood set about tidying up, Mr Donnellan added.
"He re-clothed her, covered her in a sheet and left her. He removed her belongings."
The jury was told Mr Tenniswood had put on clear plastic vinyl gloves that were later found in a bag of rubbish.
"He was obviously aware of what he was doing and put on clear plastic vinyl gloves," Mr Donnellan said. "They were found in a bag of rubbish - India's blood on the outside of the gloves and his DNA on the inside.
"It is very likely his motive was sexual and when she resisted him he was determined to have sex and he grabbed her around the throat and squeezed."
The court heard Mr Tenniswood checked into the Ibis Hotel in Mare Fare at about 21:30 GMT on 30 January. Miss Chipchase's body was discovered inside his home at about 15:30 the next day and he was arrested three hours later, the court heard.
When Mr Tenniswood was arrested police saw a scratch on his neck and other marks on his body, the court heard.
The trial continues.
