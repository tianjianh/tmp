[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An increase in international traffic was a key factor in Edinburgh recording the busiest February ever at a Scottish airport.

A total of 811,804 passengers used the airport last month, up 5.4% from 2016.
The number of international travellers rose by 13.6% in February, with Edinburgh now officially the UK's fastest-growing airport in terms of international passengers.
The airport said the benefits of its growth would extend outwith the hub.
Edinburgh Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said: "Once again our passenger numbers have broken a new record.
"This is further proof that the airport is continuing to service the growing demand for what is without doubt one of Europe's leading cities.
"As we grow we deliver greater international connectivity for this city and for Scotland - and the benefits of our growth are felt well beyond this airport."
