He has been Lille's first choice keeper since 2013 and has made 130 appearances for the club in all competitions.
The 33-year-old, whose previous deal ran until next year, says he is very settled at Stade Pierre-Mauroy.
"I am very happy to extend my contract with Lille, a club I call home," Enyeama told BBC Sport.
"I love the family atmosphere here and would like to thank the club for the incredible confidence they have placed in me since I joined five years ago.
"Despite receiving interesting offers from elsewhere, I never thought for a second that money comes before happiness hence my decision to stay here.
"I will continue to give my all, along with my teammates, to bring joy and success to our supporters who have all passionately stood by us."
This season Enyeama's Lille, beaten in the Coupe de la Ligue final by Paris St-Germain, leapfrogged Saint-Etienne to finish fifth at the end of the 2015-2016 season to seal a place in next season's Europa League.
With 17 clean sheets from 35 league games this term Lille official Jean-Michel Van Damme is delighted to tie the Nigerian down to a new deal.
"Vincent is an exceptional lad both on and off the field," said Van Damme.
"To continue to work with a player of his calibre and a man of his quality is something fantastic for the club.
"He still has bright future and showed again this season, the full extent of his immense qualities. He is happy here and feels at home.
"He brings so much with his talent, his state of mind and ability to motivate the group, we could not afford to lose the opportunity to extend his contract.
"I also think that his presence will be important in the progression of young understudy Mike Maignan. We are happy that Enyeama is able to finish his career at Lille."
