The places missing out on HS2

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the government confirmed the route for the second phase of the high-speed rail line HS2, reactions have varied from the delighted to the despondent. Leeds and Manchester are on the line - Liverpool and Newcastle, as expected, are not. So how do people who missed out on having a fast train on their doorstep feel about it?

The latest announcement is about the second, Y-shaped phase of the £55.7bn infrastructure project. The two arms of the Y split in the West Midlands. One prong heads off north-west to Manchester and is due to open in 2027. The second heads north-east to Leeds and is due to open in 2033.
Although a new station is earmarked for Sheffield, the announcement does not include a final decision about where to locate it.
Several places are not actually on the fast route but will be serviced by new trains running on older, slower tracks. These include Liverpool, Newcastle, Stafford, Preston, Warrington, Carlisle, York, Darlington and Durham. So are they all in the doldrums?
If social media is anything to go by, there is a lot of cynicism and disquiet in the North.
On Twitter, Thankerton Barry said: "The North is beyond Manchester and Leeds. Not running to Liverpool, North West and North East is madness", while Kim Sanderson from Northumberland said: "Would be great if HS2 reached the *actual* North, too."
Another, Ian Halliwell, posted on Facebook: "If this is supposed to help the north, why does it not include Liverpool, Hull or Newcastle? Link Manchester to Leeds.... glad it recognised the importance of the real hub of the north WIGAN. ... but isn't the whole thing just a gigantic waste of public funds?"
Among the big winners is Greater Manchester. The potential impact of a high-speed rail link can be illustrated by the boost it is expected to give the region.
The line will include stops at Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport, securing increased freight capacity for the region, along with better connections and shorter journey times to London.
The Greater Manchester Combined Authority estimates this will bring up to 180,000 new jobs to the area by 2040 and add £1.3bn to its economy. Fast links to Manchester Airport would also increase the airport's importance as an international gateway and attract global businesses.
So it would appear Manchester has struck gold with HS2.
Warrington, which is 25 miles away, will miss out though. Terry O'Neill, leader of the borough council, says a high-speed hub station at Bank Quay is "a priority" and he will "continue to oppose any HS2 route that doesn't include this".
The plans include a route that takes HS2 around Warrington and joins the West Coast Mainline north of the town via a spur line from near Manchester Airport to Golborne.
This will mean HS2 will not use the existing line from Crewe to Warrington but will cut through large parts of Warrington instead.
Mr O'Neill can see no benefit in the current plan: "It is all pain and no economic or environmental gain for residents and businesses.
The route also cuts through Leicestershire, but will not stop in the county. The nearest station will further north be at Toton in Nottinghamshire.
Toton is a suburb with a population of about 8,000. The majority of people will have to travel from either Nottingham or Derby - or further afield - before getting on the fast train.
Although it will take a mere 51 minutes to get from this station to London Euston, at the moment it takes about half an hour on the tram to get from Nottingham to Toton. For passengers in Derby, it would mean a 45-minute bus journey.
North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen and county council leader Nick Rushton have said for their region, the scheme will deliver "all of the pain and none of the gain".
Although some experts have welcomed the plan as improving links to northern England, many have expressed doubts about the bigger picture.
"At the moment major infrastructure projects look as if they are being developed in isolation, when a more integrated approach would be cheaper, more efficient and better serve passengers and businesses," says Colin Brown from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.
But not everyone is upset.
Liverpool is not on the route, despite having a considerable population, a large railway terminus, a port and an airport.
Certainly some residents are unhappy about missing out.
Commenting on the BBC website, geecar03 said: "The failure to connect Liverpool and west Lancashire to HS2 is disgusting. Liverpool is a major UK port and the need for rail freight will increase with the advent of the new deep water container terminal."
MakeEveryDayCount said: "It's obvious if Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham etc need high speed so does Liverpool. The oversight/sleight of hand is precisely how people and communities get left behind. The government must treat all regions the same."
Mel0dymaker was even stronger in condemnation.
"It's an example of trickledown economics at its absolute worst. It'll basically have effect of gentrifying the North at expense of wealthier southerners as they make use of faster travel and cheap property.
"The UK could update infrastructure in a fairer way across country. Remember how long it took to electrify lines around Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds?
"They must hate the North."
Yet the authorities there have cautiously welcomed the latest announcement.
Campaign group Linking Liverpool - which has been lobbying for years for the city to be fully serviced by HS2 on the grounds "it will help rebalance the UK economy" and "will bring benefits to Liverpool City Region and the whole of the north of England" - said it the scheme was "going in the right direction and is a good step forward".
"We've got some very good 'passive provision'.
"That's a small section of extra line, a couple of hundred metres or so, which means we can be fully linked to the HS2 network in the future without any disruption to current services."
Linking Liverpool is also keen on developing an east-west high-speed rail link from Liverpool to Manchester and Leeds - known as Northern Powerhouse Rail. It's estimated the connection would boost the local economy by £15bn.
The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, is also looking on the bright side.
"There are a number of good things in today's statement, especially good news for the city region's connection with both the north-south HS2 and the new west-east Northern Powerhouse Rail.
"But, there is still much to do in making sure the government commits to investment in a new station for the city centre and faster journey times to Manchester and London."
And the government has insisted the line will bring significant benefits, increasing capacity on congested railways, improving connections between cities, and generating jobs and growth.
