Vodafone has apologised for double-charging customers who donated to charity by text.

The mobile phone giant said a "small number of customers were affected by a temporary computer glitch between 17 and 18 March".
Some customers who had sent a text indicating they wanted to give to charity were billed twice for the same donation.
Vodafone said it had apologised to all customers affected.
The company said the money had been credited to their accounts, adding that it had made a donation to the charity affected to apologise for the inconvenience.
BBC Scotland understands the charity affected was the Disasters Emergency Committee's appeal on the East Africa crisis.
Vodafone only alerted customers to the mistake a month after the double-charging error.
