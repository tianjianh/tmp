Full Tilt Poker, an American-run site registered on the Channel Island of Alderney, has been closed down by the authorities there.
A US investigation into money laundering, illegal gambling and bank fraud was launched back in April.
Eleven people, among them the founders of Full Tilt Poker, were charged over the offences.
In 2006, American authorities tried to crack down on the practice.
The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was legislation introduced to try to put the brakes on the emerging industry.
It was designed to halt money transfers to online gaming sites.
As a result several big poker sites worried about the new law pulled out of America.
For example, PokerStars is based on the Isle of Man, Absolute Poker is in Canada with Full Tilt in Alderney.
Now, the commission there has said an internal investigation showed that Full Tilt employees and associates have operated contrary to its gambling laws with a hearing due in London on 26 July.
"The decision to suspend the eGambling License was in the public interest," said Andre Wilsenach, the commission's executive director.
"Because of the seriousness and urgency of the matter, it required that immediate action was taken ahead of the regulatory hearing."
There's been no comment so far from Full Tilt Poker.
