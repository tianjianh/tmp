The news was announced by Nick Grimshaw on the station's Breakfast Show.
"It's really exciting. I love festivals and I love playing them," said Florence Welch.
It'll be the band's third appearance at a Big Weekend having previously played at events in Hackney and Bangor. In Norwich they'll appear on the main stage on Saturday.
"It's really nice to play outdoors and see the sky," said Welch.
"I like performing when it's raining."

The station's flagship event will be held in the city's Earlham Park on 23-24 May.
The full line-up and ticketing information will be announced on Radio 1 over the coming months.
Seven-time Grammy winner Taylor Swift was the first act confirmed for Europe's biggest, free ticketed music event.
She'll play on the Sunday night with Florence and The Machine appearing on Saturday.
"They are rowdy, insane, in the best way - there seems to be a lot of jumping, which I love," the singer said in January.
"Everyone talks about the festivals in England being the best ones you can go to. I feel like I've been missing out - I'm really excited."
Last year's event in Glasgow was opened by One Direction and headlined by Coldplay and Katy Perry.
In the lead up to Big Weekend, for the fourth year running, Radio 1 and BBC Learning will also open the doors to Radio 1's Academy.
The station hopes to inspire local 16 to 19-year-olds to take the next step in their careers by inviting them to attend a series of radio shows, master classes and Q&As.
Radio 1's Big Weekend will be broadcast live on Radio 1, Radio 1Xtra and streamed in vision at Radio 1. Highlights will also be broadcast live on BBC Three, with all performances available after the weekend on the Radio 1 channel in BBC iPlayer.
