[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend by slitting her throat has admitted stalking her and told jurors he lied repeatedly to police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Lane, 27, of Portslade, East Sussex, said he was scared and panicked about being blamed for killing Shana Grice.
Miss Grice, 19, was found dead in her bedroom in Portslade last August.
During seven police interviews Mr Lane, who denies murder, continuously changed his story, Lewes Crown Court heard.
Jurors were told he altered his account of where he had been and what he was doing that morning before admitting he had gone to her house and discovered her body.
When asked why he thought it better to lie, Mr Lane said some of his behaviour in the months preceding her death "didn't look good".
The court has already heard Mr Lane, of Thornhill Rise, was accused of stalking Miss Grice after their relationship ended.
He has admitted fitting a tracker to her car and stealing a key to her back door which he used to gain entry.
Jurors have also heard Miss Grice made several complaints to Sussex Police about the defendant, but on one occasion was issued a fixed penalty notice for wasting police time.
On Monday, when asked by prosecuting barrister Philip Bennetts QC whether his actions amounted to stalking. Mr Lane replied: "I suppose so, yes."
The jury was shown CCTV of Mr Lane wearing a white T-shirt and grey shorts with an emblem on the side.
The prosecution claimed that he somehow disposed of these clothes to conceal evidence.
But Mr Lane said the items were at his home and he could not understand why police had not found them when they searched the property.
The trial continues.
