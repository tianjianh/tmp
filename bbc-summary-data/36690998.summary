Wayfield Primary: Inquiry call over 'unsafe' school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A councillor has called for an investigation after Ofsted found a primary school was "unsafe and chaotic".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Its report rated Wayfield Primary School in Chatham, Kent, "inadequate" and warned the safety and well-being of the 230 pupils was "at risk".
Ofsted described leadership and management as "weak at all levels".
Wayfield is part of the Griffin Trust academy chain, which said teacher shortages were "challenging".
One pupil described to the BBC how she tries to stay at home to avoid being bullied.
She said: "All the time when I cried, the teachers kept saying go sit in the book corner."
Ofsted said misbehaviour during the inspection in May was "serious and dangerous".
It revealed its own inspectors had to "intervene directly to protect the children" after fighting broke out in an infant lesson and in the lunch hall when, "although staff were present, they neither dealt with the misbehaviour nor appeared to notice it".
Ofsted said the headteacher "works hard but cannot do all that is needed by himself".
Medway Labour councillor Tristan Osborne said he would call on the regional School Commissioner to investigate its trustees.
The Griffin Trust said:  "Our school improvement team continue to work hard with Wayfield Primary to address the points raised by Ofsted.
"In the face of current teacher shortages, securing a strong leadership team for Wayfield Primary School has proved challenging."
Wayfield Primary is to be transferred to the Primary First Trust from 1 September under a new head.
