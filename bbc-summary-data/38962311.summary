The Bundesliga side were expected to pose a greater threat to Benfica after scoring 21 goals in the group stage.
Gabon international Aubameyang had contributed four of those strikes but epitomised an out-of-sorts Dortmund, scooping a close-range chance over the bar and missing his penalty before being substituted after an hour.
Dortmund's form has faltered since December, with the German side winning just two of their last seven league matches.
Thomas Tuchel's side suffered a shock defeat by the Bundesliga's bottom club Darmstadt on Saturday, and the malaise continued as they were held at bay by a stubborn Benfica display.
The Portuguese club have never lost a last-16 tie in the Champions League - having reached that stage three times - and will have a lead to defend in Germany after scoring with their only shot on target.
Benfica coach Rui Vitoria: "We fought, gave our best, and victories are also made of that.
"Congratulations to Ederson too, a keeper who showed his quality once again, this time against a team that scored so many goals in the group stage."
Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel: "Aubameyang is not fully fit after the Africa Cup of Nations and his body language did not suggest that he would do better after missing the penalty.
"We played an outstanding game and conceded a goal with their first shot in the second half.
"It is an extremely complicated result, but I am very proud of how we played tonight. Even though I am very disappointed, I am proud of how we presented ourselves."
Match ends, Benfica 1, Borussia Dortmund 0.
