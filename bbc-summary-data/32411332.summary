The suspects are all aged in their 50s and from the York area, North Yorkshire Police said.
Miss Lawrence disappeared after leaving her house on Heworth Road, York, for work on 19 March in 2009.
The latest arrests come after a local man, aged in his 50s, was detained on suspicion of murder on 23 March 2015. He remains on police bail.
Miss Lawrence was 35 when she disappeared. Her body has never been found.
Searches are being conducted by detectives, who have cordoned off a house near to Miss Lawrence's home in the Heworth area of York.
North Yorkshire Police said the searches were expected to continue for a number of days.
Her family have been notified about the arrests and are being supported by trained officers, police said.
Miss Lawrence's mother Joan, told BBC Radio York police had informed her of the arrests but they had "come out of the blue".
"It has all come as a shock," she said.
Det Supt Dai Malyn asked that members of the public and the media do not identify the men who have been arrested.
"This is to ensure the investigation and legal process are not compromised or potentially damaged in any way," he said.
"I urge everyone to again show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important inquiries."
A review of the case in October 2013 led to two arrests but no-one has ever been charged.
A 59-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder last May and was later released from bail.
Detectives said a 47-year-old man held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice last July had also been released from bail.
