Orkney crab has become the latest Scottish delicacy to be put forward for protected food name status.

Scottish Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead made the announcement during a speech at the 2015 Scottish Inshore Fisheries Conference in Inverness.
The bid for protected food name (PFN) status in Europe has been made by the Orkney Fishermen's Society.
The group is one of the leading processors of brown crab in the UK.
Last month, bakers launched a bid for the Forfar bridie to be given the same protected status as Champagne.
Other Scottish foods that have already won protection include Stornoway black pudding, Arbroath smokies and Ayrshire Dunlop cheese.
Mr Lochhead said: "Scotland is world-famous for our wonderful food and drink and Orkney crab is well known throughout the food industry for its high quality.
"It's great news that Orkney crab has applied for protected status which could help guarantee the quality and reputation of this iconic product."
Stewart Crichton, of the Orkney Fisherman's Society, said "We've worked very hard for a number of years to build the reputation of Orkney crab, starting from our fishermen and the care and pride they take in their job, to our processing factories and our customers.
"Protecting the integrity of that brand is the next logical step in the process and one we're delighted to be embarking on".
