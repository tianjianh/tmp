Dundee 1-1 Ross County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee took a significant step towards Scottish Premiership survival by earning a home draw with Ross County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren O'Dea's thunderous 76th-minute penalty maintained manager Neil McCann's unbeaten start and ensured his side move five points clear of second-bottom Hamilton with two games to play.
County, who led after Liam Boyce's fourth-minute opener, confirmed their top-flight status with the draw.
Jim McIntyre's side are now eighth - eight points clear of 11th place.
County join Kilmarnock among the bottom six teams in being safe from relegation and this point came as a result of a positive start.
Michael Gardyne signalled the Dingwall side's intent when he cut in from the right, and shot with his left, but goalkeeper Scott Bain tipped over.
And a goal soon followed when prolific Northern Irishman Boyce stretched to poke a knock-down into the net for his 22nd goal of the season.
County looked certain to add that with Dundee disjointed, but Craig Curran failed to covert two good chances before the hosts came to life.
A break in play gave Dees boss McCann a window to talk to his team and it seemed to spark a response.
Faisal El Bakhtaoui fired at goalkeeper Scott Fox, then shot narrowly wide, before Paul McGowan screwed a volley across the face of goal with only Fox to beat.
Dundee were in control but struggled to apply the finishing touch until Cammy Kerr broke into the box, was fouled by Curran, and earned the penalty which skipper O'Dea smashed in off the bar.
It felt deserved given their assertiveness and they might have had another spot-kick when Kevin Holt looked to be caught late, but referee Nick Walsh was unmoved.
They should have had a second goal late-on, though, when McGowan picked out Marcus Haber with a brilliant cross, but the striker could only nod straight into Fox's palms.
Dundee interim manager Neil McCann: "We should've won it. When things happen and you're tested, it shows a lot of character to come back from it.
"That group, maybe on the run they were on, maybe wouldn't have come back from it. I'm delighted with them because they did show character.
"It's a good point. We wanted three and want three on Wednesday. We're not there. You can see our game starting to develop. We are not a side that are prepared to be beaten."
Ross County Jim McIntyre: "We started the game in great fashion. Dundee were struggling to cope with us. We got really sloppy after that and gave them a lift.
"We went from control of the game to hanging on and that was really disappointing.
"We're delighted [to be safe]. We're relieved it's not going to go down to those last couple of games."
