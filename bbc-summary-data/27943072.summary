Guildford Council agrees plan for green belt housing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A plan to remove 15 Surrey villages from the green belt is to be put forward for public consultation after being agreed by Guildford Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twenty seven councillors supported the plan which will form the council's housing development strategy for the next 15 years, with 14 voting against.
The council said a lack of brownfield land meant removing the green belt status of areas had to be considered.
The 12-week public consultation period for the Local Plan begins on 1 July.
Monika Juneja, the lead councillor for planning at the council said that building on brownfield sites was still the preferred option for development.
But with 89% of land designated as green belt there was not enough brownfield land to provide homes for a growing population.
A final decision on the Local Plan is not expected until 2015.
