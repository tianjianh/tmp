Exeter have signed Pierce Sweeney on a permanent deal after the 1931 Fund contributed £15,000 towards the defender's wages.

The 21-year-old has been on trial with the League Two club since his release from Championship side Reading at the end of last season.
Sweeney has featured in all three of the Grecians pre-season matches so far.
"He has looked assured and solid for us in the games he has played during pre-season," manager Paul Tisdale said.
Members of the trust pay £19 per month into the 1931 Fund to help pay for a player - it assisted the club in signing Jamaica international Joel Grant last summer.
"The 1931 Fund is a vital part of our community-owned club and we really value their support," Tisdale added.
"This is the eighth year that they have done this so it's not a one-off, and their loyal support is a great bonus to the club."
The length of Sweeney's contract has not been disclosed.
