Cardiff City 0-1 Reading

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading snatched a late victory at Cardiff City as Yann Kermorgant's goal settled a scrappy encounter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts had the better chances in a stuttering first half, with Lex Immers twice heading over.
Although both sides squandered opportunities after the break, the game looked destined to end goalless.
But Kermorgant seized on a loose ball in the Cardiff box and struck an emphatic half-volley to seal Reading's first away win of the season.
It was a rare moment of quality in an otherwise forgettable meeting between two sides who struggled to play with any fluency.
The most significant event of the day for Cardiff was their omission of goalkeeper David Marshall ahead of a Â£5m move to Hull.
His successor, Ben Wilson, almost gifted Reading victory midway through the second half as he dropped the ball in the Bluebirds' box, but Roy Beerens' scuffed shot was cleared off the line.
Paul Trollope's side mustered some promising chances - Immers and Sean Morrison both missing with free headers - but their toothless attacking display prompted boos from the home crowd at the final whistle.
Cardiff manager Paul Trollope:
"I'm really frustrated. We prepared really well and created enough chances, especially in the first period, to be in front.
"We controlled the game and coped well with their game to limit them to a few chances. But you need to score goals in football and we should have been ahead.
"We had three very, very good chances from headers and didn't take them and then conceded that late goal that felt like a real sucker-punch.
"We thought we had this one in the palm of our hands at half-time and that we would go on to win. But not taking those chances came back to haunt us so we need to improve that."
Reading boss Jaap Stam:
"I'm very proud of the players and how they reacted and the passion they put into this game.
"They are learning a different style of play but I told them if they keep believing, working hard and are patient then eventually we will start winning games.
"We were up against a physically strong side who don't give away much space to pass. They pressed us high up and were winning back balls in midfield and had chances in front of goal.
"We kept our patience and picked it up in the second half. We controlled the game and created chances late on."
