Two of those infected have died but have been described as having died of "underlying conditions".
There have been another 14 cases, with patients being kept in isolation.
NHS Lothian has said all wards at the hospital remain open and infection prevention and control procedures have been reinforced.
The health board said test are being carried out to see if any of the identified cases are linked.
NHS Lothian Executive Nurse Director Melanie Johnson said: "We have identified a cluster of C diff at the hospital and an investigation is ongoing to establish if there is a link between the cases.
"As is usual practice, we isolate symptomatic patients, emphasise the importance of infection control precautions and undertake additional cleaning. We always act as if cases are linked and implement action to prevent cross transmission.
"Our robust surveillance procedures meant that we were able to identify these cases quickly and take the appropriate action."
