Judy Murray among Scots on honours list

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tennis coach Judy Murray, pop star Emeli Sande and Harry Potter author JK Rowling are among the well-known faces in Scotland to have received awards in the Queen's Birthday Honours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rowling, who was made an OBE in 2001, has now become a member of the elite Order of the Companions of Honour.
Judy Murray, mother of world tennis number one Sir Andy, was made an OBE.
And Brit Award winner Sande, who was raised in Alford, Aberdeenshire, was made an MBE.
Scottish comedian Billy Connolly was given a knighthood.
Judy Murray adds to the honours already handed to her two sons.
The tennis coach and former captain of Great Britain's Fed Cup team is being recognised for her work to grow the sport and for encouraging more women into sport.
Sir Andy Murray, was knighted in the New Year Honours List, while his brother Jamie was made an OBE last year.
Harry Potter author Rowling, who was made an OBE in 2001, becomes a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, which has a maximum of 65 members, in light of her services to literature and philanthropy.
It comes days before fans of her boy wizard mark 20 years since Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone was first published.
As well as being one of the world's best-selling authors she has set up a charitable trust which supports projects that alleviate social deprivation and founded Lumos, a charity working to transform the lives of institutionalised children.
The 30-year-old musician from Aberdeenshire will be made an MBE.
Sande was born in Sunderland to a Zambian father and English mother but moved to the north-east of Scotland when she was four.
She released her first solo singles Heaven and Read All About It, for which she gained her first number one, in 2011.
The following year she kicked off the opening ceremony of 2012 Olympics in London.
The principal of Glasgow University has been awarded a knighthood for services to higher education.
Known as a world-class economist, he chairs the Standing Council on Europe which advises the Scottish government on securing Scotland's relationship with the EU.
Prof Muscatelli said: "I'm absolutely delighted to receive this honour, but this is, of course, an award for the whole of the University of Glasgow as much as it is for me."
He added: "I am also pleased, and proud, as someone who came to the UK from abroad and who believes that science and knowledge transcends national boundaries and borders that this honour has been bestowed upon me."
Prof Muscatelli was born in Bari, Italy, and has both Italian and British citizenship.
He has been principal and vice-chancellor of the University of Glasgow since October 2009.
Dr Hood, a former Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, has been made an OBE.
She was recognised for her "exceptional and long service to the Church of Scotland and promoting tolerance and understanding" through the Scottish board of the Remembering Srebrenica charity.
The 1995 Bosnian massacre was the worst atrocity on European soil since World War Two.
Dr Hood, who lives in Paisley with her husband Peter, stepped down from her role at Renfrew North Parish Church in October after 37 years.
She first visited Srebrenica in 2013 when she was Moderator.
She said she was "gobsmacked" but delighted with her award.
Rose Fitzpatrick, Scotland's highest ranked female police officer, has been made a CBE for services to law and order.
She joined the City of London Police in 1987, rising to the rank of Chief Inspector.
In 1998, she transferred to the Metropolitan Police Service where she was awarded the QPM in 2007 and rose to the rank of Deputy Assistant Commissioner.
In 2012, she was appointed Deputy Chief Constable for Police Scotland with overall responsibility for local policing across Scotland.
She said: "This is a great and very humbling honour."
Mel Young, the co-founder of the Big Issue in Scotland and the founder of the Homeless World Cup, has been made an MBE for services to sport and social entrepreneurship.
He said he was "pleased and humbled" by the award.
Mr Young said: "It does help raise the profile of the issues we are involved in.
"First of all that sport is a real power for change and we should invest more in it and secondly that we should not have any homelessness in the world.
"If it helps raise the morale of people who are walking on the streets with people who are marginalised then that's fantastic."
Cara O'Donnell, is the co-founder of SAMS which brings support, care and respite to many families with disabled children.
SAMS works, voluntarily, with about 40 young children with Additional Support Needs (ASN) ranging from Down's Syndrome to Angelman Syndrome and many more complex needs.
Cara was honoured with British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to charity in Glasgow.
She told BBC Scotland that SAMS was like "a big family".
She said that when she got the letter about her award she thought somebody was playing a prank on her.
"Now that I know it is real, it is starting to sink in but the reality isn't there yet," she added.
The 82-year-old, from Aboyne in Aberdeenshire, was awarded the MBE for services to the Highland Games, the economy and voluntary service in the north of Scotland.
He said his first experience of a Highland Games was in 1947 when they started up again after the war, when he sold programmes at Aboyne.
He later became involved with the running of the games and spent half a century as one of the Highland Games' leading lights.
He said: "It's been a privilege and absolute pleasure working for the association."
Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, has become an OBE.
He hit the headlines last year when he oversaw the operation to recover the Transocean Winner oil rig that ran aground on Lewis.
From the world of politics, former Conservative MSP Mary Scanlon becomes a CBE.
A former education spokeswoman for her party, she was among the first intake of MSPs in 1999 and stood down at the last Holyrood election.
Former Labour health spokesman Dr Richard Simpson, who also retired from the Scottish Parliament in 2016, is made an OBE.
Prof Bill Buchanan, head of Edinburgh Napier University's Cyber Academy, is made an OBE.
He was recognised for his services to cyber security and innovation.
A Fellow of the British Computer Society, the university describes him as an international authority on cryptography and the criminal use of hacking software.
A number of others are awarded MBEs for services to their communities.
They include Eunice Olumide - a fashion designer, actress and one of the first black Scottish models - and Carolyn Little, volunteer director with Support in Mind Scotland, for services to mental healthcare.
There are more than 100 Scottish recipients in this year's list.
Others receiving awards include Nora Senior (CBE), for services to the Scottish and UK business community, Polly Purvis (OBE), for her work on the digital economy in Scotland, and Paralympian Angie Malone (MBE), for services to wheelchair curling.
Queen's Police Medals go to Deputy Chief Constable Johnny Gwynne and Chief Superintendent Gillian Imery of Police Scotland.
