Pompey broke the deadlock when Carlisle goalkeeper Mark Gillespie parried Kyle Bennett's shot into the path of Smith, who made no mistake from close range.
Adam McGurk had two chances to make it 2-0, first hitting the post and then having Danny Grainger block his shot.
Carlisle could have earned a point but Hallam Hope could not find the net from Derek Asamoah's cross.
The result means Portsmouth remain in sixth place in the League Two table, while Carlisle slip two places to 11th.
Portsmouth assistant manager Leam Richardson told BBC Radio Solent:

"It is always great for strikers to score. Smith has worked hard to get that little bit of luck and to get that goal today.
"The lads know what is expected; the work ethic among the lads is top class. We started the second half with intent and with tempo so we were unfortunate not to go two up.
"We are trying to get momentum, trying to gather pace and hopefully we can claw a few points back to try and get in the automatics and cement a play-off place."
