A bid to break the world record for the largest ever hula hoop workout was attempted in Wrexham on Saturday.

Organisers wanted more than 500 people to join in the effort at Glyndwr University's sports centre.
Sasha Kenney was behind the move as she tried to get into the Guinness Book of Records for a second time after hula hooping the London Marathon course.
The attempt was part of the Wrexham Fitness Festival, which encourages people to get active.
Official confirmation will need to be gained, but organisers believed they were close to setting a record.
The current record is 407 people, who took part in a hula hoop workout in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, in March 2013.
