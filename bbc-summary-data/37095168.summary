Chat: Are you heading back to school?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If you live in Scotland you'll be on your way back to school already - let us know what you're looking forward to in the new school year!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
School holidays start and finish on different dates depending on where you live in the UK, so lots of you will still be on summer holidays.
But if you're heading back now, let us know about it - will you be returning to the same school or starting a new one? Will you have new teachers, a new uniform or new subjects?
What are you looking forward to the most?
I'm getting a new school building since my old one one had been there since 1886 so i get 3 days extra so they can build it!

I'm moving to high school when the holiday ends and I am a little bit nervous because I don't know many people going but I know I will make new friends. As well as new people and teachers, there will be new subjects and I can't wait to use fire in science!
