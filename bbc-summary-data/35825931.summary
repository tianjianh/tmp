The comments come in a joint letter to parents of pupils published on the school's website.
There has been an ongoing industrial dispute in the school over a number of months.
Most recently, around a third of the teaching staff were absent from school on Monday and Tuesday.
The letter is signed by the principal, Claire White, and Nuala Lynn from the board of governors.
It said the school is introducing "support mechanisms for the coming days and weeks to address the educational provision in the light of staff absences".
These include:
The letter said that the school hopes these additional measures will address parents concerns.
It also says the steps have been taken in consultation with the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS).
On Tuesday, about 20 parents of pupils held a protest outside the school to express their concerns about ongoing incidents at the school.
