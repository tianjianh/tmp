He was speaking after four people were arrested in raids in the city of Sydney.
Mr Turnbull said the raids had been a "major joint counter-terrorism operation".
He said extra security had been put in place at domestic and international airports.
The raids took place in the suburbs of Surry Hills, Lakemba, Wiley Park and Punchbowl, Australian broadcaster ABC reported.
Police were acting on information that the plot involved an "improvised device", it added.
