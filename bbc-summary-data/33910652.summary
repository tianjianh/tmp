Protest over Calderdale council care home child abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Victims of child sex abuse in Halifax are staging a protest calling for an inquiry into historical abuse at care homes in Calderdale to be reopened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men were convicted for carrying out abuse during the 1970s, 80s and 90s at the now closed Skircoat Lodge.
Victim Kaz Gray said inquiries did not go far enough and some individuals were allegedly still working with children.
Calderdale Council said no one involved in the historical cases still worked for the authority.
In 2001, Malcom Phillips, who ran Skircoat Lodge for nearly 20 years, was jailed for seven years for repeated abuse of children in his care.
A social worker there, Andrew Shadders, who abused boys, was jailed for 15 years.
Another man, Terence O'Hagan, was charged with abuse but died before conviction.
Ms Gray, who is leading the protest at the council's social services offices, said the scale of the abuse in care homes in Calderdale over that period of time was "rampant".
She said: "When I went into care one of the first things they did was put me on the pill.
"I was 14, the youngest lass I knew of at the time on the pill in Skircoat was 11 years old."
Ms Gray, who has waived her right to anonymity, was abused at Skircoat and said she was trafficked to a care home in North Wales where she was raped.
She said she considered there were people still working with children in the area who had been "complicit in the abuse" of youngsters decades ago.
"Nothing's changed, nothing will change until everything comes out," she added.
The council said it fully supported the investigation at the time.
It added: This was an appalling case and we regret that children suffered when they were in the care of the local authority.
"I would like to reassure people that nobody involved in the historic cases works for the council, and in the intervening years our safeguarding practices have changed beyond recognition."
Chief Supt Dickie Whitehead, Calderdale District Commander, said a thorough investigation was carried out by police and the council between 1997 and 2002 following allegations against a number of employees at Skircoat Lodge Assessment Centre and Dobroyd Castle.
He said: "This led to a number of arrests and prosecutions, resulting in a number of substantial prison sentences."
Mr Whitehead urged victims of abuse to come forward, adding: "We can promise that reports will be investigated and victims will be treated with the utmost sensitivity."
