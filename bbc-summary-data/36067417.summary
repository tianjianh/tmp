[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karl Rose admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply.
He must forfeit £25,000 under the Proceeds of Crime Act after Warwickshire Justice Centre rejected his claims the majority of the cash was from the show hosted by Noel Edmunds.
The 29-year-old, from Coventry, won £20,000 on the Channel 4 programme in May 2009, West Midlands Police said.

Rose, of Bruce Road, Radford, was arrested in September 2014 when almost half a kilo of cannabis was found in a car owned by an accomplice, police said.
Officers searched his home and found cannabis, worth almost £5,000, and £25,480 in cash.
Det Con Greg Ashfield said: "We found plenty of evidence showing that Rose was actively dealing drugs and that the cash we found in a holdall was money derived from selling cannabis.
"Incredibly, he asked us and the courts to believe he kept game show winnings from five years earlier just lying around his house."
Rose and three other men were handed 12-month prison sentences, suspended for 18 months, after they all admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply in November.
They were ordered to carry out 150 hours of voluntary community work.
