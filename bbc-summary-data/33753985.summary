It was his first individual World Championship medal since 2009 and came after he won team gold with Rebecca Gallantree in the team event.
"I'm really happy with that bronze because I did make it as hard as possible for myself," said Daley.
Daley was ninth after the second of six rounds but recovered well.
The 21-year-old, who had already secured an Olympic 10m platform place for Team GB by reaching the final, delivered four stunning routines to score a total of 537.95 and finish in the final podium position.
And it ensured that Britain ended with a total of four medals - their best finish at a world championships. The team won one medal in 2005 and 2009.
Defending champion Qui Bo of China (587.0) took the title, with USA Olympic gold medallist David Boudia (560.2) second.
"I've learned to persevere, stick at it and keep going because you never know what can happen in competitions," added Daley, who won bronze at London 2012.
"It came down to the last dive when we were on the same score but I quite like that competition pressure - I find it fun.
"It's interesting to see the same three people on the podium today as at London 2012. It looks like we've still got it and we just need to shuffle around for next year and hopefully I can end up on top!"
