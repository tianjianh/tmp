Hong Kong dock workers end strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dock workers in Hong Kong have ended a 40-day strike that affected one of the world's busiest ports.

About 450 workers agreed to a pay increase of 9.8%, after initially demanding a hike of more than 20%.
Cargo was delayed at the terminal resulting in a backlog of thousands of containers.
The container terminal is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire, and Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing.
Union leaders said the deal was a success, as the pay rise was for all workers, not just those who went on strike, and also addressed complaints about working conditions at the port.
They said dock workers would return to work after setting up camp outside Mr Li's headquarters in the heart of Hong Kong three weeks ago.
Hutchinson Port Holdings, the port operator owned by Mr Li, said it would now "focus on restoring the port to its full operational capabilities".
Last month it said the strike had encourage ships to by-pass the port in favour of rival ones on mainland China or elsewhere in Asia.
Hong Kong is the world's third largest container port after Shanghai and Singapore, and is a major transhipment hub for goods going into and out of mainland China.
A Hong Kong trade association estimates that delays in moving cargo on and off ships at the terminal resulted in a backlog of between 80,000 and 90,000 containers.
