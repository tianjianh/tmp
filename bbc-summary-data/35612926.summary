[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edward Fofie, 50, stole his wife's Vauxhall Vectra and was pursued around the city, Cardiff Crown Court heard.
But he left the UK before facing justice, returning to his native Ghana.
He was arrested at Heathrow Airport, then sentenced to 10 months in prison after admitting aggravated vehicle taking, failure to provide a specimen and failure to surrender.
The court heard in 2009, police spotted Fofie talking to a prostitute before there was a "dangerous" pursuit through the city and he was cornered in Splott.
Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett told the court his arrest was "sheer chance".
Defending, Ruth Smith said he left the UK to look after his 85-year-old parents in Ghana.
