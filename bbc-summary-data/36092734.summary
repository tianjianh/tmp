Robin Haig, a founding member of the Scottish Crofting Federation's Young Crofters group, made Hula in her home village of Dornie in the Highlands.
Starring Taggart's Blythe Duff, it won Best Drama at the Bafta Scotland New Talent Awards last week.
Haig, who has studied and worked in filmmaking for several years, will see the short premiered at June's XpoNorth creative industries festival.
Hula is about "uptight divorcee" Clara, played by Duff, who is struggling to find a new purpose in life after her daughter leaves home.
Clara opens a B&B and, inspired by her guests, "rediscovers the joys of life".
Haig was previously nominated for best director and best new work awards for Dear Dad, a documentary about reconciliation with her deer-stalker father.
Hula was made by an all-female core creative team. Haig, who directed the short, co-wrote the story with Scottish screenwriters Claire Nicol and Mandy Lee. It was produced by Lindsay McGee.
The plot draws on a Highland legend of the Five Sisters of Kintail, a group of sisters who waited on the shore until they turned into the famous mountain range near Dornie.
In the film, the five sisters are played by local girls - two sets of real life sisters and their mutual friend.
Haig said: "The inspiration for Hula came from my observations of women in the rural community I grew up in.
"I set out to make a film about being middle-aged, divorced and long-term single in the Highlands. I wanted to bring a protagonist to life who represented these women, and take the audience on a journey that was satisfying, uplifting and joyous."
She added: "It was amazing to work with Blythe. She brings the character of Clara right off the page and makes her strong and real.
"Blythe spent a week in my home village of Dornie while we shot the film.
"We were a relatively young crew and as a veteran actor she was very generous with us. It was a fabulous week."
