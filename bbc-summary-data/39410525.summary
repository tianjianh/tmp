Coventry City: Sky Blues legend Steve Ogrizovic praises 'special' Wembley support

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry City legend Steve Ogrizovic says the size of their travelling army of supporters for Sunday's EFL Trophy final against Oxford United sums up the "special" spirit of the Sky Blues.

When Ogrizovic kept goal for City in their 1987 FA Cup final win over Tottenham, they were restricted to the regulated allocation of 25,000 tickets.
But on Sunday there will be close to 43,000 City fans heading for Wembley.
"It's a special day for all of us, the fans particularly," he told BBC Sport.
"This is a one-club city. You don't bring 40,000 to a cup final if there's not a good fan base, if there's not a real interest in the club."
City goalkeeping coach Ogrizovic, 59, will have the honour of leading the team out against Oxford.
And City's travelling support will be one of the biggest-ever followings for a club game at Wembley, bettered only by the 44,000 allocation given to winners Southampton against Carlisle United in the 2010 final.
It is all the more impressive given the struggles the Sky Blues have gone through in recent seasons.
Even if they win on Sunday, they could soon be adding their name to the list of teams to reach a Wembley final and be relegated in the same season as they are bottom of League One, and 11 points from safety.
Despite the pre-Wembley boost of two home wins in four days, the prospect of going down to English football's fourth tier for the first time since 1959 remains their likely fate.
Although Premier League relegation in 2001 after 34 years in the top flight marked the start of Coventry City's decline, the club has fallen further since the 2007 takeover by current owners Sisu, a London-based hedge fund.
After going down to League One in 2012, Sisu became involved in an ongoing off-field rent row with the city council, who were then part-owners of the Ricoh Arena.
It led to the Sky Blues spending a season playing home games in Northampton, before returning to the city to discover that Premiership rugby union club Wasps had been invited to buy the stadium - and become their new landlords.
The fans' inevitable frustration at the handling of affairs on and off the field has often boiled over into massed protest, which has been the backdrop to the current season.
"It's unfortunate what's happened," Ogrizovic told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire. "There are so many reasons and factors, I wouldn't know where to start.
"But, at some stage, this club will turn around and let's just hope Sunday is the start. This is a competition that's got its critics but, when you get into the later rounds, it's one that everyone wants to win.
"There's a lot going from Oxford too. There'll be nearly 80,000 there. They can't all be wrong.
"We're not covering up the cracks. It's been a disappointing season, there's no getting away from it. But that will be forgotten on Sunday. The fans have talked about it for ages. I've never been to the new Wembley before and it looks a bit special. Let's go down there and try to put a few smiles on faces.
"You find out about players in big competitions. How will the team react in front of a nigh-on full house? But how will Oxford react too? You just don't know until you get there."

Coventry's first-ever visit to Wembley in May 1987 could not have got off to a worse start as Clive Allen headed Tottenham in front in only the second minute of the FA Cup final from Chris Waddle's cross.
"My main memory from 1987, " said Ogrizovic, "was (chief coach) John Sillett's last words to us before we left the dressing room. 'Keep it tight for 10 minutes', he said.
"Instead, less than two minutes later, we're one down and you're thinking 'Gosh, this could be embarrassing'.
"But, in a way, that's still a useful lesson for our lads to take into Sunday. If you do go a goal down early on, don't drop your heads. We came back really strongly that day."
By the eighth minute, City were level when Keith Houchen headed on for Dave Bennett to round the advancing Ray Clemence.
Gary Mabbutt's mis-hit off Brian Kilcline put Spurs back in front before the break, but midway through the second half, City equalised again with one of Wembley's most memorable goals, Houchen's diving header from Bennett's cross - voted the 1987 BBC Goal of the Season.
Their winner was far less spectacular, Lloyd McGrath's right-wing cross looping in off Mabbutt's left knee, but it remains the club's most glorious day.
City were back at Wembley three months later, but were beaten 1-0 by Wayne Clarke's Charity Shield strike for Everton.
