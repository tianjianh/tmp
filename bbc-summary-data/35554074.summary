Leicester City 'miracle' inspires Swansea City - Guidolin

Manager Francesco Guidolin says Swansea City are inspired in their fight against Premier League relegation by Leicester's "miracle" title challenge.

Since his appointment in January, Guidolin has spoken to friend and Foxes manager Claudio Ranieri.
Swansea are four points above the relegation zone, while Leicester are five points clear at the top.
Asked if the Swans could replicate that, Guidolin said: "I hope - but Leicester's situation is a miracle."
Guidolin, 60, was named Swansea head coach in January, succeeding Garry Monk, whose final game in charge was a 3-0 home defeat to Leicester.
Since then, the Foxes have maintained their unlikely bid for the title, beating reigning champions Manchester City 3-1 last Saturday.
This time last season Leicester were bottom of the Premier League and Ranieri dismissed suggestions Leicester are title favourites after they beat Manchester City on Saturday.
"When I arrived here, two or three days afterwards Claudio called me to tell me 'welcome, croeso' [Welsh for welcome]," Guidolin joked.
"I'm happy for Claudio. This period for him is fantastic.
"I think Leicester could win the league. They are a team that's compact with a very important striker in [Jamie] Vardy.
"All the team has an important organisation and they have enthusiasm."
Former Udinese manager Guidolin's contract keeps him at the Liberty Stadium until the end of the season, with the option of another term if Swansea avoid relegation.
"At the moment I'm only thinking about these four months," he added.
"I hope to have the opportunity to improve our situation and save the season.
"I hope to remain here for a long time, but now I'm concentrating on this season."
Swansea City host Southampton in the top flight on Saturday at Liberty Stadium.
