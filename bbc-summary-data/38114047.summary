[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Heed controlled the game early on but struggled to make their dominance pay as Patrick McLaughlin and Danny Johnson spurned good chances.
Reece Thompson punished them for not taking advantage just after the half-hour mark, nipping in front to poke home Taron Hare's fierce delivery from the left.
James Bolton hit the bar with a header and Gateshead camped in the hosts' half for long periods after the break, but it was to no avail as North Ferriby climbed one place to 23rd.
