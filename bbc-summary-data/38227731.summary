Althea Efunshile, the only non-white candidate put forward by the broadcasting regulator, was rejected by culture secretary Karen Bradley.
The other four proposed candidates, all white males, were approved.
Last week Prime Minister Theresa May faced questions in Parliament over why the only BAME candidate was vetoed.
A group of more than 50 MPs also wrote to Mrs Bradley to request an explanation.
In response, Mrs Bradley said she was "in full agreement in the need to ensure our public institutions and appointments represent and reflect modern Britain".
She added: "I do, however, firmly reject any suggestion that female or BAME [Black, Asian and minority ethnic] candidates are treated unfairly in our public appointment decisions."
Karen Bradley, MP for Staffordshire Moorlands, was appointed Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport in July.
A DCMS spokesman said she had "approved four candidates on the basis that they met the specific skills and experiences set out in Ofcom's advertised job descriptions".
Althea Efunshile, who left Arts Council England this year, was made a CBE in June for services to arts and culture.
The former secondary school teacher joined the Arts Council as chief operating officer in 2007 and was appointed its deputy chief executive in 2012.
Channel 4's chief executive David Abraham said: "When combined with the many detailed issues they have raised with us over more than a year, this amounts to a worrying and unprecedented level of government interference."
