Mumbles RNLI lifeboats were called to the scene on Gower on Saturday.
Crew member Josh Stewart said the casualty, who also suffered head injuries, was in "a very difficult position" and could not be reached by the coastguard cliff rescue team.
The lifeboat was able to move him to a position where he could be winched and flown to Morriston Hospital.
