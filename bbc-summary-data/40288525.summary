Glasgow city housing development could switch council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A number of Glasgow residents could have their homes assigned to a different local authority.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People living in Cardowan, near Stepps, who currently fall under Glasgow City, want the boundary to be redrawn so they become North Lanarkshire residents.
They claimed they were disadvantaged by being in a different council area from their neighbours.
The plan, affecting 150 homes, has been put forward by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland.
It is seeking the public's views on the proposals by 6 September 2017.
The commission has proposed that the boundary be realigned at the southernmost edge of the newly-completed development.
The commission's secretary, Isabel Drummond-Murray, said: "We are particularly keen to hear from those residents and electors affected by the proposed changes, but would welcome any interested parties' views, whether in favour of the proposals or not."
It expects to report its final recommendations to the Scottish government later in 2017 or early 2018.
