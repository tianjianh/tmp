The 30-year-old was held in the city's Piccadilly Gardens on Friday evening, Greater Manchester Police said.
He was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and possession of cannabis.
GMP said officers dealt with about 600 incidents on Friday night as thousands celebrated the festive season in what has come to be known as Mad Friday.
Earlier in the evening, a man dialled 999 after waking up locked in an empty nightclub dressed only in his underpants following a Christmas party.
