Lateral Property Group has announced plans to develop land near Junction 32 of the M62, at Glasshoughton, West Yorkshire.
The plans also include a retail centre and 50-acre country park.
Tigers chairman Jack Fulton said it was an "exciting opportunity" to get a home "fit for the 21st Century".
Lateral Property Group (LPG) said it was in talks with Wakefield Council about the proposal and, subject to planning approval, construction work could begin in 2015 with the new stadium ready for the 2017 season.
LPG managing director Philip Lunn said: "We estimate that around 2,000 jobs will be created at the site, along with another 680 during construction.
"Overall, the development will see around £135 million being invested into the local community."
He said details of a public consultation would be announced "shortly".
In 2010 Castleford Tigers secured land for a new stadium but in 2012 the supermarket firm which was set to buy its ground put the move on hold.
Mr Fulton said: "A new stadium will provide the foundations of a bright new future for the club and much needed facilities for the wider Castleford community."
