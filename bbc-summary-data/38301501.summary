The first refugees arrived in the town on 9 December last year, and since then 11 refugees have settled in Ceredigion.
The mural, which was unveiled at Ysgol Gymraeg Aberystwyth, includes messages from pupils and members of the public.
It was a special collaboration between Oxfam Cymru, the artist ValÃ©riane Leblond and the school.
Pupils Cari and Steffan said they hoped everyone liked their mural of welcome.
Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of Oxfam Cymru, said: "It's been one year since the first refugees arrived to Wales, and this wonderful mural symbolises the extent of support and welcome that the people of Aberystwyth have shown the newly-arrived families."
Earlier this year, Syrian refugees gave out flowers and thanked passers-by for welcoming them to the town.
