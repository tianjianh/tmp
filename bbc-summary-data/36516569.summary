Omar Mateen targeted Orlando's Pulse club before being killed by police.
The hour-long vigil, billed as "Glasgow Stands With Pulse Orlando", is set for get under way at 17:30.
The rainbow Pride flag, a symbol of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, will also fly over the Scottish government's headquarters.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: "The #Pride flag will fly at half mast over @scotgov HQ today in memory of those whose lives were taken in #Orlando. #lovewins".
Glasgow City Council has also flown the rainbow flag at half-mast over the City Chambers in George Square, with Lord Provost Sade Docherty saying: "Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by the terrible atrocity."
After news of the shooting, which injured 53 others, emerged on Sunday, Ms Sturgeon said that "no words can convey my horror and sadness".
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who proposed to her partner Jennifer Wilson in May, wrote: "News from Orlando is shocking - people from all around the world stand with the LGBTQ community today."
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who confirmed she was gay two months ago, tweeted: "Scenes from Orlando utterly heart-breaking. The very freedom to love and dance attacked in the most brutal, destructive and senseless way."
After President Obama had called the shooting "an act of terror and hate", Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie tweeted: "The President speaks for me. We must stand together against this hate."
Omar Mateen killed at least 50 people and wounded 53 more in the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history, before being shot dead by police.
The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has since claimed responsibility for the attack.
An FBI spokesman said that Mateen had called the emergency services before the attack and sworn allegiance to IS.
His father, Seddique Mateen, said his son had been angered after seeing two men kissing in Miami.
In the aftermath of the shooting, communities around the world have been organising vigils to remembers those who were killed and injured.
Organisers of Glasgow Stands With Pulse Orlando said: "With the tragic news of the shooting at the gay club Pulse in Orlando, we're holding a vigil in George Square tomorrow evening (Monday) to show our support for LGBTQ people worldwide, and to provide a space for us to mourn with our community.
"This attack is a reflection of the violence LGBTQ people face daily, not just in the US but across the world, and this violence feels personal for many of us.
"This was a hate crime against our community, and an extension of the messages that we hear daily that we should not be visible, we should not be out, we should not exist."
The statement ended: "The inclusive support of our whole community, and of the wider Glasgow community, is vital as we mourn the loss of so many lives, and continue to fight the bigotry that allows such attacks to happen in the first place."
A similar event, "Edinburgh Stands With Orlando" is set to take place in the capital's St Andrew Square on Wednesday from 19:00 until 19:45.
Meanwhile, the SNP's Stewart McDonald, MP for Glasgow South, has asked for a minute's silence to be held in the House of Commons to remember the victims.
He tweeted: "I've written to the Speaker's office to ask that parliament be given the opportunity of a one minute silence this week following Orlando."
