A British man has been placed under formal investigation for the aggravated murder of a 34-year-old jogger in the French city of Nimes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of mother-of-three Joudia Zimmat was found with multiple stab wounds on Thursday in scrubland.
Robert Plant, 32, originally of Chatham, Kent, was arrested in connection with her death on Monday.
Being placed under formal investigation is the first step towards a criminal trial under the French legal system.
Mr Plant, who lives with his mother in Nimes, was remanded in custody after appearing before a court in the city on Wednesday.
Ms Zimmat's partially clothed body was discovered in a thicket in the Courbessac area of Nimes after her children's school alerted her partner that she had failed to pick them up.
A box cutter-style knife and two blood-stained stones found nearby are thought to have been the murder weapons.
Ms Zimmat, who is of Tunisian heritage, had three children, aged three, six and nine.
