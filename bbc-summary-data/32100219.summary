Alt Meadows, which is the city's 48th park, was developed over two years, on a 20-acre site in Croxteth.
More than 2,000 trees, nearly 4,000 shrubs and 2,100 wetland plants have been planted in the area, Liverpool City Council said.
The park also involved the diversion of a 0.6 mile (1km) section  of the River Alt and was opened by Mayor Joe Anderson.
He said: "It is a great example of how we are converting disused land into a vibrant space and making more of it accessible."
Local people chose the park's name and were involved in the planting. The area now includes accessible paths, meadow, wetland and woodland habitat.
Liverpool charity, The Cass Foundation, led the project with the Community Forest Trust.
Chairman Richard Cass said: "We hope the new park will encourage people to enjoy the fresh air, walk and cycle."
