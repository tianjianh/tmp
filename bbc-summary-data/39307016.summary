[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kylian Mbappe scored twice to take his Ligue 1 goal tally to nine in seven games as leaders Monaco beat Caen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old striker, who has been called up to the France squad for the first time, put Monaco ahead in the 13th minute after a wonderful piece of skill, turning two defenders to score.
He won a penalty just after half-time, which was scored by Fabinho, before scoring with a header late in the game.
Monaco are three points clear of Paris St-Germain, who beat Lyon 2-1.
All the goals at the Parc des Princes came in the first half, with Adrien Rabiot and Julian Draxler scoring for PSG after Alexandre Lacazette had given the visitors a seventh-minute lead.
Nice drew 1-1 with Nantes on Saturday to stay third, four points behind Unai Emery's side.
Mbappe has scored 17 goals in all competitions this season, including one in Monaco's midweek Champions League last-16 win over Manchester City.
