The 20-year-old moved to Deepdale from Cork City in January 2014 and has made 41 appearances for the club.
The Republic of Ireland youth international has also captained his country's Under-19 side.
"This new contract now just gives me the freedom to go and play again and do what I do and it's great to get it done," he told the club website.
"I think we can make a big impact in the Championship and be up there come the end of the season and I can't wait to be a part of it."
