The six-month project with the Football Association of Wales Trust, which has received funding from Arts Council of Wales, starts ahead of of the Euros.
The social documentary photographer said she wanted to show another side to Welsh football.
"The people of Wales' focus might be on Gareth Bale, Chris Coleman and the games, but I want to show a side to Welsh football that is just as important," she said.
"I'm a huge football fan so to work on this project is so exciting."
The aim of the project is to highlight the indirect impact the sport makes on people's lives.
As she travels around Wales taking photos she will also be hosting photography workshops in selected communities.
Nick Capaldi, chief executive of Arts Council of Wales, said: "Sports and the arts alike bring real benefits to individuals and make significant and positive contributions to many aspects of our lives.
"We look forward to seeing some of the stories of the devotion and passion of football supporters and participants in community groups across Wales being captured on camera."
