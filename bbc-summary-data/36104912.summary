Swansea City: Francesco Guidolin still unsure of Swans future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Francesco Guidolin insists he will know whether he will remain as long-term Swansea City manager before the end of this Premier League campaign.

The Italian, whose Swansea side are at leaders Leicester City on Sunday, was appointed in January until the end of the season to preserve their status.
Chairman Huw Jenkins, also in takeover negotiations with American investors, has been in talks with Guidolin.
''He told me in two weeks he can decide for the future," said the 60-year-old.
Former Liverpool and Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers, ex-Chile national team manager Marcello Bielsa and Carlo Ancelotti's one-time assistant at Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain Paul Clement have all been linked with the Swans job.
Swans chief Jenkins is expected to oversee an American boardroom takeover at the Liberty Stadium before the end of the season with US entrepreneurs Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan in discussions to buy a controlling stake in Wales' only English Premier League club.
But with the club's Premier League status virtually secured - 10 points from the relegation zone with four games remaining - attention is now on Guidolin's future.
"For me it is not important," he maintains. "I am sure in two weeks or 10 days, the chairman will tell me his decision.
''It is important to save Swansea City.
"My only idea is to finish the season well because our opponents in the next few weeks - with Leicester first and the other big teams - have important targets.
"It is important for us to achieve our target and finish well, my players feel the same. My future is not important.''
Swansea finish their Premier League season with four of the Premier League's top seven teams.
Europa League semi-finalists Liverpool and Champions League semi-finalists Manchester City visit the Liberty in between Swans trips to Leicester and European-chasing West Ham.
