The Hammers will assess Aaron Cresswell's tight hamstring and Cheikhou Kouyate's dead leg, but Diafra Sakho  and Angelo Ogbonna remain out.
West Brom defender Jonny Evans returns after missing five games with a calf injury.
Midfielder Claudio Yacob is also fit after recovering from stomach cramps.
Simon Brotherton: "This is a match between two sides who are going well in the Premier League - but who may find it hard to improve much on their current positions.
"West Ham have won six of the last nine league matches but they were thrashed 4-0 by Manchester City in their last home game, while West Brom were stung by the same scoreline at Tottenham last month on their most recent visit to London.
"Albion have generally been solid though and have only lost once to a team currently outside the top seven all season, in September's 1-0 defeat at Bournemouth.
"West Ham were in the midst of their early-season struggles when they lost heavily at The Hawthorns in the reverse fixture. This game should be much tighter."

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic on striker Andy Carroll: "He brings you everything, everything that you could ask from a centre-forward.
"He is great in the air, he is very physical, has a great touch and a great sense to combine with other players by playing the ball off.
"I don't know if [England boss] Gareth Southgate is a big fan, but when Andy is playing like that every manager would like to have him in his team or squad.
"Andy would help any team. Andy would help the German team, Andy would help the Croatian team, the Spanish team, because he is a top player."
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis: "They [West Ham] are a good team, they've got some good players.
"They've had a season of being very, very good and pretty bad at times and we just go there and hope we can compete.
"We'll have to - with [Andy] Carroll back now, they look a handful."
Both teams are ticking along nicely in the top half, and West Ham are showing what a good team they are now the Dimitri Payet saga is over.
The Baggies have got some talented players too but, away from home, their approach is to try to shut up shop.
Prediction: 1-1
