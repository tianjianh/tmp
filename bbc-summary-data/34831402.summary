The makers of children's TV programmes Spot, Humf and Deer Little Forest previously announced plans to develop a new series from a base on Skye.
It also emerged last month that it will hold free workshops for artists next month and in January as part of an effort to create a local workforce.
Gaelic language college Sabhal MÃ²r Ostaig UHI will host the training.
King Rollo Films said the new animated series, which will be offered in Gaelic and English, could be ready within three years.
The studio's Leo Nielsen said: "This is just the start. We hope to create an animation unit that will develop and expand in years to come, producing films to entertain families around the world.
"In the process, it will create exciting and sustainable creative jobs rooted in the Highlands."
Amanda Millen, Gaelic-speaking director of the XpoNorth network which is supporting the training programme, said: "This is exactly the kind of ambitious project which should be taking root in places such as Skye.
"We are very happy to be in at the start, helping turn it all into a reality."
