Jessica Chisnall, 15, was hit by the bike on Ashton's Green Drive in St Helens as she walked home from school on 13 January.
She suffered a severe head injury which resulted in bleeding on the brain.
Her parents, Carl and Sara Chisnall, said their "smiling, laughing" daughter had "a long road to recovery".
They said Jessica, who was due to take her GCSE exams this summer, "suffered a very severe head injury" with "eye socket injuries and deep cuts from head to toe".
She remains in the neurology department at Alder Hey Children's Hospital.
Police said two males were arrested and released on bail, and appealed for witnesses to come forward.
"The depth of some of her injuries are still unknown so we are unsure how this will affect her in the future", her parents said.
"We have not left her side and are sleeping with her."
They described Jessica as a studious girl who is full of energy and very close to her two big sisters.
"We say she is like the Tasmanian devil with all her energy. She will help anyone and has a heart of gold," they added.
They thanked well wishers for their support and said Jessica was currently stable and "taking very small steps on to the road to recovery".
