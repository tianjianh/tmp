Chris Norton, who is uploading the photos to Twitter account @UrineWatch, said he noticed men repeatedly using the wall at his premises as a toilet.
The businessman, based in Bradford Street, Walsall, said he was shocked to find it happening up to five times every day.
Walsall Council is investigating.

Mr Norton, who uses the hashtag #walsallwee, said: "It's been happening for more than two months and I reported it to the council but nothing happened.
"So I decided I had to take action myself because it was getting very depressing to see.
"I thought it was just happening at weekends, but when I saw the footage it was actually happening up to five times a day."
Deputy council leader Adrian Andrew said the authority is looking to establish a public space protection order in the town centre to combat anti-social behaviour.
"Officers are gathering information, which includes Mr Norton's evidence, and talking to other businesses in the area and the police to determine our next course of action," he said.
"Both myself and the majority of residents in Walsall are proud of this town. We've worked damn hard to attract investment here and I'm not going to allow the behaviour of a few to cause such a stink."
