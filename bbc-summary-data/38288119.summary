[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The closure of more small schools in Dumfries and Galloway has been identified as an area for consideration to meet education spending targets.

A report to councillors identifies a series of options to be examined as part of the budget-setting process.
Reducing property costs is one area which has been flagged up.
Instrumental tuition is another potential target although it has already seen its funding cut and fees introduced for lessons.
Other possible options to curb spending include making deeper cuts to discretionary school budgets as well as increasing some savings already identified.
The council report outlines a savings target of Â£1.65m for the financial year 2017/18 with nearly Â£1m of efficiencies recommended.
However, it said that "restrictions to flexibility" meant a shortfall of about Â£700,000 in meeting targets.
Among the areas which could be considered is the closure of schools.
"Members may feel there needs to be a reduction in school estate," said the report.
"Schools with low utilisation have been identified and discussions have taken place with some schools and parent councils."
It said that process could be "escalated" while taking into account consultation requirements.
The council confirmed the closure of three schools in the region earlier this year.
The Scottish government decided not to call in decisions to shut Mouswald and Drochduil primaries along with the Elmbank Centre in Dumfries.
