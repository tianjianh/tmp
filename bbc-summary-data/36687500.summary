[SN]TITLE[SN]
East Anglian councils agree to pursue regional devolution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nineteen councils across East Anglia are to proceed with plans for regional devolution despite four Norfolk authorities rejecting the plans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposals are for a combined authority covering in Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire.
They include the creation of a regional mayor responsible for powers devolved from Whitehall.
Andy Woods, negotiator for the councils, said: "The appetite for devolution... remains strong."
Breckland, Norwich, North Norfolk and Great Yarmouth councils have rejected the proposals but the 19 others have agreed to start statutory consultations.
John Fuller of South Norfolk Council, said: "It's the most generous deal of all the devolution deals yet announced in the whole country and who knows if the public are absolutely unanimous in their support or there is substantial agreement it is possible the dissenting councils may actually decide the benefits are there."
