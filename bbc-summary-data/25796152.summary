Tributes to Komla Dumor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tributes have been paid to BBC TV presenter Komla Dumor, who died suddenly at his London home on Saturday at the age of 41. It is thought he suffered a heart attack. A Ghanaian, Dumor joined the BBC in 2007 and became a presenter for BBC World News and its Focus on Africa programme. Here are a selection of comments sent in by readers or posted on Twitter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Our nation has lost one of its finest ambassadors. @BBCkomladumor was a broadcaster of exceptional quality and Ghana's gift to the world. Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama @JDMahama via Twitter
With Komla Dumor's sudden and tragic death, Africa has lost one of its brightest young talents. Komla was an inspirational journalist, always determined to find the facts and report on the truth. I shall miss his smile and wonderful sense of humour. May his soul rest in peace. Kofi Annan, former UN Secretary General
Komla was the trailblazer of modern radio journalism in Ghana. He was the icon, most of us local journalists looked up to, for inspiration. May he rest in peace.  Justice Lee Adoboe, Accra, Ghana
As a fellow Ghanaian I'm saddened to hear the death of Komla Dumor. As a child growing up in Ghana I always listened to his shows on the local radio and when I moved to London I was honoured to have met him in person whilst at work. It's very very sad to hear this news today. My prayers are with his family.   Maximus, London
I first met Komla while we were both students at the University of Ghana around 2000-2001. He was working at JOY FM while still studying at the time. He was affable, friendly and had a good sense of humour... He made a mark on radio journalism in Ghana, and was a great source of inspiration for many Ghanaian youth, especially, those who wanted to get into radio. May his soul rest in peace.    Emmanuel, New York City, USA
It is a sad day today, we have lost a talented journalist. I am still in shock. A true representation of Africa, strong, a true gentleman, a go getter. You will be missed Komla. Rickie Davies, Ghana
I never knew him personally but always looked forward to his posts on Facebook. My Facebook page will not be the same without him. Every Ghanaian loved him and we still do. Forever in our hearts. My sympathies to his wife, children and entire family. Life is really unpredictable. Rest in Peace   Benjamin Tetteh, Accra, Ghana
We have lost a truly dedicated and illustrious journalist...Working for the BBC, Komla was a delight to listen to; very knowledgeable and inquisitive at the same time. In his prime, we have lost him painfully. Who will now speak for Africa as a true African? Augustine Adams, Accra, Ghana
I remember his coverage at the world cup 2010. The time he took off his shirt to reveal the Ghanaian football team jersey he was putting on. He was a light indeed to many particularly African journalists. He will be greatly missed for his tireless effort in journalism. Anderson Chinorumba, Gaborone, Botswana
Here was truly a shining star of Africaâ€¦ a beacon of Africa's warm and sunshine. Komla was Africa in every essence. I think wherever Komla is now he is smiling because he left a mark on this world. I think he has joined other great spirits, my fatherâ€¦We should be glad that they came into our lives, even for a short while. Nelson Mandela's daughter, Makaziwe, who was interviewed by Komla shortly after her father's death
Komla swept into the world, stylish and sure, with his big chuckle, the light in his eyes, a genuine goodwill for people, a familiarity with laughter. He had no false modesty, yet an endearing insecurity lurked beneath his flair-filled confidence. He had, too, something close to innocence, a wonderful capacity for wonder. And now he is gone. We have lost a star. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Nigerian author, writing in Nigeria's Premium Times
Komla was evidently one of Africa's finest broadcast journalists. Whether with "Focus on Africa, or "Africa Business Report", he treated burning continental issues with a light-hearted flair, and yet a critical approach that incarnated a true spirit of Pan-Africanism and African Renaissance. Komla is truly one of Africa's brightest stars that just got extinguished. He will greatly be missed. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, African Union Commission chairperson
For us Africans, we feel very proud when news about Africa are conveyed by an African... and Mr Komla Dumor did an excellent job. There is no doubt he got that job not because he was an African, but because he was highly qualified. Therefore he brought great honour to Africa... This is a great loss to us all in Africa. Ombeni Sefue, Chief Secretary to Tanzania's president
His insightful commitment to convey to the rest of the world the heart of Africa was always noteworthy. I have valued and appreciated the interaction I had with Komla over the years and I will miss him. Pravin Gordhan, South Africa's Minister of Finance
Mr Dumor brought to the world the hope, vision, plight, and challenges of Africa in an understandable manner with his unique perspectives, interviews and coverage of stories that no other network covered.  I am sorry to learn of his passing.  My thanks to his family and BBC for sharing him with the world.  My sympathies to his family, friends, colleagues and fans. Denise Sangster, San Francisco, California
I loved this enthusiastic and dedicated man. My heart goes out to his family and friends in this tragic time. Hard to believe I will not see his smiling face and down to earth assessments of his home roots, Africa, again. A tragedy and one which I trust BBC will honour and respect to the best of their ability. Amongst all of the BBC's many great and famous human assets, Komla Dumor's name should today be irrevocably established. Jimbo, Pattaya, Thailand
I am in deep shock, hearing of the early death of Komla Dumor. He added a different aspect on the world's developing stories, somehow making many, pleasant and more understandable, even with sensitive subjects. He will be really be missed by the viewing audience. Jack Wolstenholme, Kranevo, Bulgaria
Komla has left a legacy in a media arena and  a better understanding of Africans stories. He will be dearly miss by everyone. He was a true symbol of hope for those want to make change in people life through media. David-Mayen, Juba,  South  Sudan
Komla was the embodiment of the vibrancy and the strength of the BBC's relationship with the audience in Africa. In recent years, Komla's presence and expertise has been appreciated even more widely, across the world and into the UK. It is hard to imagine the newsroom without him. Peter Horrocks, Global News Director
It is hard to believe that Komla is no longer with us because, in every way, he was larger than life.  He had such an infectious enthusiasm for life, for Africa, for the story.  He was an inspiring journalist, both on screen and off it. James Harding, Director of News and Current Affairs
Our BBC family tonight mourns loss of one of our brightest & best - Komla Dumor. Big heart, big personality, brilliant broadcaster.  Tweet from Mishal Husain,  BBC News presenter @MishalHusainBBC
I first met "Do More" as I often called him, when I was producing and editing Network Africa in 2007. Komla was every producer's dream. He delivered every assignment diligently. He came into the organisation and broke barriers. He reached for the stars and inspired many of us to do the same. I'll remember Komla as a man who understood that he had a bigger purpose and he therefore didn't allow his mission to be destructed by petty issues. He was so focused on everything he did. Rachael Akidi, Focus on Africa radio editor
For me Komla epitomised excellence - the thoroughness he put into preparing for each programme. Working with him was a brilliant learning curve. I miss him terribly and I'll never forget. Thanks KD. Adieu. Peter Okwoche, BBC Focus on Africa TV presenter
RIP Komla Dumor. Far too young to pass. Kay Burley of Sky News @KayBurley via Twitter
BBC World TV's Komla Dumor dies - so very sad. A nice and talented  man. And so young. Kevin Bakhurst, Managing Director, RTE News and Current Affairs, former Controller BBC News Channel @kevinbakhurst via Twitter
#KomlaDumor brought huge energy and humour to the #BBC's reporting from #Africa. He had such character and enthusiasm.
I just can't believe it. I didn't know him well. But we chatted at a party last night and he seemed entirely fine. Stunned.
