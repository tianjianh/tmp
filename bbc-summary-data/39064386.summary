A struggling Harris Tweed mill business on the Isle of Lewis has been sold to new owners for £1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carloway Mill almost went into administration at the beginning of last year before being offered for sale.
It has been bought by The Carloway Mill Ltd and its two directors, Anthony Loftus and the mill's former production manager Annie MacDonald.
The deal means the mill's 17 employees, who have been working a three-day week, can be retained.
The Carloway Mill Ltd is a new business set up to secure the future of the mill.
Ms MacDonald told BBC Alba: "We are hopeful that we will get orders through.
"Because of the uncertainty over the mill it has been difficult, but we are getting back out there and we are hopeful."
