[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ernesto Valverde will not coach Athletic Bilbao next season, the Basque club announced, with strong speculation he is to take over at Barcelona.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu says he will announce on Monday the board's decision about who will replace Luis Enrique.
Former Barca player Valverde, 53, guided Athletic to eighth place in La Liga this season.
He previously managed Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol.
At a news conference to confirm he was leaving Bilbao, Valverde said: "Right now I have no commitment to any team even though there are teams that have been interested in me.
"Athletic is my club, first I say goodbye to them and then I'll think of another team.
"I will not talk about other teams here and now."
