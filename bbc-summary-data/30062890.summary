Strictly's Ola Jordan and Steve Backshall have dismissed talk of problems in their partnership.

There have been claims she had been bullying him because he was struggling with his steps.
Until now the pair had remained silent about reports Steve had apparently asked not to be left alone with Ola.
Steve said:  "We have pretty much the same work ethic and attack everything with the same sort of vigour."
He added: "She is fierce, but in a way that we both want to achieve" and insisted "it's been going great".
Jordan's husband and former dancer on the show, James Jordan, tweeted his support for his wife and accused the BBC of trying to turn the public against her.
Ola said James can do whatever he wants and is "very vocal".
This all came about because of a story in a newspaper claiming someone close to the show had said: "Steve is a very bouncy personality, up for any challenge, but Ola's harsh treatment has flattened him and made him lose confidence.
"She was very rude and impatient when he found it difficult to master the shapes for last Saturday's Charleston" and "Steve resorted to asking other people to show him what he had to do".
The pair will take to the floor in Blackpool in one of the big shows of the series at the town's famous Tower Ballroom.
Co-host Claudia Winkleman will miss this weekend's spectacular so she can remain at her daughter's bedside as she recovers from burns.
Zoe Ball is expected to present the show for third consecutive week.
Strictly Come Dancing is on BBC1 Saturday night at 7pm.
