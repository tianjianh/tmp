A faultless show jumping round from Astier Nicolas secured first place.
Runners-up Germany, bronze medallists Australia, and New Zealand were all in contention going into the final round.
Great Britain accrued just four penalties in the show jumping phase of the three-event competition, but finished fifth after struggling in the cross country on Monday.
The individual medals will be decided later on Tuesday, with the final round starting at 18:00 BST.
