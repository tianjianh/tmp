Aaron Mooy: Huddersfield Town agree club-record £10m fee with Man City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premier League newcomers Huddersfield Town have agreed a club-record £10m fee for Manchester City's Australia midfielder Aaron Mooy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mooy, 26, spent last season on loan at Huddersfield and played in their play-off final win over Reading, which secured them a place in the top flight.
It is thought the fee will be made up of an £8m initial payment, plus a further £2m in add-ons.
There are also buy-back and sell-on clauses included in the deal.
Mooy joined City from Australian club Melbourne City 12 months ago on a three-year contract.
He has not made a senior appearance for Pep Guardiola's side.
