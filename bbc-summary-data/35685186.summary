He was struck by an upright section of the post, which narrowly missed a group of people when it came "crashing down" at Shrewsbury Rugby Club.
The 46-year-old had been watching his son play for the under-12s visiting side, Oswestry.
The club, which has suspended all matches, said he was now "conscious and speaking" and under observation.
Meanwhile, Shropshire Council said its public protection team was investigating the incident.

The Rugby Football Union has been informed and the club said all games would be postponed until safety checks were carried out.
Nigel Dolman, a BBC reporter who was at the ground, spoke to spectators who had seen the accident.
"Part of the upright post came crashing down, narrowly missing a group of spectators, and hit the man on the head," he said.
He said there had been a "light wind" but the incident was not thought to be weather-related.
The reporter, who helped carry the ambulance trolley across the muddy field, said about 15 to 20 people had been watching the match.
An off-duty hospital trauma specialist, who had been watching a different game, treated the man until paramedics arrived.
An ambulance crew were at the scene just after 11:50 GMT and took the victim to Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.
Club chairman Giles Alton, who has been speaking to the man's wife at the hospital, wished him a speedy recovery. He said the exact nature of his injuries was not yet known.
