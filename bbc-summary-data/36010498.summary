McCormack had 61 seconds to spare from Deirdre Byrne as she won in 33 minutes and 30 seconds as Maria McCambridge completed an all-Irish podium.
Wicklow woman McCormack ran the Olympic 10,000m mark in the US last weekend.
Britain's Andy Maud won the men's race in 29:55 ahead of Irish pair Mick Clohisey and Kevin Maunsell.
Olympic Games marathon hopeful Clohisey was five seconds behind Maud with Maunsell a further 23 seconds in arrears as the athletes had to battle windy conditions at the Phoenix Park.
Sunday's event, which attracted almost 8,000 runners, honoured the memory of late Ballymena & Antrim athletics club great Sean Kyle.
Great Ireland Run organiser, former Irish international athlete Gareth Turnbull came up with of incorporating a team match into the event which would pay tribute to the renowned coach, who formed a remarkable partnership with his wife, the three-time Olympian Maeve Kyle at the Ballymena & Antrim club.
The team component saw an Ireland line-up which included McCormack, lifting the inaugural Sean Kyle Cup, as they defeated a Commonwealth select
The mixing of the sport's grassroots and elite athletes is something that would have delighted Ballymena athletics doyen Kyle, who died after a long illness last November.
Sunday's meeting also included a Great Ireland Mile event won by Irish international John Travers in four minutes and 11 seconds which left him ahead of British runners John Ashcroft (4:13) and Phillip Sesemann (4:16).
Thomas Frazer and Kerry O'Flaherty took the victories at the Titanic Quarter 10K in a windy Belfast on Sunday.
Belfast man Frazer, who will run the London Marathon in two weeks in the hope of booking his Olympic Games Rio, had five seconds to spare from Gary Murray as he triumphed in 30 minutes and 48 seconds.
"I am really happy with that. I am in the form of my life and will be adopting an all or nothing stance in London to make the team for Rio," said Frazer, 34.
Lisburn's Chris Madden finished third in 31:31 which left him eight seconds ahead of fourth-placed  Conor Duffy, who won last year's men's race.
Olympic Games-qualified O'Flaherty won the women's event in 34:17 which left her 14 seconds ahead of runner-up and last year's winner Ann-Marie McGlynn.
Laura Graham took third in 35:21 with Olympic Games marathon hopeful Gladys Ganiel fourth in 36:07.
"I knew this would be tight especially as 10K is over my distance," said O'Flaherty.
"However I have really been working on my stamina to assist in the last kilometre of the steeplechase and it paid off today.
"I am now going to altitude training in France in preparation for track races in June in the build-up to Rio."
