Scotland's 'best and worst' beaches revealed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Water quality at 17 Scottish beaches have been classed as "excellent" against new, much stricter European standards.

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said 80% of Scottish beaches passed the standard as "excellent", "good" or "sufficient".
However, 17 beaches are now rated as "poor" under the new system.
Sepa measured the quality of water at 84 "officially designated bathing waters" across Scotland.
Many beaches likely to have good water quality - for instance in the Western Isles - are not officially designated and so the pollutants are not monitored there.
The new EU classification system includes four years' of monitoring data which Sepa said provided a "more consistent picture" of water quality.

The new classifications will be displayed at the beaches from May until mid-September.
This summer, Sepa said it would also be extending its network of electronic signs - which provide daily real-time water quality information - to six new beaches.
The agency is also preparing improvement plans to help poorly-rated beaches with the aim they would meet at least the "sufficient" standard by 2020.
Calum McPhail, Sepa's environmental quality manager, said: "We understand that some local communities will be disappointed, as we are, that 17 bathing waters have been rated as having a 'poor' EU classification, and many will be concerned when the new classifications are displayed on these beaches for the first time this month.
"It is important to remember that a 'poor' classification does not necessarily mean that water quality is continually poor, and in many cases this is due to historic episodes of reduced water quality following heavy rainfall. These are still fantastic beaches to visit."
Mr McPhail added that Scottish bathing waters had been increasing in number and quality since monitoring began in 1988.
VisitScotland said marine recreation and tourism expenditure was worth an estimated Â£3.7bn a year to Scotland.
A spokesman added: "We are pleased that the vast majority of bathing waters are classified as sufficient or above, while 65% have an excellent or good classification.
"It is very disappointing, however, to hear that the water quality at some beaches have not met Sepa bathing water standards and we will be discussing the potential impact this could have on tourism with the organisations involved."
