Steve Baker, from Mencap, said they had reported the issue to the "relevant local authority safeguarding team".
It took the wellbeing of the people in its care "extremely seriously" he said, adding: "What we see here would fall well below that standard."
The BBC has contacted the woman but has not received a response.
The photograph is believed to have been taken in Leicestershire and was subsequently shown to Mencap.
The charity has confirmed it has suspended the woman.
