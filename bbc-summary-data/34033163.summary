[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staff at the National Museum of Scotland are set to begin seven days of strike action on Monday.

The move is part of a union campaign, now in its 18th month, over the removal of a weekend allowance from new members of staff.
The action comes just as the city is at its busiest for the Edinburgh Festival.
The Public and Commercial Services union said 120 members were due to strike following the collapse of talks with National Museums Scotland (NMS).
An NMS spokesman said the action was likely to cause disruption to both the National Museum of Scotland and the National War Museum.
Union officials said the weekend pay changes had created two rates for staff, those who get the allowance because they were employed before 2011, and those who do not.
Officials said withdrawal of the allowance could reduce an individual's pay by Â£2,000 to Â£3,000.
