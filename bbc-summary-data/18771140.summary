Carl Cope, 47, was admitted to Walsall Manor Hospital with chest pains. Eleven hospital workers have been suspended following the incident.
Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust and the ambulance service have confirmed they are investigating.
Paul Cope said he had never known his brother to go to the doctors.
Mr Cope said: "It's a massive shock, it's heartbreaking - I'd argued with him that morning [he went into hospital] about his dog.
"He had just talked about chest pains, I've never known him go to the doctors or the hospital.
"He'd phoned the paramedics and gone to hospital but never came back out."
The trust confirmed seven staff members, including nurses and porters, had been suspended and West Midlands Ambulance service said four members of ambulance staff had been suspended.
They have been suspended over claims they did not rush to help Mr Cope on the site of Walsall Manor Hospital on 23 June.
A spokesman from the ambulance service has said the investigation is expected to be completed within the next two weeks.
