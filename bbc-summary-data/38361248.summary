[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A drab first-half saw little goal threat at either end despite the Welsh side dominating proceedings.
In a brighter second period, Wrexham goalkeeper Shwan Jalal pulled off good saves from two Andrai Jones' headers.
The hosts took all three points when right-back Edwards sneaked in to force home a cross from Paul Rutherford on 88 minutes.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales:  "It was the perfect result. Performance-wise it was not where we wanted to be, but I would say it was all about getting the result today not about the performance.
"They worked hard, it was a bit scrappy, a bit nervy. But we got the goal and it was all about the three points in the end."
