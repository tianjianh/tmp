Three men have been charged with the murder of 14-year-old Jordan Watson, who was found dead in a Carlisle cemetery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police named the men as Brahnn Finley and Daniel Johnston, both 19, and 18-year-old George Thomson.
The trio, all from Carlisle, will appear at the magistrates' court there on Monday.
Jordan died from neck and head wounds caused by a sharp implement in what police called a "brutal attack".
He was discovered by a member of the public on Tuesday in Upperby Cemetery.
"Police would like to thank the public for all their help with recent appeals," Cumbria Constabulary said in a statement.
A 16-year-old boy who had been arrested on Thursday was released on bail on Friday, and officers said they did not believe he was "directly involved in the murder".
