Blues players hoisted the injured Ivorian from the Stamford Bridge pitch in the first half of his final game - a 3-1 win over Sunderland on Sunday.
Drogba, 37, first signed for the club in 2004 and has scored a total of 164 goals in 381 appearances.
"In order to play more football I feel I need to go to another club," he said.
He told Chelsea's website: "I want to play for at least one more season."
Drogba scored a late equaliser and the decisive spot-kick in the penalty shoot-out against Bayern Munich in the 2012 Champions League final.
Blues boss Jose Mourinho re-signed the forward in 2014 on a one-year deal after he left Galatasaray as a free agent.
Voted the club's greatest ever player in a fans' poll in 2012, Drogba then had a spell with Shanghai Shenhua in China before helping Galatasaray to a Turkish league title in 2013.
He returned to Stamford Bridge to "make more history" and this season collected his fourth Premier League winner's medal and third League Cup medal.
Drogba, who signed from Marseille for Â£24m 11 years ago, has now won 12 trophies in two spells at Chelsea.
He added: "All the fans know my love for Chelsea and I hope to be back here in the future in another role.
"This group of players gave me the best present. I came back and have won the league and today is a big celebration. We deserve it."
