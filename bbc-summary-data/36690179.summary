The Weymouth-based 29-year-old succeeds Sir Ben Ainslie, who won the previous three titles, and will now join the ex-Olympian's 2017 America's Cup team.
"It's an amazing achievement for Giles. He really has been totally dominant," Ainslie told BBC South Today.
Scott's victory gave Great Britain their 17th gold medal of the Games.

The champion took an unassailable lead going into Tuesday's medal race, winning three of the 11 races in the competition.
Ainslie added: "To win gold without having to even compete in the medal races is rare."
Scott came second in the final race and finished with a total score of 36 points. Slovenia's Vasilij Zbogar took silver with 68 points and USA's Caleb Paine, who won the final race, finished third with 76 points.

Scott said on Monday: "It's been a long road. I campaigned properly for London, missed out on the qualification for that and was bitterly disappointed.
"Watching all of my friends racing at the Olympics and get medals wasn't easy, but the amazing thing that came off the back of it was a desire to right the wrongs I felt I made, and to put together a campaign I could be proud of and just really work my ass off for three years."
