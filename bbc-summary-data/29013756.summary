[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Belgium international striker Jelle Vossen, 25, arrives on a season-long loan from Genk, where he has scored 105 goals in 244 games.
Winger Yanic Wildschut, 22, is a former Netherlands Under-21 international and has signed for an undisclosed fee on an initial two-year contract.
Boro have also captured Chelsea goalkeeper Jamal Blackman, 20, on loan until 17 January.
The deals are subject to Football League and international clearance.
Vossen, who has been at Genk for his entire career so far, scored 13 times as the club finished sixth in the Belgian top flight last season.
He made international debut in 2009 and has two goals from 12 appearances.
Wildschut is a graduate of the academy at Ajax and has also previously featured for FC Zwolle and VVV-Venlo, as well as having a loan spell last season with Eredivisie side Den Haag.
His deal at the Riverside Stadium has an option for a further 12 months.
"Middlesbrough have been interested in me for a long time, but I wasn't ready to take the step a few years ago," Wildschut said.
"When I heard they wanted me again, I knew straight away I wanted to come here."
