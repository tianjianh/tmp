The 26-year-old had been due to hold talks about his future with head coach Lee Johnson but has chosen to move on in search of regular playing time.
"He's a lovely lad and I didn't really want to lose him because he's great in the dressing room," Johnson said.
"I felt I would find it difficult to promise him the number of games he wants at this stage of his career."
Wagstaff made only one league start in 2015-16, scoring his only goal as a sub in a 6-0 thrashing of Bolton.
