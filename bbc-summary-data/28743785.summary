Husband survived suicide pact, wife's inquest hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A husband survived a suicide pact in which his wife died, ending her suffering from illness, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Brown cared for his wife Helen, 71, who suffered from a long-term depressive illness and the eye-condition nystagmus.
The couple, of Liss, Hampshire, agreed to take their lives together after she made several unsuccessful attempts.
Portsmouth coroner David Horsley recorded a narrative verdict.
As the couple spoke about killing themselves at the same time, Mr Brown was not prosecuted for aiding a suicide.
Det Sgt Glyn White, of Hampshire Police, said the Browns visited known suicide spots such as Beachy Head but were concerned about the impact on other people.
On 8 November last year, they took a cocktail of drugs at their home and created noxious fumes.
They wrote suicide letters and left a voicemail message for family.
Emergency services found Mr Brown in a dazed condition.
His wife died in the bath. Post-mortem tests showed the cause of death as carbon monoxide poisoning.
Mr Brown was arrested but was released without charge.
Mr Horsley recorded a narrative verdict that Mrs Brown died as a willing participant in a suicide pact.
He said: "She was an intelligent lady and she could see what was happening to her and I can quite understand why she might not want to her life to go on.
"I can only say how deeply sorry I am."
