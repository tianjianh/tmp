Harriet Millar-Mills returns to the second row to replace Abbie Scott, who sustained a knee injury in the 20-13 victory over Wales.
The winner of the match at Stade de la Rabine will be crowned champions, while victory for England would also secure them the Grand Slam.
England lead coach Scott Bemand said he expected a "hard" and "physical" match.
France have won their last nine home games in the tournament since England beat them in Paris in 2012.
"We set a high bar for ourselves and we are where we wanted to be at this point in the tournament," Bemand said.
"Our ambition is to go to France and win. France will step up their physicality. We're ready for that but remember, they've got to deal with us."
England:  Katie Mason, Lydia Thompson, Lauren Cattell, Ceri Large, Lotte Clapp, Amber Reed, La Toya Mason, Rochelle Clark, Emma Croker, Vickii Cornborough, Emily Braund, Tamara Taylor, Harriet Millar-Mills, Izzy Noel-Smith, Sarah Hunter
Replacements: Amy Cokayne, Heather Kerr, Bianca Dawson, Poppy Leitch, Poppy Cleall, Bianca Blackburn, Leanne Riley, Ruth Laybourn
