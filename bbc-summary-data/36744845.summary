Up to 200,000 golf fans from around the world are expected to attend next week's event.
The temporary air restriction order has been put in place for the duration of the tournament, meaning personal drones will not be allowed.
This means no aircraft other than an air ambulance or police helicopter can fly below 2,000ft within the area.
Flights taking off and landing at Prestwick airport and under the charge of Air Traffic Control are not included in the restriction.
Police said the restriction had been put in place for the safety of both the spectators and players.
A police spokesman said: "In line with events of this nature, to ensure public safety and minimise disruption to the local community a number of restrictions are in place. In the coming days we will make use of our social media accounts to raise awareness on these."
As well as the restriction on drones there are a number of traffic restrictions and road closures and police have advised visitors to check ahead of their journey.
