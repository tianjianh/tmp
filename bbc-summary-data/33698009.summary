The US justice department said Harlem Suarez, also known as Almlak Benitez, has been charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.
He allegedly planned to bury a bomb containing nails at a beach in Key West and detonate it with a mobile phone.
Prosecutors claim he was inspired by the Islamic State militant group, which has called for attacks on the West.
According to the FBI, Suarez recorded a video in May in which he said: "We will destroy America and divide it into two. We will raise our black flag on top of your White House and any president on duty."
Officials say he first came to the attention of the FBI in April after posting extremist messages on Facebook.
He was caught after buying a fake device from an FBI agent in a sting operation on Monday.
Several young men have been arrested in the US in recent months, with many plotting attacks in the name of the Islamic State group.
