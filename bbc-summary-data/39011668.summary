[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wigan Athletic 0-0 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling Wigan and Nottingham Forest played out an uneventful goalless draw at the DW Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a first half lacking in quality, Forest winger Mustapha Carayol's effort was the only shot on target.
Dan Burn had a close-range shot blocked for Wigan just after the break, before Eric Lichaj curled just wide for the visitors from outside the box.
Carayol forced another save towards the end of the game but both teams had to settle for a point.
With Bristol City drawing at Newcastle, the Latics remain in the final relegation place and are two points from safety, while Forest are still not out of danger as they stay six points above them.
Wigan have won just three Championship games in front of their own fans this season and have scored in only 18 of their 34 league matches.
The draw ends a three-game losing run for Gary Brazil's side, who had won their first four matches under his tenure.
Wigan manager Warren Joyce:
"Some of those players have played every minute of every game - it's not a massive squad. Some of the younger ones, the fitness levels are not the same as the experienced players.
"Lads are coming in because they're not playing at other clubs - they're not coming in ready-made, ready to go, they're not up to the level of 35, 32-year-olds here because they haven't been playing, they're not battle-hardened.
"There's a side issue of getting all those lads up to speed. The fresher ones might not actually be as fit as the ones playing every week."
Nottingham Forest boss Gary Brazil:
"I don't think about how many points we need.
"I think there's 12 games to go and we'll take as many points as we can out of those games. I think there will be an ability for us to get stronger as we go through the season.
"It's not something I'm considering or thinking about. We will get fitter, stronger, work harder and the points will come for us."
