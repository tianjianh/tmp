The aircraft took off from Newtownards air field at 12:00 BST on Friday.
A sudden engine malfunction meant it would not climb so the pilot brought it down safely in a nearby field close to the Moate Road, between Newtownards and Comber.
Police said the pilot and his passenger were "safe and well".
Some damage was caused to the microlight's front wheel during the landing.
Emergency services were called to the scene and police said an air accident investigation team is due to begin an inquiry.
The owner of the microlight, who is a flight instructor but was not flying the aircraft, said a large part of small plane training focuses on pilots being able to make safe landings away from airfields.
