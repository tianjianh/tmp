Detectives investigating the murder of a woman in her home in Doncaster Lane, Penkhull, Stoke-on-Trent, have charged 73-year-old David Powell.
While the body has not been formally identified, she is believed to be Mr Powell's mother, Cecilia Powell.
Mr Powell, of Longton Road, Barlaston, will appear before magistrates at Newcastle-under-Lyme on Saturday.
Detective Inspector Andy Maxfield from Staffordshire Police said "At this stage of the investigation we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident. We will complete our forensic examination of the home later today [Friday] and we expect a Home Office post-mortem to take place tomorrow."
Police arrested Mr Powell after they were called to the home in Doncaster Lane at 20:00 BST on Thursday night.
Family liaison officers are working to support family members affected by the death.
