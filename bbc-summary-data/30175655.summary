Blair Cowan hopes his displays in the autumn Tests have convinced any doubters that he is good enough for Scotland.

The London Irish back row was man-of-the-match in Saturday's win over Tonga at Rugby Park.
"It's always something I wanted to do, not just turn up and play but prove myself and prove I'm worthy of the jersey," he said.
"Getting the man-of-the-match is something I'll always remember."
Cowan scored a try in the 37-12 triumph over Tonga, having also played in the win over Argentina and the narrow loss to New Zealand.
"I take each Test match as it comes and I think I'm progressing slowly," Cowan told BBC Scotland.
"I still think I've got a lot to offer but I hope people accept I'm worthy to wear the jersey.
"You've always got parts of your game you want to pick up, and there's been a few slight errors I'd like to improve on.
"I don't think any player's had the complete game, where they're 100% happy, so I'm still searching for that and hopefully one day I'll get it in a Scotland jersey."
In the wake of the weekend win, hooker Ross Ford backed Scotland to enjoy a successful Six Nations championship in the new year.
And 28-year-old Cowan also reckons Vern Cotter's side can lift the trophy.
"I know what we can possibly achieve, which is winning the Six Nations, but for me it's about us growing as a team and just keeping progressing," Cowan added
"If you don't believe you can win it what's the point of turning up? I definitely think we're capable of that and we're showing signs of being able to do that.
"If we start looking ahead of ourselves that's when we can slip up, so it's about progressing and just working on those positives, improving the little flaws we've got and you never know what can come."
