Goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey back in Ghana national squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
USA-based goalkeeper, Adam Kwarasey, is back in Ghana's national squad for their forthcoming 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Mozambique following a self-imposed exile.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
28-year-old Kwarasey had been absent from the Black Stars since their participation at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
Ghana coach Avram Grant convinced the shot-stopper - who plays for MLS side Portland Timbers - to return to the national set-up ahead of their matches against the Mambas later this month.
Captain Asamoah Gyan is also in the squad as is Mubarak Wakaso.
But Swansea forward Andre Ayew is not included due to an ankle injury.
Ghana are top of Group H with a maximum six points from their opening two games.
The Black Stars host Mozambique on 24 March in Accra before playing the return leg in Maputo four days later.
