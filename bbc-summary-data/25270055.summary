The fire at Siteserv on the Vale Business Park in Llandow has been contained but continues to burn.
It is the second fire in less than a month after another Siteserv building nearby was accidentally destroyed.
South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said the demolition was needed to access and douse burning waste.
A statement said the operation was "challenging and complex" and had been prolonged by the nature and volume of the burning material in the building, by the strength of the building structure, challenging site conditions and the need to protect the environment.
It added: "Steady progress is being made and South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Natural Resources Wales and the recycling company which owns the site, Siteserv, are working closely together to ensure that the fire is extinguished as rapidly as the constraints allow."
Health authorities say the risk to public health associated with the fire is low.
At one point nearly 90 firefighters were at the scene when the fire broke out on 26 November.
Investigations into the cause of the blaze are continuing.
