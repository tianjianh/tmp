Gloucestershire NHS trust 'requires improvement' says report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS trust that runs seven Gloucestershire hospitals has been rated as requiring improvement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) found that care at Gloucestershire Care Services NHS Trust was "good" but it judged safety in the urgent care service "to be inadequate".
Inspectors said people were waiting too long to be assessed at minor injuries units and there were safety concerns.
The trust said it had taken on board the CQC's findings.
The trust runs hospitals at Cirencester, Stroud General and Tewkesbury Community Hospital, Minor Injuries and Illness Units (MIIU), dental clinics and community services.
The inspection, carried out in June, July and August, found that patients were being seen by "unregistered practitioners".
Sir Mike Richards, the CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said community teams were "overstretched" because there were not enough experienced nurses and it was concerned about safety in the urgent care service.
"We were not assured that people were adequately protected from the risk of harm, and we were not convinced that this had been addressed adequately yet by the trust board," he said.
"While there are many good services, we have also been very clear about those areas for improvement, which I expect the trust to address as a priority."
Dr Marion Andrews-Evans, from the NHS Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group, said the trust was working to ensure patients "receive the right care, in the right place at the right time".
"We know that the trust has taken immediate action to improve arrangements for initial triage of patients within Community Minor Injury and Illness Units," she said.
"We also know that they are working hard to recruit and train additional emergency nurse practitioners to support increased use of MIIU services."
