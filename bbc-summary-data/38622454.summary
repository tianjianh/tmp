"The Birch", 71, was at the Leicester Mercury Sports Awards when he suffered a cardiac arrest on Thursday evening.
Lisa Fereday, who was attending as her daughter was nominated, said Mr Birchenall's first words were, "Wow, what just happened?".
His charity work has included putting defibrillators in public places.
Ms Fereday went to help after Mr Birchenall collapsed while presenting awards.
She said: "I started chest compressions and asked for the automatic defib to be brought to me as soon as possible and someone ran for that.
"When it came I attached that and was able to deliver a shock for his arrhythmia which was pivotal in saving his life.
"After the fourth shock he came back round and was breathing for himself again and the first thing he said to me was, 'Wow, what just happened then?'."
Dr Douglas Skehan said: "He has had so many messages of support I have warned him not to respond to too many - but he is overjoyed by the response."
Mr Birchenall is in a stable condition and is expected to have an operation this weekend but is due to be out of hospital within days.
He played for youth clubs before he was spotted by Sheffield United. He went on to play for Crystal Palace and Chelsea.
However, the majority of his playing career was a six-year spell with Leicester City.
He made 163 appearances and scored 12 goals for the club.
Fans are planning to show their support with a phone light display during Saturday's game against Chelsea.
