[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has begun her legal battle to overturn a £100 fine for feeding a chip to a pigeon in Swansea.

Lauren-Paige Smith said she was "only feeding the birds" when she first received a litter fine from a council worker.
The 19-year-old refused to enter a plea at Swansea Magistrates as she did "not believe a crime was committed."
Swansea council said throwing food is a "littering offence" and anyone caught risks a fine.
Representing herself against Swansea council's legal team, Miss Smith, from Rumney, Cardiff, said she had "never been in trouble before."
"The person who approached me did not give me any warning or tell me to pick anything up," she told magistrates.
"I had colleagues with me at the time who also couldn't believe it."
Footage taken by the council worker heard him tell Miss Smith: "You could feed them seeds but not chips, that's human waste."
Speaking before the case, Miss Smith said: "There are so much worse things going on in the world.
"I can't believe I'm being penalised for doing a kind act.
"I thought it was a wind-up but now the fine has escalated and I'm being hauled into court."
District judge Neale Thomas said he wanted to speak to the council worker and other witnesses before continuing the case.
He adjourned proceedings for two weeks.
Before Tuesday's hearing, a Swansea council spokesman said they have an ongoing campaign in the city centre to discourage people from throwing food on the ground for seagulls and pigeons.
"City centre businesses raised concerns about aggressive birds attacking shoppers," he said.
"Throwing food on the ground is a littering offence and anyone caught doing it risks being issued with a fixed penalty.
"Discarded food and other types of litter can have a negative impact on the look of our city centre and we are doing what we can to make sure the city centre is an attractive place for visitors to come and enjoy."
