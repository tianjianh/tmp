The Olympic team pursuit champion needed just six laps to catch Emily Nelson in the final.
Jessica Frampton beat Rachel James to sprint gold, while Lewis Oliva and Daniel Bigham won the men's keirin and pursuit respectively.
Britain's most successful female Paralympian, Sarah Storey, raced the able-bodied pursuit, finishing eighth.
In Para-cycling, Sophie Thornhill and Corrine Hall won the mixed tandem time trial title, while Lauren Booth won the C1-5 event.
Archibald had only recently returned to the track after breaking her wrist at the Glasgow World Cup.
Archibald and Elinor Barker are the only two Rio Olympians in action over the three-day meet.
Laura Kenny and Katy Marchant withdrew through injury, while others are having a slow return to action following their efforts in Rio.
"I'm chuffed about today. Why train when you can race?" Archibald told BBC Sport.
"I want to make the World Championships this season, so I wanted to get back on the start line."
