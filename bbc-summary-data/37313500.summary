Massimo Cellino has taken full control of Leeds United by buying the rest of GFH Capital's shares in the club.

The Italian's Eleonora Sports company bought a 75% stake from GFH in 2014.
Cellino officially became the majority shareholder after winning an appeal against the Football League's decision to block the takeover.
"The club is delighted to confirm that Leeds United Football Club is now 100% owned by Eleonora Sport Limited," said a statement from the Elland Road club.
Last month BBC Sport revealed that Italian businessman Andrea Radrizzani has been in talks over buying a major stake in Leeds United. Those negotiations are continuing.

"GFH Capital were the Middle Eastern bank who bought the club from Ken Bates.
"GFH Capital, according to the last accounts, were owed Â£17m by Leeds United so it is fair to assume this debt has been restructured in a way that is positive for Leeds United whilst allowing GFH Capital to exit."
