Michelle Perryman rang for help in June 2015 saying she felt violently ill but said she was frustrated by the service.
At one point the non-emergency service call handler is heard to laugh.
South West Ambulance, which lost the service in 2016 after a damning report, said the the call handler selected the wrong "pathway" on the computer.

Mrs Perryman from north Devon complained in July 2015 and in December 2016 she got an apology and a "goodwill" payment of Â£100 from the NHS Litigation Authority.
"I was asked numerous questions, totally the wrong questions," said Mrs Perryman, who was ill after suffering "severe depression".
She was asked if she had developed a headache, or had travelled abroad recently, or being exposed to the Ebola virus recently.
After about 40 questions over a 10 minute call she was advised to see a GP, which she did, and was told an out of hours service had been informed.
South West Ambulance said call handlers have to ask a series of questions known as NHS Pathways which are selected with a computer.
But in a letter to Mrs Perryman it said "the outcome would not have been different" even if the "correct pathway" had been followed.
It added that it was not acceptable that the call handler was heard to laugh, agreed his tone was "inappropriate" and apologised for the "distress and upset".
