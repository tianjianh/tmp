Ministers deny £2m flood cash for marginal seat is electioneering

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh ministers have denied that spending £2m on protecting 17 homes in Boverton, Vale of Glamorgan, from flooding amounted to "electioneering".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vale of Glamorgan Labour AM Jane Hutt had a 3,775 majority over the Tories in 2011.
The Conservatives have held the seat at Westminster level since 2010, with an assembly election to take place in May.
On Tuesday, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said the suggestion of electioneering was "foolish".
Boverton was one of two south Wales communities to learn it will receive money for flood prevention in 2016-17.
Another £2m will be spent on Porthcawl seafront in the neighbouring Bridgend constituency, replacing ageing coastal defences to protect 260 properties.
The cash, more than £4m in total, followed December's announcement of £3m for extra work at St Asaph, Denbighshire.
Speaking to the BBC Wales' radio programme Good Evening Wales, Mr Sargeant said: "While 17 houses will be protected in Boverton, there are road networks and infrastructure important to many more people in that area which will be of equal importance - you can't balance it on one thing only."
He said Ms Hutt had "worked incredibly hard to raise the profile" of the issues at Boverton.
Asked if Tuesday's announcement was electioneering, he said: "It's rather foolish to say that, when we've got people in crisis across Wales.
"We take this very seriously, we're providing £240m of investment."
