Jasmyn Chan, 14, was hit by a vehicle on Normanton Hill in Sheffield on 9 May after pushing a friend out of danger.
A 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving is on bail.
Friends and students gathered with their heads bowed as Jasmyn's coffin arrived at City Road Cemetery by horse-drawn carriage.
Hundreds of people lined the paths outside the crematorium, some holding flowers and garlands.
Jasmyn was crossing the road near the junction with Richmond Hill Road with a 12-year-old girl at about 21:20 when they were both hit.
The younger girl was also injured and had to be treated in hospital.
Police have said that Jasmyn's last actions were "to push her friend from danger".

The silence of a Sheffield cemetery on a beautiful sunlit morning, broken by the approach of hooves.
A horse-drawn carriage arrives carrying the coffin of 14-year-old Jasmyn Chan. Hundreds of the schoolgirl's friends form a silent vigil for the girl they know better as "Jazzy".
Entire families have come to pay their respects, old and young alike, dressed brightly in vibrant colours contrasting the sombre occasion.
The tributes read during the service talk of a thoughtful, generous, cheeky teenager, a giving person "beautiful inside and out". Words from teachers, friends and family offering comfort, bookending a life taken suddenly by a hit-and-run crash.
Fundraising in her name has continued in the weeks after her death. Her family say they will not know the person she would have become, but her life's work continues.
Detectives said the investigation was continuing and they were still trying to find a blue-green Honda Civic with the registration P135 FEO.
The funeral procession began on Mansfield Road and travelled through the Manor Top area before arriving at the cemetery.
Tributes read during the service talked of a thoughtful, generous, cheeky teenager, a giving person "beautiful inside and out".
The Reverend Mike Reeder, who led the funeral, said the ceremony would be "a simple service to say thank you to someone who lived her life to the full even though it was only for 14 years".
Jasmyn had "made an impression on her family, on the people of Sheffield and further afield," he added.
The teenager's parents laid white roses on the coffin to mark the end of the service.
Paying tribute to their daughter after the crash, they said: "Jasmyn was a loving, friendly girl who was very giving.
"She only recently had her hair cut short to donate it to a charity that make and provide wigs to children who have lost their own hair through cancer.
"That's just the kind of girl she was and I am filled with absolute sadness I will never again see her sweet, smiling face."
