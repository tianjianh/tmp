"I thought we fully deserved the result. The most important thing is getting the three points.
"It was a tricky game tonight, Swindon are a good passing side and they can really hurt you.
"I wouldn't like to play against us at the moment. The stamina in the team is excellent and we fully deserved the result and another clean sheet.
"I'm really pleased for Curtis Main. He deserved the goal, it was a great finish."
