Beau Falloon: Leeds Rhinos hooker leaves club by mutual consent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds Rhinos have terminated the contract of hooker Beau Falloon by mutual consent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old joined Leeds until the end of the season in October 2015 after his release by Gold Coast Titans.
Leeds signed fellow Australian hooker James Segeyaro in June as part of a swap deal with Penrith Panthers that saw Zak Hardaker head the other way.
"Beau has been a great professional since he arrived," chief executive Gary Hetherington said.
"The signing of James Segeyaro was not planned for this season but his availability has resulted in us having to make a decision on Beau."
