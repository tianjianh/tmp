Mrs Boardman, who competed in cycling races in her youth, was taken to hospital with serious injuries following the collision in Connah's Quay, Deeside, on Saturday.
She later died in hospital.
Chris Boardman said she was "the most positive, outgoing person you could ever hope to meet".
The 47-year-old, who won a gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games, tweeted a photograph alongside a tribute to his mother, who he said "never lost her love of the bike or competing".
"A stealth combatant and full of energy; mum was one of those individuals who could quietly turn anything into a contest.
"On the 10-minute walk to my nan's she would often force us to skip - it didn't feel as strange then as it sounds now - which inevitably turned into a dog-eat-dog contest, a woman and two children frantically speed-skipping along a suburban pavement with a blue garden gate as the winning post.
"God knows what it looked like to people driving past."
He also wrote about her "generosity of spirit" and love of the outdoors, recalling fond childhood memories of walking and exploring as a family in north Wales.
"We love you Carol, may the wind be ever at your back," he said.
North Wales Police have appealed for any witnesses to the collision at 13:54 BST at the roundabout on Mold Road, Connah's Quay with the Junction of Ffordd Llanarth.
The vehicle involved was a white Mitsubishi L200 pick up, police said.
A spokeswoman added: "Police are renewing their appeal for anybody who may have witnessed the collision to contact officers on 101, quoting reference number U104385."
Chris Boardman, a father-of-six from Hoylake, Merseyside, broke the world record for the longest distance cycled in an hour three times.
He competed in the Tour de France, and won three stages - wearing the yellow jersey on three occasions. He has been part of ITV's recent coverage of the world-famous cycling event.
His broadcasting colleague Ned Boulting tweeted: "I'm so sorry Chris. You and your family are uppermost in our thoughts here in France."
Bob Howden, president of British Cycling, said: "This is truly awful news and my thoughts, and those of everyone at British Cycling, are with Carol's family."
