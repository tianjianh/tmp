The Co-op has changed its advert for chocolate Easter eggs after being accused of "outrageous sexism".

The advert's tagline for its Fairtrade eggs which appeared in national newspapers over the weekend said: "Be a good egg. Treat your daughter for doing the washing up."
One of the Fairtrade principles is gender equality.
The Manchester-based supermarket said: "We are proud of our organisation's equality and diversity, we are sorry."
Ronnie Morris tweeted: "Wow! Co-op demonstrating outrageous sexism!! @EverydaySexism."
The supermarket chain said the advert was one of a number of adverts which ran over the weekend as part of its overall Good Egg campaign.
It now has new wording which does not reference dishwashing, said a spokesman.
The spokesman added: "We have a proud tradition of equality and the first female member joined in 1846 at a time when women could not join trade unions and women members of the Co-op have had an equal vote 80 years before they had an equal Parliamentary vote.
"We have a very strong commitment to Fairtrade and all that it stands for and are the largest convenience retailer in the world to support Fairtrade."
The Fairtrade Foundation said: "We know the Co-op is committed to gender equality and therefore we are pleased that the wording of this advert has been changed."
The Fairtrade movement aims to get better prices, decent working conditions and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers.
