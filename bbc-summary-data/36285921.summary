Manchester United: Club post record third-quarter revenues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United have posted record third-quarter revenues of £123.4m despite their continued inconsistency on the pitch.

The Premier League club reported total revenue rose by 29.9% in the three months to 31 March.
It means they expect to earn between £500m and £510m in 2016.
United are through to the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace at Wembley on 21 May, but could miss out on Champions League football next season.
Louis van Gaal's side are fifth in the Premier League table, two points adrift of Manchester City in the fourth qualifying spot.
A clause in United's £750m deal with kit supplier Adidas means they would sacrifice £22m over the remainder of the 10-year contract should they fail to qualify for the Champions League group stage in successive seasons.
"That isn't something that keeps us awake at night," said Hemen Tseayo, United's head of corporate finance.
United will climb above Manchester City if they beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Sunday and their neighbours lose at Swansea.
The Red Devils could also drop to seventh if they lose and both West Ham and Southampton win.
