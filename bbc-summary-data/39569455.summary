[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford Tigers maintained their position at the top of Super League with another free-scoring success, this time against rivals Wakefield Trinity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tigers scored six first-half tries, with Jake Webster and Grant Millington crossing twice, after David Fifita gave Wakefield an early lead.
Prop Fifita completed his double in the second half, to add to Trinity's second from Bill Tupou in the opening 40.
Greg Eden's 12th try of the season ensured a fourth straight Tigers win.
Ben Jones-Bishop's spectacular late airborne score could do nothing to change the outcome, with Castleford well ahead by then.
There was extra significance to the win as the two clubs compete for the Adam Watene Trophy, a prize in memory of the late prop-forward who played for both clubs before his tragic death in 2008, aged 31.
Daryl Powell's Tigers have now scored 61 tries in just nine games - winning eight - with Salford the only team to taken points from them in 2017.
Wakefield came into the game on the back of three straight wins, but despite the early optimism they failed to cope with the Castleford 'wave' once they broke their deadlock with Ben Roberts' wraparound move try.
The ability to mix up play and shift the ball caused the visitors so many problems, with Luke Gale, Roberts and hooker Paul McShane at the heart of the creativity.
Smart footwork was key to Millington's two scores, while the bulldozing power of Jake Webster at short range brought up his double.
Chris Chester's side did cause Cas problems, notably through the rampaging Fifita, while the kicking games of Jacob Miller and Sam Williams led to three of their four scores.
Castleford head coach Daryl Powell: "At half-time we were well in front - we scored some fairly smart tries and defended with intent - but in the second half it became scrappy and we made too many errors.
"We got ourselves a strong half-time lead and the only disappointment was that we didn't go on and make more of it."
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester: "I'm frustrated and disappointed. They were too good for us the first 40 minutes and killed us with their ruck speed and off-loads.
"We were better in the second half but game had gone by then. Their forward pack rolled us far too easily but take nothing away from Cas - sometimes they are a pleasure to watch but not for us today.
"They are a great side and very hard to stop although we didn't react well to the errors that we made. A team like Castleford will really hurt you and they did today. Their completion rate was very high and they have two good kickers in (Luke) Gale and (Ben) Roberts who can really punish you
"Classy Cas they are nicknamed and they are a very hard team to defend against and very difficult to break down - something which they have done a lot to improve over the last 12 months."
