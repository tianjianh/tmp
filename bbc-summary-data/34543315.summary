Plymouth Argyle winger Gregg Wylde "scares defenders" with his pace, according to manager Derek Adams.

The 24-year-old has started nine of the Devon side's 12 League Two games this season, but has been taken off by half-time in four of them.
"There will be times where he's not going to see much of the ball and not going to be in the game," Adams said.
"But when he gets that opportunity he causes teams problems and in a lot of games he's a great outlet for us."
The former Scotland under-21 international joined the Pilgrims this summer after being released by St Mirren following relegation from the Scottish Premiership.
He was replaced after just 32 minutes of Plymouth's 2-0 win at Notts County last Saturday, which kept them top of the table, because of illness
"What people sometimes don't realise is when he plays against a defender he scares them because of his pace, and that can shift them back five or 10 yards," Adams told BBC Sport.
"He's our only out-and-out winger. Nowadays we don't see as many wingers because full-backs are more powerful and quicker than they used to be.
"If you cause a full-back trouble, they've got a problem if they want to go forward. It's a bit like cat and mouse where one goes, one stays and we'll see who wins the battle."
Adams also revealed he is still looking at keeper Deniz Mehmet, who has been on trial, but will not be able to make a move for any player until January because of budgetary constraints.
