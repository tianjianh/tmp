The man was trapped under a pile of rubble when the derelict church crumbled in Splott at about 14:50 BST on Tuesday.
Two others escaped with minor injuries following the incident close to the main south Wales to London railway line.
South Wales Police is investigating the incident at the building.
The building was in the process of being demolished.
It follows a report for Cardiff council in June 2016 which warned the building was a "dangerous structure" at risk of "imminent collapse".
Report authors Bruton Knowles warned part of the building close to the railway line was unstable and needed to be stabilised or it may "fall" and damage the tracks.
The report warned: "In our opinion, the building may be deemed as a dangerous structure. In consideration of the close proximity of the railway line."
The structural survey was undertaken for Network Rail ahead of work to replace a bridge nearby, as part of rail upgrades.
Cardiff demolition firm Young Contractors, which has been working on the derelict church for about three weeks, confirmed none of its staff were on the site at the time.
Cardiff council said police were investigating.
Stephen Doughty, MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, has said on Twitter "questions must be asked".
Firefighters, rescue dogs and a drone had been searching for the man who was found on Tuesday between 20:00 and 21:00, police said, adding formal identification would now take place.
Splott Road is still closed in both directions following the church collapse while closures also affect Pearl Street and Agate Street.
