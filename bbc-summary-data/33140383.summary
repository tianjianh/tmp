[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 69-year-old man, who has not been identified, died at Lincoln County Hospital earlier this month.
The man was a patient at Long Leys Court in Lincoln, which is being closed temporarily due to "serious incidents".
Lincolnshire Police said it was investigating the circumstances surrounding his death.
Further tests are due to be carried out to establish a cause of death.
The 16-bed facility is for adults with learning disabilities and other complex needs, including mental illness.
In a statement, the police said: "We are currently working very closely with the Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (LPFT) and the Lincolnshire Adults Safeguarding Board around all of the incidents at Long Leys Court."
An LPFT spokesman said: "The patient was not related to current police investigations. However, as necessary in such unfortunate circumstances, we must now await the outcome of any investigations surrounding their illness and death."
The trust said earlier that is was closing the facility because "despite intensive action... [we] do not feel that the unit can currently provide sufficiently high quality care for patients".
The health watchdog the Care Quality Commission said it is aware of the situation.
