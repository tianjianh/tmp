Emergency services were called to the construction site at about 09:00 on Monday after reports that a 57-year-old man was ill.
He was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife, where he later died, police said.
It is understood the man worked for the Â£1.35bn construction project and was walking to work at the time. A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.
A Transport Scotland spokesman said: "Emergency services attended the site this morning after a colleague had taken ill.
"The incident is understood to be unconnected to work activities and further details are not available at this time."
Around 1,300 workers are employed on the 1.7-mile Queensferry Crossing, which is replacing the Forth Road Bridge across the Forth between the Lothians and Fife.
