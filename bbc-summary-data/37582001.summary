Miller scored the only goal of the game midway through the first half when he met Lee Wallace's cross with a perfectly struck angled volley.
Owain Fon Williams kept Inverness in the game with a marvellous save to deny Martyn Waghorn moments later.
Caley Thistle substitute Aaron Doran had an effort cleared off the line as Rangers held on for the points.
The win moves Mark Warburton's men four points behind Celtic having played two more matches than the league leaders.
Inverness' five-match unbeaten run ended as they remained eighth in the table.
Miller's goal brought up his century for the Ibrox club - and there cannot have been too many better.
He knew exactly what he was doing as Wallace's delivery arrived, pausing and contorting his body shape perfectly before volleying off the outside of the boot away from Fon Williams into the corner.
Miller seemed full of confidence and was very unfortunate immediately after the break with a low shot Fon Williams did well to turn away.
He later tried an acrobatic overhead kick which belied his years.
At 36, he remains an important part of this Rangers side and proved the difference here. Scotland call-up anyone?
Rangers capitalised quickly when they were on top, something Inverness failed to do when Lonsana Doumbouya somehow sent a close-range header over when they were pressuring the visiting defence early in the game.
He had time, was alone and just six yards out but his attempt was inexplicably weak.
Credit is due to the home side, though. They toughed it out, worked their way back into the game and really threatened an equaliser with an attacking approach.
Carl Tremarco seemed to freeze when presented with a clear sight of goal before Doran scuffed one and then saw another effort saved.
Fellow substitute Alex Fisher, who scored a late equaliser against Celtic, had a chance right at the end but misguided his header.
They simply never gave in, something that will stand Richie Foran's side in good stead this season.
Rangers have lacked consistency in this campaign but this may prove a pivotal 90 minutes.
It is back-to-back wins now, and this came against a side brimming with confidence.
They had to weather an early storm with Inverness intent on unsettling them but they stuck to the gameplan and thrived for a long spell before Inverness pushed on.
Rangers are climbing the table and will feel they are now closer to where they want to be.
Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Richie Foran: "I'm disappointed for the players. We gave it our all. On chances alone I think we deserved a draw.
"We just lacked that wee bit of quality in front of goal.
"I think it's our best performance over the last six games.
"I knew we'd get chances. Bringing Jake Mulraney and Aaron Doran on can turn a game for you and I thought they might have nicked us a goal.
"We kept believing. I can't complain. The lads have given their all but it just wasn't their night."
Rangers manager Mark Warburton told Rangers TV: "I'm delighted. It's a tough place to come. We can be better but tonight the focus was to get three points.
"We talk about players being brave - brave on the ball, brave to move one or two yards to receive it, but also the bravery of the boys heading, blocking tackling was outstanding.
"There's no lack of desire in that team. They are strong, quick athletes and it was a very pleasing performance.
(On Miller's 100th Rangers goal) "It is testament to his approach, the way he looks after himself, the way he conducts himself, the mentoring role he has on and off the field with the younger players, and the older players."
