The Sri Lankan's brilliant run-a-ball 121, in a fourth-wicket stand of 180 with Ben Foakes (86), helped the visitors to 313-7 at Headingley.
Opener Adam Lyth struck 75 and Australia batsman Peter Handscomb made 60 but Yorkshire fell short on 289-9.
Surrey play Worcestershire at New Road in the last four on Saturday, with the final at Lord's on 1 July.
Essex host Nottinghamshire in the other semi-final on Friday.
Sangakkara, who is retiring from first-class cricket at the end of this season, looked in superb touch once again, offering only one difficult chance to Alex Lees on the boundary early on in his innings.
The 39-year-old mixed deft touches to the boundary with some brutal straight hitting over the rope to bring up his 39th List A century.

When he was eventually stumped off Azeem Rafiq and Foakes fell to the same bowler soon after, teenagers Ollie Pope (37) and Sam Curran (19) made sure Surrey passed 300.
In the chase, Yorkshire were well placed with Lyth and Jack Leaning (42) taking them to 126-1 at the halfway stage.
But once Lyth gifted a catch to Mark Stoneman on the cover boundary off seamer Ravi Rampaul and Leaning nicked Rampaul behind in his next over, Yorkshire began to struggle.
Skipper Gary Ballance (36) added 64 with Handscomb but could not push on, and only a late flurry of boundaries from Matthew Waite in his 34 prevented an even bigger winning margin for Surrey.
Yorkshire captain Gary Ballance told BBC Radio Leeds:
"We just got outplayed. Sangakkara played a brilliant innings for them. It was a match-winning knock. We just needed someone to do that for us.
"We knew how good a player he is, and we tried everything at him. He played very well. Sometimes you just have to hold your hands up.
"When you are chasing a score, one of the top five has got to get a score. We didn't quite do that."
Surrey batsman Kumar Sangakkara told BBC Radio London:
"Ben Foakes played really well and took the pressure off me. Then, as a partnership we bowled really well on what was a really good track.
"The way Lyth batted put us under a bit of pressure at the start, but our guys responded. The way they picked up crucial wickets and bowled smartly was really impressive.
"When you're defending on a wicket like that with the fielding restrictions, every part of your game has to be spot on. Today we were lucky we were up to the challenge.
"It feels really special (hundredth 100), but I'll take the win over that any day."
