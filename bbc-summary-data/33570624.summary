Week ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's the final two and a half days before MPs and peers head off for their summer break...but they're cramming a lot of action in. There's some high politics around the Work and Welfare Bill, and it may be that the new Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron will make his debut before the summer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
And watch out for moves in the Lords to set up a Joint Committee on EVEL, which would add a significant complication to what is already turning into a rather fraught saga for the government.
Monday
The Commons meets at 2.30pm for education questions - which will be followed by any ministerial statements or urgent questions - and it's a fair bet that one way or another the rather interesting axis of David Davis and Tom Watson will ensure there's a minister at the dispatch box to talk about their successful legal challenge to the DRIPA - the law on communications data monitoring.
And there may be other statements or UQs on any number of other issues.
The day's main legislating will be the second reading debate on the Welfare Reform and Work Bill - - Iain Duncan Smith's flagship welfare changes, telegraphed in the Budget.
One of the main points of interest here will be the actions of Labour MPs. Backbencher Helen Goodman attracted 40 signatures in no time at all, for a "reasoned amendment" which declined to give the bill its second reading (killing it, if passed) because of its impact  on child poverty. The Labour leadership, which had not flatly opposed the bill, trumped this with its own reasoned amendment supporting some aspects, but not others - including the abolition of the child poverty target. Crucially, it does not seek to block the bill.
The Goodman amendment will probably not now be selected for debate - although she intends to keep it on the Order Paper. The question now is how many Labour MPs will vote for its sentiment and vote against the bill, when the official party line is to abstain. The numbers, and the names will be interesting; what will the leadership and deputy leadership candidates do?
In the Lords (from 2.30pm) there's a busy day of detailed legislating: First is the Remaining Stages Supply and Appropriation (Main Estimates) Bill - a money measure which peers will rubber stamp pretty rapidly.
Then comes the third reading of the Psychoactive Substances Bill
And finally there's the report stage of the Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill. One interesting amendment to look out for comes from a cross party alliance including Labour's Baroness Hayter, the Lib Dem Lord Palmer, the Crossbencher and former Permanent Secretary in the DCLG Lord Kerslake, and the Bishop of Rochester.
The amendment says the Charity Commission "shall ensure that independent charities are not compelled to use or dispose of their assets in a way which is inconsistent with their charitable purposes." Which sounds innocent enough, but could, among other things, have implications for Housing Associations being pushed to dispose of homes under the government's right to buy reforms, when the homes in question are built on land donated for social housing.
Another cross party amendment from the Lib Dem Lord Wallace of Saltaire and others requires independent schools with charitable status to "engage actively with local communities and state schools with a view to sharing resources and facilities" and that the Charity Commission must publish guidance setting out the minimum that independent schools which are charities must do to comply with the duty.
Tuesday
It's MPs' last day on parade - but unusually there's a three-line whip in force for the main business, the second reading of the Finance Bill, the measure which puts the tax changes from the Budget into law.
But first, at 11.30am, it's Treasury questions, followed by a ten minute rule bill from the Conservative David Davis on Public Nuisance from Wind Farms
Over in Westminster Hall from 9.30am - 11am, there's a debate on human rights in Saudi Arabia from the SNP's Stewart McDonald.
Over in Westminster Hall there are a couple of interesting debates, from 2.30pm, starting with Newport MP Jessica Morden's on the tolls on the Severn bridges - campaigners argue that abolishing tolls could boost the South Wales economy by Â£107 million.
There's one for aficionados of the great age of British aviation at 4pm when the Conservative defence expert Sir Gerald Howarth ponders the future of the iconic Avro Vulcan XH558 RAF V Bomber.  An injection of Â£7 million from lottery money and public donations saw the Vulcan return to the skies in 1997, but this summer, it will fly its last flight following a decision to ground the aircraft.
Then former Cabinet Minister John Redwood (4.30pm - 5.30pm) leads a debate on the UK's relations with the Euro area and further Euro integration.
In the Lords (from 2.30pm) it's the third reading of the (significantly amended) Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill. Expect the Commons to push back on the amendment dropping the requirement for elected "metro mayors" in return for the government granting extra powers to city regions.
Then peers move on to a (slightly belated) debate on the Budget.
Update: on Tuesday, the promised motion from the Crossbencher Lord Butler, to establish a joint Lords-Commons Committee on English Votes for English Laws, will pop up. The tenor of Lord Butler's short debate on EVEL suggests he might well get approval from peers, and that would confront the government with an awkward debate and vote in the Commons.
Wednesday
Their lordships linger in Westminster for one final day. They warm up by nodding through the committee stage of the European Union (Approvals) Bill, and then move on to the second reading of the Energy Bill, which is intended to deliver the Conservatives' manifesto promise to North Sea oil and gas, change the law so that local authorities decide onshore wind applications and end any new public subsidy for onshore wind specifically in relation to the Renewables Obligation.  They embark on detailed consideration in the committee stage as soon as they return to Westminster after the summer.
There's a motion to approve the Draft Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007 (Extension of duration of non-jury trial provisions) Order 2015  and the Draft Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections) (Amendment) Order 2015.
And then peers debate the report from the EU Committee on the proposal to establish provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece - in other words on the Mediterranean migrant crisis.
And that's that. Barring an emergency recall, honourable members and noble lords will return to their chambers on 7 September.
