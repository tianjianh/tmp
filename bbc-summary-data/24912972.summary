Knight's Peak on Skye demoted from Munro Top status

A rocky peak on Skye's Pinnacle Ridge is shorter than previously thought, according to a new measurement.

Knight's Peak had been listed as a Munro Top, with a height of 3,002ft (915m).
Munros and Munro Tops are mountains of more than 3,000ft (914.4m). They are prized by hillwalkers and climbers.
Knight's Peak, however, has lost its status after surveyors using GPS technology found it to be 6in (16.5cm) too short to qualify as a top.
A Munro Top is a subsidiary of a nearby Munro. Climbers do not regard them as having the "sufficient gap" from a neighbouring mountain to be considered as a Munro proper.
The classifications take their name from Victorian climber Sir Hugh Munro, who began writing a list of Scotland's highest mountains in the late 1800s.
Knight's Peak, a subsidiary of Sgurr nan Gillean, was named after W Knight, who made the first recorded ascent of it 140 years ago.
John Barnard, one of the surveyors involved in calculating the new height, said GPS allowed measurements to be made down to a few centimetres.
He told BBC Scotland: "It doesn't take anything away from the hill. The hill is still there and it is a fantastic hill. It is just the categorisation that has changed."
Alistair Milner, who co-ordinates height records for The Munro Society, said new technology made it "inevitable" that some peaks would lose their status.
He added: "We want to make the list as accurate as we can.
"Sir Hugh Munro was a stickler for accuracy. We are just carrying on his tradition."
Mr Milner said that because of the challenging route up to Knight's Peak climbers would still want to tackle it.
The same survey team also found that another Munro Top on Skye, Basteir Tooth, was 4ft (1.2m) higher than previously recorded.
Last year, Beinn a'Chlaidheimh, a Munro near Ullapool, was demoted to Corbett status after a fresh measurement of its height.
Corbetts are Scottish hills of 2,500-3,000ft (762-914.4m).
Also last year, two peaks that had twin Corbett status because mountaineers could not determine which was taller were separated by new measurements.
Buidhe Bheinn above Kinloch Hourn and Sgurr a' Bhac Chaolais, overlooking Glen Shiel and linked by a ridge, were previously thought to be 2,903.6ft (885m).
But modern survey equipment recorded Buidhe Bheinn the higher at 885.50m. It now solely holds the status as a Corbett.
