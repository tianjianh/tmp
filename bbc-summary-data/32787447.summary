But no club has yet made a firm offer for the 16-year-old defender, according to Exiles manager Terry Butcher.
"Liverpool were keen to have a look at him so he's gone with some of the younger players to a tournament abroad," said Butcher
"He's attracted a lot of interest. A lot of clubs are looking at him... and it's only right you give a young player like that an opportunity."
Poole became County's youngest player last season when he made his debut against Shrewsbury aged 16 years and 94 days, going on to play 12 games as the Exiles just missed out on the League Two play-offs.
The Wales Under-17 international came close to joining Fulham in January and has also previously had a trial period at Manchester United, who are understood to still be interested in signing Poole.
Poole is still on scholar forms at Rodney Parade until the end of next season and cannot sign a professional deal until he turns 17 in June.
Butcher, a former defender himself capped 77 times by England, remains hopeful they can keep hold of him: "I think there's no substitute for playing.
"Young players in particular need to play and play at the highest level they possibly can. Regan's had a good taste of first-team football with Newport County and he's done very well and there's still a lot to do with him.
"He's a good prospect, he's a good boy and hopefully he'll play his football here at Rodney Parade and we can progress him then every club will come looking at him.
"They've not made bids or expressed interest, they only want to have a look at him so at this moment in time that's all they're doing.
"There are clubs that want to have a look at younger players and see what standard they're at, so they're doing their job but we're doing our job trying to progress his career, make sure he learns with us and make sure he learns his football with us.
"You can understand it, head's been turned and all that sort of thing, but he knows it's out there, he knows it's there for him or could be there for him if he continues to play on a regular basis. That's his aim and ambition.
"The last thing he wants to do is go to a top club and not play."
