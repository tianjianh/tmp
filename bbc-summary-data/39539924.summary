Massaro, who won the British Open title last month, comfortably won 3-0 (11-7 11-7 11-3) against the Egyptian.
Fellow English players Emily Whitlock and Alison Waters also progressed.
Whitlock beat Coline Aumard of France 3-0 (11-6 11-8 11-9), while Waters overcame Egypt's Hana Ramadan 3-1 (11-8 6-11 11-6 11-5) in El Gouna.
However, England's Jenny Duncalf was beaten 3-0 (13-11 11-7 11-5) by Egyptian third seed Raneem El Welily.
"I took her extremely seriously," said Massaro.
"I know how good she is, and this is the first round of the World Championship, so I wanted to play as well as I could and not to take any chances."
Massaro, Whitlock and Waters join England's Victoria Lust and Sarah-Jayne Perry in the second round after they won their respective first round ties on Friday.
Wales' Tesni Evans also reached the second round on Friday and will face top seed, world number one Nour El Sherbini of Egypt on Sunday.
Lust and Perry play each other for a place in the quarter-finals on Sunday, while Massaro takes on New Zealand's Joelle King on Monday.
Also on Monday, Waters faces Joshna Chinappa of India and Whitlock takes on either second seed Camille Serme of France.
At the same venue, England's world number four Nick Matthew was beaten 3-2 (10-12 11-4 7-11 11-5 11-6) by Egypt's Fares Dessouky in round one of the El Gouna International.
