Edinburgh beat their rivals back-to-back, following a 23-11 win last Sunday with a bruising 14-11 victory on Saturday to claim eight Pro12 points.
The victories also allowed the capital side to retain the 1872 Cup.
"I've felt that over the last couple of seasons we've definitely closed the gap," Solomons told BBC Scotland. "We saw that that gap has been closed."
Solomons also feels the spirit shown by his players is the best he has experienced in his rugby career.
Edinburgh repelled huge pressure from the Warriors deep in their own 22 as the clock hit 80 minutes.
"The players there in the last two minutes were just incredible," said the South African. "They weren't going to lose that game, that's for sure.
"For two weeks in a row, you are not going to peak to the same extent and we always knew we were going to come off a bit, which we did. But their resilience was incredible.
"I think it's about the building of a team and the spirit within that team. It's something we started doing two-and-a-half seasons ago.
"I've always said this team has got the most amazing spirit of any team I've ever been involved with, we've got the most amazing players, and we saw that."
