[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man's leg was impaled as he tried to climb a spiked metal fence in Bedworth, Warwickshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is believed the man was locked out of his flat on King Street when he became stuck 3m (10ft) up on the railings.
Fire and ambulance crews lifted him off the fence at about 02:30 BST and he was taken to University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire.
Police went to the scene but officers said no crime was committed.
The man is understood to have suffered a flesh wound and was given pain relief and anti-bleeding drugs.
A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: "The man was stuck several feet up. The railing had gone through his right thigh.
"It was a difficult rescue for the emergency services because of where the man was and because of the driving rain at the time."
