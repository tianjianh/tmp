[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A court in Los Angeles has found The Shield actor Michael Jace guilty of murdering his wife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He shot April Jace, 40, in the back and then twice in the legs at their family home in May 2014, while the couple's young children were present.
Jace's son, now 10, told the court he heard his father say: "If you like running then run to heaven," before firing the second time.
Jace will be sentenced on 10 June and could face up to 40 years in prison.
Deputy District Attorney Tannaz Mokayef said during the trial that the actor was upset that his wife wanted a divorce and believed she was having an affair, although no evidence was presented to support this.
Jace waited for her to come home and shot her before calling police.
He later told detectives that he had planned to kill himself but could not go through with it and so instead planned to shoot his wife, a keen runner, in the leg so she would feel pain.
The 53-year-old actor played Detective Julien Lowe in police drama The Shield.
He also had small roles in films such as Planet of the Apes, Boogie Nights and Forrest Gump.
