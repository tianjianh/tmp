A road closed after a major landslip in Bournemouth has reopened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bournemouth Borough Council shut East Overcliff Drive on 26 April while engineers assessed the area for signs of further movement.
Rubble came tumbling down from the 30m-high (100ft) cliff close to the Jon Egging Memorial in the early hours, two days earlier.
The council said a cordon along the promenade at either side of the site would remain in place.
The authority said surveys had revealed no further movement had occurred.
The landslip partially submerged the East Cliff Lift, an Edwardian funicular railway. A public toilet block at the foot of the cliffs was also destroyed.
A memorial to Red Arrows pilot Jon Egging has also moved close to the cliff's edge.
Cracks had started appearing on the promenade the day before the fall, leading the council to close the area.
The council said close monitoring of the cliff was ongoing and work to clear the debris would get underway shortly.
Further road closures along East Overcliff Drive will be necessary during this period.
