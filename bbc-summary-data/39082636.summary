The front window of the property in Lodge Road, Talke, blew out with the force of Friday's blast.
Two dogs, three cats, and 12 rabbits were killed, according to owner Alan Rhodes, who was out at the time.
Fire crews said the house was "well alight" when they arrived. Staffordshire Police confirmed no-one had been injured.
Mr Rhodes said he and his wife kept 50 rabbits and they found out about the blaze through a phone call.
"My wife got a phone call, house is on fire, it's just blown up, the windows have blown through, so we've come back and this is how we found out," he said.
Officers from the RSPCA were also called to the scene.
The cause of the blaze is still being investigated.
