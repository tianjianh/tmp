Pisano will officially join City after the expiry of his contract with the Italian side on 1 July.
The 30-year-old former Varese, Palermo and Genoa right-back helped Verona earn promotion to Serie A last season.
"Eros brings with him a winning mentality, having just won promotion with Verona," City head coach Lee Johnson told the club website.
"He's a tough cookie and that's what we're after in that position."
