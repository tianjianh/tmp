The body of the woman - believed to be 37-year-old Jessica McGraa, from London - was discovered at a flat on Union Terrace on Friday afternoon.
Bala Chinda, 25, was charged with murder and theft at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody.
Police said the woman was "strongly believed" to be Jessica McGraa.
Formal identification is yet to take place.
Det Supt David McLaren, from Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team, is appealing to anyone who saw or spoke to Jessica McGraa in the days before her death to contact them.
He said: "In particular, I am appealing for anyone who was in Jessica's company or who spoke to her on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday 12 February to come forward as a matter of urgency.
"Piecing together the events leading up to her body being discovered on Friday afternoon is crucial to our investigation.
"Jessica is also believed to have sometimes used the name Bianca, so this may be a name that people are more familiar with.
"Although a man has been arrested and charged we continue to gather evidence and would appeal for anyone who has information to contact us."
