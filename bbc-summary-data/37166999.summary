Michael Bugg, 39, was last seen leaving the Southbank bar, next to the River Trent in Nottingham, in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Officers said the father-of-one could "potentially" have fallen in the water.
Friends said his disappearance was out of character and his young daughter had been asking after him.
Mr Bugg is known as "Buggy" to his friends and lives in Silverdale.
One friend, Hayley Mallia, said she and about 60 people had been out looking for him.
"This is so out of character for Buggy," she said.
"He's got a little girl, Scarlett, who's two-and-a-half and we know that she keeps asking for her daddy, so we are just trying to do as much as we can."
CCTV shows Mr Bugg leaving a bar on his own at about 01:10 BST on Sunday.
"I think concerns grew massively when he didn't arrive for work yesterday," said Ms Mallia.
"We know he's a really hard-working guy and that's not something he would do."
Nottinghamshire Police said extensive searches were being carried out adjacent to the River Trent and specialist boat teams had been deployed to assist with the search.
Det Ch Insp Karen Pearson said: "He potentially could have walked home along an embankment and maybe had an accident and fallen in.
"We are scoping the water and if we see anything that we need to investigate that's when we'll start to look at underwater search teams."
