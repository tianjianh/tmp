Ms Cavell served in a hospital in Belgium and treated Allied, German and Austrian soldiers.
She was executed by a German firing squad on 12 October 1915 after helping Allied prisoners escape to Holland.
Hundreds packed the grounds of the cathedral, including dignitaries from Belgium and Germany.
Led by the Bishop of Norwich, the Right Rev Graham James, the service was attended by members of the armed forces and nursing organisations.
Colonel Frank Hartwig, who represents German forces in the UK, said: "Terrible things happened, and it must never happen again.
"It's important for us that we remember and follow the example of Nurse Cavell."
American Red Cross nurse Terri Arthur travelled from Massachusetts for the centenary.
She said Edith Cavell had been "forgotten everywhere".
She added: "It's now at the 100th anniversary that we're beginning to see people giving her the recognition she should have had all along."
The cathedral also held a concert, Remember Edith, featuring specially-composed music and drama, which will feature on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 08:10 BST.
On Sunday, churches across Norfolk will commemorate Nurse Cavell, including her home village of Swardeston, near Norwich.
A special edition of BBC Look East on Monday  - the 100th anniversary of Edith Cavell's death - will be broadcast live from Brussels.
