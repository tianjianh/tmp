The inquiry comes after police were called to a disturbance between two men outside a gym on Chapel Lane, Wigan shortly before 20:45 BST on Friday.
Two men entered the gym, said Greater Manchester Police, with one apparently causing damage.
No arrests were made, but the Super League club say it was conducting its own inquiries.
Marketing director Simon Collinson issued a brief statement before the start of coach Shaun Wane's weekly press conference at the club's training ground at Orrell earlier.
He said: "We are carrying out an internal investigation and I would ask that no questions are put to Shaun that might compromise or prejudice those investigations.
"As soon as the investigations are complete, we will then issue a full statement."
The incident day after the Warriors beat Castleford 33-26.
GMP said: "Officers attended and spoke to all parties. Inquiries are ongoing but no arrests have been made."
