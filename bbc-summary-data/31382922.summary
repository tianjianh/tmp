Fr Seamus Quinn said Oisin's mother told him that his life support was gradually being withdrawn.
The Belfast Trust has said the teenager remains critically ill.
The 13-year-old was injured following an incident at St Michael's College, Enniskillen, on Monday.  It was reported to police at 14:45 GMT.
A 17-year-old youth, a sixth former at the school, was detained following the incident.
He was later released on bail pending further inquiries.
Fr Quinn said Oisin was a "typical 13-year-old lad".
"He's big, strong, happy, a lad of fond of sports, into all sorts, football, running, and everything like that and a good-natured friendly young fella," he said.
The parish priest said the whole community was devastated by what had happened.
St Michael's is a Catholic boys grammar school with 700 pupils.
The school released a statement on Wednesday.
"A group of students were playing at lunchtime when one student became unwell and we sought medical assistance," the school said.
"He was taken by ambulance to the South West Acute Hospital for medical help.
"We have no further information at this time."
The school said the Western Education and Library Board's critical incident response team was "on hand to offer reassurance, advice and emotional support to school staff and pupils".
A spokeswoman for Northern Ireland's Department of Education said it was "aware of the incident".
The teenager plays under-14 football in Belcoo.
The club has asked its members to keep Oisin and his family in their prayers.
