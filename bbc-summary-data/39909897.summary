[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The parents of a man who went missing in South Ayrshire have appealed for information about his disappearance several days ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Archivist Alexander Singerman, 32, failed to turn up for a meeting at the Gaiety Theatre in Ayr on Wednesday .
Since then he has not been active on social media and extensive police searches have drawn a blank.
His parents have urged him to get in touch, or anyone with information to contact the police.
Mr Singerman, from Shawlands in Glasgow, travelled to Ayrshire on Wednesday morning and left his workplace at Auchincruive later that morning but never arrived for his scheduled meeting at the theatre.
His car was found near his work and he was last seen walking towards St Quivox, near to the Agricultural College on the B743.
His mother Claire Singerman said he was a very personable young man whose disappearance was totally out of character.
She said: "He's got loads of friends who he sees and contacts all the time.
"We are very, very worried because he's not been in contact with any of them - and normally he's in contact with us. All we want is a phone call to know he's safe.
"We don't mind that we've been looking for him for days. We want him home."
Alexander is described as 6ft tall, with short black hair and has a sallow complexion.  When he was last seen he was wearing a red and black checked lumber-style jacket.
Ch Insp Annette Morrison of Police Scotland said inquiries both in Ayr and Glasgow had failed to shed any light on his disappearance.
She said: "We have conducted door to door in the area where he was last seen, CCTV, we've had helicopters out.
"We still currently have officers out searching that area. This is so out of character for Alexander. His family and his friends - as well ourselves - are really concerned."
Anyone with information is asked to contact police on the 101 number.
