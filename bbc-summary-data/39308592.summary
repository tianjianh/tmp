Australia's Nick Kyrgios has pulled out of his quarter-final against Roger Federer at Indian Wells because of a bout of food poisoning.

The 21-year-old, seeded 15th, beat world number two Novak Djokovic in the previous round, but will not now face Australian Open champion Federer.
"At this stage we think it's food poisoning, and I'm praying it's nothing more," Kyrgios said in a statement.
Federer, 35, goes on to face Jack Sock, who beat Japan's Kei Nishikori.
The American 17th seed upset fourth seed Nishikori 6-3 2-6 6-2 to reach his first Masters 1000 semi-final.
The Swiss star's match-up against in-form Kyrgios was much anticipated, and he sent his support to the Australian on Twitter, saying: "Hope you feel better @NickKyrgios."
Kyrgios added: "After a restless night of being sick I have nothing left and to play a great champion like Roger, I need to be at my best to have a chance."
"I don't take this decision lightly, these are the matches we train for but I'm in no fit state to take to the court. I'm sorry to the fans but I have to put my health first and I hope you understand.'
"I want to wish Roger the best of luck for the rest of the tournament and thank everyone for their support so far here at the BNP Paribas Open. I will definitely be back. Thank you."
In the women's semi-finals, Russian 14th seed Elena Vesnina beat French 28th seed Kristina Mladenovic 6-3 6-4, while Vesnina's compatriot, eighth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova, defeated Czech third seed Karolina Pliskova 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-2).
Kuznetsova, 31, last reached the Indian Wells final nine years ago and the two-time grand slam champion will aim to go one better this time around after defeat to Ana Ivanovic in 2008.
Meanwhile, 30-year-old Vesnina will play her first final at this level after a confident semi-final performance.
"In tennis 30 is the new 20," she told BT Sport.
"They are just numbers, I am really enjoying myself, I feel good, I feel healthy and I love tennis."
Eighth seeds Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo are through to their first ATP World Tour Masters final as a pair after edging out fourth seeds Jamie Murray and Bruno Soares 3-6 7-5 10-5.
Britain's Murray and Brazilian Soares, who sat first in the ATP Doubles rankings last year, started the stronger and took the first set before racing to a 2-4 lead in the second.
Yet a rallying performance from the Polish/Brazilian pairing of Kubot and Melo ensured they will face sixth seeds Raven Klaasen and Rajeev Ram in Saturday's final.
