The pictures include one of Lord Attenborough and his brother Sir David performing as children.
The director and actor's life and work has also been celebrated at the University of Sussex's Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts.
Lord Attenborough died aged 90 on 24 August last year.
He was the University of Sussex's chancellor from 1998 until 2008.
The university's arts centre has had a multi-million pound makeover and been renamed after Lord Attenborough.
A 3D montage of his most famous roles was projected onto the art centre's walls at the weekend, including Brighton Rock, Jurassic Park, Gandhi and Chaplin.
Lord Attenborough's son, Michael Attenborough, said the film montage represented "the multi-faceted personality that my dad was".
"The moment you tried to pin him down and define him, he'd wriggle away and be somebody else," he said.
"Of course he acted in over 100 films and directed or produced a huge number, but he didn't see art as something isolated from the rest of life and he learned from his parents that a full involvement in the wide world was every bit as important."
University of Sussex vice-chancellor Professor Michael Farthing said in his time as university chancellor Lord Attenborough became very much part of the university community.
"We fondly remember Richard for his warmth, humanity, humour and vitality," he said.
"As our chancellor he brought an element of real celebration to our graduation ceremonies and his regular visits to campus were always a big occasion.
"He had a gift for making any staff or student that he met, feel very special."
