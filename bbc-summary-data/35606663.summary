[SN]TITLE[SN]
Simply the crest: Worcester scoops coat of arms gong

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcester has won an award for displaying its coats of arms in more than 2,000 places around the city centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Retired teacher Roger Whitworth compiled a huge dossier of pictures of the Worcester City Ancient Arms and the Worcester City Modern Arms.
The heraldic emblems can be seen on buildings, bins, benches, gates and even a radiator cover.
The city council received the Corporate Heraldry Award at a ceremony in London.
The accolade, sponsored by the national Heraldry Society is given twice a year to recognise how coats of arms strengthen a place or organisation's identity.
Worcester City's ancient arms feature a castle while the modern arms have the addition of three black pears.
Mr Whitworth, a former lecturer who runs a genealogy business, entered the city for the award.
He wrote in detail about how the people of Worcester identify the council and the city using the crests.
Floreat Semper Fidelis Civitas - Let the faithful city ever flourish
Civitas in bello et pace fidelis  - In war and peace, a faithful city
Semper fidelis mutare sperno  - Ever faithful, I scorn to change
"We are delighted that Worcester's commitment to its heraldic heritage and the importance of the city crest has been recognised nationally," said Councillor Lucy Hodgson, the council's cabinet member for history and heritage.
"This award can only help to strengthen Worcester's case to gain Heritage City status in 2016."
