Fifa: Franz Beckenbauer case could be decided soon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Fifa investigation into Germany's World Cup-winning captain and coach Franz Beckenbauer has been concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The world governing body's adjudication committee will now decide whether to take any action against the 70-year-old, who was one of 22 men to vote on the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Beckenbauer was provisionally banned by Fifa for "failing to co-operate" with its inquiry into the bidding process.
Russia and Qatar won the 2010 vote to stage the next two tournaments.
Fifa vice-president and senior Uefa official Angel Maria Villar Llona has also had his case passed to the committee for a verdict from head of adjudication Hans Joachim Eckert.
In a statement, Fifa also said it would "do everything in its power" to complete its separate investigation into outgoing president Sepp Blatter and Uefa chief Michel Platini, within their 90-day suspensions.
Both men are banned, pending further inquiries into a Â£1.35m payment between them.
Beckenbauer captained West Germany to victory as hosts at the 1974 World Cup, and was coach when they next lifted the trophy in Italy 16 years later.
He then managed at Olympique Marseille and Bayern Munich, where he is now honorary president.
