Play was held up for around 10 minutes after fans hurled objects following Zlatan Ibrahimovic's controversial goal that earned Paris St-Germain a 1-0 League Cup victory at St Etienne.

A plastic water bottle was also thrown, while St Etienne coach Christophe Galtier urged supporters to calm down.
The controversy occurred in the 72nd minute when striker Ibrahimovic chested the ball over the line.
St Etienne argued the ball had not crossed the line but the goal stood.
It was enough to send Paris St-Germain into the semi-finals of the League Cup.
PSG had gone into the game on the back of a 4-2 league defeat by Bastia last Saturday.
They have slipped to fourth in Ligue 1 after failing to win their last three league games.
