Glencoe Mountain and Nevis Range snowsports centres have been among places to report having coverings of snow.
A picture by Mark Trigg for his Facebook page Back Corries shows a thick covering on Aonach Mor.
The picture has been shared on Twitter by Iain Cameron, who studies and writes about snow, and Lomond Mountain Rescue Team.
In a message below the photograph, Mr Cameron said: "This is 1pm on Tuesday the 2nd of June on Aonach Mor and this is just ridiculous. Unprecedented, perhaps."
The rescue team has also asked if anyone can remember a longer winter season.
BBC Weather has been reporting how 40 years ago there were snow falls across the UK.
Forecasts suggest temperatures should rise later this week.
