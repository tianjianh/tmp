The girl's remains were found in Manor Park, Church Hill, in Aldershot on Friday afternoon.
Detectives said they believed "Baby M" may have been delivered under a nearby oak tree and then taken into the park some time between Sunday 14 May and the following Tuesday.
Police said they were "extremely concerned" for the mother's welfare.
More on this and other stories from across the South of England.
Making a renewed appeal to her, Ch Insp Debbie Brooks said: "I know this must be a very distressing time for you, but please contact us on 101 or go to a hospital."
Det Supt Darren Rawlings said the mother needed "medical attention, care and support".
He said police officers would continue to patrol Manor Park to speak to potential witnesses.
The force has also appealed to any friends, relatives or healthcare workers with information to come forward.
A post-mortem examination has taken place, but no details of how Baby M died have been released.
A memorial service for the child was held in the park on Sunday.
