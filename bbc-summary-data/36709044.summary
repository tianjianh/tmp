The 26-year-old winger, who joined the Hammers from Nottingham Forest last summer, made 26 appearances last season, scoring eight goals.
Antonio's new deal comes after those signed by team-mates Dimitri Payet, Adrian, and Cheikhou Kouyate.
"I am happy that the manager and the chairman have showed their belief in me to give me a new deal," he told the club's official website.
"I had to be patient when I first arrived, but once I got the chance I never looked back and hopefully I can now push on and do even better than what I did last season."
