The Metropolitan Police said a post-mortem examination revealed Mr Stone died from a stab wound to his chest.
In a statement, the force said although they were still awaiting formal identification officers were "satisfied the deceased is Alfie Stone" and his next of kin had been informed.
At the Home Affairs Select Committee earlier, Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said there had been 15 teenage murders in total so far this year, the highest number since 2010.
He said "gang warfare" was often the reason.
High Road remained closed in both directions between West Ruislip Tube Station and Aylsham Drive until about 16:00 GMT.
