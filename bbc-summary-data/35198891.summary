Ospreys and Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb has become the latest player to agree a national dual contract (NDC).

The 27-year-old becomes the second player to re-sign a long-term NDC following regional and international half-back partner Dan Biggar.
Webb has not played since suffering a serious foot injury playing for Wales against Italy in September.
"I'm over the moon. With this security I can concentrate on my rehab without any distractions," he said.
Biggar, Webb's half-back partner at regional and international level, became the first Welsh player to renew his dual contract on 4 December.
Wales have 17 players on dual contracts and another of those, Ospreys captain Alun Wyn Jones, has said he is "weighing up" his options.
Dual contracts are 60% funded by the WRU and 40% by the regions.
While the WRU is in negotiations to keep its leading players in Wales, its funds are also used to bring players back from foreign clubs.
Wales centre Jonathan Davies is rejoining Scarlets on a dual contract from French side Clermont Auvergne at the end of the season, and he could be joined by Leigh Halfpenny.
The 27-year-old joined Toulon on a two-year deal in 2014 and has been linked with a move to Scarlets, Wasps and former club Cardiff Blues.
