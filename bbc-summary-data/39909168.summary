Jon Wilkin: 'Low point' in captain's St Helens career

St Helens captain Jon Wilkin believes Saturday's Challenge Cup quarter-final thrashing by Castleford is the lowest point in his 15 years at the club.

The Saints, who are waiting for coach Justin Holbrook's visa to be approved, are seventh in Super League and were thrashed 53-10 by Cas in the cup.
Wilkin told BBC Sport: "It does not get much worse than we are at the moment.
"Self-belief disappears and you are in that negative spiral and we can't get out of it at the moment."
Wilkin joined the club in 2002 from Hull KR and has won seven titles, including the treble in 2006 and the Grand Final in 2014.
But the Saints have only won five of their 13 Super League matches this season and are now out of the Challenge Cup at the fifth-round stage.
And Wilkin admits that incoming boss Holbrook has a tough job on his hands.
"We need some self-reflection and we have some hard work to do," continued Wilkin. "It's a big job, it's a huge job.
"Confidence has gone. We need something to break that. We were hoping a big performance would do that, but that was not the case.
"Congratulations to Cas, they have been exceptional all year and really set the standard.
"They have played an exciting brand of rugby and throw the ball around."
