The 27-year-old, who was born in Oslo, signed a three-and-a-half year deal.
"Jonathan is a class player who fits perfectly into our club and style of play," manager Jostein Flo told the club website.
"He is good with both feet, very capable and is a player with a lot of energy who will delight the fans here at Marienlyst."
Parr's contract with Championship side Ipswich was due to expire in the summer.
