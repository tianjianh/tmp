Officers want to trace a light-coloured saloon car spotted near the scene of the attack at Balerno on 27 August.
The woman was walking along Newmills Road after midnight when a man approached her from behind, threatened her and took her into a field.
An update on the inquiry was posted on the BBC's Crimewatch website on Monday.
The suspect is described as white with a slim build.  He is around 6ft tall and possibly has long hair.
At the time, he was wearing a grey hoodie and dark jeans. He may also speak with an Edinburgh or English accent.
The officer in charge of the investigation, Det Insp Grant Johnston said: "We are hopeful that tonight's Crimewatch appeal will help jog people's memories and result in a vital piece of information.
"Anyone who believes they have information that could assist with our ongoing enquiries is asked to come forward immediately."
Detectives said a  light-coloured five door saloon car seen a short time before the attack, near the railway line further down Newmills Road towards Gowanhill Farm Road.
Det Insp Johnston stressed that the people in this car are potential witnesses and appealed for them to come forward.
Only a description of the driver is available. He is said to be his 20s and around 5ft 7in tall.
There were also thought to be two or three passengers in the vehicle.
