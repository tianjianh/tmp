November's attacks across the French capital killed 130 people, with three suicide bombers dying in blasts outside the stadium as France played Germany.
The Euro 2016 hosts play their first home match since the incident when they meet Russia on Tuesday.
"You don't forget, but you have to move forward," said Deschamps.
France captain Hugo Lloris added: "It's important to return to the Stade de France to find our point of reference and confidence."
Security at the national stadium will also be on high alert following last week's Brussels attacks which left 35 dead.
"We have to have confidence in the security officials," said Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris.
"We have to continue to live and to live our passion together, it's important."
Deschamps will watch his team in action for the final time before naming his 23-man Euro 2016 squad.
"We've only had friendlies for the past two years, but I've repeated to all the players, it is up to them to seize their chances and to give their all for themselves and the team," said France's 1998 World Cup-winning captain.
"They have nothing to lose and everything to win."
France have been drawn alongside Romania, Albania and Switzerland in Group A. Russia are in Group B with England, Wales and Slovakia.
