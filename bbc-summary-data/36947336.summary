The 30-year-old had been at the Magpies for 21 years until his contract expired this summer, making 268 appearances for the relegated club.
"Steven Taylor gives us a proven piece that can step into our backline and perform immediately," said Timbers head coach Caleb Porter.
"His experience and leadership will be very important to our team."
He will join the Timbers, who are seventh in the Western Conference, once his international clearance comes through.
Meanwhile, Newcastle goalkeeper Freddie Woodman, 19, has signed a new four-year contract.
The England under-19 international has yet to make a senior appearance for the Championship club, but featured in 12 games on loan at Crawley last season.
