[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 21-year-old and a 19-year-old are being held on suspicion of the murder of Marcel Addai in Hoxton.
Marcel was stabbed in the chest on 4 September after being chased through St John's Estate in Pitfield Street. He died at the scene.
Police believe witnesses have yet to come forward. Marcel's family have appealed for help.
"These people must come forward to prevent another family going through the pain we are all now suffering," they said in a statement.
