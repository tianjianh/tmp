[SN]TITLE[SN]
Highland Council 'to cut a further 200 jobs'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland Council is to seek a cut of "at least" 200 jobs to help it make budget savings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Almost 400 staff at the local authority took voluntary redundancy packages last year.
Information on a "early release scheme" is to be made available to workers online in the effort to achieve a further reduction in posts.
The GMB union, which represents many said it was disappointed at the level of cuts proposed.
It warns that a further reduction in the council's workforce will increase work loads on remaining employees and affect the running of services.
Bill Fernie, Highland Council's budget leader, told BBC Alba that the early release scheme should mean compulsory redundancies could be avoided.
