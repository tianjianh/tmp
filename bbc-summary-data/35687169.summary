A music festival that has attracted more than 50,000 fans is moving from Birmingham to Liverpool.

Fusion Festival has teamed up with Capital Liverpool radio station and wants to host the event at Otterspool Promenade in September.
The festival, now in its fourth year, boasted performances from Ed Sheeran, Rudimental and The Vamps in 2015.
The line-up and ticket information for the event on 3 and 4 September will be announced in April.
A Birmingham City Council spokesman said they had no comment as the festival is not a council-organised event.
The move follows Liverpool being declared a Unesco City of Music in recognition of its musical heritage.
Claire McColgan, Liverpool's culture director, said: "We're delighted that Fusion Festival is heading to Liverpool.
"It's a real coup that this city is going to host yet another major music event this year which will bring with it a creative and economic boost to the area."
Damien Sanders, event director of Fusion Festival, said: 'We are so excited to finally announce that Fusion is coming to Liverpool.
"Liverpool is such a vibrant, fun city that we can't wait to become part of its musical fabric."
The decision by Fusion to move the festival from Birmingham to Merseyside is a blow for festival fans in the West Midlands.
The area also lost Wireless Festival in 2015.
The proposed location of the festival at Otterspool Promenade is subject to a licence being granted.
