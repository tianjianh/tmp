Police said 15 arrests were made at the island's ports last year and a number of "notable seizures" of heroin, cocaine and cannabis were made.
Chief Constable Gary Roberts said "stopping the evil trade in Class A drugs remains a top priority".
There were six drug-related deaths in the island in 2015.
Home Affairs Minister Juan Watterson said the deaths "highlight the devastating impact that drugs can have on a community."
"The Isle of Man takes a robust stance against drug crime and those involved in trafficking can expect lengthy prison sentences."
