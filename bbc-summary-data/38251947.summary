[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than twice the number of Irish passports were issued to people in Great Britain last month than in November 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The number issued to people in Northern Ireland also doubled, in the largest monthly increase since the Brexit vote.
June's result has sparked a marked rise in the number of people applying for Irish and European Union passports.
November is normally one of the quietest months of the year for passport applications.
But the total number from Northern Ireland - 4,569 - was up by more than 600 from October.
Some 6,855 people people in Great Britain applied for an Irish passport in November 2016, a significant jump from 3,133 last year.
Applications from Northern Ireland went up from 2,267 in November last year to 4,569 last month.
