Three attackers were killed at Gush Etzion Junction, where similar incidents have occurred, and the fourth was killed near Hebron, the army said.
No soldiers were injured. Palestinian health officials confirmed the deaths.
There has been an upsurge in violence between Israelis and Palestinians in recent months.
"Three attackers, armed with knives, attempted to stab soldiers guarding the Gush Etzion junction," an Israeli military statement said.
Palestinian media named the three as Muhanad Kawazbeh, 20, Ahmed Kawazbeh, 21, and Alaa Kawazbeh, 20, all from the village of Sair, north-east of Hebron.
Shortly afterwards, a Palestinian was shot while tried to stab soldiers near Hebron, an Israeli statement said.
He was later named as Khalil Shalalda, 16, also from Sair.
Twenty-two Israelis have been killed in attacks including stabbings, car rammings and shootings since 1 October.
More than 140 Palestinians have been killed. More than half were said by Israel to be attackers. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli forces.
