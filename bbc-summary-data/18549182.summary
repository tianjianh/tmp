With expert analysis, rules, history, ones to watch and an explanation of each sport's unique appeal, BBC Sport provides comprehensive guides alongside details of how to try them out.
You're going to get such excitement - archery is very fast-paced

ATHLETICS: BBC Sport event guide and how to get involved
Badminton players are super-fit, super-fast and have super reactions
Not many sports hit speeds of up to 200mph - but badminton does. Or the shuttlecock, at least.
It'll take you a while to hit it that fast but if you want to learn, there are more than 2,200 clubs in the UK. Use our guide to find one near you plus find out where Britain's medal hopes might lie at London 2012.
BADMINTON: BBC Sport event guide and how to get involved

In canoe slalom, something is always on the edge of going wrong
You could fill 75 bath tubs per second with the water coursing down the Lee Valley slalom course. So it's probably an idea to start somewhere else.
Happily, there are clubs all over the UK with equipment you can borrow and slightly calmer waters on hand. Our guide has all the details plus all the rules of slalom canoeing - like gates and penalties - explained.
CANOE SLALOM: BBC Sport event guide and how to get involved
Team GB are expected to win a couple of medals here

BMX: BBC Sport event guide and how to get involved
Czech star Jaroslav Kulhavy is a huge man but he seems to defy physics
There are four types of mountain bike race - cross-country, the Olympic one, is probably a good place to start. Downhill can be something to aim at for later. Helmet, knee pads and so on? Essential.
British Cycling offers various ways into MTB and we've got them covered in our guide. We also take a look at the top British riders and explain the rules of Olympic cross-country mountain biking ahead of the Games.
All British hopes will be pinned on super-sprinter Mark Cavendish
Britain's roads reverberate like never before with the whirring wheels of weekend warriors on their road bikes. Fancy joining them? We'll explain how initiatives like Sky Ride can help out. You don't have to compete - simply going for a ride counts.
However, there's a lot more at stake this summer for the best British road cycling team in generations, if not ever. Our guide picks apart the rules and riders for the London 2012 road races and time trials.
Young British star Laura Trott will win the hearts of the crowd
After the Olympics there will be a shiny, new velodrome waiting for you. But what skills do you need? Why stay indoors instead of pedalling out on the open road? And doesn't always going left get boring?
Our guide answers these questions and can help you find a track near you. British hopes are high for more track cycling success this summer, so we also preview the London 2012 track cycling programme.
Divers look like they are performing magic with their twists and turns
Diving tones a wide variety of muscles, engaging the lower body, back, shoulders, abdominals and arm muscles. Don't underestimate this sport - as you get better, it becomes a full-body workout.

Who doesn't want to watch two people fighting with swords?

Hardly anyone has the skill to pull off the feats you will see at the Games
Bad news. You can't get a perfect 10 any more - that scoring system faded some time ago - but it turns out 16.375 is the new 10.0, so you'll just have to aim for that when you sign up at one of the 1,600-plus gymnastics clubs in the UK.
Our guide gives you all the links you need to make a start, as well as explaining how anyone gets to a score of 16.375 (or higher) and who from Team GB might do just that this summer.

In judo, technique can and does often overcome power
