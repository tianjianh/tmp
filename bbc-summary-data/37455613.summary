Dean Cox: Crawley Town winger joins non-league Burgess Hill Town on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crawley Town winger Dean Cox has joined Isthmian League Premier Division side Burgess Hill Town on loan until the end of 2016.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 29-year-old joined the Reds from Leyton Orient on 13 September but he is unable to make his EFL debut until 2 January because he left the O's after the transfer window closed.
"It's an arrangement which suits everyone," boss Dermot Drummy said.
"Burgess Hill are an excellent club and we'll be monitoring his progress."
