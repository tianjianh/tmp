Evans, 20, and 21-year-old Smith came through the Pontypridd schoolboy ranks and the Blues academy.
"They are both very hard-working, diligent and dedicated players," Blues coach Danny Wilson said.
"There are is still plenty for them to learn but they can certainly go a long way if they continue their progress here."
Smith made his senior Blues debut in 2014 and has made 10 appearances for the region this season.
"I'm happy with the progress I'm making at Cardiff Blues and have been involved a lot this season," Smith said.
"There is a lot of competition for centre places and that is only good. It drives me on and I'm also learning from the other boys."
Evans has made 22 appearances for the Blues and has featured in consecutive Junior World Championships for Wales' Under-20 side.
"The coaches here really know their stuff and that's had a big influence on my decision," Evans said.
"I've been with Cardiff Blues since I started and I'm really looking forward to what the next few years hold."
