The 30-year-old Olympic champion won the IAAF Combined Challenge in Germany with 6,733 points - 64 more than she managed in winning the world title.
Ennis-Hill built on her lead after the opening four events with a personal best of 6.63m in the long jump.
She threw 44.37m in the javelin and ran the 800m in two minutes 11.46 seconds.
That gave her victory by 257 points, with Germany's Carolin Schafer second.
It was only Ennis-Hill's second outing of the season after an Achilles injury forced her to withdraw from June's event in Gotzis.
It was her only opportunity to compete in a full heptathlon before heading to Rio to defend her title when the Olympics begin on 5 August.
