Megan was due to take the first of her GCSE exams on Tuesday, said her school. She wanted to become a midwife.
Her family said in a statement: "Megan was our beautiful, talented, loving daughter and sister, and our hearts have been utterly broken by her death.
"The thought of life without Megan is impossible to imagine, and we cannot adequately express in words the sense of numbness and overwhelming grief we feel at her loss.
"She was bright, clever, and a responsible person who loved her family and her many friends.
"She had a strong self-will and had set her heart on training to becoming a midwife.
"Knowing how confident and determined she was, we have no doubt she would have realised that dream."
Wigston College, where Megan was a student, said in a statement: "Megan was funny, friendly and good.
"She was popular and had a wide range of friends. She liked people and they liked her and this is how we will remember her.
