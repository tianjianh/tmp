A group of animal-lovers mounted a rescue for four orphaned ducklings - on pedalos.

The young birds were saved after their mother was killed by a dog in Station Park, Moffat.
They were pulled to safety by a family on pedalos in the park's pond.
The ducks are now being cared for at the South of Scotland Wildlife Hospital in Dumfries and they will be released back into the wild once they are old enough to fend for themselves.
Animal rescue officer Tricia Smith, of the Scottish SPCA, said, "Sadly the mum was killed by a dog, leaving her four ducklings on their own.
"This is an important example of why dogs should be kept on a lead and under control whenever there are wild animals nearby.
"As the ducklings were on the water it was extremely difficult to catch them but with the help of a few willing volunteers on pedalos we managed to rescue them all.
"We'd like to say a special thank you and well done to Chloe MacFarlane, who caught the last duckling with her fast hands."
