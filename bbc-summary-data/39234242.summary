[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the main routes through Dumfries and Galloway is being shut as part of a Â£475,000 improvement project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A75 will be closed for about 10 miles between Annan and Gretna from 19:00 on Friday until 06:00 on Monday.
The works will aim to address potholes and surface cracking on the road used by up to 9,000 vehicles every day.
Scotland TranServ, which is carrying out the repairs, said they had been timed to try to reduce the impact on commuters, businesses and families.
The road will also be closed overnight between 19:00 and 06:00 between Monday 13 March and Friday 17 March.
Jane Maclennan, Scotland TranServ's assistant engineer on the project, said: "Potholes and surface cracking are widely recognised issues on the A75, and working with Transport Scotland, we're doing everything possible to identify the most pertinent locations and programme improvement works to address these defects.
"The A75 is one of the longest routes in Dumfries and Galloway, and we're working hard to prioritise the most pressing road surface issues."
Diverted traffic will leave the A75 at Gretna West (B721), travelling through Rigg, Eastriggs and Dornock, and rejoining the A75 at Annan East (B6357).
Eastbound traffic will follow the same route in reverse.
