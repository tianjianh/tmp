The Heed led when right-back Ryan Higgins failed to clear CJ Hamilton's cross and sub Rob Ramshaw tapped in.
Kane Richards nodded in to level before Higgins' low long-range shot gave Chester the lead two minutes later.
But Rooney teed up Hannah, who was set up by Tom Shaw for a second before Dan Johnson scored from Ramshaw's cross.
Following their season-closing three victories, Chester finish 17th in the National League table, six points clear of trouble.
Neil Aspin's Gateshead ended up in ninth, 13 points adrift of a play-off place.
Hannah's 22-goal tally was beaten by only three other National League strikers, Cheltenham's Dan Holman and Grimsby's Padraig Amond, who both scored 30, and Barrow's Andy Cook (24).
Chester caretaker manager Jon McCarthy told BBC Radio Merseyside:
"I'm really pleased for the players. They can go and enjoy their summer now and the club can get on with what they have to do.
"But I wanted it for the fans too. We wanted to thank them after a frustrating season. We wanted a performance, and it came in the end.
"We talked about having a little bit more desire than them. We were quite ruthless. There was no sentiment or young players and we kept the same team and we knew Craig Mahon and Ross Hannah would want to come on.
"It is just playing more 4-4-2 than 4-2-4. It's about bringing wide players into deeper positions which actually gives them more of the ball, rather than them going and marking the full backs. It just makes us so much tighter."
