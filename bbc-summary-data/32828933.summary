How to make EU referendum debate fly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The debate surrounding the in-out EU referendum hasn't taken long to gather momentum.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are a number of Welsh dimensions.
First of all, timing. David Cameron is facing calls to hold the referendum early, possibly next year.
You'd have thought this is something he will want to do but at the same time he also won't want to be rushed into negotiating new terms with the EU.
The first minister has already warned of the dangers of holding it at the same time as the assembly election in May.
Alex Salmond has also done the same, but said he favoured an early vote, which would suggest that autumn 2016 would be most attractive to the SNP.
There are clear dangers of confusing the electorate or even over-shadowing the assembly election with the in-out referendum.
Then there's the economic dimension.
Big business is getting in early. The boss of JCB, which has a factory in Wrexham, says the UK has nothing to fear from an exit.
The counter view has come from the president of Airbus UK, who says the company would reconsider investment here in the event of a withdrawal.
The Airbus wings plant at Broughton in Flintshire employs 6,000 people and is the single largest manufacturing plant in Britain.
The construction of the Airbus fleet must be the best example of an integrated EU-supply chain.
After the wings are made at Broughton, they are either flown or transported by sea to the enormous final assembly plant at Toulouse in south west France.
The engines, cockpits and tail fins and the rest all arrive from other parts of the EU.
UKIP have always said it's scaremongering to suggest that Airbus would shut up shop at Broughton if the UK leaves, and it is fair to say that no company in its right mind is going to walk away from generations of wing-making expertise in north-east Wales.
But Airbus is not immune to financial pressures and demands from countries in the far and middle east who buy so many of its aircraft, and who want the company to start building their planes in that part of the world.
It's in that context that the warnings from Airbus will inevitably be significant.
The other element of the EU referendum debate for Wales will be related to regional aid.
Wales is a clear financial net beneficiary thanks to the millions spent on a vast array of projects from community centres, to training schemes to dual carriageways.
The problem is that it has failed to lift Wales from the bottom of the UK league in economic activity terms, and the rise of UKIP in Wales is partly a response to the disillusionment many feel about the results of all that aid.
PS: My previous blog focused on the debate about the NHS and I want to follow it up with a classic exchange at the Senedd on Wednesday between the Health Minister Mark Drakeford and his Conservative shadow Darren Millar.
It was a classic not because it told us anything we didn't already know but it encapsulated perfectly the tone of the debate between the Welsh government and opposition parties at the assembly about health services.
Darren Millar: " Isn't it the honest truth minister, that you need to admit, as have other members of the governing party, that you have lost the argument on the NHS?
"You need to pull your socks up, pull your finger out and deliver the improvements that the patients of Wales need to see, not just in terms of emergency departments' performance but across the board."
Mark Drakeford: "Once again the contribution of Darren Miller is a triumph of prejudice over analysis, the idle bile that is his stock in trade when it comes to the NHS in Wales is noticed every day by people who work in it and use it.
"His party has not a single good word to say about the NHS in Wales and their consistent attempts to denigrate and run down what people achieve every day in Wales is well understood."
Expect much more of the same from here until May.
