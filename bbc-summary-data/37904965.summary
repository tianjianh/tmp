Holman wasted early chances for the Robins but he made a decisive contribution to the 19th-minute opener. He blasted a shot that Ben Garratt could only parry and Wright followed up at the far post to snaffle the rebound.
With leading scorer Ryan Lowe left on the bench after recent injury problems, Crewe lacked a threat and youngsters Alex Kiwomya and Dan Udoh struggled to make an impact on the Robins' back three.
The restless natives in a crowd of just 1,711 were given further cause to moan in the 36th minute when centre-half Rob Dickie thrust forward and slid the ball inside for Barthram, who beat Garratt at his near post.
Garratt then turned away Holman's piledriver and Crewe were fortunate to have James Jones well placed to divert Dan O'Shaughnessy's shot off the line from the resulting corner.
The tie was soon out of their reach after the restart with Cheltenham striking twice in the space of nine minutes.
First former Alex player Waters brought down a high ball amid a crowd of home defenders and hooked the ball into the far corner in the 53rd minute, before Holman cut in from the left and drove into the top corner.
The goals kept coming with Lowe, brought on at the restart, turning home from close range after playing a one-two with fellow substitute Callum Saunders in the 65th minute, but it was a mere consolation for Crewe.
