Archaeologists have discovered "globally unparalleled" evidence of prehistoric eating practices.

Experts at Cardiff University said 10 years of research had revealed a custom of mass feasting, focused on pigs' right forequarters, at Llanmaes in the Vale of Glamorgan.
The majority of the bones found were from one quarter of the pig, suggesting selective eating.
Scientists said many of the pigs had been brought from a distance away.
Dr Richard Madgwick said it was "particularly startling" the practice had continued over centuries during the Iron Age.
"These feasts would have represented a time of solidarity when people came together to feast on pig right forequarters just as their fathers and their fathers' fathers had done," he said.
