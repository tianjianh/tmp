The first storm to be officially named by the Met Office is bringing gusts in excess of 60mph to Northern Ireland.

Storm Abigail will mainly impact Scotland but parts of the north and west coast of Ireland are being hit with heavy rain and strong winds.
The storm is bringing colder air, so after a recent mild spell Friday is likely to be quite chilly.
Abigail will move away,  but ex-hurricane Kate will hit on Saturday bringing wet, windy weather.
Driving conditions are being affected by the storm conditions, and in the Republic of Ireland flights at Dublin airport have been disrupted due to the strong winds.
Passengers on one flight from Rome to Dublin were kept on a holding pattern above the airport before being diverted to Shannon airport in the west of the country.
One couple, George and Gwen, said: "It's caused a bit of disruption because we're from Kilkenny and can't get to our car.
"But we're quite philosophical. It's a lot worse for those on connecting flights who don't know what's happening."
Karen Griffin and her family from Boston in the United States were planning to stop in Dublin on their way home from a holiday in Italy.
She said a lack of communication had been a problem for them.
"We were on the runway for quite some time and then told buses would take us to Dublin," she said.
"There's still no buses and we've been waiting over an hour.
"We had hoped to sightsee in Dublin but now we think we'll just head straight to the pub."
