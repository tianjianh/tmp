Dragged down by the Mers virus and weak exports, GDP in the second quarter grew just 0.3% in the second quarter compared with 0.8% in the first.
Further bad news came from South Korean car giant Hyundai, which reported a 24% drop in net profit after overseas sales were weaker than expected.
Sales to China, which is Hyundai's biggest market, fell by about 8%.
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 edged up 0.4% to close at 20,683.95.
Data released on Thursday showed Japan's trade deficit narrowed sharply last month, as exports picked up on the back of a weaker yen.
In June, the value of exports jumped 9.5% while imports fell by 2.9% leaving the trade deficit at 69.0bn yen.
Mainland China stocks extended their recovery on Thursday, rising for a sixth consecutive session. The benchmark Shanghai Composite closed up 2.4% at 4,123.92, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended 0.5% higher at 25,398.85.
