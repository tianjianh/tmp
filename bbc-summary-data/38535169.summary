[SN]TITLE[SN]
Consultation on 11-19 Haverfordwest school starts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fifth consultation on the future of secondary education in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, begins on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pembrokeshire council proposes closing Sir Thomas Picton and Tasker Milward schools to establish an 11-19 school from September 2018.
The new school would initially use both sites.
Previous plans to create an 11-16 school, with a sixth form at Pembrokeshire College, were met with protests from students.
The latest consultation will supersede one preliminary and three statutory consultations.
An education spokesman from Pembrokeshire council said the council was "duty bound" to comply with the Welsh Government's School Organisation Code which states they must hold a fresh consultation when "a new option emerges".
The latest plans also include designating Johnston and Neyland primary schools as feeder schools to Milford Haven School, where as previously they were feeder schools for Haverfordwest.
The deadline for consultation responses is 28 February.
There will also be a public meeting on 1 February at County Hall from 18:00 GMT.
