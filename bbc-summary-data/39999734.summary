Thomas Brown suffered fatal injuries while riding at Hardwick Motocross track in Sedgefield, County Durham, in April.
The 27-year-old Barnard Castle farmer's funeral was held at St Mary's Church in the town, with the coffin arriving  on a trailer pulled by a tractor.
Mr Brown's family said they wanted the day to be a "celebration" of his life.
The popular motocross rider came off his bike at a privately-run event next to Low Hardwick Farm.
The cortege brought the town centre to a standstill with riders revving their engines as the procession made its way to the church.
Mr Brown had worked on his family's farm and had been involved in motocross since the age of eight, Durham Police said.
After the crash he was taken by air ambulance to hospital in Middlesbrough, but was pronounced dead shortly before arrival.
A collection was made in aid of the Great North Air Ambulance Service after the funeral.
