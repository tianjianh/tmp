The 34-year-old matched Steffi Graf's Open era record with a 7-5 6-3 victory over Angelique Kerber at the All England Club on Saturday.
Williams was one title away from the record when she won Wimbledon in 2015, but had lost in the Australian and French Open finals this year.
"It was really tough," Williams told BBC Sport.
"I came so close at the last three Grand Slams and was not able to pull through but I felt when I came into Wimbledon I had taken the pressure off, I didn't feel it any more. I just have to win.
"It was definitely a lot of relief. This was never my goal growing up and all of a sudden it became my goal and felt like the world's goal as well. So I was excited to get to that 22. "
Graf reacted to Williams equalling her record by writing on Facebook: "What an incredible performance by Serena at Wimbledon. Such a gift to all sport fans who get to continue to watch her add to an already amazing career #22."
Williams' win on Saturday means she has now won seven singles titles at Wimbledon.

Kerber, 28, stunned Williams to win the Australian Open title in January - the German's first major victory.
But the fourth seed could not find a way past the American world number one on Centre Court, and earned only one chance to break her opponent's serve.
"I think I played what I could today. Serena's serving was unbelievable," said Kerber.
"At the end I was trying everything, but she deserved it. I think I was not the one who lost the match, I think she won the match. Today, Serena deserved it."
Williams is now level with German Graf in the all-time list of Grand Slam singles champions, but remains two behind overall leader Margaret Court, the Australian who won 13 of her 24 major titles before tennis turned professional in 1968.
When asked if surpassing Court was her next aim, Williams responded: "Oh God, no.
"I've learned a lot about 22. I learned not to get involved in those debates and conversations. I just learned to just play tennis. That's what I do best.
"One thing I learned about last year is to enjoy the moment. I'm definitely going to enjoy this."
