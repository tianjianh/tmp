[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who fantasised about "putting a bullet in Prince Charles' head" has been detained indefinitely.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Colborne, 37, of Southampton, was found guilty in September of plotting a mass cyanide attack from his bedroom after a retrial.
Jurors heard he had felt "belittled" for being a ginger, white male.
The Old Bailey heard how Colborne fantasised about assassinating Prince Charles in order for Prince Harry to become king.
A previous jury did not reach a verdict.
Colborne was detained under the Mental Health Act.
After the second trial he was found guilty of possessing handwritten notes and books related to making recipes for lethal poisons such as cyanide.
Prosecutor Annabel Darlow said Colborne's notes also expressed hatred for "non-Aryans" whom he referred to as "blacks and Caucasian idiots".
He bought ingredients over the internet, and stockpiled dust masks, metal filter funnels, plastic syringes and latex gloves at his home in Butts Road, jurors were told.
Colborne was cleared of intending to use the chemicals and paraphernalia as part of the terror plot.
He was arrested on 3 June last year after his half-brother and mother uncovered chemicals and handwritten papers detailing his racial hatred stashed in his bedroom.
