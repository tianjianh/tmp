[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mike Samwell, 35, was fatally injured as he confronted thieves outside his home in Chorlton, Greater Manchester.
Raymond Davies, 21, from Manchester, appeared at the city's magistrates court accused of manslaughter, burglary and aggravated vehicle taking.
He was remanded in custody to appear at Manchester Crown Court on 25 May.
In April, Ryan Gibbons, 29, of Steven Court, Egerton Road South, was charged with murder, burglary and aggravated vehicle taking.
His trial date has been set for 16 October.
Former submarine officer Mr Samwell was asleep with his wife Jessica in their Cranbourne Road home when they were awoken by a noise outside at about 03:00 BST and he went to investigate.
Police believe he was run over by his car, a black Audi S3, which was later found about three miles away on Whitby Avenue, Ladybarn, with extensive damage.
Mr Samwell's family described him as a "special, kind and exceptionally talented man".
