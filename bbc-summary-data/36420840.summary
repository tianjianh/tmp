League Two club Luton Town have signed Oxford United pair Danny Hylton and Johnny Mullins on two-year contracts.

Hylton, 27, was Oxford's third-highest scorer as the U's won promotion to League One but has turned down a new deal to remain in the fourth tier.
Mullins, 30, made 51 appearances in all competitions this season but was released earlier this month.
"Luton have got a fantastic style of play, especially since Nathan came on board," Hylton told the club website.
"It's an honour to join Luton - it's a massive club."
Mullins added: "When a club like Luton call, it was a no-brainer - I wanted to join. I've come to get promoted and play in front of some top-drawer fans."
