Symons, 24, joins older brother Matt, 26, at the Exiles after three years with Worcester Warriors.
Leicester Tigers' Sebastian de Chaves, Saracens' Dave Porecki and Bath's Max Northcote-Green have also agreed deals.
Northampton prop Danny Hobbs-Awoyemi, 22, is the other player to agree terms with the Premiership's bottom club.
Porecki played against London Irish in the first Premiership game to be played overseas earlier this month.
"Andy [Symons] is a very talented centre, who has proven his worth to Worcester during his three seasons," said London Irish's head of operations Glenn Delaney.
"He gives us strength in depth in our backline, and we are looking forward to having him at the club."
