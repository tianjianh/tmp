[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cattle moving service's use of Welsh language criticised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The body responsible for monitoring the movement of cattle has been criticised by the Welsh language commissioner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Meri Huws said 92.5% of calls to the Welsh language line of the British Cattle Movement Service between September and February were not dealt with in the language.
In November, two calls were dealt with in Welsh out of a total of 124.
The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) which oversees BCMS, said it took its Welsh language obligations seriously.
Ms Huws concluded the agency had breached its own Welsh language policy and recommended the agency provides her office with monthly statistics for a year to monitor the situation.
The RPA said it would consider the recommendations in the report so it could "continue to support Welsh-speaking customers".
