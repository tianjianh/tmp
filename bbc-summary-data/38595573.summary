The 51-year-old was found in the tank under the garage of her home in Royston, Hertfordshire, in July. She had been missing for three months.
Her partner, Ian Stewart, 56, has denied murdering her.
John Bailey told St Alban's Crown Court the joke was made in "full earshot" of Mr Stewart.
He said the quip was made during his first and only visit to his sister's new home in August 2013 - almost three years before her death.
"Helen showed us the house and garden, the outbuildings, the garage," he said.
"I think it was Helen, but it could have been one or both of them, mentioned an old well in the garage. I asked where and was directed to half way along the right hand side of the wall.

"Then there was some banter, almost certainly instigated by Helen, that it was a good place to hide a body," he added.
Stuart Trimmer QC, prosecuting, asked if both the defendant and Ms Bailey were present at the time.
"Yes, they were," he said.
"The well never featured in my consciousness during her disappearance," he told the court.
"But when the police officer visited to tell me he had discovered a body in an old well, the recollection of our discussions came back."
Asked about his sister, Mr Bailey described her as a "highly intelligent, extremely funny, a very witty person".
"She was very much somebody who would come to someone's aid as a friend, she would always put herself out there.
"She was very strong willed, she was quite a powerful person, but she was quite fragile. She suffered from anxiety throughout her life."
Friend Tracey Stratton, who told the court she had known Ms Bailey for 15 years, said she last saw her in person in January but they had kept in constant touch by email and text.
On 11 April, the two had exchanged emails about wedding dresses and the venue, the trial heard.
"There was nothing then to make me think there was anything wrong, she was excited about the future," she said.
Ms Stratton spoke of her worry when Ms Bailey did not answer her mobile or reply to a text later that day.
"Things just weren't right," she said.
Ian Stewart denies charges of murder, preventing a lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice.
The trial continues.
