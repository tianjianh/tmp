A lane of the A63 in Hull is to be closed overnight for a ground survey to start ahead of the construction of a multimillion-pound footbridge.

The bridge will connect the Princes Quay shopping centre with the Marina. Work is expected to start next year.
A lane in both directions will be closed until 9 December.
Highways England said it would allow contractors to safely investigate "around the location of the new bridge".
Lanes will be closed between the exit and entry slip roads at Mytongate Gyratory, at the Ferensway junction, to allow contractors to dig bore holes in the centre of the roundabout, a spokesperson said.
The ground investigation work is due to finish by the end of January while the bridge is expected to be completed by Easter the following year in time for the port's 2017 City of Culture celebrations.
Project manager Jimmy Holmes said: "We will work hard to keep disruption to a minimum and thank drivers and residents for their patience while we carry out this work."
