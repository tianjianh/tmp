[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A West Midlands police officer has admitted sexually assaulting two women while on duty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Steven Walters had denied two counts of sexual assault between February and April last year but pleaded guilty at Stafford Crown Court on Monday.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Walters "targeted vulnerable victims of crime for sexual purposes".
The 48-year-old will be sentenced on 29 September.
Walters, who is suspended from his job in Sutton Coldfield, had also denied misconduct in a public office, but the prosecution offered no evidence on that charge.
The police watchdog was alerted after one of the victims complained about the officer.
IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said Walters "completely abused" his position of trust.
"I would like to praise the courage and bravery of the women who came forward to give evidence against him and hope that they can now move on with their lives in the knowledge that justice has been done.
"Such unprofessional and disgraceful conduct cannot go unchallenged and I hope that today's outcome reinforces the message that officers who behave in such a way will be exposed and brought before the courts where appropriate."
