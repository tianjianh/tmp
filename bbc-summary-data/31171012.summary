Why we love pound shops so much

Poundland and 99p Stores sell everything from bacon to soap, via One Direction calendars, for just a quid.

Now Poundland is trying to buy its rival - for 55 million of those pound coins.
That would add 251 shops to its existing stores, which already number almost 600 across Britain and Ireland.
Over time, all the 99p Stores would be converted to Poundland shops if the deal is approved by competition authorities.
So what is it about pound shops that keep us coming?
Well it's not just the price.
"People see enticing prices that are great, but then buy more volume than they actually need," explains Dr Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London (UCL).
"Customers think they can control and calculate how much they are buying. But in reality they buy more - it is an illusion."
Pound shops use a number of methods to keep things cheap:
"When you operate in these stores you have more clarity over how much things will cost," Dr Tsivrikos told Newsbeat.
"People like specific amounts and being in control."
"The low-price, no-frills formula has found particular resonance in Britain's era of sluggish economic growth," says Deborah Weinswig, head of global retail and technology at the Fung Business Intelligence Centre (FBIC).
The FBIC says pound shops have boomed in the UK, mirroring the rise of cheaper supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl.
If Poundland completes the purchase of 99p Stores it will, of course, mean a 1p price rise on thousands of products.
The boss of Poundland argues that the change will make the stores more efficient.
"I think people probably will find the Â£1 price a little bit better, because they won't have to start rooting around for pennies," argues Poundland chief executive Jim McCarthy.
"Not having to give the penny back is quite a significant operational efficiency."
