This week's local papers feature the Manchester bombing, the murder of an elderly couple and under-age drinking.

A student from County Antrim, who was working at the Manchester Arena when a bomber killed 22 people, has been reliving the horror.
Speaking exclusively to the Antrim Guardian, Shannon Smylie said it was just a "normal night" until "there was a bang".
At first, the 20-year-old thought a balloon had burst and then she was told a sound system had exploded. She was moved outside the building and then ordered back in.
"There were bodies lying around. Wheelchair users were sliding down the stairs trying to get away," she said.
"Then a woman ran past with a child in her arms. I didn't know if the child had died or had passed out, but it was terrifying."
Ms Smylie, who was working as an attendant in the VIP suite, said she was able to borrow someone's phone to let her family know she was safe.
The Salford University student, who attended Antrim Grammar School, says she has now been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Neighbours of an elderly couple, Marjorie and Michael Cawdery, who were murdered in their home in Portadown last Friday have described the killings as "a great shock".
Forty-year-old Thomas Scoot McEnte, from Moorfield Court in Killkeel, appeared in Lisburn Magistrates' Court charged with double murder earlier this week.
A friend of the couple's for more than 20 years, David Hamill, told the Impartial Reporter: "They were quite a private couple. Very gracious people".
In a statement the Cawdery family described the murders as "awful and incomprehensible".
A disabled man who was attacked by two men who hijacked his car outside Sixmilecross is the lead story in this week's Tyrone Constitution.
The two men flagged down the car before pulling the disabled man out, assaulting him and removing his glasses before driving off.
The victim who suffers from Cervical Disc Disease and uses crutches, told the paper that he was dragged out of the car "head first" and pulled across the road.
"The men never communicated - that was the most frightening thing. It's the first time I've ever felt vulnerable," he added.
The man's vehicle was found crashed into a bridge not far from the attack.
The Ulster Gazette's front page features a deer under the headline "Heroes & Villains".
The animals are not the villains of the piece - the bad guys are those who allegedly doused Yanna the deer with corrosive chemicals, according to its owner.
Tandgragee farmer Kenny Gracey, who was exhibiting his animals at a fair in Scarva when the injuries were sustained, has offered a reward for information.
However, fair organisers issued a statement saying an independent vet had assessed the deer and found "no signs of burning consistent with a chemical attack".
The vet's findings support the account of an eyewitness who saw the deer being bitten by a donkey, which was housed in the same enclosure, organisers said.
The Newry Reporter's front page story is about the new Greencastle to Greenore ferry which will not be leaving the harbour for a while yet.
It was all set for its maiden voyage on Thursday 1 June but there has been "an unforeseen delay in taking delivery of some specialised technical products (navigational lights and a fender)".
Carlingford Ferries said they were "disappointed but not downhearted". It will now take to the water on an unspecified date later in June.
The paper says this is not the first delay to beset the controversial project, which was first proposed a decade ago and has faced opposition from Greencastle residents.
The Londonderry Sentinel reports that up to 300 drunk teenagers were found drunk in St Columb's Park  in Derry on Friday 26 May.
A police source told the paper that they believe some parents left their children off at the park.
Officers have appealed for parents to take greater responsibility and to work with them in order to tackle the issue.
