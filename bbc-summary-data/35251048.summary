The £10.6m project is part of a Cube Housing Association's programme which already covers Collina Street in Maryhill and Gorget in Knightswood.
The centre will have three 500KW wood pellet boilers and 1.5MW of condensing gas boilers for top up energy.
Underground heat mains, a new pipe network and heating systems and metering will all be installed.
Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil announced details of the scheme during a visit to Cube's Gorget district heating scheme.
"This £10.6m project will make a massive difference to the lives of hundreds of households in Glasgow, supplying heat more efficiently and saving people money on their bills," he said.
"The district heating scheme will help tackle fuel poverty, be better for the planet and make homes in the Broomhill area warmer and cheaper to heat."
British Gas is carrying out the building and installation work at Broomhill and providing £5.6m in funding.
The remainder of the cost is being met by a £5m loan from the Scottish Partnership for Regeneration in Urban Centres Fund - a joint Scottish government and European Regional Development Fund initiative.
Cube chair Liz Ruine said: "This huge investment in our homes will make a big difference to the lives of Cube tenants and to the communities around it."
