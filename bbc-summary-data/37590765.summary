Lewis Evans, 18, from Thornbury near Bristol, suffered "devastating injuries" when he came off the bike on the Greek island of Zante on Monday.
Mr Evans had holiday insurance but it did not cover quad biking.
His parents were told to "expect the worst" and flew out to be with him. His family have set up an appeal to raise the money for an air ambulance.
His great-aunt Sue Turl said: "Lewis has had devastating injuries.
"He's been diagnosed with a ruptured spleen, a very large hole in one lung and a not-so-large hole in the other lung."
She said he also has several broken ribs and two bad breaks to his shoulder.
Ms Turl said: "A few days ago, they [his parents] were told to expect the worst. He rallied round this morning and is now stable.
"It turns out the insurance have refused to make any payment, saying that quad biking [is a] dangerous sport and it's in the small print. His parents are absolutely devastated.
"The air ambulance to bring him home will cost at least £30,000 and his family aren't in the position to pay that sort of money."
