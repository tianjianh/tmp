Police forces across Wales have stepped up officers' presence on the streets following Tuesday's terror attacks in Brussels.

South Wales Police ACC Jon Stratford said the move was to protect the public and provide reassurance.
Explosions at Brussels Airport and a metro station in the city are feared to have killed at least 31 people.
ACC Stratford said the increase in patrols was not down to any specific threat.
He said: "Our thoughts are with the people of Brussels following this morning's horrific attacks."
"As a precaution forces across Wales have increased policing presence at key locations, including transport hubs, to protect the public and provide reassurance. This is not in relation to any specific information or intelligence.
"The number of officers deployed will be regularly assessed. These additional officers are deployed as part of reassurance measures.
"The threat to the UK from international terrorism remains at severe, as it has been since August 2014, meaning an attack is highly likely."
Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain faced "a very real terror threat", announcing extra patrols at ports, airports, Tube stations and major railway stations.
