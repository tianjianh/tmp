She beat off competition from 19 other finalists from across the world to take the title.
The week-long competition was whittled down to five for Sunday's final at Cardiff's St David's Hall.
Ms Koutcher will take home the coveted trophy, Â£15,000 prize money, and will perform a new piece by composer John Lunn at the BBC Proms 2016.
Meanwhile, Amartuvshin Enkhbat from Mongolia won the Audience prize.
The finalists who missed out on Sunday evening included Lauren Michelle from the United States, Oleksiy Palchykov from the Ukraine, and Jongmin Park from South Korea.
Devised in 1983, the competition is designed to find the talented classical singers of the future.
