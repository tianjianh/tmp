Leicester City's Danny Simpson denied strangling the mother of his child but was convicted last May.
However, the 29-year-old's lawyer complained that journalists had found where he was carrying out his community service, making it impossible.
A judge revoked the sentence and ruled he should serve a curfew instead.
Simpson's lawyer Gary Ryan asked if the millionaire footballer could instead pay a fine, arguing that a curfew would be "unfair and unjust", and would interfere with his football commitments.
But this was rejected by District Judge Alexandra Simmonds, at Manchester Magistrates Court.
She said while press intrusion was to blame for Simpson not completing the work, a fine would be "no punishment", given his financial position.
The judge said Simpson's sentence for assaulting his ex-partner Stephanie Ward was a "richly-deserved punishment".
The former Manchester United player's community sentence was revoked, and a curfew imposed.
Simpson must wear an electronic tag and stay indoors at his home in Salford between 22:00 and 06:00 for the next 21 days.
Mr Ryan said Simpson had work commitments in the next 10 days, including end of season parades and functions with the rest of his team which were not to be regarded as "a jolly for the players".
He also said Simpson was expected to fly out to Thailand with the club's owners on Tuesday, but the judge rejected any plea to defer the curfew.
The right-back, who also played for Newcastle and QPR, was arrested on 29 December after a reports of a row at a house in Worsley, Greater Manchester.
