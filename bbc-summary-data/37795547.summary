After an even first half, Southend almost scored with the first shot on target when Anthony Wordsworth's effort was cleared off the line.
The game looked to be heading towards a replay before Lions defender Romeo stabbed in the dramatic winner.
Southend nearly equalised but Marc-Antoine Fortune's shot was saved.
Millwall, mid-table in League One, go into Monday's second-round draw and will be hoping for a good cup run.
They reached the final of the competition 12 years ago, when they were beaten by Manchester United.
Millwall manager Neil Harris:
"I said to the boys at half-time there would be one moment of quality in the game and when it comes to make sure whoever it was grasped it. That's cup football. Mahlon certainly did that."
Southend boss Phil Brown:
"There was a division apart between the teams. We were the best side on the park and should be walking away in the draw."
