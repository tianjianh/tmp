The club's 1927 victory marked the only time England's showpiece football trophy has been out of the country.
Memorabilia on display include the medal belonging to captain Fred Keenor, match day shirts and a replica trophy.
Councillor Peter Bradbury said the achievement was "something the whole of Wales should be proud of".
