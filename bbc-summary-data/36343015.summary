The brother of a Welshman on board the crashed EgyptAir flight says the last two days have been "overwhelming" as the family await more news.

Geologist Richard Osman, 40, who grew up in Carmarthen, was on flight MS804 en route from Paris to Cairo with 66 passengers and crew when it vanished.
His brother, Alastair, from Swansea, described Mr Osman as warm-hearted.
Egypt's army spokesman said wreckage and passengers' items have been found 180 miles (290km) from Alexandria.
European Space Agency satellites spotted an oil slick in the area where the flight had vanished but the organisation said there was no guarantee it was from the missing plane.
Alastair Osman, 36, a biochemistry student at Swansea University, described his brother as a "workaholic, full of principles and the type of person you could admire".
"He was a very hard worker. He was always like that," he told BBC News.
"He was a great brother. He was admirable, someone you could look up to."
Mr Osman's wife Aureilie, 36, gave birth to their second daughter Olympe three weeks ago.
His brother said: "It's sad that he has been deprived of a potentially wonderful future and they've been deprived of a wonderful future with him.
"You have to try to remain strong."
Mr Osman is the eldest of four children of the late Dr Mohamed Fekry Ali Osman and wife Anne.
He has three siblings; Alastair, Phillip, 34, and Anna, 32, who grew up in south Wales after their father moved there from his native Egypt to work as a consultant in ear, nose and throat surgery.
Mr Osman was a pupil at Queen Elizabeth Cambria School in Carmarthen and later studied geology and has a masters from Camborne School of Mines in Cornwall.
He is a mining company executive for Centamin at Jersey, where he was living with his family, and he has previously worked in Australia and Egypt.
His friend Steve Ellyatt told BBC Jersey he roughly knew Mr Osman's schedule and, when he heard about the EgyptAir flight, sent a text message to Mr Osman's wife to ask after him.
He said: "She then came back, and said 'unfortunately Steve he's on the plane which has just come down".
Mr Ellyatt explained how the couple had recently bought his house although Mrs Osman had returned to Paris to give birth while Mr Osman was "backwards and forwards" due to work commitments.
"It's dreadful," he said.
Prof Kip Jeffrey, head of Camborne School of Mines, said: "We are deeply saddened by this terrible tragedy, and our thoughts and sincere sympathies go out to Richard's family, friends and colleagues at this difficult time.
"Richard is fondly remembered from his time studying at CSM as a genuinely lovely man, quiet but dedicated, and for his warmth towards his friends and real passion for his work."
