[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teacher who had sex with a student has been banned from the profession.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Bickford-Smith, 39, began a relationship with the girl when she was 17, while he was a teacher at Sixth Form College, Farnborough in Hampshire.
A National College for Teaching & Leadership (NCTL) panel found he engaged in sexual activity with her on at least one occasion.
In its report the NCTL found him guilty of unacceptable professional conduct.
Mr Bickford-Smith was banned from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England.
It added the conduct, which took place between 2014 and 2015, was also likely to bring the profession into disrepute.
Mr Bickford-Smith, who had worked at the college since 2005, resigned from his position as a personal tutor in January 2015.
The girl, known as Pupil A, stated in evidence that Mr Bickford-Smith invited her to his flat for coffee where he lived on his own.
She told the panel that she and Mr Bickford-Smith kissed on this occasion and also had sex.
He also kissed her on more than one occasion, the report stated.
The panel found Mr Bickford-Smith had exchanged emails with the girl using his personal email address, which she said were "flirtatious" and suggestive at times.
He was also found guilty of posting naked images of men and women on his Tumblr social media account, which he knew she could access.
It concluded his "sexually motivated" conduct had also had a "profound and negative effect" on the girl.
College principal Simon Jarvis described NCTL's decision as "an appropriate outcome in the light of overwhelming evidence".
He said the college had acted "as soon as we had concerns" and "co-operated fully with the authorities involved".
Hampshire Constabulary said it investigated but found no crime had been committed, and no arrests were made.
