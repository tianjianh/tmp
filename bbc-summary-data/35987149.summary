One of Scotland's leading new wave brewers, Edinburgh's Innis & Gunn Brewing Company, has taken over the Inveralmond Brewery of Perth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Its investment comes with plans to expand brewing and maturation facilities, with the intention of growing their product ranges.
The purchase of Inveralmond was funded by Â£3.1m raised through crowdfunding.
The founders of the Perth brewer will continue to run it, being long-time friends of the Innis & Gunn managers.
New investment plans are to expand the Perth factory's capability to produce beers with different ingredients and flavours. It will have a new warehouse for oak barrel maturation.
Inveralmond is also to have the equipment for infusing flavours into beer, which Innis & Gunn has pioneered with oak, bergamot and coffee beans. A small bottling line may be added next year.
Innis & Gunn Brewing Company was founded in 2003. Selling 20 million bottles of beer in 2014, it had turnover of Â£12m - up from Â£10.5m in 2013 - making it one of the biggest craft beer suppliers to supermarkets and the on-trade.
It exports to more than 20 countries.
