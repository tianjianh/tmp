[SN]TITLE[SN]
Farmed Atlantic salmon production down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The harvest of Atlantic salmon from Scotland's fish farming industry has declined by more than 4% to 172,000 tonnes, figures show.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The average weight of fish has also fallen, according to Marine Science Scotland's annual report.
Fish farmers are understood to be facing difficulties with sea lice affecting the growth of fish.
Production of lumpsucker and wrasse, a natural predator of sea lice, is being increased.
The report also shows that the industry is diversifying into other species, with production of farmed rainbow trout up by nearly half to more than 8,000 tonnes.
Last year saw record production of farmed salmon, with 179,022 tonnes produced.
