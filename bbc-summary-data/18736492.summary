Final results showed that Mr Pena Nieto achieved 38.21%, with second placed Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador 31.59%.
While third-placed Josefina Vazquez Mota admitted defeat, Mr Lopez Obrador said he would challenge the result in Mexico's electoral tribunal.
Accusations of irregularities led to a re-check of about 50% of votes after the result was announced on Monday.
Mr Lopez Obrador, of the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution, said the election had been fraudulent and that he would file an appeal next week.
A protests march is planed in Mexico City on Saturday. Mr Lopez Obrador promised to keep protests peaceful and "act responsibly."
Mr Pena Nieto, of the PRI party, told the BBC he had done nothing wrong and said he may sue his opponents over the allegations.
The president of Mexico's electoral body said following the recount there was no reason not to accept the result.
The BBC's Will Grant, in Mexico City, said the election had been a tortuous process, and that Mr Pena Nieto was unlikely to see a quiet acceptance of the result.
Six years ago, after losing the presidential election by a narrow margin, Mr Lopez Obrador led weeks of protests that caused disruption in central areas of Mexico City.
Mexico's Federal Electoral Institute has until early September to address complaints and formally announce a winner in the presidential election.
