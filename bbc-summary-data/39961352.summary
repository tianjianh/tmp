However any buyer of St Nicholas, in Withernsea, East Yorkshire, has been warned it sits within a graveyard that could still be used for burials.
It also has restrictions to protect the fabric of the building, according to the Diocese of York.
Martin Sheppard, diocese spokesman, said the  building would remain as "a well-loved local landmark".

"The churchyard is not for sale and people will be able to have access to it", he said.
"There is regret a building at the heart of the community for many centuries will not be playing the role."
He said the church site was medieval in origin and many people had a "strong affection and loyalty to it".
Church of England worshippers in Withernsea would continue to be served by St Mathew's church nearby, said Mr Sheppard.
Deena Weightman, of estate agent Dee Atkinson and Harrison who is handling the sale of Grade II*-listed St Nicholas said: "It has some wonderful architectural features. It's a grand building, it's beautiful."
Interested parties have to submit offers with proof of funds, the proposed new use and experience in converting such buildings.
The Church Commissioners must ultimately sanction any sale.
