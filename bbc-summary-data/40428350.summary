Novak Djokovic is second, Roger Federer third and Rafael Nadal fourth seed.
It is the first time since Wimbledon 2014 that the four players have been named top seeds for a Grand Slam and keeps them apart until the semi-finals.
German Angelique Kerber is the top women's seed with Britain's Johanna Konta sixth.
The draw will be held at about 10:00 BST on Friday for the tournament, which starts on Monday, 3 July.
At this stage, only seeds one and two are in opposite sides, so 30-year-old Murray could potentially face Nadal or Federer in the last four

Murray, who won Wimbledon for the second time last year, pulled out of his scheduled warm-up match at the Hurlingham Club on Tuesday with a sore hip but the Scot still plans to play an as-yet-unnamed opponent on Friday.
With the men's seedings taking into account recent grass court form, Djokovic and Federer move up two places from their world ranking, with Nadal and fifth seed Stan Wawrinka dropping two.
The Queen's Club champion Feliciano Lopez is ranked 25, but will be seeded 19th for Wimbledon.
Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas has withdrawn with a knee injury, meaning Spain's Fernando Verdasco is now seeded 31st. Cuevas will be replaced by a lucky loser.
Women's seedings reflect the world rankings, with Simona Halep second behind Kerber, while 26-year-old Konta looks to get further than the second round for the first time.
Defending champion Serena Williams is absent because she is pregnant.
Briton Jamie Murray and his partner Bruno Soares are the third seeds for the men's doubles, which are headed by Henri Kontinen and John Peers.
