Lionel Messi netted before Luis Suarez (two), Rafinha and Neymar scored.
Barca are one point ahead of Real Madrid, who beat Valencia 3-2, while Atletico Madrid are out of contention after losing 2-1 at relegated Levante.
Barca play their final game at Granada next Saturday and will win the league if the teams finish level on points due to their superior head-to-head record.
Relive how the title race developed
Luis Enrique's side looked vulnerable after seeing their lead at the top of the table ebb away during a four-match winless league run wrapped around their Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid in the quarter-finals.
But they have bounced back to form in impressive style - scoring 21 goals in winning their past four league games - to put themselves within touching distance of a sixth title in eight seasons.
Suarez, 29, has led the charge with 11 goals in his past four appearances to give the former Liverpool striker 56 in all competitions and 37 in La Liga - four more than Cristiano Ronaldo.
Messi has 26 league goals, including four in his past five games.
The Argentine set Barca on their way to victory with a superb free-kick before teeing up Suarez to make it 2-0 with a calm finish early in the second half.
Suarez then headed home from a corner, before tap-ins from Rafinha and Neymar saw Barca end their home programme with a flourish.
Granada have nothing to play for after securing their safety with a 4-1 win at Europa League finalists Sevilla.
They can be caught on points by Getafe and Sporting de Gijon but have a superior head-to-head record.
Granada lost 4-0 at the Nou Camp in January but did beat Barca at home in 2014.
Barcelona also have a Copa del Rey final to look forward to against Sevilla on 22 May.
