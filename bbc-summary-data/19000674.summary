Reserve is cleared over Violet D'Mello cheetah attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A South African game reserve where an Aberdeen woman was attacked by a cheetah has been cleared of any wrongdoing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Violet D'Mello entered the enclosure for a photo next to the cats at the Kragga Kamma Game Park in Port Elizabeth earlier this year.
She suffered injuries to her head, stomach and legs during the incident.
The authorities in South Africa have ruled the park was not negligent.
A party of visiting schoolboys and a cheetah in heat were said to have been factors in what happened.
Mrs D'Mello, 60, said she survived by "playing dead". She had been on holiday with her husband Archie at the time.
