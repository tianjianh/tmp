Froome, 11 seconds in front at the start of the day, attacked his rivals late in the day on a testing climb prior to a steep descent.
Colombia's Esteban Chaves could not keep pace and lost 17 more seconds.
Alaphilippe came out on top in a three-way sprint as he claimed his first Grand Tour stage win.
"It's incredible. I didn't expect I would win the stage," he said after holding off Jan Polanc and Rafal Majka.
Froome, who is aiming to become the third man to win the Vuelta and the Tour de France in the same year, was one minute 27 seconds behind Alaphilippe as he finished 14th on the stage.
Only home favourite Alberto Contador could stick with him on the steep gradients and the pair were 15 seconds ahead of the other general classification contenders.
