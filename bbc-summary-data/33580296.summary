The Serbia international, 20, has signed a five-year deal with Steve McClaren's side.
He becomes United's second summer signing following the £14.5m arrival of PSV midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum.
"This is a club with a very big history and the fans are a big part of that. There will be pressure here, for sure, but I like pressure," said Mitrovic.
"I also know about the famous players who have played for Newcastle United, like Alan Shearer, who is a hero of mine. I hope I can play like him for this club. It will be an honour."
Mitrovic scored 36 league goals in his two years in Belgium, including 20 last season to be the league's top scorer.
He cost the Belgian club £4.3m when they signed him from Partizan Belgrade two years ago.
Mitrovic, who was also a reported target for Chelsea, scored an injury-time equaliser in the Champions League against Arsenal last season.
"He's moved from Partizan Belgrade to Anderlecht, he has had to adapt to a new league, and will do so again," McClaren told BBC Newcastle.
"He's got experience of Belgian football, experience of the Champions League and international football, just breaking into the scene.
"We just want to get the boy training and in our team."
