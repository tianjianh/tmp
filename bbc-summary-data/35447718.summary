Nick Ross hit the post early on for the visitors but further opportunities were few and far between.
Dumbarton's new signing Christian Nade was impressive on his debut as the Sons competed well.
The hosts' spirit was summed up by an excellent clearance off the line by Mark Docherty to deny Kane Hemmings.
Dumbarton, seventh in the Championship, have not beaten Dundee since 1985 so a replay at Dens Park - a week on Tuesday, 16 February - will no doubt please the Sons.
The opening 10 minutes of this contest suggested it could be an afternoon of shooting practice for Dundee.
Greg Stewart cleverly slipped the ball to Ross, whose low shot from 16 yards bounced straight back off the bottom of the left upright.
But despite a few more pot-shots in the direction of Sons goalkeeper Jamie Ewings and some menace down the right by Stewart, the Dark Blues failed to capitalise on early dominance and allowed Dumbarton into the game.
Much of the hosts' promising play stemmed from the experience and intelligence of Nade.
On one occasion the former Dundee man closed down Darren O'Dea's clearance and bore down on goal, only for visiting goalkeeper Scott Bain to rush out and boot the ball away to spare the Irishman's blushes.
Dundee fans were cheering in anticipation of a goal before half-time, but Mark Docherty's sliding clearance on the line in the nick of time prevented Kane Hemmings' dinked effort from trundling in. Needless to say the Dumbarton supporters enjoyed cutting the visiting section's celebrations short.
Hemmings' luck did not improve after the break. The striker has scored 16 goals this season and managed  to succeed in sliding the ball into Dumbarton's net, before realising he had long been flagged offside.
Docherty's curler gave Bain something to think about before Gary Harkins headed narrowly over for Dundee at the other end, but a breakthrough proved elusive on a pitch that was cutting up badly.
Dumbarton manager Stevie Aitken: "I thought the players work rate and commitment was terrific.
"We defended really well against a strong Dundee side who have got great players going forward.
"I'm delighted we've got another shot at it. The club might make some money out of it as well."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "I thought we dominated the game from start to finish, but we just didn't have that cutting edge in the final third.
"Dumbarton got men behind the ball and tried to frustrate us.
"But it's a clean sheet for us and we're still in the cup."
