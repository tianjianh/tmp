"We're delighted to support the first minister and the Scottish government with this new mentoring programme and we are encouraging as many young women from across Scotland as possible to apply for this amazing opportunity."
"I hope that my election as first minister does indeed help to open the gate to greater opportunity for all women.
"I hope that it sends a strong, positive message to girls and young women, indeed to all women, across our land - there should be no limit to your ambition for what you can achieve.
"If you are good enough and if you work hard enough, the sky is the limit and no glass ceiling should ever stop you from achieving your dreams."
