A mystery dog disease that killed two pets in Wiltshire at the end of last year has been confirmed as Alabama Rot.

At least four dogs were suspected of contracting the illness after being walked in the same woodland near Marlborough in the run-up to Christmas.
The disease, causing skin lesions and potential kidney failure, was first identified in the US in the 1980s.
David Walker, from Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists, said: "At least we now know what we're dealing with."
Several suspected cases of Alabama Rot, or cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), were reported in December after dogs were walked in West Woods near Marlborough.
One of the dogs - a cocker spaniel called Pippa - died just before Christmas.
Test results have now confirmed the animal, along with another dog in Salisbury, both had Alabama Rot.
Owner Jessica Worthington said Pippa developed sores on her legs after walking in West Woods.
"Unfortunately after a few days Pippa's condition deteriorated and she was showing signs of kidney damage," she said.
"Not long after that - despite trying many intensive treatments - we unfortunately lost her."
Mr Walker, who treated Pippa, said even before the toxicology reports came back positive, there were "very strong" suspicions that it was CRGV.
"This is a very rare disease which affects very few dogs but the best thing pet owners can do is be vigilant and if they're seeing skin lesions of unknown cause then go and speak to your local vet."
Possible cases of Alabama Rot were identified in 71 dogs across England between November 2012 and March 2014.
