A police officer who admitted stealing a kayak and set of paddles before selling them on eBay recently represented the UK at the canoeing world championships, it has emerged.

PC Andrew Hamilton was dismissed by Lincolnshire Police for gross misconduct on Wednesday.
He was convicted of two counts of theft at Nottingham Magistrates' Court in August.
Hamilton took the kayak and a set of paddles from Nottingham Kayak Club.
He kept the proceeds from the sale, despite knowing, or believing, he was not entitled to do so, a disciplinary hearing heard.
Officials said there was no place for dishonesty in the force.

In June, the officer was described by national coaches as the "standout performer" of the Great Britain team, which competed at the ICF Wildwater Canoeing World Championships in Bosnia.
He finished seventh in both the Men's C1 sprint and classic team events, and 22nd in the Men's C1 classic.
Last year, Hamilton was awarded a special commendation for bravery for his role in saving a motorist who passed out at the wheel at 60mph (96.5km/h).
He was dismissed when a disciplinary hearing found his actions amounted to gross misconduct.
Nottingham magistrates fined Hamilton Â£245 for each theft, and ordered him to pay Â£290 compensation and court costs of Â£85.
