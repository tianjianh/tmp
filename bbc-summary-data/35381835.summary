Liverpool's adult social care cuts despite 3.9% council tax rise

More than 5,000 adults in Liverpool are set to lose their social care packages during the coming year - despite a 3.9% increase in council tax.

The city's Mayor Joe Anderson made the announcement on Friday at a meeting of the council's cabinet.
More than half of the tax increase will go towards adult social care, but the mayor said there would still be a shortfall and services will be axed.
Care packages are to be cut from more than 14,000 adults to about 9,000.
Packages currently range from home help with washing and cleaning to more intensive help for the most vulnerable adults.
Council taxpayers living in Band A properties will pay an extra £18.46 per year while those in dearer properties will pay more.
Mr Anderson said the council had been spending £224m on adult social care but this has had to be cut to £172m by this year, and reduced by another £16m next year.
He said the council had to find another £10m to pay all staff members the soon-to-be increased Living Wage.
The Liverpool Echo reported he told the cabinet: "As I have said, and continue to say, people are constantly underestimating in some senses the impact of these cuts."
Between 2010 and 2017, Liverpool has had £330m - or 58% - of its funding from central government cut.
Another £27m will be shaved from the council budget in 2016-17.
