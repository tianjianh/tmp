The 21-year-old, who will undergo knee surgery on Monday, made 25 Super League appearances for the Rhinos in 2015 and helped them to victory in the Challenge Cup final.
The Rhinos have also announced that Ward has been given the club's number 13 jersey for the 2016 season.
Kevin Sinfield held the number for the last 15 years before switching codes to join Yorkshire Carnegie in October.
