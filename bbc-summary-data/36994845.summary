[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale substitute Anton Forrester scored one and set up another to help beat Southend United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old, brought in on a free this summer, headed in his first Vale goal just five minutes before the break.
After coming on for the injured Rigino Cicilia on 11 minutes, Forrester out-jumped Jakub Sokolik to meet Sam Foley's cross and guide a header past Mark Oxley.
Three minutes earlier, Southend had almost taken the lead when a combination of home keeper Jak Alnwick and the crossbar kept out Simon Cox's header from point-blank range.
Vale defender Nathan Smith almost gifted the away side an equaliser after 46 minutes when David Mooney's header cannoned off his legs before hitting a post.
But Forrester then helped to double Vale's advantage on 75 minutes when he played in defender Streete, who fired the ball home from just outside the six-yard-box.
That consigned the Shrimpers to a club-record eighth straight defeat in all competitions, while it maintains Vale's unbeaten league start under new boss Bruno Ribeiro.
