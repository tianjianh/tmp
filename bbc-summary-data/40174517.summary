Pasquale Minichini, 35, from Naples, was spotted in Cardiff on Friday by an off-duty Italian police officer.
He was arrested after shouting "tickets" in the street and was caught with six fake tickets he was trying to sell for 1,000 euros (Â£870) each.
Minichini pleaded guilty to being in possession of an article for fraud at Cardiff Magistrates' Court.
He also admitted being an unauthorised person who attempted to sell a ticket.
Real Madrid beat Juventus 4-1 at Cardiff's renamed National Stadium of Wales on Saturday.
Prosecutor Edward Marsh said: "CCTV shows the defendant catching the attention of two males, showing them his mobile phone, then walking into the Money Shop.
"He was stopped coming out of the shop but left an envelope on the counter with six tickets in it. A lady came out from the shop and said that he had left them on the counter."
District judge Bodfan Jenkins said: "You came to this country, and to that game, in order to make money by selling fraudulent tickets at huge prices to people who would not have been able to gain access to the game."
Minichini, who was not involved in making the fake tickets, was also ordered to pay a Â£115 surcharge.
