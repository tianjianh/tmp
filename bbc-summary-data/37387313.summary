Becky Godden murder-accused driver brands evidence 'rubbish'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering a woman and burying her in a field has told a court the evidence against him is "rubbish".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Halliwell, 52, is charged with strangling sex worker Becky Godden and burying her in a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, in 2003.
He is serving a life sentence after admitting murdering Sian O'Callaghan, 22, in 2011.
Halliwell told Bristol Crown Court he "never knew Rebecca," who was 20-years-old when she disappeared.
The jury has heard the defendant initially confessed to strangling Miss Godden before leading police to the exact spot of her burial.
Halliwell, formerly of Ashbury Avenue, Swindon, Wiltshire, has since pleaded not guilty to murder and is representing himself at his trial.
In his closing speech from the dock, the defendant said: "The forensics evidence so poorly presented to the forensic lab, so poorly examined it is not worth mentioning. It is rubbish."
Earlier, he told the jury two drug dealers were responsible for burying Miss Godden in 2003.
He said he regularly drove the men, who he has refused to name, while they delivered drugs and they would pay him "three of four times" the usual fare.
He told the court he had received a call from the men saying they "needed to get rid of something".
He said he drove the pair to Oxo Bottom Field and returned to collect them an hour later.
"I didn't know at the time they had buried Rebecca. I was under the impression it was drugs, money or weapons," he said.
Prosecutors allege Halliwell was one of Miss Godden's clients and murdered her after becoming possessive.
Retired High Court judge Sir John Griffith Williams is due to sum up the case to the jury on Monday.
