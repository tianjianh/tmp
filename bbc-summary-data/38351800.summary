Scot John Higgins staged a remarkable comeback against Judd Trump to reach the final of the Scottish Open.

The 41-year-old four-time world champion from Wishaw came from 5-1 down to beat the Englishman 6-5.
Trump, 27, made three century breaks and a 99 to open a commanding lead in Glasgow before Higgins rolled off five consecutive frames to win.
Higgins will play Hong Kong's Marco Fu in Sunday's final at the Emirates Arena.
"I wasn't getting a look in with the way Judd was playing," Higgins told BBC Scotland.
"So, to come back and win, I'm still in a daze. I was shaking like a leaf at the end there and I was worried I wasn't going to do it.
"I didn't want to throw the towel in at 5-1 because my family is here, so I was determined to make Judd try and win it.
"To come back and win in front of them is an incredible feeling. They were crying at the end and I was crying too."
Fu, who has made 10 centuries and 15 more breaks over 50 on his way to the final, beat China's world number 59 Yu Delu 6-1.
The 38-year-old made breaks of 72 and 73 to move into a 3-0 lead and after Delu pulled a frame back, rattled in further breaks of 100, 130 and 87 to surge into the final.
The world number 14 will be aiming for his third ranking title - his first since the 2013 Australia Open - in his seventh ranking final.  Fu beat Ronnie O'Sullivan to win the Grand Prix in Aberdeen in 2007, his first ranking title.
He has won eight of his 14 previous meetings with Higgins, who will be aiming to win a 29th ranking title to move him clear of O'Sullivan and Steve Davis (both 28) into second place overall behind Stephen Hendry (36).
