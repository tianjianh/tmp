Many criticised the "senseless violence", making #PrayForLahore one of the top trending topics on Monday.
Some also used #IndiawithPakistan and urged fellow citizens "to stand with Pakistan in this hour of grief".
A Pakistan Taliban group claimed the attack, saying it had targeted Christians celebrating Easter.
The blast hit the main gate of Lahore's Gulshan-e-Iqbal park on Sunday.
The popular park was more crowded than usual, as Lahore's minority Christians were celebrating Easter at a funfair in the premises.
Many Indians, including Bollywood actors Sonakshi Sinha and Sidharth Malhotra, said such attacks "were against humanity".
A similar outpouring of sympathy was seen in India in December 2014 after militants launched an attack on an army school in Peshawar, killing more than 130 children.
