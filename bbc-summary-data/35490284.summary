[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fresh attack on university changes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for changes in the way universities are governed are facing a fresh attack from the principal of Edinburgh University.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Timothy O'Shea said plans to elect the chair of universities' governing bodies were "inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging".
The proposal is made in the Scottish government's Higher Education Governance Bill.
The Scottish government said it would continue to listen to all views.
The bill aims to improve the way universities - which are fiercely protective of their independence from the state - are governed.
Although universities get a large chunk of their income from the Scottish government, unlike schools and colleges they are not part of the public sector or directly accountable to politicians.
The proposal which has caused the most controversy is for directly elected chairs for university courts - students and staff would be able to take part in the vote.
But this is seen by some as a threat to the role of the rector at the ancient universities.
The role of the rector is sometimes seen as purely symbolic and ceremonial. However, supporters argue the best rectors can be powerful ambassadors for their universities and champions of the students' interests.
Prof Sir Timothy said amendments to the bill could prove damaging to his university.
He said the amendments would allow for two elected positions playing a chairing role in the university - a rector and a senior lay member.
This would suggest changing what he described as the "the long-established and well-understood role of our rector - without any prior consultation or discussion."
He also argued the senior lay member would appear to have significantly weaker powers than their counterparts at other universities - without any prior consultation.
Sir Timothy said: "The amendments are inconsistent, incoherent and potentially very damaging for one of Scotland's major universities.
"There has been no consultation or discussion with us, or the wider sector on the implications, which require careful consultation and scrutiny otherwise there is a real risk of perverse and possibly unintended consequences."
He argued it could even significantly impede the university's ability to contribute to the economic and social good of the country.
He urged Holyrood's education committee to ask the government to withdraw these amendments until they have consulted with those affected on the implications of their proposals.
However, Sir Timothy also welcomed amendments to the bill, including one which removed some additional ministerial powers that he argued threatened the university's institutional autonomy.
A Scottish government spokesperson said: "The Higher Education Governance Bill aims to ensure that the entire campus community has a say on how our higher education institutions are governed.
"We have worked closely with the sector over the course of the bill's development and will continue to listen to the views of all interested parties and consider all constructive suggestions as the bill continues to be considered by parliament.
"The detail of how a rector and new elected senior lay member would work together would remain, as now, a matter for each autonomous institution to address. The bill does not change that."
The Scottish government said any expansion in the role of the rector in a higher education institution beyond the current role set out in statute would be a matter for each institution.
"We think that the post of senior lay member should be an elected one," the spokesperson said.
"This role is pivotal in the leadership of all Scottish institutions, and all staff and students should have their say in appointing the best candidate for the role.
"The model for appointment of the senior lay member proposed by the Scottish Government has been discussed with stakeholders."
