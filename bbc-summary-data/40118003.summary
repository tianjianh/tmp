Ninety jobs at oil giant Shell to go in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ninety jobs are to go at oil giant Shell's North Sea headquarters in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shell said the cuts would help it maintain competitiveness and ensure the long-term sustainability of the North Sea business.
Of the 90 posts going, half are full-time employees with the rest made up of agency staff and contractors.
The jobs are expected to go by the end of the year.
Shell's 1,700-strong workforce in Aberdeen were told about the redundancies at meetings on Thursday morning.
No jobs will be lost offshore.
Shell announced in January it had agreed to sell $3.8bn (Â£2.46bn) worth of North Sea assets to oil exploration firm Chrysaor.
