Jacob Butterfield, who plays for Derby County, proposed to his girlfriend in March but celebrated their engagement over the weekend.
Police were called to the party in Bardsey, West Yorkshire, following a report a 47-year-old man had been assaulted.
The man was later treated in hospital.
Det Insp Phil Jackson, of Leeds District CID, said: "At 2.28am on Sunday, police were called to a report of a 47-year-old man having been assaulted at an address in Bardsey.
"The man was treated at hospital and discharged later that day.
"A 26-year-old man, from Leeds, was arrested in connection with the incident and has since been released on police bail pending further inquiries."
Mr Butterfield's fiancÃ©e, Hollie Jayne Dixon, works as a stockbroker, according to her Twitter profile.
She tweeted about their engagement and posted a photo of her engagement ring in March.
The footballer also tweeted a photo of his fiancÃ©e wearing her ring.
Neither of them have tweeted anything since the party.
