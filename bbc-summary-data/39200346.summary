Tourists throw coins into her pond for good luck, but it turned out to be bad luck for the turtle, when she started snacking on the loose change.
Her expensive dinner got so heavy that it weighed her down and even damaged her shell.
Luckily, vets noticed that something wasn't right when she couldn't swim straight, and surgeons were able to take the coins out.
Now, she's happy if a little poorer!
