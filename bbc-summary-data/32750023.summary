Buildings already constructed at the Beechwood site include the new £60m Inverness College UHI.
The college should be ready to open its doors to its first students this autumn.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), which is leading the project, hopes to attract science, technology and other types of businesses to the site.
Mr Swinney said: "This is an outstanding facility which I believe will be a leading resource for enterprise and innovation, not only of benefit to the region, but to the entire country.
"The teamwork of everyone involved has helped make Inverness Campus a reality and I am sure this will continue in the years ahead."
