Among the best known and most sought after awards are the Oscars and Baftas.
Film directors, producers, actors, technicians, musicians and animators can all be nominated and anyone can win.
Here's all you need to know about the biggest film award ceremonies in showbiz...
The Oscars are thought to be the most prestigious film awards in the world.
They're organised by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which is made up of professional people in the film business.
It was set up in 1927 with just 36 members, but now there's more than 6,000 and they vote for who wins in each category.
Everyone who wins an Oscar is automatically asked to be an Academy member.
They're called the Oscars after the golden statue which is given out to the winners. No one's quite sure why the statue's called Oscar, but it's rumoured to be because one of the Academy members thought the statue looked a bit like her Uncle Oscar, and it stuck.
