East Lancashire Railway facing £18,000 loss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A heritage railway may have lost £18,000 after a glass firm helping with the renovation of a railway station went into administration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The East Lancashire Railway, which operates as a charity, is working to restore Bury Bolton Street Station, in Greater Manchester.
The money was paid in advance to Paperlinx, which was supplying roof glazing for a Victorian-style canopy.
However, the firm is now under the control of administrators Deloitte.
Deloitte said in a statement: "The administrators are looking into this payment and will report directly to the charity when they are able to provide an update."
The railway's general manager Andy Morris said "We're absolutely devastated by what's happened and we're still struggling to come to terms with what this will ultimately mean for the future of the canopy project.
"The sum of money involved is very substantial for a charity such as ours and it is particularly upsetting bearing in mind the funds were raised through donations and other benefaction.
"We shall be taking legal advice about what rights we have in circumstances such as this but at the moment it doesn't look very encouraging."
The East Lancashire Railway operated from 1844 to 1859 across the county.
A section of the original line between Bury and Rawtenstall, Lancashire, is now operated as a heritage railway, supported by a network of volunteers.
