The world number one lost 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 to Thompson, a late replacement for the injured Aljaz Bedene.
It is the first time since 2012 that Britain's Murray has lost his opening match at Queen's Club.
Second seed Stan Wawrinka and third seed Milos Raonic also lost their first-round matches.
However, it was Murray's straight-set defeat that left the crowd packed into the new 10,000-capacity Centre Court stunned.
"It's a big blow, for sure," said Murray.
"It has happened in the past where guys haven't done well here and gone on to do well at Wimbledon.
"There is no guarantee that I won't do well at Wimbledon, but it certainly would have helped to have had more matches.
"He played better than me. I didn't create loads of chances. I didn't return particularly well. He served big. He served well."
Australian Thompson, a lucky loser who lost in qualifying and only made the first round after Briton Bedene withdrew because of a wrist injury, played superbly.
The 23-year-old from Sydney sealed the most famous victory of his career with an ace after one hour and 43 minutes.
"Andy's the world number one. I've looked up to him and that's definitely the biggest win of my career," Thompson said.
"I took each point at a time. I didn't expect it to be winning in straight sets.
"I was sitting around yesterday hoping to get a match. Here I am, I got in the draw and I was so lucky to be here."
Murray, 31, could not find any rhythm, dropping serve twice in the second set and failing to convert the three break points which came his way as his forehand in particular let him down.
The defeat was the Scot's first at the tournament since 2014 and ended a 14-match winning streak on grass stretching back to 2015.
Both his Wimbledon titles, in 2013 and 2016, followed victories at Queen's Club.
Murray had to adjust his game plan after the late change in opponent, and hot, blustery conditions were not ideal, but the five-time champion was still surprisingly out of form.
Thompson had not won an ATP main-draw match in 2016 but reached the final of the lower level Surbiton Challenger on grass last week, and was sharp from the outset.
He denied Murray a single break point in the first set, failing to convert three chances of his won in game two, and then recovered from 3-1 down in the tie-break.
A Murray double-fault changed the momentum and the Briton could only tamely guide a backhand smash into the net on set point.
The comeback appeared on when Murray moved 0-40 up at the start of the second set, but Thompson played his way out of trouble without any nerves and went on to dominate.
Murray's forehand gave up the first break of serve at 4-2 and Thompson made sure with a second successive break before serving out the match.
A final tally of 26 errors to nine winners illustrated Murray's lack of form.

Andy clearly doesn't feel comfortable hitting a tennis ball and that's what he's been great at throughout his career.
What Jordan Thompson did so well was chase balls down and made very few unforced errors. Andy, after a few unforced errors, really just didn't want to do it.
John Lloyd, former GB Davis Cup captain on BBC Two
Andy looked unsure and looked unbalanced. He was hooking his forehands and was all over the place. He was looking at his box and was getting very negative. It was poor by his standards.
There was no physical presence. "I'm number one in the world and you're not beating me" - that was not there. But I think he'll be fine - there's no reason to panic whatsoever.

Murray's exit means there is no British interest left in the draw at Queen's after all five home players suffered first-round defeats.
After British number two Kyle Edmund lost on Monday, James Ward, Cameron Norrie and Liam Broady were also beaten on Tuesday.
Ward, 30, was playing only his third match since an eight-month absence with a knee injury, but lost 6-2 6-2 to France's world number 87 Julien Benneteau.
Norrie, 21, also received a wildcard - as the leading player on the US college circuit - but he was beaten 6-1 6-4 by American Sam Querrey, the 2010 champion.
Broady, 23, lost 6-4 6-4 against France's Jeremy Chardy after replacing the injured Pierre-Hugues Herbert as a lucky loser from qualifying.
