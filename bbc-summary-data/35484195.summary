Stefan Hansen, 24, was found guilty of causing the death of 62-year-old Andrew Rennie by careless driving in the crash on the A83, Argyll, on 17 October 2013.
Hansen's Mitsubishi 4x4 collided with the minibus driven by Mr Rennie at Kennacraig, near Tarbert.
Sentence on Hansen was deferred and his bail was continued on the condition that he surrender his passport.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lady Stacey, told Hansen: "You appreciate you have been convicted of causing death and injury by careless driving."
The judge said she would allow him bail but added: "I am not prepared to allow you to return to Denmark."
Hansen had originally been charged with causing death by dangerous driving but was convicted of the lesser charge to which he had previously offered to plead guilty.
The court heard that Hansen had gone hunting on the day of the crash and had set off alone with a rifle.
He said he had turned onto the A83, taking the left hand side, but had crossed over on to the wrong side of the road after deciding to change the channel on the car radio.
Hansen told the court: "I just saw these two lights coming towards me and that's it. There is no time at all to react, just maybe hitting the brakes and try to avoid it," he said.
One of the passengers in the minibus, joiner Charles McCormick, said he had seen headlights coming towards them.
He said within seconds there was an impact and the windscreen shattered. "It was just mayhem after that," he added.
One police officer who attended the scene said she had spoken to the Danish driver who told her he had "got onto the wrong side of the road".
Another witness who made a call to the emergency services said the driver had said he had forgot what he was doing and drove up the wrong side of the road.
Mr Rennie was trapped in the minibus and collapsed after he was eventually freed. He died after suffering leg, chest and abdomen injuries in the crash.
