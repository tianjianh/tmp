A hospital in Slovakia is testing a South Korean man for the potentially deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers).

If confirmed, it would be the first case in Europe since an outbreak in South Korea began.
Authorities there have reported seven new cases, bring the total to 145. Fourteen people are known to have died.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the outbreak is "large and complex" with further cases expected.
The man in Slovakia reportedly works for a subcontractor of South Korean car maker Kia.
He is said to be in a stable condition, and tests should determine if he has the virus within a day.
The outbreak began when a businessman returning from the Middle East last month was diagnosed with the disease.
All of the cases have been linked to health facilities. The WHO said overcrowding and South Korea's habit of "doctor shopping" - visiting multiple facilities for the same complaint - may have contributed to the outbreak.
But despite the organisation's warnings, it says there is no evidence of Mers spreading wider in the community.
The outbreak is the largest outside Saudi Arabia, where the disease was first identified in humans in 2012.
