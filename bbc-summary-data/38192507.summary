[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 3-1 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend made it nine League One games unbeaten with a convincing win over struggling Coventry at Roots Hall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimpers went in front after just six minutes when Anthony Wordsworth fired home from 12 yards after a bright burst into the box by Jason Demetriou.
The Sky Blues hit back with goalkeeper Mark Oxley doing well to deny both Andy Rose and Daniel Agyei before visiting shot-stopper Lee Burge was forced off injured in the 44th minute after being clattered into by Nile Ranger.
But Southend got back on top after the break and doubled their lead in the 64th minute when Anton Ferdinand volleyed home from close range after being picked out by Ryan Leonard's header from a Wordsworth free-kick.
Phil Brown's side made it 3-0 in the 69th minute as Stephen McLaughlin's right-footed shot struck the inside of the left post before hitting the back of substitute goalkeeper Reice Charles-Cook and rolling into the net.
The fortuitous strike heaped further misery on Coventry, who sit in the relegation zone, but they did net a late-minute consolation strike when Agyei scored from close range.
