Stephen Sutton, 19, from Burntwood, was diagnosed with bowel cancer aged 15 and started raising funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust.
He has compiled a bucket list, featuring things he wants to accomplish before he dies, which includes getting in the Guinness Book of World Records.
His record was getting the most people to make a "heart-shaped hand gesture".
The event took place at Stephen's former school, Chase Terrace Technology College and involved 554 people.
Stephen himself attended the event and the organisers said he was "so excited" to have achieved the record.
One of the event's organisers, Maria Tucker, said the previous record stood at 501.
She said: "Stephen was in very good spirits. It was phenomenal how the whole community pulled together."
Stephen's fundraising efforts have attracted a huge online following.
On Friday, Prime Minister David Cameron praised him after visiting him at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.
