Charlie Austin and Matt Targett have returned to full training after long-term injuries but it is too soon for them to be involved in the first team.
Hull striker Oumar Niasse is available after the red card he received against Watford was rescinded.
Defender Omar Elabdellaoui remains absent with a back problem and may not play again this season.
Mark Scott: "This is a real chance for Hull to crank up the pressure on Swansea, who play a day later.
"While the Tigers' record on the road is awful, they can draw hope from the fact Southampton haven't exactly been on fire at St Mary's of late.
"That said, the Saints display at Chelsea in midweek certainly dispelled any suggestion they might already be on the beach.
"But Marco Silva's men are likely to be just that bit more fired up than the home side, given how strong a position victory would put them in, with all-but-doomed Sunderland the visitors to their KCOM Stadium fortress next week."

Southampton manager Claude Puel: "It's important to take points because we want to finish in the first half of the table.
"Hull City will be a difficult game, we know, it's important to have this good concentration in this game.
"I think it will be just as difficult as the last games against Chelsea and Manchester City. Perhaps it will be more difficult."
Hull head coach Marco Silva on away form: "We need to change, of course we need to change.
"We analysed the last game like normal, and I think it's clear to me and I hope it's clear for our players what we need to do differently.
"We need to keep focus always and play with the same confidence we do at home. We need to keep focus, we conceded goals away on the counter-attack."
As good as Hull have been at home since Marco Silva took charge in January, they still cannot win away.
The Tigers have drawn one and lost eight out of nine matches on the road in all competitions in that time, and I don't see them improving on that record here.
