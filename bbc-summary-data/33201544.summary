Jason McGovern: Manslaughter accused must wait over fourth trial decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of the manslaughter of teenager Jason McGovern will have to wait until at least the end of the month before learning if he is to face a fourth trial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr McGovern, 19, died after being attacked on a night out in Omagh, County Tyrone, on New Year's Eve 2012.
Mark Donnelly, 23, had pleaded not guilty to manslaughter.
Last month, a jury failed to reach a verdict in a third trial of Mr Donnelly.
A decision was expected on Friday on whether to mount a fresh prosecution against Mr Donnelly, of Greencastle in County Tyrone.
The judge at Dungannon crown court had previously given the prosecution until Friday to consider its position.
But, at the time, the prosecution indicated that may not be sufficient time for a review and a decision on proceedings to be made.
The decision is now expected to be made by 1 July.
Two juries have failed to agree a verdict on the charge against Mr Donnelly and a third trial was aborted for legal reasons.
