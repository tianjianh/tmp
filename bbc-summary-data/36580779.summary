[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester's long-serving loose-head prop Nick Wood has left the Premiership club after his contract expired.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old had been with the Cherry and Whites since joining their academy in 2001 and has spent his entire playing career at Kingsholm.
"Nick's been an outstanding ambassador for Gloucester over the past 15 years," director of rugby David Humphreys said.
Full-back Rob Cook, 31, and Welsh wing Steph Reynolds, 22, have both also left the club at the end of their contracts.
Wood represented England at Under-21 level and Saxons level and was called into the full England squad party to tour South Africa in 2008 but was then himself injured.
He was also named in the England squad for summer matches against the Barbarians and Argentina in 2009 but did not play.
