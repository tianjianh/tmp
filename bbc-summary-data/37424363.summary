Bronze medallist Tyrone Pillay says he was prevented from boarding an internal flight from Johannesburg to Durban as he made his way back from Brazil.
On Twitter, the athlete called the airline "disrespectful".
South African Airways says he should have been allowed on board with the prosthesis and is investigating.
"Our policy makes provision for passenger assistive devices to be carried into the cabin," said airline spokesperson Tlali Tlali.
"Mr Pillay's prosthetic legs fall under this classification and should have been allowed."
He said Mr Pillay was unable to keep the prosthetic leg with him in the plane's cabin, but it was unclear what had happened to it.
"We have offered an inconsistent service. He was allowed to board our flight from Sao Paulo to Johannesburg, so we want to establish from the staff member here exactly what happened," he added.
