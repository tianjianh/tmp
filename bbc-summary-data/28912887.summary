Dean Smith, 38, of Pyle, was walking near Kenfig Pool on Saturday when he saw a fin sticking out of the sand.
He reached down to pick it up, but ending up falling and landed with the 2ft-long (0.6m) bomb on top of him.
The site has been cordoned off by police and the Royal Logistics Corps will carry out a controlled explosion.
History enthusiast Mr Smith, who made the discovery with his son-in-law James Clarke, 20, said he often finds old ordnance material in the area.
"We saw the fin sticking up and I thought, that will be nice for my collection," he said.
"I pulled so hard that I fell back and it landed on top of me. We froze for a second and I noticed that the fuse was still attached so it was still live."
"I'm a bit of a history buff and so I knew what it was straight away.
"We phoned the police and put up a cordon with sticks and plastic bags.
"They [the police] were great, I think they were coming expecting what they had seen before but as he [the officer] took a closer look, I could see his eyes widen."
South Wales Police confirmed officers were alerted to the presence of historical ordnance at Kenfig Pool and said the matter would be dealt with by the Royal Logistics Corp bomb squad.
