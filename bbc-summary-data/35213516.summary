The victims were stabbed in the torso in Mountearl Gardens, Streatham, at about 17:30 GMT on Wednesday.
Police suspect four people approached the victims on mopeds and the pillion passengers carried out the attack.
The second boy, a 17-year-old, was treated for his injuries and has been discharged from hospital.
Detectives said neither of the pillion passengers were wearing a helmet and have urged witnesses to contact them with a description of the attackers.
Det Ch Insp Jim Redmond said: "This was a vicious and violent attack which has left a teenage boy in a critical condition.
"The incident happened late in the afternoon and there would have been a number of people in and around the area who may have witnessed the events in the lead up to the attack, the stabbings themselves or the moped riders with their pillion passengers fleeing the scene."
Anyone with information is urged to contact police or call the Crimestoppers charity anonymously.
