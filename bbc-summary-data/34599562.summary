Tony Torrez, 32, was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the death of Lilly Garcia.
According to police, someone pulled up beside Garcia's father's pickup on an Albuquerque motorway and fired into the vehicle.
It is not clear what caused the dispute.
Lilly Garcia's father - who has not been named - told officers the shooting was the result of road rage, police said.
He was driving Lilly and her seven-year-old brother home from school when the incident occurred.
Police offered a $25,000 reward for information on the gunman, but the search was complicated by a storm that washed away potential clues and conflicting witness statements.
Police said they were seeking a warrant to search an Albuquerque home and car as part of their investigation.
