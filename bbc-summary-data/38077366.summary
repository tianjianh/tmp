East Lancashire Hospice in Blackburn was rated "outstanding" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) after an inspection in September.
It reaches out to marginalised communities using "innovative methods" such as social media, the report said.
The CQC praised staff for treating people with "sensitivity and dignity".
"There are no words to describe how proud I feel," Lyn Stevenson, chief executive of the hospice, said of the health watchdog's report.
Inspectors highlighted that the hospice was "creative" at improving its services and shared best practice with the wider industry, acting as a "role model for excellence".
It praised the "ethos" of the inpatient service, which aimed to make people "feel that they were in a 5 star hotel and spa rather than a hospice".
People felt "exceptionally safe" in the hospice's care and their "emotional, cultural and spiritual needs" were met by "knowledgeable and confident" staff, the report said.
The hospice runs an inpatient unit for up to 10 people and during the inspection was providing community services for 142 people and giving 67 others creative and support therapies.
Last week, St John's Hospice in Lancaster also received the watchdog's top rating.
