Leyland teenagers taken ill after swallowing tablets

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two 14-year-old boys fell ill after taking tablets they believed to be ecstasy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One collapsed on Thursday while, in a separate incident, the second boy was arrested for criminal damage and drug offences after "behaving out of character".
The teenagers, both from Leyland, took blue and yellow tesla pills.
Two further youths, aged 15 and 17, were arrested in Buckshaw Village in connection with the incidents.
Cannabis and pills were seized during the raids.
Sgt Mark Douglas of Leyland Police said: "We know that these tablets have appeared in Leyland and surrounding Chorley areas,  so I am also asking the public to remain vigilant and to report, or hand in, any of these types of tablets to the police so they can be properly examined."
The advice follows the death of a man in Nelson last week who was thought to have taken shield-shaped turquoise tablets, again suspected to be ecstasy.
Four people were also taken to hospital after taking what is suspected to be a similar type of pill at the Beat-Herder Festival in the Ribble Valley last weekend.
The 14-year-old arrested after taking the pills is currently on bail pending enquiries.
