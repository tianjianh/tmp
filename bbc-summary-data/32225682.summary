An unannounced mental health and disability inspection at Cefn Coed Hospital also highlighted "significant issues" with staff numbers, patient privacy and poor ward environments.
Healthcare Inspectorate Wales visited on four days in November 2014.
The hospital's health board said it was addressing issues.
Areas in need of immediate improvement included the "run down and unacceptable" condition of some wards, with paper and towels being used as curtains.
Despite these issues, HIW noted the commitment of staff and rapport with patients throughout the visit.
HIW's Alun Jones said Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board has since submitted a comprehensive improvement plan addressing the issues.
A spokesman for the health board said that £65m out of a planned £100m has been invested in brand new mental health accommodation.
