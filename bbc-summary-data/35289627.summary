Leaders of Aslef, the RMT union and Unite will meet with Transport for London for talks chaired by conciliation service Acas.
Three 24-hour strikes are due to be held in the coming weeks in the long running dispute over pay and plans for an all night Tube service.
The RMT is planning further industrial action in a separate row over jobs.

Finn Brennan, Aslef's organiser on London Underground, said the union "hoped to do a deal", but said London Underground "needs to stop bullying and start negotiating".
An RMT spokesman said the union would attend the fresh talks in the hope of breaking the deadlock.
If negotiations fail, the strikes by members will start on the evenings of 26 January, 15 February and 17 February.
