Bristol City will not sell Ivory Coast forward Jonathan Kodjia for less than £10m, says owner Steve Lansdown.

The 26-year-old was the Championship club's top scorer last season, with 20 goals in 48 games in all competitions.
Lansdown also said the Robins would not sell Kodjia to any Championship clubs.
"It would have to be a mega price to prize him away and it would have to be a Premier League side," Lansdown told BBC Radio Bristol. "People have talked about five or six million - no chance."
The former Angers front man, who signed for the club in July 2015 for around £2m, played 90 minutes as City beat Wigan Athletic 2-1 on Saturday in their first match of 2016-17 and their first home game in the fully-redeveloped Ashton Gate.
"We wouldn't sell him to anybody in in the Championship because we're looking to compete in the Championship this year, and he's an integral part of that," Lansdown added.
"If it's not £10 million-plus, we're not even looking at it. If it's £10 million-plus from a Championship club, we're still not looking at it.
"If somebody comes in with the right offer, you've got to look at it."
