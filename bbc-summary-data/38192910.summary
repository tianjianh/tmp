[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen 0-0 St Johnstone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen survived late St Johnstone pressure to secure a draw but slipped further behind second-top Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murray Davidson fired wide for the visitors and Andrew Considine headed wildly over for the Dons.
With Niall McGinn and Peter Pawlett hooked at half-time, the Dons began the second half more brightly.
But it was Saints who had the best chances, with goalkeeper Joe Lewis saving a point by turning David Wotherspoon's free-kick on to the post.
With Rangers beating fourth-top Hearts at Ibrox, Derek McInnes' Dons are now four points adrift of the Glasgow side.
Saints, who stretched their unbeaten league run at Pittodrie to four games, move to within four points of fourth place.
Aberdeen captain Ryan Jack returned to the side, but the midfielder was stationed at right-back with Shay Logan on the bench due to a slight foot injury.
It meant Pawlett, Kenny McLean and James Maddison occupied the central midfield areas.
Pawlett had a long-range shot that went wide and Considine missed a sitter from a corner, heading over from five yards.
Clearly, McInnes wanted to shake things up at half-time, taking McGinn and Pawlett off at half-time and replacing them with Jayden Stockley and Logan.
Jack moved into midfield, where he could exert more control on the game. But, although there was perhaps a better balance and intent from Aberdeen, it failed to conjure a goal.

There was a real blow for St Johnstone before the match as it emerged Danny Swanson would miss out after picking up a hip injury on Thursday. The winger could be out for up to 10 days.
This match could have done with his personality and invention in the final third.
Saints' best chance in the first-half came when Steven MacLean's cross was flicked on by Chris Kane to Davidson, who fired wide when he probably should have done better.
After the break, MacLean tried his luck with a shot from 30-yards that Lewis tipped over the bar and Blair Alston almost nicked in on a poor Graeme Shinnie back-pass but poked the ball wide as St Johnstone finished strongly.
The best chance of the game came from Wotherspoon. His free-kick from 25 yards was curling viciously towards goal, but Lewis produced a great save.
There was a bizarre moment when referee Kevin Clancy blew for half-time just as Pawlett was winding up for a shot from 25 yards.
The Aberdeen players remonstrated - and rightly so.
The ref has a tough job, but it was a meaningful passage of play with Aberdeen threatening the St Johnstone goal.
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes: "It was always a bit of a risk playing so many attacking players in the opening period, and I don't think we got our game going with any real rhythm.
"When we did move the ball and brought pace to the game, we moved them about and looked like we could carry a threat, but I don't think we got into enough good attacking positions.
"You have to credit St Johnstone. They denied us space and worked hard to keep us away from goal. It's not just about us - there's an opponent there and I think St Johnstone played well."
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: "I thought over the piece we probably could have edged it, but we're happy with the point.
"We're slightly disappointed it wasn't all three because even in the first half we had the better chances, and in the second half we had the better chances.
"It was another good away performance. We've been to Ibrox now and probably should have won, been to Hearts and should have won, and been up here and should have won."
