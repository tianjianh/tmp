Bayern Munich have agreed a deal to sign Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal and say "priceless" forward Thomas Muller will not be sold this summer.

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed they have received offers for Muller, 25, who was reported to be a target for Manchester United.
He added: "There are some players who don't have any price tag. We would be out of our minds to sell Muller."
Vidal, 28, has agreed terms with Bayern and will have a medical this weekend.
The German champions will pay a reported Â£26m for the player, who is on holiday after helping Chile win the Copa America last month.
Bayern have already signed midfielder Douglas Costa from Shakhtar Donetsk, Stuttgart goalkeeper Sven Ulreich and former Stuttgart midfielder Joshua Kimmich this summer.
Long-serving midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has been their highest-profile departure - the 30-year-old having joined Manchester United.
Rummenigge, speaking on Bayern's pre-season tour of China, also said no talks are planned to discuss a contract extension for coach Pep Guardiola.
The former Barcelona boss, who has been linked with a future move to Manchester City, reaches the end of his deal next summer.
Rummenigge said: "I can't currently think of any reason why Pep would leave us. Maybe we'll just meet for an espresso and clear everything.
"But if Pep doesn't want to stay, our world would not fall apart."
Guardiola, 44, has led Bayern to the domestic title in his first two years in Germany but not beyond the semi-finals of the Champions League.
