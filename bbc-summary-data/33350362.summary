Welsh government defends 'Carwyn Connect' tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh government has defended a series of "Carwyn Connect" events, in which people are invited to put their views directly to the first minister.

Carwyn Jones will begin his tour in Merthyr Tydfil on 16 July and Rhyl on 22 July with other locations to follow.
The Conservatives said it was a "cynical abuse of taxpayers' money" that the public was "being asked to fund Labour's re-election campaign".
Ministers said an estimated Â£1,000 cost for each event was "good value".
Mr Jones said he wanted people to share their ideas on how to "build a more prosperous Wales".
But a Tory spokesman called the events a "sham".
"It doesn't take a cynical disposition to question Carwyn's decision to wait until the last year of this term to 'connect' with voters," the spokesman added.
Responding to the criticism, the Welsh government said the estimated cost of each event would be around Â£1,000 "which we believe represents good value for money".
"All good governments listen to the people they serve," a spokesman said.
"These events, which will take place across Wales, give people the chance to meet the first minister, face to face, to talk through the matters which affect their daily lives - that should be welcomed, not derided."
Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas told BBC Wales it was "blatant electioneering" by the Labour party, which he said was copying the public meetings held across Wales by Plaid leader Leanne Wood.
A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesman also noted the timing, saying: "It's rather telling of Labour's attitude towards the people of Wales that they only think of starting to listen to them a year before the assembly elections."
While in opposition, David Cameron held a series of "Cameron Direct" public events, followed by "PM Direct" events after he came to power at the 2010 general election.
