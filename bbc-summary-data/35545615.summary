An old smuggling tunnel leading to the sea is believed to have been discovered underneath a Ceredigion shop.

The owner of New Quay's Ocean Blue shop, David Edwards, made the discovery after his basement store room flooded.
Despite claims it is nothing more than a drainage system, he said he was told about the "secret tunnel" as a child.
It could have been used in the 17th and 18th Century, when the trade of illegal goods such as wine and spirits was rife along Cardigan Bay.
During a clean-up of the basement after the flooding, the removal of an old blocked doorway and debris led Mr Edwards to an underground passage.
"I thought I was going to find a pot of gold and retire but unfortunately not. It is eerie to go along the tunnel but also exciting," said his wife, Karina.
The tunnel leads to the beach, where contraband, wines and spirits were stored and traded in caves.
Salt smuggling was also rife, which was used to preserve bacon and herring.
One historian maintained it was just part of a drainage system leading to the sea, but another historian, Roger Bryan, said many locals were involved in illegal trades.
Mr Bryan said in August 1704, after three ships had arrived with salt on board, custom officials found 150 men with horses on the beach loading contraband.
"It would be great to be able to see if the tunnel could be cleared all the way to the beach, but at the moment it's just great to make this discovery and it's already got all of New Quay talking," he added.
