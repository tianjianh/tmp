Indian officials brought Sonu, 13, to Delhi from Dhaka on Thursday after a Bangladeshi court allowed him to fly back home.
On Tuesday, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj confirmed his DNA had matched with his mother Mumtaz Begum.
Ms Swaraj added that Sonu had been kidnapped from the Indian capital.
Two women, accused of abducting the boy from Delhi, are facing a criminal investigation in Bangladesh.
Ms Begum told BBC Bengali that "she was happy to be reunited with her son" and she felt like "celebrating Eid today".
Bangladeshi national Jamal Ibn Musa had discovered the boy, who was being made to work as a servant. He alerted police to his whereabouts, and eventually traced his family to India.
"They [the alleged abductors] used to torture the boy and keep him busy with hard work around the day at my neighbour's house. I informed the police about it around three years ago," he told Bangladeshi newspaper Daily Star.
He added that he told the local police about the boy's situation but they "kept mum even after visiting the house".
He said he was finally able to rescue Sonu in December and produce him before a court.
The court sent the boy to a children's welfare home after which Mr Musa started the process of tracing his family in India.
He decided to travel to Delhi on 14 May to search for "a vague address" that the boy had given him.
After a few days, he tracked down Sonu's parents in Delhi's Seema Puri area. "His parents were so happy to hear the news of their missing son," he said.
Ms Begum said that Mr Musa was an "angel".
"I can't thank him enough. He is a great man," she said.
Ms Swaraj also expressed gratitude towards "those who looked after our young citizen in Bangladesh".
