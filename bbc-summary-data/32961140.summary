Author EL James has announced that she has written a new version of her erotic bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey.

The new book, titled Grey, tells the story through the eyes of sadistic billionaire Christian Grey.
James said that since the publication of the original novel in 2011 "thousands of readers" had written to her requesting to hear Christian's point of view.
Grey will be published on 18 June - the date of the character's birthday.
Fifty Shades of Grey told the story of the steamy relationship between Grey and "unworldly, innocent" literature student, Anastasia Steele.
It was followed by two sequels - Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed - with the trilogy achieving worldwide sales of more than 125m.
On the opening page of the new novel, James writes, "This book is dedicated to those readers who asked… and asked… and asked… and asked for this."
Monday's official announcement said the author would offer her fans "the opportunity to see the world of Fifty Shades anew through the eyes of its intriguing and enigmatic protagonist".
"Christian is a complex character," said James, "and readers have always been fascinated by his desires and motivations, and his troubled past.
"Also, as anyone who has ever been in a relationship knows, there are two sides to every story. It's been a great pleasure to return to my happy place - writing, being with Christian and Ana in their universe, and working with the fantastic publishing teams in the US and the UK."
The film adaptation of Fifty Shades Of Grey, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, hit cinemas earlier this year starring Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele.
James's husband Niall Leonard is set to write the sequel, after reports of disagreements between the author and her collaborators on the first film.
