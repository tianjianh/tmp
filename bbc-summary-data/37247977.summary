Marcus Ingvartsen and Pione Sisto's fine individual effort gave Denmark a 2-0 half-time lead.
Sisto's second goal and Kasper Dolberg's late strike sealed victory for an impressive Danish side.
Wales are seven points behind Denmark, with only the group winners qualifying automatically.
Geraint Williams' side host Luxembourg in Bangor on Tuesday, 6 September with their final game away to Armenia on 11 October.
Williams had said Wales needed to win against an unbeaten Denmark side they had held to a goalless draw earlier in the campaign.
Christian Norgaard had a long range effort saved by Wales keeper Billy O'Brien but two minutes later the visitors took the lead.
Marcus Ingvartsen scored from close range after a scramble in the penalty area following Andrew Hjulsager's corner.
Wales' response saw Wes Burns heading wide from Harry Wilson's cross while Patrick Banggaard nearly doubled Denmark's advantage.
Denmark extended their lead when the lively Sisto fired an unstoppable shot from outside the area after he embarked on a run from his own half.
Sisto scored his second of the game with a header from Hjulsager's cross three minutes into the second half.
Burns and Harry Wilson had second half chances for the hosts before substitute Dolberg's half volley sealed Denmark's win with seven minutes remaining and end a tough afternoon for Wales.
