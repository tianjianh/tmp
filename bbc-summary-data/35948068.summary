A loud bang and a flash of light in the sky over west Belfast on Friday night were nothing sinister, NIE has said.

A piece of equipment failed at an electricity substation near Lenadoon. An investigation is under way.
Witnesses described hearing a bang and flash of light in the sky at about 23:15 BST.
Many people believed it was an explosion. Three Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue crews were called to the scene.
Sarah McClintock, NIE, said a fault had caused a dip in power.
"Equipment failure could cause a bang and a flash which we believe is what people saw last night," she said.
"There was nothing sinister involved. It was a piece of equipment that failed in one of our sub stations and that would have caused the flash and could also have caused the dip in power that we have seen."
