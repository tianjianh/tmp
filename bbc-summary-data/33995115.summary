[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Kovacik is accused of shooting Rosalynde Pitcher in the temple with a pellet after she told him they were not going to have a long term relationship.
Mr Kovacik, 58, from the Isle of Wight, told Portsmouth Crown Court he had no recollection of the attack on the 21-year-old.
He denies wounding Ms Pitcher with intent.
He also denies possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, having an article with a blade or point, and possessing an air gun with intent to cause fear of violence.
Mr Kovacik, who is from Shanklin, told the court he had fallen in love with Ms Pitcher and promised to give her Â£50,000 if she stopped taking drugs and working in the sex industry.
He also gave her Â£6,000 to pay for a breast enlargement operation.
On 12 December, while at her flat he said he was confronted by her father Lee Pitcher, who accused him of making her pregnant.
Mr Pitcher was allegedly "abusive and aggressive" and threatened to kill him, leaving Mr Kovacik in a "state beyond terrified".
Five days later, Mr Pitcher punched him in the face and body several times, he said.
On 20 December, Mr Kovacik went to see Ms Pitcher again to clear the air.
He said he took an air pistol and a knife for self defence, as he was scared Mr Pitcher would be there.
He said: "Rose turned round and said to me 'I am not on my own, he's in the bathroom'."
He was then "overcome with blind terror [and] panic" and drew the gun.
It turned out to be another man who ran away, Mr Kovacik said.
"I turned back to Rose and said 'I just want to know why, I thought you loved me'.
"Her reply: 'I can't believe you fell for that, we were never going to get together, it was never going to happen.'"
Mr Kovacik claims not to remember what happened next, but recalls driving away in his car and calling police with the aim of committing suicide by being shot by them.
He was arrested in the ensuing confrontation.
He said: "I had voices saying to get the police to shoot me, that is the solution.
"They didn't seem to be shooting me despite my best efforts to make them do so."
The trial continues.
