West Ham midfielder Marko Arnautovic is included in Austria's squad to face Wales in their World Cup qualifier at Cardiff City Stadium on 2 September.

Arnautovic, who joined from Stoke for £24m in July, scored twice in the 2-2 draw in Vienna last October.
Defenders Moritz Bauer of Rubin Kazan and SK Rapid's Maximilian Wober earn first call-ups from Marcel Koller.
That sees Tottenham defender Kevin Wimmer left out, although the £15m West Brom target remains on standby.
Wales coach Chris Coleman will announce his squad on Friday, 25 August to face Austria and then Moldova in Chisinau three days later.
