Sunday's fixture was called off 64 minutes before the scheduled throw-in because of a waterlogged pitch.
Tyrone's hurling match with Donegal was also postponed - it will now be played at Healy Park on Sunday. 19 March.
Meanwhile, there is a 17:00 GMT throw-in for the All-Ireland club football final between Slaughtneil and Dr Crokes at Croke Park on 17 March.
The NHL Division 3A tie between Tyrone and Donegal, which was to have been the Healy Park curtain-raiser, was switched to Carrickmore but that too fell victim to the weather.
