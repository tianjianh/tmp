A video has been released of how a planned Â£100m shopping development near Oxford would look.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plans for the West Way shopping area in Botley include restaurants, a hotel and student accommodation.
The "walk-through" video was produced by developer Doric Properties following a request from North Hinksey Parish Council.
It is based on plans submitted to the Vale of White Horse District Council in December 2013.
It is claimed the development will create 600 jobs in construction and 480 jobs when it is operating.
Opponents have previously raised concerns about the development being too large for the site.
Other concerns include increases in traffic and congestion.
