De Montfort University (DMU) and Beaumont Town FC both train and play on pitches at Beaumont Park, in Leicester.
On Monday, DMU said a student was "dragged" across a road, while the club claims children were "goaded".
Leicestershire Police said it was investigating an alleged assault that took place on Monday evening.
DMU invested Â£2.3m in Beaumont Park in March 2015 to "boost community sports and support student teams".
However, a row recently broke out over access to the pitches and changing facilities.
It came to a head on Monday after members of Beaumont Town FC organised a protest, saying they had been locked out of the ground.
DMU said in a statement that protesters disrupted its football matches and claimed one of its students was "bruised" after being dragged across a road and knocked to the floor.
A security guard also said he was punched.
However, Nick Langton, Beaumont Town's general secretary, told the BBC the university's claims were "misleading" and an "exaggeration".
He said, while he was not there, parents had told him that students from DMU were "winding up the children".
The university said Mr Langton was the "cause of the problems" between the two sides but it would work with a "reconstituted committee".
In response, Mr Langton said he was trying the prevent the break-up of the football club.
He said: "My heart and soul is in the club. I would step down if I was to blame."
A spokesman for the Leicestershire & Rutland County FA said: "Various allegations have been made and the County FA is subsequently in communication with parties involved and an investigation is under way."
