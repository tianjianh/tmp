Those killed include two children. All the victims were passengers in a  minivan.
The attack took place in Sangin district in Helmand province.
It is not known who carried out the attack, but the area on Pakistan's border is a stronghold of the Taliban and al-Qaeda militants.
Helmand provincial spokesman Daud Ahmadi told the AFP news agency that the minivan "struck a Taliban-planted mine".
Correspondents say says roads are increasingly in the front line of the war in Afghanistan.
Civilian and military casualties are at levels not seen for a decade - last year more than 2,400 civilians died, with roadside bombs the biggest source of casualties.
