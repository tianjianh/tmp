The death of at least seven people after a vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed at the Shoreham Air Show marked the most serious crash at such an event in the UK in many years.

But there have been a number of other accidents during aerial displays in the UK over the last decade - including a further two at the Shoreham show.
August 2015 - CarFest
Pilot Kevin Whyman, 39, was killed when his Folland Gnat aircraft crashed during an aerial display at the CarFest event in Cheshire.
The plane nosedived during the display, before disappearing behind trees. Moments later a plume of thick black smoke was seen.
July 2014 - Royal Navy Culdrose Air Day
A Royal Navy Sea Fury crashed onto the runway at the show, with eyewitnesses reporting the aircraft appeared to lose power and made an emergency landing.
Pilot Lieutenant Commander Chris Gotke walked away uninjured.
July 2012 - Old Warden Aerodrome
Trevor Roche, 52, was killed when a 1923 De Havilland DH53 Humming Bird crashed near Biggleswade.
The plane crashed at the back of the airfield while practicing for a display.
A report later found Mr Roche lost control of the aircraft in strong winds.
August 2011 - Bournemouth Air Festival
RAF Red Arrows pilot Flt Lt Jon Egging, 33, died when his Hawk T1 aircraft crashed.
Eyewitnesses described seeing the plane plunge to the ground in a field near the River Stour at Throop village.
It was one of nine Red Arrows aircraft that had earlier taken part in a display over the seafront.
10 July 2011 - Duxford Flying Legends show
Two classic US fighter planes collided during an air display show in Cambridgeshire.
One of the planes  plummeted to the ground after their wings touched, forcing the pilot to parachute to safety. The pilot of the other plane, a Skyraider, went on to land safely. No-one was injured.
3 July 2011 - Old Warden airfield
A Bucker Jungmann plane, designed in the 1930s, crashed during a practice in the run-up to a display. The pilot escaped with slight injuries.
September 2010 - Shoreham air show
A pilot survived after a stunt glider crashed into a runway in front of spectators.
September 2007 - Shoreham air show
Brian Brown, an experienced pilot, died when the Hurricane he was flying crashed.
A report found the accident was probably caused by an unplanned manoeuvre.
The report recommended the sequence of manoeuvres should be clearly specified in advance of flying displays.
