'Nuisance' seagulls swoop on Llanfairpwll residents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People living on Anglesey have said they are "at the end of their tether" due to seagulls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Residents at Bryn Bras, Llanfairpwll, said the birds are noisy early in the morning, and that they pose a danger to small children as they swoop down.
The birds have been nesting at the estate for about two years.
Anglesey council said it had received complaints about the gulls - but its hands were tied as the birds are protected.
Some residents said they were afraid to take their dogs for a walk or eat in their gardens.
Janet Roberts said: "They're around the house about five o'clock in the morning waking everyone up.
"There is bird poo everywhere on the house walls and I have tried to get rid of it."
The council said it was a criminal offence to intentionally kill or harm any seagull, or to destroy a nest, and, therefore, the council was not able to provide any service to get rid of them.
