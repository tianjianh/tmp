2016 FA People's Cup: Fabulous finale to five-a-side competition in Sheffield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2016 FA People's Cup came to a sparkling finale in the Sheffield sun.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 4,300 teams who entered the tournament back in January to compete across 11 categories had been whittled down to just 90.
They competed in groups, with the winners progressing straight through to the finals - two of which were decided by penalty shootouts.
The victorious teams won tickets to the FA Cup final in May, where they will be honoured at half-time on the pitch.
The day was covered by a special live text commentary and featured last-gasp winners, stunning goals, great celebrations and a wonderful sense of enjoyment and camaraderie.
There were also appearances from former player Kevin Kilbane, BBC presenters Ore Oduba, Harry Gration and Paul Hudson and Helen Rollason Award winner Bailey Matthews.
