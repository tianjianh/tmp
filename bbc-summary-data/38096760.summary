Sex scandal author Galloway speaks about university sacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Steven Galloway, the writer at the centre of a Canadian literary firestorm, has spoken out about sexual misconduct allegations against him.

The University of British Columbia (UBC) fired Mr Galloway earlier this year because of unspecified "serious accusations".
Media reported accusations of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault.
Mr Galloway's lawyer says the author "regrets his conduct" but denies the most serious allegations.
The writer faces no criminal charges and has filed a complaint over his dismissal.
The university has never revealed the substance of the accusations against Mr Galloway or the results of the investigation conducted by a former British Columbia supreme court judge, citing privacy for both Mr Galloway and his accusers.
Speaking about the allegations for the first time, Mr Galloway's lawyer Brent Olthuis said that the sole complaint substantiated by the university's investigation was that Mr Galloway engaged in "inappropriate behaviour with a student".
"Both the student and Mr Galloway were married at the time. The relationship developed into an affair that lasted approximately two years," Mr Olthuis confirmed in a written statement sent to media.
"Mr Galloway profoundly regrets his conduct and wishes to apologise for the harm that it has caused.
"He does not seek to minimise it or to hide from it. He seeks fair treatment for all involved, and an end to the scurrilous assertions and accusations that have proliferated in the vacuum of information."
According to Mr Olthuis, the university also investigated "specific complaints of a sexual nature from 2011" related to one complainant. Mr Olthuis said the university's investigation concluded "on a balance of probabilities that Mr Galloway had not committed sexual assault."
Mr Galloway's case received considerable media attention since he was suspended over a year ago. The university also became the subject of considerable scorn, after over 80 of Canada's brightest literary talents came to his defence in an open letter to UBC.
In the letter published 14 November, writers including Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Madeleine Thien and David Cronenberg demanded an independent investigation into how UBC handled the allegations against the creative writing professor and bestselling author.
The authors have since faced criticism that, by attacking the lack of due process they saw afforded to Mr Galloway, they are turning a blind eye to "rape culture".
Thirteen authors, including Camilla Gibb and Miriam Toews, have since removed their names from the letter.
"I may have been inadvertently complicit in contributing to a culture of shaming and silencing," Ms Gibb wrote on Facebook.
A number of others have added their names to the list.
