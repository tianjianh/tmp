[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is hoped the Donside Hydro project - aimed at powering about 130 homes on the site of the former Donside paper mill, as well as selling energy to the National Grid - will be generating electricity later this month.
Aberdeen Community Energy (ACE) is behind the project.
The hydro power scheme will harness energy from the River Don.
