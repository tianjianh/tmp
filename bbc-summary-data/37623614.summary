[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A motorcyclist who died in a crash on the Isle of Man was travelling at about 150mph, an inquest has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shaun Watkinson's BMW motorbike crashed into the back of a Citroen car driving in the same direction at about 42mph on the A18 Mountain Road, the court heard.
Mr Watkinson, 55 and of Bolton, Greater Manchester, was thrown over the the car and on to the road in front.
The project manager was pronounced dead at Noble's Hospital in Braddan after the collision on 2 June.
A police investigator told the inquest, sitting at Douglas Court House, that Mr Watkinson's motorbike struck the back of Citroen, which was being driven by a local man, in an area of the Mountain Road known as Hailwood's Rise.
Both the driver of the Citroen and his sister, who was a passenger, were taken to hospital but later released.
The inquest heard that during the TT festival the Isle of Man government operates the Mountain Road as a one-way system.
The scheme was introduced as a safety measure and is thought to avoid the potential for head-on collisions in the derestricted route.
Coroner John Needham said: "This is a very tragic accident - if there had been a speed limit in place there is good reason to believe that this accident would not have happened and Shaun would still be with us.
"This road should be governed by a speed limit while it is a one-way system during the TT festival. Without it fatalities are inevitable.
"I will be writing to the [Isle of Man] department of infrastructure to make this recommendation, for the second time."
Mr Needham recorded a verdict of accidental death.
