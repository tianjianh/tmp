Celtic are one of a number of clubs interested in Aberdeen winger Jonny Hayes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Republic of Ireland cap Hayes, 29, is contracted at Pittodrie until the summer of 2019.
He previously worked with Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers at Reading and it is believed the east end of Glasgow is the winger's likeliest destination.
Hayes scored Aberdeen's goal in their 2-1 Scottish Cup final defeat by Celtic last weekend.
And the wide man, who has three senior international caps, is in Martin O'Neill's national squad to face Uruguay in a friendly in Dublin on Sunday.
Hayes has made more than 350 Aberdeen appearances, scoring 56 goals, since arriving from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2012.
The 2016-17 campaign was the most prolific of his five seasons with the Dons, netting 11 times.
Hayes attracted interest from Cardiff City in January, with the Welsh club having two bids rejected before he signed a new deal with Aberdeen.
The midfielder started his career with Reading and, after loan spells with Forest Green Rovers and MK Dons, moved on to Leicester City without having made a first-team appearance.
Hayes, who was farmed out by the Foxes to Northampton Town and Cheltenham Town, joined Caley Thistle in 2009.
