While many of his countrymen play reggae or other musical styles borrowed from elsewhere, he and his band, the Amaravi Movement, make music inspired by traditional Malawian rhythms and instruments.
Known in his country as "the voice of the voiceless", Mawanga has a strong social conscience and is not afraid to speak out on behalf of the poor.
He ruffled feathers with his first hit Amakhala ku Blantyre which suggested that city dwellers who visit villages may not be as rich as they seem - they may have borrowed their fancy clothes.
