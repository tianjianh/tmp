Traffic cone hats and hidden motorways: The secret life of roads

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "roads revolution" is coming to the UK, according to ministers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A tunnel under Stonehenge on the A303 and 1,300 new miles of extra lanes will be added to motorways and A roads as part of a £15bn plan.
Pretty or polluted, congested or clear, these asphalt arteries are a part of our landscape and a vital part of our life.
We'd be lost without roads.
There are 245,700 miles of road in Britain.
That's almost 10 times the circumference of the Earth, which is a surprisingly small 24,859.82 miles.
Or, in road trip terms, you could drive 79 times across North America, using US route 50, driving from Ocean City, Maryland on the Atlantic Ocean to West Sacramento, California.
Since 1993, when the UK Statistics Authority first began estimating road length in this way, road length in Britain has increased by 6,600 miles or 2.7%.
That means The Proclaimers would have to walk their initial 500 mile pledge just over 13 times, or if they were to make good their second pledge to "walk 500 more" they could walk the new roads 6.6 times over.
Or, if they decided to split the route because they are twins, they would walk their promise 3.3 times each.
They'd have to navigate 18,994 roundabouts but there would be 112 motorway service stations to stop at, according to figures from Ordnance Survey (we don't advise walking on the motorway).
The only traffic cones owned by the Highways Agency are those used by the Traffic Officer Service (a lot of the cones you see on the roads belong to private contractors).
According to the latest data from the Highways Agency has around 4,500 traffic cones at a cost of £53,000. A cone therefore costs around £12 each.
The Agency has had to buy 755 replacement cones so far this year.
Traffic cones seem to be orange beacons of joy for the light-fingered.
Every year police forces and local councils around the country issue traffic cone amnesties where people can return cones they may have stolen but no longer have any use for.
Devon County Council was forced to have an amnesty in August last year after 180 cones went missing at Sidmouth Folk Week. That's about a quarter of all the cones they put out for the event.
The Duke of Wellington statue in Glasgow is perhaps one of the most famous cone-wearers.
His Grace is believed to have sported his orange urban headwear since the 1980s.
However, the practice is discouraged by Glasgow City Council and police as it is both dangerous and the statue is a listed monument.
Plans to end the tradition by raising the plinth, which stands outside the Gallery of Modern Art, were abandoned after a social media backlash.
The Duke, complete with cone, is ranked at number 45 out of 127 attractions in Glasgow, according to TripAdvisor.
Motorway enthusiast website Pathetic Motorways lists a number of motorways they consider secretive, unmapped or suffering from an identity crisis.
One of those listed is the M96, a four-lane motorway in Moreton-in-Marsh which you've probably never travelled on.
It's only a mile long and it's not open to the public. It's used by the Fire Service College to simulate large-scale traffic collisions and spillages.
Emergency services, helicopter personnel and medical staff can train there.
Several incidents can be simulated at the same time without causing traffic or having to shut functioning roads to allow training.
The BBC used this secret motorway in 2003 to film disaster mockumentary The Day Britain Stopped.
It dramatised a rail strike, traffic congestion and a mid-air plane collision.
For the purposes of the programme, the motorway was temporarily rebranded the M91. The M91 does not exist.
You might not have clocked it, but every sign has its own colour.
Blue is the colour of motorway signs which are mostly rectangular. Primary, or often used, routes are given a green background.
Local routes are written on white signs with a black border.
The brown signs are used for tourist attractions or facilities.
You can apply for a brown sign if you feel your site is worthy of tourist attraction status, but you'll have to pay for the sign yourself.
A single sign may cost £8,000 to £20,000 to design and install on a single or dual carriageway (larger signs cost more).
A motorway sign can cost from £17,000 to £40,000.
