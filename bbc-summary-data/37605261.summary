The 39-year-old passed for 406 yards and three touchdowns as the Patriots beat the Cleveland Browns 33-13.
"It's been a fun week to get ready to play and be back doing what I love to do," said the quarterback.
Brady was given a four-match suspension by the NFL in May 2015 for his role in a scheme to deflate match balls to give his side an advantage.
Sunday's win leaves the Patriots top of the AFC East standings with a 4-1 record, while a fifth straight defeat leaves the Browns bottom of AFC North.
