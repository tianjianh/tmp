The World Cup winners took the honour ahead of Europe's Ryder Cup golfers, the GB & Northern Ireland athletics squad and the Mercedes F1 team.
England beat Canada 21-9 in Paris to win the World Cup for the first time since 1994 after three final defeats.
"This is a massive turning point for women's sport," said captain Katy McLean.
"I would like to thank the Rugby Football Union and Sport England and our friends and family and to everybody at home."
"Also to the ex-players who have battled to win England the World Cup. This is just as much to you as it is to us.
"This is for you guys," added McLean.
Many of the England players returned to full-time jobs following the win.
It was later announced that the England Women's Sevens squad would be turning professional, with the Rugby Football Union giving full-time contracts to 20 players.
