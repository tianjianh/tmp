Mazembe were 2-0 up inside the first 26 minutes thanks to goals from Ben Malango and Rainford Kalaba.
SuperSport launched their fightback with Aubrey Modiba hitting straight back after Kalaba's strike and Teboho Mokoena hitting a second-half equaliser for the South Africans.
With Guinea's Horoya beating Mounana of Gabon 1-0 on Saturday, Group D is now tight with three teams level on points.
Horoya, Mazembe and SuperSport all have five points at the half-way stage of the group phase.
In Group B, Tunisia's CS Sfaxien moved back to the top of their pool with a comfortable 3-0 win over Platinum Stars of South Africa.
Nigeria's Kingsley Sokari opened the scoring after 10 minutes, Karim Aouadhi extended the lead before the half hour mark - and the win was rounded off by Maher Hannechi early in the second half.
Sfaxien lead the pool by a point from Mouloudia Alger.
Also on Sunday, Zambia's Zesco United beat Recreativo Libolo 1-0 in Ndola to go two points clear at the top of Group C.
A goal from Idris Mbombo was enough to give the Zambians the victory.
Group winners and runners-up will qualify for the quarter-finals.
