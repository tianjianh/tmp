The 61-year-old had the operation on 16 March and has missed the League Two club's matches while recuperating.
"I'm pretty sure I'll be well enough to go to the game and not feel stressed," he told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"I'll have an earpiece probably, to the dugout, and any decisions we can make we can all make together."
With assistant boss Russell Milton in charge in Johnson's absence, the Robins have lost four consecutive games, leaving them six points above the relegation zone with seven games remaining.
"If I am sitting at home, I'm watching the results of our rivals in our league and, all of a sudden, the pressure is more by sitting at home and trying to relax," Johnson added.
"So I might be better off just being at one game, putting the effort that I can give into that, and hopefully we can get a result.
"I'll be sitting there with my wife next time - I can't get too excited if she is there."
