It happened at Castlerock in County Londonderry at about 18:10 BST on Sunday.
Paramedics were called to the scene before Coastguard rescue teams from Coleraine and Ballycastle were able to lift the boy to safety from the rocks.
The boy was treated at the Causeway Hospital before being discharged.
John McPoland of the Ambulance Service said: "We received reports that a 12-year-old male had fallen on to the rocks at the beach. We dispatched a rapid response paramedic and an accident and emergency crew.
"When they arrived and assessed the scene, we required the assistance of the coastguard also," Mr McPoland said.
"They attended the scene, took the young fella from the rocks and handed him over to the care of the paramedics."
