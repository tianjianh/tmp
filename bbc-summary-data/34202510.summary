Moshe Fuerst, 17, suffered a fractured skull during an assault at Bowker Vale Metrolink station, which police are treating as an anti-Semitic hate crime.
He had been waiting for a tram with friends when he was verbally and physically assaulted, police said.
Officers arrested two boys in Whitefield, Bury, and Derbyshire.
A third teenager from Prestwich, Bury, was arrested after he attended a police station.
The three, all aged 17, are being held on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and violent disorder.
Two men, 18, and a 20-year-old man were also hurt during the incident on Saturday at about 23:40 BST.
Det Insp Liam Boden of Greater Manchester Police appealed for witnesses to come forward to what he described as a "sustained and unprovoked attack".
He said: "There are two distinct scenes, as we believe the victims were chased from the platform to Middleton Road and that is where the most serious assault took place.
"We believe the offenders then alighted the Metrolink towards Bury at around 23:35, travelling between Bowker Vale and Radcliffe."
Det Insp Boden added: "We know there were people on this tram and that they would have noticed these offenders travelling between carriages, as it would have been obvious that at least one of them had been involved in an assault."
Moshe Fuerst's father Rabbi Michael Fuerst called the attack "shocking" and claimed his son's religion "added to the intensity" of the assault.
He said: "Primarily this attack was about violence and bullying, but it had that element of anti-Semitism which carried it to a more severe level."
The family said the teenager was recovering and hoped he would leave hospital in the next week.
Anyone with any information is asked to contact police or Crimestoppers.
