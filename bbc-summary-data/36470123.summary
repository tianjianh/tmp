Ten points are awarded for a correct result (correctly guessing the winner or that the match will end as a draw). Forty points are awarded for predicting the exact scoreline.
As well as personal leagues, you will be entered into the overall league, which contains everyone who has registered - including BBC Sport's football pundits.
So if you think you can out-think our experts and your friends, sign up and get predicting using this link.
