[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Manchester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sergio Aguero effectively secured Manchester City a Champions League place while seriously denting Tottenham's top-four hopes.

Aguero swept in his 22nd Premier League goal this season to lift his chances of finishing the campaign as top scorer.
Tottenham missed several chances, with Harry Kane unable to add to his goal tally and City keeper Joe Hart superb.
Second-placed City's win puts them nine points and 24 goals clear of Liverpool, in fifth, with three games left.

And while the result provided a little respite for City manager Manuel Pellegrini, it remains to be seen whether it will help save his job after a disappointing season.
Defeat for Tottenham, in sixth, leaves them seven points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester United with nine points left to play for.
Yet Mauricio Pochettino's side could well have won the game had they been more ruthless in front of goal.
City, who had lost their previous four away league games, looked uncomfortable when defending at set-pieces, while their offside trap threatened to get them into trouble more than once.
The visitors had to survive a number of scares - the first coming when an unmarked Eric Dier headed wide from a corner, and the last when Hart pushed away Erik Lamela's stoppage-time volley.
But this was not Tottenham's day, nor Kane's.
The England international was unable to punish Pellegrini's side, rolling an early shot wide after being played clear, before being frustrated by Hart in the second half.
Kane began the day one goal behind Aguero in the race to finish as the Premier League's leading scorer - and the Argentina international, who had a strong first-half penalty appeal rejected, extended his lead just seconds after City had almost conceded from a corner.
David Silva sprinted away on to a Hart throw, and Aguero timed his run perfectly to meet the through pass and sweep a beautiful shot high into the net.

City's defence failed again just before half-time as Kane's diagonal ball from the left found Ryan Mason unattended, but the finish was hesitant and Hart spread himself to block.
Pellegrini's side may have been vulnerable in defence, but Aguero's tireless efforts ensured they were a consistent attacking threat.
The striker almost scored a wonderful second-half goal from a one-two with Fernandinho, but he screwed wide after rounding keeper Hugo Lloris.
Aleksandar Kolarov and substitute Wilfried Bony could have added further goals before a late flurry of Tottenham pressure, but Pellegrini came out on top.
