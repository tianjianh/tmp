A Hartlepool care home boss has been jailed for failing to protect an elderly resident who fell to her death.

Norah Elliott, 90, died after climbing out her bedroom window and falling from the conservatory below at Parkview care home in Seaton Carew in October 2012.
Owner Matt Matharu was accused of failing to fit window restrictors on Mrs Elliot's room, which he denied.
Judge Michael Taylor said he had shown a "reckless disregard" for health and safety and jailed him for eight months.
Teesside Crown Crown heard Mrs Elliott, who had dementia, was taken to James Cook University Hospital with "serious head injuries" following the fall and later died.
The prosecution argued the evidence suggested there was not a restrictor on one window of the room Mrs Elliott shared with her husband Bob and the case "boiled down to a failure in the duty to protect someone who could not protect themselves".
Matharu, of Elwick Road, described the fall as an "awful accident" and denied the charges.  He claimed one of them "must have removed" the security chain before the fall.
The 50-year-old was found guilty of two breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act following a trial in 2014.
