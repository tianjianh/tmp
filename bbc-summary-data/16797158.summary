Cardiff City have signed Wycombe Wanderers winger Kadeem Harris for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 18-year-old has established himself in the Wycombe team this season, making 17 appearances in League One.
Harris, who has signed a three-and-a-half year contract, won League Two's apprentice of the year award for the 2010-11 season.
"It's a good deal for all parties," Wycombe manager Gary Waddock told the club's website.
Cardiff manager Malky Mackay has made signing a winger a priority in the January transfer window.
He has failed in his attempts to prize Craig Noone from Brighton, while a bid for Blackpool's wide man Matt Phillips has also been rejected.
Harris broke the record as Wycombe's youngest player when he made his debut in 2009, aged 16 years and 201 days. That record has subsequently been taken from him by Jordan Ibe in 2011, who was 15 years and 244 days when he featured in a Carling Cup tie.
Striker Ibe, now 16, joined Liverpool earlier in the January transfer window.
Waddock added: "Like Jordon Ibe recently, we didn't want to stand in the way of Kadeem and the opportunity for him to play at a higher level.
"I've thoroughly enjoyed working with Kadeem during my time at the club and I wish him every success for the future."
