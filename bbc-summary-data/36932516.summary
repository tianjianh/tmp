Yorkshire Water said disruption to 3,600 properties in Thorne near Doncaster would continue while work to flush out pipes was completed.
The company said it had provided 100,000 litres of bottled water and would continue to hand out supplies.
The water cannot be drunk but is safe to wash in and for flushing toilets.
Yorkshire Water said it had been working through the night investigating the cause of the contamination, which was found during routine sampling.
A spokesman said small storage tanks would be available in some streets for customers to use but warned the water would need to boiled before use.
In a statement, the company said: "We would appeal to customers to only take what water they need and to help any vulnerable neighbours or friends in the affected areas."
It added: "Customers should continue to follow the Do Not Drink advice until further notice.
"The water supply in the area will need to remain on as we flush out the pipes and continue to undertake water quality testing."
