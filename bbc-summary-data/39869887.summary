New Moray councillor Sandy Cooper resigns days after election

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new councillor has resigned only days after being elected in Moray.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sandy Cooper was one of three people chosen to represent the Elgin City North ward in last week's election.
He tendered his resignation in a letter to the council's chief executive.
The letter said he had taken the decision after "careful consideration" and apologised for the inconvenience and cost implications. A by-election will take place at a date yet to be decided.
Mr Cooper had earlier promised Â£1,000 of his annual authority salary to each of five schools in his ward if elected.
When contacted by BBC Scotland and asked about his decision, Mr Cooper said: "It's just not for me."
It is understood the cost of the by-election could be about Â£25,000.
Moray Council said Mr Cooper's nomination papers contained no party or political affiliation.
