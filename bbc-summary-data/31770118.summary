Teaching training reforms 'critical' in Wales - review

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

Prof John Furlong said the quality of the system had "deteriorated" since he last looked at it nearly 10 years ago.
It follows hot on the heels of proposals for a radical overhaul of how and what children are taught.
Education Minister Huw Lewis said the case for change was "compelling" if teachers are to meet future challenges.
Prof Furlong, appointed by Mr Lewis last year as an adviser on initial teacher education and training, was asked to look closely at the system and he has now set out nine recommendations in a 40-page report.
The Oxford University academic and former comprehensive school teacher said the case for change was "undeniable".
This year, 2,700 teachers are being trained at three centres involving five universities in Wales.

Prof Furlong said he had been in contact with Prof Donaldson in drawing up his findings.
"It is my view that if the Welsh government, national agencies, schools and higher education work together on this, we can soon build a teacher education and training of which we can be proud," he said.
Mr Lewis said he would be considering the options in detail, adding: "In principle I  would disagree with nothing contained in Prof Furlong's report".
