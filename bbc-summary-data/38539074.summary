[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship strugglers Rotherham beat 10-man Norwich as Nelson Oliveria was sent off early for violent conduct.

Jerry Yates tapped home Tom Adeyemi's cross on his debut to give the Millers an early lead.
Norwich were then reduced to 10 men on 18 minutes when forward Oliveira seemed to strike the face of Kirk Broadfoot.
Cameron Jerome's header gave the Canaries hope of a draw after the break, but Adeyemi nodded in against his former club to earn three points.
Rotherham, who have the worst defensive record in the division this season and are bottom of the Championship, took the lead in the seventh minute.
But the game came to a head after an unsavoury incident between Oliveria and Broadfoot.
Centre-half Broadfoot was initially fouled and whilst down on the floor, Oliveira appeared to hit the the Rotherham player in the face and was immediately dismissed by referee Geoff Eltringham.
It got even worse for Norwich when their influential midfielder Jonny Howson hobbled off injured. Despite pulling a goal back, Rotherham showed resilience to earn a vital win in their fight against relegation.
Norwich's ninth defeat in 13 Championship games means they fall to 11th in the table, eight points off the play-off places.
Rotherham caretaker manager Paul Warne:
"I didn't think many people would give us a chance and I thought that would be in our favour.
"Norwich came here today and I bet their staff did everything they could to say that it would be a difficult game, but I know how it works, they would have expected to beat the bottom of the league.
"We haven't got as good as players as Norwich have, that's a fact. We set them up to play ugly and it caused them problems.
"I still don't think a managerial career is for me but while the chairman has asked me to do it I will give it everything I have got."
Norwich manager Alex Neil:
"I have spoken to Jez Moxey (chief executive) and Delia Smith (owner) and the message is that it was a disappointing day and the decisions haven't helped us.
"We didn't start playing until the man was sent off. We got ourselves back into the game and then gave away a sloppy goal. The damage was done in the early part of the game.
"Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong, that happens when you're on a poor run."
