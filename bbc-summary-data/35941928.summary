The baby, named Sion by officers, was recovered from the River Taff on 23 June. It is believed he died at birth.
The force said its main concern was to provide the mother with the emotional support she may need.
Police also want to find Sion's mother so he can be "laid to rest with his family name".
Det Insp Mark O'Shea said: "With the passing of time we hope that Sion's mother, or a family member, may feel more comfortable to come forward and enable us to support them and allow Sion to be laid to rest with his family name.
"We understand that Sion's mother has been through a traumatic time and I can reassure you that we have professionals in place with specialist skills who can provide you with support."
Suzanne Hardacre, head of midwifery at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said staff understood the mother might be frightened to come forward but urged her to get in touch.
"We are here to help you. We have a range of health care professionals available to give you any emotional support or medical attention you may need. Any care you receive from us will be in total confidence."
"Please contact us on this telephone number 02920 742679 anytime of the day or night, we want to make sure you are ok."
