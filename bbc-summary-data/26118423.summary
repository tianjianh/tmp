Plans to improve key sites around Port Talbot have been boosted by nearly £10m in funding.

Redeveloping the derelict Plaza Cinema, where Richard Burton and Sir Anthony Hopkins used to visit, is on the list of proposed work.
Improvements to public transport links and new developments on Aberavon seafront, along with affordable housing, are also planned.
Funding for the proposals has come from the Welsh government.
Its Vibrant and Viable Places scheme is used for regeneration projects which include tackling poverty, building homes and improving community facilities.
"This is again fantastic news for the residents and businesses of Port Talbot and surrounding areas," said Neath Port Talbot council leader Ali Thomas.
"This funding will enable a programme of development which will build on other recent successes such as the completion of Harbour Way, the first phase of the town's Harbourside quarter and the redevelopment of the Parkway station.
"There is now real momentum behind our regeneration programme for the county borough.
"Whilst this remains a very tough time for local councils financially, we are committed to securing the necessary funding to deliver our vision for a prosperous and attractive Neath Port Talbot."
Earlier this month, Network Rail unveiled final plans for an £11.4m redevelopment of Port Talbot Parkway train station which will be completed next year.
It follows on the footsteps of last year's opening of the £107m Harbour Way project - linking the M4 to Port Talbot docks where land is being opened up for development.
