Crystal Palace 1-2 Manchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zlatan Ibrahimovic struck two minutes from time to give Manchester United a vital victory just as it appeared they had squandered another advantage at Crystal Palace.

The 35-year-old Swede slid on to Paul Pogba's pass to beat Wayne Hennessey from an acute angle after James McArthur's 66th-minute strike seemed to have rescued a point for a strangely passive Palace.
Pogba's assist repaid Ibrahimovic for creating his opener in first-half stoppage time - although Palace were furious as claims for a handball in the final pass and offside against the scorer were ignored by referee Craig Pawson.

Pawson had a difficult night and United were angered equally when he ignored a clear handball in his own area from Palace substitute Joe Ledley after the break before Juan Mata's shot was contentiously ruled out for offside.
In the end, the frustration was Palace's as Ibrahimovic popped up to secure a United win, their second in succession after beating Tottenham at the weekend, and one that had manager Jose Mourinho on the pitch celebrating with his players at the final whistle.
Relive the drama from Selhurst Park as it happened
Ibrahimovic and Pogba were Mourinho's showpiece signings when he took over in the summer - and they are starting to deliver as they appear to be on the same wavelength.
Yes, there was plenty of dispute about both the creation and the finish for Pogba's first but the pair linked instinctively.
And they did it again in that decisive moment when the game was won, Ibrahimovic making the perfect run to profit from Pogba's power and pass.
It is happening more and more, as it did when Pogba created a goal for Ibrahimovic against West Ham recently.
Two high-class players are in tune with each other. This can only be good news for Mourinho.
Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo was heavily criticised for a wild two-footed lunge on Everton's Idrissa Gueye in the 1-1 draw at Goodison Park at the start of the month.
He was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card from Michael Oliver then - and he was the beneficiary of similar leniency from referee Pawson here at Crystal Palace.
In a carbon copy of his transgression at Everton, Rojo launched himself at Palace's Wilfried Zaha and was penalised with a foul and a caution. He farcically protested his innocence but can count himself lucky he was not punished more heavily.
Watford striker Troy Deeney, speaking on Match Of The Day 2 after the Everton game, said: "He strikes me as someone who's a bit scared of getting hurt so he's thought 'I'm going to do everything I can to protect myself'."
Rojo's tackling was reckless and could have cost the visitors dearly - not to mention the players he is tackling.
Wayne Rooney needs one goal to equal Sir Bobby Charlton's club record of 249 goals for Manchester United but, with the Old Trafford legend looking on, he was frustrated here.
It was not for the want of trying as he worked tirelessly and brought two fine saves from Palace keeper Hennessey, but the wait goes on as he was substituted late on. The show now moves on to West Bromwich Albion at the weekend.
It is now one win in 10 Premier League games for Palace, who are three points above the relegation zone, and it is not about to get any easier for Pardew's side.
Premier League leaders Chelsea visit Selhurst Park on Saturday and Palace, who have won just six league games in 2016, have to visit Arsenal in their first game of 2017 on 1 January.
They failed to register a shot on target in the first half and only came alive after Ledley's introduction at the start of the second.
"We knew we had this tricky spell of matches coming up," said Pardew after the game. "We've got a big game Saturday so we've got to take what we can out of this game in terms of our confidence levels.
"We could've done better on the break but I can't fault them, they've given me everything and we need a little break here and there and we'll be OK."
