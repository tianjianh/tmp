Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha praised his players for "suffering" against Aberdeen before securing a win that cut the gap on the Dons to nine points.

The visitors were grateful to keeper Wes Foderingham for three fine saves before Kenny Miller's brace and a third from Joe Dodoo clinched a 3-0 victory.
It ended second-place Aberdeen's run of 10 consecutive home wins.
"I can describe the game with two words - organisation and sacrifice," said Caixinha after a second win in charge.
"I think the team understood perfectly well the opponents that they were facing and what they needed to do throughout the match.
"When it was needed to suffer, the team knew when to suffer, especially in the first 15 or 20 minutes in the second half.
"We needed to make decisions at that moment because Aberdeen were taking risks and exposing their two full-backs and we knew the time to exploit the space they were conceding.
"I am glad the game went and finished how it did."
Victory revived Rangers' hopes of catching the Dons in second spot, with six games left - including another against Aberdeen - to come.
"We knew we had still two more games against Aberdeen," Caixinha added.
"We have now won the first one but if we don't continue winning before the next game then maybe things will be different.
"That is what we need to do, keep winning and then beat them again but our focus is always on our next match and now we will have to look right away at our next opponent on Saturday."
Rangers host Partick Thistle on 15 April before a Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic on 23 April. The post-split Premiership fixtures will be announced early this week.
