Doncaster Rovers 1-3 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter City booked their place in the League Two play-offs with an impressive victory over long-time leaders Doncaster at the Keepmoat Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Jordan Moore-Taylor, David Wheeler and Liam McAlinden were enough for Exeter to condemn Doncaster to a third straight defeat which saw them slip to second place in the table behind Plymouth.
Moore-Taylor smashed in a 30-yard thunderbolt after 16 minutes, but Rovers were level in 26th minute when James Coppinger finished well from a tight angle.
The Dons endured a frustrating second half attempting to break Exeter down, and the visitors regained the lead just after the hour.
They were awarded a penalty when Joe Wright handled on the line, and although Ryan Harley saw his spot-kick saved by Ian Lawlor, Wheeler drilled in the rebound.
The win was sealed late on when Ollie Watkins squared for substitute McAlinden to score.
