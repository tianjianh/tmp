The Vauxhall Corsa ended up on its side alongside the house on Carrington Drive in Hop Pole, near Spalding on Thursday.
The 25-year-old driver escaped the wreckage with broken ribs and a dislocated shoulder.
No-one is thought to have been in the property at the time of the crash, which demolished part of a rear bedroom of the semi-detached house.
Dick Holmes, from Lincolnshire Police, said the car demolished a fence as it flew through the air.
However, on Friday, a police spokeswoman said it was unclear whether the car hit the first floor or if that part of the house crumbled as a result of an impact at ground level.
Firefighters worked into the early hours to stabilise the building and structural engineers were assessing the damage.
Graham Roberts, who said his fence was damaged during the incident, said: "I heard a horrendous noise and I knew something was wrong.
"It looked like Armageddon, no fence to my house, hedge broken, and the car that had obviously knocked a hole in the house and fallen down."
