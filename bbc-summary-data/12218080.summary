Some like it pink - rare burgers ban from Dublin menu

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dublin restaurant has had to pull rare and medium-rare burgers from its menu after it was threatened with legal action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jo'burger in Rathmines has been warned by the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) to serve only well-done burgers or prove they can serve undercooked meat without the risk of contamination like E.coli.
The restaurant received a written warning in January that serving rare or medium rare burgers could prove a risk to public health.
Restaurant owner Joe Macken said rare and medium rare burgers had been pulled from the menu, although he, personally, believed it was an issue about consumer choice.
Mr Macken said he had been warned when the restaurant opened about three years ago.
As a result, he put a disclaimer on his menu, telling customers: "We will serve your burger as you request it, rare to well-done.
"Rare and medium-rare burgers are undercooked. Note: eating of undercooked or raw meat may lead to food borne illness."
He said an average of one in four burgers served in his city restaurant was ordered rare or medium-rare.
His argument is that he has faith in the abattoir that supplies him. They deliver the meat vacuum packed and the last thing they want is an E.coli outbreak, he said.
Mr Macken said he had now referred the HSE's written warning to a barrister.
"We are complying with the order but we have referred it," he said.
