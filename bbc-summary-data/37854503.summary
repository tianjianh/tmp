Keith the snake went missing before Fiona Wellington, from Sheffield, sold her car to a garage.
A couple from Bristol then bought the car from the dealer, with the snake emerging while they were driving home on the M5 motorway.
Mrs Wellington spotted a news article on Facebook about Keith and contacted the finders.
