[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tony Adams' Granada have been relegated to the Spanish second tier after a 2-1 defeat at Real Sociedad.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carlos Vela and Juanmi, formerly of Arsenal and Southampton respectively, scored the hosts' goals as Granada suffered a fourth successive defeat under Adams.
"We are all sad, the players, the fans, everybody," said Adams.
"There's been a lot of mistakes. We're going to try to rectify it and rebound very quickly."
The 50-year-old, who took charge on 10 April, has a contract to the end of the current campaign.
However Adams has been working at the Spanish club since November and is vice president of the company owned by Granada's club president.
"If the team played like this at the beginning of the season, there's no way we'd be in this situation," he added.
"I thought they were incredible today, but it's not a day for incredible, it's too late, you're down, you're finished, it's over."
Granada's relegation ends a six-season spell in the top flight. They play Real Madrid at home in their next match on 6 May with fans having walked out of previous defeats in protest at how the club is being run.
