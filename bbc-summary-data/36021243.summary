[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonas Knudsen's injury-time equaliser earned Ipswich a point against Fulham to give them an outside chance of reaching the Championship play-offs.

Moussa Dembele's 17th league goal of the season, from Scott Parker's cross, gave Fulham the lead.
But the hosts responded to remain eight points behind sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday with three games left.
Fulham have all but secured their Championship safety, remaining nine points clear of third-bottom MK Dons.
The Whites, who recovered from a 5-0 defeat by Brighton on Friday, are 16 goals better off than Karl Robinson's side, who kept their slim hopes alive with a goalless draw at Hillsborough.
Left-back Knudsen's first Ipswich goal came after a poor display from Mick McCarthy's side, who did not register a shot on target until the 74th minute.
Fulham created more of the entertainment, as Ryan Tunnicliffe had a shot saved, Dembele shot wildly over from close range and Shaun Hutchinson's header was brilliantly tipped over by Bartosz Bialkowski.
Dembele ended the gloom but after home fans ironically cheered a shot towards goal late on, the breakthrough finally came in stoppage time when David McGoldrick cleverly played in Freddie Sears and his low cross was rifled in by Knudsen.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"We got a result at the end but it was always a hard game and not one that will live long in the memory.
"They made it very hard for us, they slowed it down, got men behind the ball and they have some good quality.
"It looked like real end-of-season fare, which was a shame as I didn't set out that way."
Fulham head coach Slavisa Jokanovic:

"I am disappointed by the late goal but I believe we deserved to win and keep a clean sheet.
"I am satisfied with the fighting spirit and how my team tried to win the game.
"We need to keep trying until the end of the season and finish the competition in style."
