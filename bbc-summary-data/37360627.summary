The musical, about a jaded weatherman forced to live the same day over and over again, will open in the spring at New York's August Wilson Theatre.
The show, based on the 1993 film starring Bill Murray, has been adapted for the stage by the movie's co-writer Danny Rubin, with songs by Tim Minchin.
The musical got glowing reviews when it opened last month at London's Old Vic.
The London run, in which Andy Karl plays Murray's Phil Connors character, comes to an end on 19 September.
It is not yet known whether any of the London cast will make the transfer to New York's Great White Way.
