The book was given to the legendary singer by his Uncle Vester and Aunt Clettes for his first Christmas at his Graceland home in 1957.
Its 1,600 pages contain annotations by Presley, who died on 16 August 1977.
One note reads: "To judge a man by his weakest link or deed is like judging the power of the ocean by one wave."
The bible, embossed in gold on a leather cover, is among more than 100 lots of Elvis memorabilia to go on sale at Omega Auctions in Stockport on 8 September.
The collection is being sold on behalf of a British Elvis collector and marks the 35th anniversary of "The King's" death.
Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: "With much of the memorabilia in the collection having never previously been seen in the market, we are expecting significant interest from Elvis fans and collectors worldwide."
Presley began his career in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1954. He died in 1977 aged 42.
