The blaze broke out at Studio 338 on Boord Street, Greenwich, at about midday on Monday, pumping plumes of smoke into the air that could be seen for miles across the city.
The man, 28, has not been formally identified but has been named by the nightclub as an employee called Tomas.
A statement from the club said "our hearts are smashed and broken".
He was airlifted to an east London hospital but died on Tuesday.
The statement said: "Tomas fought for as long as he could given the extent of his injuries. He was as strong as an ox but it was too much even for him.
"He was so pure and beautiful, an inspiration to us all: always positive, never complaining, working through the night to make sure the parties were the best they could be for you and us.
"We are all so devastated to lose him like this. Everything we do from now on is for you, our brother."
Police are working alongside the Health and Safety Executive in a joint investigation into what caused the fire.
More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze, which spread to a nearby industrial warehouse and a scrap paper processing yard containing a number of outbuildings.
Fourteen men were initially arrested on suspicion of arson but were released without charge.
