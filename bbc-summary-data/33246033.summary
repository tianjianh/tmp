[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northern Ireland science fair 'breathtaking'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It was a day to put a rather technophobic education correspondent to shame.

Back in my schooldays, science meant Bunsen burners and the periodic table. I remember getting to type some script into an ancient computer about once a month.
The 3,000 schoolchildren who showcased their science, technology and engineering projects at the University of Ulster on Tueday are light-years ahead.
The sheer variety and invention of their 150 exhibits was breathtaking.
And that is good news for our local economy, as we send fewer young people to university to study science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects than other parts of the UK.
According to recent Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) figures, fewer than a quarter of students at universities and colleges in Northern Ireland study STEM subjects.
That compares to 25.2% of students in England, 28.1 % in Wales and 28% in Scotland.
Back at the science fair, the statistics were the last thing on Dearbhla McDonald's mind.
Instead, the Sacred Heart College, Omagh, student was busy checking that her school's electric car was ready to impress.
"It's a self-built car, the only one of its kind in Ireland," she said.
"We've raced it at Nutt's Corner, and we've qualified to do an international race at Rockingham in England in October."
The car can reach a top speed of just under 23mph.
It may not attract Louis Hamilton, but it feels pretty quick when you are driving round an exhibition hall full of pupils and their teachers with your legs inches off the ground.
Thankfully, I managed not to cause anyone serious injury during my spin.
Elsewhere there were apps aplenty, medical innovations including special clothes for eczema sufferers, and even a self-made DJ unit.
John Beattie and Arianna Brown from Cookstown High School, County Tyrone, were being kind to new pupils.
They had used the online game Minecraft to produce a virtual version of their school.
"It means that when first year [students] start school we can give them a virtual tour online, instead of just handing then a 2D map," said Arianna.
And John said that they planned to expand the project.
"We're going to create teachers to go into our virtual school," he said.
I wonder how the teachers feel about that.
As someone who still regards Twitter as new-fangled, I was feeling pretty low-tech by now, but help was at hand.
I spotted a large egg-shaped structure, made out of good old-fashioned wood with a little orange plastic lid.
Andrew Rourke from Lagan College, Belfast, is offering a taste of 'the Good Life'.
"I've designed an urban chicken coop for families living in the middle of the city who might only have small gardens."
"It helps them show their children the agricultural side of life, but a couple of chickens can live in it, and it means you might get fresh eggs for breakfast too."
As someone familiar with farming, which I'm not, Andrew assured me that chickens would be happy to jump up to enter his coop.
Some of the young people I met may go on to be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, but all of them are important to the Northern Ireland economy, according to Bill Connor, CEO of Sentinus, the educational charity who organised the fair.
"STEM subjects have never been more important as we seek to develop a strong knowledge economy here in Northern Ireland.
"This event is a centrepiece of our ongoing work to encourage more young people here to pursue these subjects, with a view to developing the necessary skills to underpin for our future economic success."
If this event is anything to go by, the future of innovation in Northern Ireland is in good hands.
As long as they're not mine.
