Hundreds of people have collectively donated more than £25,000 to Stuart Bates' team who are riding for bereavement charity 2 Wish Upon A Star.
Mr Bates, 43, and his son Fraser, seven, were struck on the A4119 at Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taff, on Sunday.
The driver was arrested and bailed.
The pair were hit while crossing the carriageway near Arthur Llewellyn Jenkins furniture store near Llantrisant.
Mr Bates, from Llanishen, Cardiff, an IT programme manager for PHS in Caerphilly, died at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital shortly after the crash.
Fraser, a pupil at Llysfaen Primary School in Cardiff, died at the Bristol Children's Hospital on Sunday night. His organs were later donated to transplant patients.
Before Sunday, £41 had been donated to Mr Bates' fundraising page but since then hundreds of people have given money in their memory.
One person posted: "So shocked and upset to hear. Stu's posts of positivity made W&W even more special an event - he'll be greatly missed by all. Anna, family & friends - Stu and Fraser are in our thoughts and prayers."
Another wrote: "So so sad. Thinking of you, your son and those you left behind. Hopefully the money you raised (and continue to raise even now) will help provide support at this difficult time."
The Wickets 'n' Wheels 2016 bike ride from Taunton to south Wales will take place on 27 May.
