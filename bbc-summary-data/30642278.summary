The new facility at Longue Hougue opened in November 2013, but was previously only able to process meat for on-island sale.
Val Cameron, director of environmental health, said snagging issues had needed to be solved and systems improved.
She said routine inspections would ensure the standards were maintained.
The previous slaughterhouse, in St Peter Port, had served the island for more than 150 years and is currently up for rent at Â£25,000 a year.
The cattle compensation scheme introduced in 1996 during the BSE crisis, which compensates farmers for culling cattle aged more than 30 months, is expected to end as older cattle can again be killed for meat.
Although a final decision on the scheme, which costs about Â£120,000 a year, will have to made by the Commerce and Employment Department.
