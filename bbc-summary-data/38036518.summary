The tone was set in the opening minute when Michael Cheek converted at the near post, but Southport first drew level when Jack Higgins scrambled home after a quarter of an hour before Josh Thompson's header put them ahead.
Andrai Jones profited from a goalkeeping error almost immediately after in the 28th minute but Manny Parry closed the gap moments later before Oliver Muldoon's floated free-kick levelled matters after 36 matters.
Another Muldoon free-kick was turned into his own net by Higgins as Braintree, having trailed 3-1, ended a breathless first-half leading 4-3 at the Merseyrail Community Stadium.
Southport were level after 56 minutes when Jamie Allen netted from the spot after Braintree goalkeeper Sam Beasant had brought down Jones, but the visitors had the final say eight minutes later when Jack Midson headed home from a corner.
