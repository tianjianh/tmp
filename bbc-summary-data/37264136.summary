[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torquay United 2-0 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nathan Blissett's first-half brace was enough for Torquay to claim a win over York at Plainmoor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old opened his account for the season in the sixth minute, heading home Dan Sparkes' inch-perfect cross from four yards out.
Sparkes turned provider again for Blissett in the 29th minute. This time the midfielder headed Aman Verma's cross back across goal, leaving Blissett to lash home on the volley from close range.
The former Kidderminster striker nearly clinched his hat-trick in the 40th minute, with Matt Fry clearing his goal-bound effort, but the job was already done. York tried to push after the break, but were unable to breach the Gulls' well organised back four.
