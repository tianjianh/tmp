A former deputy head of security at Croke Park who stole seven booklets of GAA season tickets in an effort to pay off his son's debt has avoided jail.

John Gibson, 45, had access to all areas at the stadium while he was working there with Brinks Allied.
He was based at the security desk at the Hogan Stand and has since resigned his position.
Each booklet had a total of 33 tickets allowing admission into each game at Croke Park for the GAA season of 2014.
The seven booklets had a total value of 9,313 euros (Â£6,834).
The court heard that there is no entitlement to sell off tickets individually so the booklets were effectively worthless and Gibson never made a profit from them.
At Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, Gibson of St Catherine's Gate, Rush, County Dublin, pleaded guilty to theft of the booklets from Croke Park on dates between January and March 2014. He had no previous convictions.
Judge Martin Nolan gave him a 18-month suspended prison sentence.
He said he believed that Gibson had already suffered through his loss of employment and accepted he had shown considerable remorse for the offence.
"He is a decent man who made a serious mistake on the day in question," said Judge Nolan, adding that it was "painfully obvious" that he didn't deserve a jail sentence.
Earlier, a detective told the court the GAA spotted the tickets for sale on a website and immediately cancelled them.
