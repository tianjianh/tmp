Thousands of books used for Wimborne world record attempt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of books were laid end-to-end through the centre of Wimborne in a bid to set a world record.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The attempt to create the longest-ever line of books took place on Sunday morning and is set to benefit the Dorset town's library and museum.
More than 16,000 books were donated and the oldest are being given to the Priest's House Museum.
The town's library will also get 325, with the rest sold to help community groups.
Organiser Dan Hancock said it was a "real community effort".
Some of the books have also been earmarked for educational projects in Nepal with the remainder being sold off to raise money for local groups as part of the Challenge Wimborne initiative.
Mr Hancock said "quite a few interesting books" had been received following an appeal.
Donations include a copy of the 1954 Highway Code and 50 Enid Blyton books, while a novel with a note dated 1864 is among those being given to the Priest's House Museum.
"It's been a really fun and heartening experience to see the amount of people who have got behind it.
"It's incredible the sort of things people don't want -  some of them have hardly been looked at," he said.
The line of books was recorded and will be sent to Guinness for verification as a world record.
