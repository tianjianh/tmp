The number 12 shirt was worn by David Fairclough in his team's victory over French side St Etienne 40 years ago, on their way to a European Cup triumph.
Fairclough earned the nickname supersub for his knack of scoring when he came off the bench.
The shirt is up for sale in an auction of sporting memorabilia.
In March 1977, Liverpool were six minutes away from an exit in the second leg of the quarter-final tie at a packed Anfield when the Liverpool-born striker changed the match.
Fairclough controlled a long pass from Ray Kennedy on his chest, shrugged off a heavy challenge and with two touches slotted the ball home from just inside the penalty area to give his side the 3-1 win they needed for an aggregate victory.
It sent fans wild and prompted a TV commentator to scream: "Supersub strikes again."
Recalling the day, Fairclough, 60, said: "I have very vivid memories of that day.
"I arrived at the ground and you had the feeling something was going to happen - I was not in the starting 11 and never dreamt I would play such a part."
He does not see the shirt as an essential reminder of one of Liverpool FC's classic nights in European football.
"It had been in the Liverpool FC museum - now it's in a bread box at my house. I'm not a great one for memorabilia but it might mean something for someone else," he said.
Fairclough said he would give the money raised from the sale to his children.
He added: "Most of the lads swopped theirs at the game. There was only me and Joey Jones who kept ours."
The shirt, which is listed at Â£4,000 to Â£6,000, is part of an auction of sporting memorabilia at London-based Graham Budd Auctions.
