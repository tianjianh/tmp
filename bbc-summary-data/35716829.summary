A "confusing" traffic junction contributed to the death of a motorcyclist, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samuel Slater, 25, died after he crashed with a van in Victoria Avenue in Jersey in August 2014.
Acting Insp Jez Payne told the inquest on Thursday that the van driver should have checked for traffic when he crossed the avenue.
Deputy viscount Mark Harris said he would recommend a review of the junction to the States.
The driver of the van, Antonio Rodriguez, had previously told police he crossed the avenue because he thought the traffic lights were green.
However, those traffic lights were intended for the next junction.
The inquest, held at Morier House in St Helier, found that Mr Slater died from head, neck and chest injuries.
Mr Harris said he would send his report seeking a review of the "layout and flow of traffic" to the Department for Infrastructure, "which may have the power to take action in order to prevent recurrence of similar fatalities".
Police have also recommended changes to the layout of the junction to the department.
Currently there is no traffic light signal for cars turning right into Kensington Place, which involves crossing the eastbound traffic lane in Victoria Avenue.
Mr Rodriguez has left the island, but faces a charge of driving without due care and attention if he returns, the inquest was told.
