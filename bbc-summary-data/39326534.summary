Dr Brian Harris 'sexual predator', says former patient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A psychiatrist accused of rape and assaulting patients is a "sexual predator who knows how to handle people like me", a former patient has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Brian Harris, 77, who worked at the Trealaw Clinic in Pentre, Rhondda Cynon Taff, denies 13 charges of rape, sexual assault and indecent assault.
The man told his trial Dr Harris groomed him during appointments between 2009 and 2011 when he was a student.
He said the doctor raped him and got him addicted to prescription drugs.
Merthyr Crown Court heard the former Cardiff University student, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was being treated for anxiety and depression after leaving his university course because of his symptoms when the assaults began.
He told police Dr Harris got him addicted to diazepam and gave him Viagra.
In recorded interviews played to the jury, he said: "He abused his position as a doctor.
"I was very vulnerable at the time and I didn't have any friends - he took advantage of me."
He claimed the initial incidents took place at the Trealaw Clinic in 2009 and said the memory of the assaults was "eating me alive".
He added: "I can't understand how he was so brazen about it in that damn office - I wish someone had walked in."
The court heard Dr Harris used to tell the man's mother to leave the room during their consultations and would then sexually assault him.
The alleged assaults took place at both Trealaw and the mental health department of the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant, the court was told.
In the interview, the man said Dr Harris had "control over my tablets, he can make my life difficult, so I went along with it".
He added: "I didn't want to do what I was doing. He had so much power, he was in charge. He could say if I could stay out of hospital."
The man said as a result of the assaults he put bleach in his mouth which burnt his teeth and "felt dirty".
In another interview in 2016, the man told police Dr Harris had come to the hostel where he lived and after inviting him out for a drink the doctor had invited himself inside afterwards and raped him on his bed.
"After that I took to drink. I put on weight so much that my father didn't recognise me. Even though his demeanour is mild and he's so small, he's the worst sexual predator ever. He's studied psychology," the man said.
He added the experience made him feel "worthless" and "like a piece of meat".
The alleged assaults eventually stopped when the doctor went on sick leave with cancer.
Dr Harris worked for the NHS and in private practice in Cardiff for 40 years.
Some of the alleged incidents date back to 1991.
The trial continues.
