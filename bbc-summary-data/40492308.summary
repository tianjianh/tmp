Asad Khan death: Family calls for coroner to stand down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has dismissed a family's call for him to stand down from an inquest into the death of a schoolboy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Asad Khan, 11, was found hanged in his bedroom at his family home on Tile Street, off Whetley Lane, on 28 September by his mother Farina Jan.
Speaking at a pre-inquest review, his father Asif Mahmood said he had "absolutely no faith" in coroner Martin Fleming's actions.
The coroner told the hearing there were "no grounds" for him to step aside.
Asad, from Bradford, died three weeks after starting at Beckfoot Upper Heaton School, with his family believing he was being bullied.
In June, an inquest into his death was adjourned when claims emerged a "choking game" was "all over the school".
At Monday's hearing, Asad's family claimed the investigation into his death had been carried out "very badly" and told the coroner they "would like someone else to take my son's investigation further, and not you".
They said relevant CCTV footage had not been considered and a summons was issued for the family's mobile phones and laptop despite them already agreeing to provide them.
Mr Fleming said he was "saddened" by the family's comments and had taken their "heartfelt concerns" on board, but would continue to preside over the inquest.
Asad was taken to hospital after he was found unresponsive, but died a short time later.
After his death, his mother called for "justice for her child" amid claims he had been bullied.
The hearing was adjourned until 16 August, with a full inquest due to start on 16 October.
