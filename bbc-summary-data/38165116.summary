James Hook: Gloucester fly-half to rejoin Ospreys at the end of the season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester fly-half James Hook will rejoin Ospreys at the end of the season, six years after he left the Welsh region.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 31-year-old, who left Ospreys to join French Top 14 side Perpignan in 2011, has agreed a three-year contract.
"It's good for me personally as a rugby player and it's the right thing for my family to be coming home," said Hook.
"It's important I finish well at Gloucester. It's a great club and they've been really good to me."
Hook, who has 81 caps for Wales, began his career with Neath before spending five years with Ospreys, and helped them to the 2010 Celtic League title.
He made 68 appearances for Perpignan in a three-year spell and, after Ospreys tried to re-sign him, joined Gloucester in 2014, having activated a get-out clause in his contract when the French club were relegated from the Top 14.
"It's been fantastic to go away to new places, get some unbelievable experiences in England and France with two great clubs, but I'm coming home to a team that's going places," Hook continued.
"I'm only 31, I'm playing week in, week out with Gloucester and I think I've got plenty to give on the field for a few years to come."
Hook's return to Ospreys comes after fly-half Sam Davies and back-row forwards Justin Tipuric, Dan Baker and Dan Lydiate all signed new deals with the region.
