Part of a coastal cycleway in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro has collapsed, killing at least two people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Witnesses said five people were on the path when about 50m (150ft) crumbled into the shoreline, in late morning local time. Search operations are now under way.
The elevated path was built ahead of the Rio Olympics this summer. The cause of the collapse is not yet known.
No events were planned for the bike lane, which opened earlier this year.
A witness, Ademir Guedes, told the O Globo newspaper (in Portuguese) he was cycling along the route before being alerted to the danger.
"I thought he was joking. I never imagined a newly built bike path would collapse. I went slowly to the edge of the cliff. Then drivers started shouting at me warning of the risk."
