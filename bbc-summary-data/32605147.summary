Election 2015: David Cameron - we can still win majority

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prime Minister David Cameron has said he still believes his party can win a majority in Thursday's election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Conservative leader said that outcome would mean a "strong, stable government that continues with a long-term economic plan that is working".
Mr Cameron also told the BBC he had a "duty" to warn of the "danger" of a Labour minority reliant on SNP backing.
And he said he would "put the country first" whatever the outcome of the general election.
Mr Cameron is continuing a 36-hour campaign drive ahead of polls opening.
Opinion polls suggest the 2015 general election is a very close race, with the Conservatives and Labour within just points of each other.
The polls also indicate neither of the two parties are on course to win a majority, meaning they would either have to form a minority government or do a deal with another, smaller, party.
Main pledges
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
The Conservatives need 23 seats more than they won at the 2010 election to secure a majority in the House of Commons.
Later, Mr Cameron will say a Conservative government will ensure "British people will have security at every stage of their lives".
He will say: "If Britain delivers a Conservative government, I make this promise: Britain will continue on the road to a brighter future. Our policies will deliver more childcare and jobs, help people buy their homes, cut taxes, and give people the retirement deserve."
Warning of the alternatives, he will add: "A vote for UKIP or the Lib Dems opens the back door to a Labour government: It will result in Ed Miliband as prime minister, unable to survive without SNP support. And that support will cost you money. They will take us back to square one, with heavy borrowing and higher taxes for more welfare. An economy facing ruin."
Speaking to Radio 4's Today in Wales, Mr Cameron said he was still "fighting" to win enough seats to form a government on his own.
He said: "People still have the chance to shape the election with their vote and we can achieve an overall majority that gives Britain the strong stable government that continues with a long-term economic plan that is working, the jobs, the growth, the houses we want to build, the childcare we want to provide, the good retirement we want to provide for our people, those things are in reach."
And he said he wanted to talk about policies until the polls closed.
"We should talk about the results after they're in and talk about the issues before the election takes place," Mr Cameron said.
Discussing the role of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Mr Cameron said: "They've got every right to vote, of course they do.
"But I've got every right to warn of the dangers of a bunch of nationalists who don't want our country to succeed."
Mr Cameron was also questioned about what he would do if there was no clear winner after Thursday's election.
"People know with me that in 2010 we didn't win a majority and I put the country first," he said.
"I formed the first coalition government for 70 years because I wanted to provide strong and stable government for Britain.
"I will always put the country first and always do what I can to provide that strong and stable government."
The prime minister was also asked about reports in the Daily Mirror that former Prime Minister Sir John Major had told a dinner that Britain must "acknowledge the fact we have a pretty substantial underclass".
"There are parts of our country where we have people who have not worked for two generations and whose children do not expect to work," Sir John is reported as saying.
Mr Cameron said Sir John was "absolutely right to make these points".
He said he was not satisfied with the situation and that was why he wanted another five years in office to follow through on reforms to welfare and education.
