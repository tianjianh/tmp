A 17-year-old man has also been arrested in connection with the incident.
Ms Price was driving her red Nissan Pulsar northbound on the A77 when it was involved in the crash with a Volkswagen Golf at about 21:35.
She died at the scene, while her 39-year-old female passenger was taken to Ayr Hospital with serious injuries. She was said to be in a stable condition.
Police said an Audi A3 car was also spotted close to the scene.

John Gribben was freed on bail. Their cases were continued for further investigation.
Tributes have been paid to Ms Price, who was a member of the Dunaskin Doon brass band.
A post on the band's facebook page said: "The Dunaskin family are heartbroken and devastated to hear of the passing of our dear friend and fellow band member, Joan Price, following a car accident last night.
