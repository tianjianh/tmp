The blaze erupted in a restaurant at Fleet services on the M3 at 22:30 GMT on 14 December. No-one was injured but the rear of the building was destroyed.
An investigation subsequently confirmed the blaze started in a coffee machine.
Operators Welcome Break said toilets and the forecourt were open, with food available from the Fleet North site.
It said a temporary Starbucks outlet and a Harry Ramsden truck would also open later this month.
A temporary building will be erected in the truck park in spring to provide full facilities while the new building is built.
The entrance which survived the fire is being used to allow customers access over the bridge on the northbound site which was unaffected by the fire.
About 100 firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze and part of the M3 was closed for a time before it was brought under control in the early hours.
The footbridge which runs over Fleet services on the M3, named after BBC Radio 1's Scott Mills, was also closed due to smoke logging.
