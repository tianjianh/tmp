Flats to be knocked down and replaced in Caterham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twenty flats in need of repair are to be knocked down and replaced by new housing in a Â£7m move in Caterham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twelve of the 20 two-bedroom flats in Ninehams Gardens are privately owned by leaseholders, with the other eight owned by Tandridge District Council.
The council said it would try to buy out the leaseholders and replace the flats - built in 1946 - with 35 homes.
The authority said structural surveys had shown that rebuilding was the "most cost-effective option".
