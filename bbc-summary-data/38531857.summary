Paul Barton jailed for kidnap of nine-year-old in Norwich park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who snatched a nine-year-old girl in a park's play area has been given a three-year jail sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Barton, 33, of no fixed address, admitted kidnapping the girl as she played at Pointers Field, off George Pope Road, Norwich, in September.
The girl, who was dragged into a wooded area, managed to break away and escaped uninjured.
The crown court judge gave Barton a sexual harm prevention order, ruling he must serve at least half his sentence.

Sitting at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Mark Dennis told him he had been impressed by a letter written by Barton which he believed he had recognised what he had done and included a "genuine apology".
However, he said, he had some concerns which remained, and issued an order banning him from having contact with females under 16 or from working with children.
