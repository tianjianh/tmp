Winger Kazenga LuaLua is expected to be named among the substitutes once more after making his debut from the bench in the win over Reading last week.
Fulham striker Chris Martin is expected to feature again, after boss Slavisa Jokanvoic said the row with Derby about the on-loan player "is over".
Forwards Floyd Ayite and Neeskens Kebano are away at the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.
Rangers are looking to secure a fourth consecutive Championship win while Fulham have lost just one of their last seven league games.
The R's won the first west London derby of the season 2-1 at Loftus Road on 1 October, after the Whites missed two penalties.
QPR manager Ian Holloway told BBC Radio London:
"Losing so many games in a row forced my hand to be as brutal as I have been [with transfers].
"It is sometimes about clearing out things to get a freshness. The atmosphere here is one of optimism and the young players have helped with that.
"Our pitch is small and tight and Fulham are a fantastic test for us. We need to get around them and in their faces and try and carry on our momentum.
"Slavisa Jokanovic seemed to get no credit for what he did at Watford and no appreciation from them. Fulham's wage bill has gone backwards yet he has managed to hold it all together and play some wonderful football."
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic told BBC Radio London:
"We played well against QPR last time, created many opportunities and missed two penalties.
"At this moment we play with more confidence and have improved ourselves. We know how important it is for our fans.
"I have to be happy because we have created an identity. We are more solid but in football it is important to win the game.
"We want to play these kinds of games and, although it is not my first derby around the world, I am excited like our supporters."
