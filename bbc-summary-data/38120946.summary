Strikes from Shane Ferguson and Aiden O'Brien added to Smith's treble - but goals from Braintree's Michael Cheek and Jack Midson ensured it was not a straightforward victory for the hosts.
Braintree took an unlikely lead after 16 minutes when Cheek barged through the defence and fired past Jordan Archer from 20 yards.
But a minute later Millwall were level as Lee Gregory raced into the box to square for Smith, who gratefully poked home from six yards.
Smith squeezed in a volley at the back post to grab his second, before Ferguson drilled a low effort into the far corner in the 25th minute.
The visitors pulled one back through Midson when he pounced on Byron Webster's slip and broke through to curl past Archer at the near post.
But Smith completed his hat-trick with a tap-in before O'Brien scored late on to seal Millwall's progress.
