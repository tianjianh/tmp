Murray's first-round opponent, Serbia's Troicki, was fined for unsportsmanlike conduct after a rant at an umpire following his second-round defeat at this year's Wimbledon.
The draw for the mixed doubles, which Murray and Laura Robson took silver in in 2012, will be finalised on 9 August.
BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller:
At 35 in the world, and in a best-of-three-set match, Troicki is a dangerous first-round opponent - even though Murray has won all seven of their previous meetings.
His chief rival Djokovic has an even more perilous start against 2009 US Open champion Del Potro and could face Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarter-finals. Murray's projected opponent in the last eight is David Ferrer - and Kei Nishikori in the semi-finals.
The draw has been kind to Konta, Watson and Edmund, although Watson's opponent Peng Shuai was 27 in the world before missing 10 months through injury.
