You will, you will, you will: Committee debates price of a cuppa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The question of whether the Northern Ireland Assembly should adjourn or not is not the only matter causing division among parties at Stormont.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Social Development Committee are also divided on whether free hot beverages should be reinstated to their meetings.
Stewart Dickson of Alliance, said: "It might be helpful to have a cup of tea or coffee to commence the meeting."
TUV leader Jim Allister said he thought members would "survive without it".
"It costs Â£500 of taxpayers' money," he said.
Ulster Unionist Roy Beggs said: "It's not the biggest problem we face at the moment".
Members voted in favour of free beverages in future. Mr Allister was the only person who voted against.
