Portadown have signed experienced defender Kyle McVey as they bid to make an immediate return to the Premiership.

The 30-year-old former Coleraine and Linfield player was released by Ballymena earlier this month after a loan spell with Carrick Rangers.
"He's a warrior, dominant and a leader and that ticks everything we're looking for," said Ports boss Niall Currie.
"He has a top pedigree at the highest level and we can get some great years from him."
Portadown were relegated from the top flight in April and McVey's arrival follows the signing of veteran full-back Kyle Neill last week.
"We're over the moon to get Kyle on board, he is exactly what we need in the development of our two young centre backs that we will have," Currie told the club website.
"It was one meeting we had and I knew we both wanted this as soon as I left the meeting.
"He knows what is going to be needed next season and he will be a fantastic addition to our new squad."
