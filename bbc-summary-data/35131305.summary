Fardowsa Hassan, 13, was found by police in the early hours of Friday.
Her friends Abir Salah, 16, and Ahlam Salah, 15, have now also been traced by officers.
The Salah sisters were found at a separate address in Haringey to the one where Fardowsa was discovered.

Fardowsa's mother had said she thought her daughter could have been kidnapped and taken abroad. Speculative comparisons were made with four London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria earlier this year.
But Scotland Yard advised that none of the girls were believed to have left the London area.
