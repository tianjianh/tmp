[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberystwyth Marina dredged and layout reconfigured

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A marina in Ceredigion has been "significantly improved" with its layout revamped, following previous dredging work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
New pontoons have been installed at Aberystwyth Marina and others repositioned to upgrade its access and design.
It has increased the number of berths and created some larger ones.
The marina was also dredged and its security systems upgraded earlier this year.
The work comes as part of a Coastal Communities grant to the Marine Group to develop and improve its infrastructure, which began in September 2015.
