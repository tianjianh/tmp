Brian Graham: Hibs sign striker after Ross County exit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County will receive a small fee for the departed Brian Graham if the striker helps Hibernian win promotion this season after Saturday's transfer.

Graham's move came a day after Richard Foster left for St Johnstone.
Manager Jim McIntyre agreed to release them despite both having a year left on their contracts.
"I don't see many clubs paying money for a player in his 30's. Brian's coming up to that as well," he said of the 28-year-old.
"There will be a small fee if Hibernian get promoted.
"Quite frankly, Brian came and asked me 'can I go?' He's missing his wee girl and finding it tough because they're based in the central belt.
"I feel we've got good competition there and young Greg Morrison coming through who we feel has got an opportunity."
Foster made his debut for St Johnstone in Saturday's 4-2 defeat by Celtic, the former Aberdeen and Rangers right-back having already been in talks with the Perth club, who pushed through the deal following a series of injuries.
"Both players did fantastically well," McIntyre told BBC Scotland following his side's 2-0 win over Kilmarnock.
"They were involved in arguably the most successful season Ross County's had last year, so we wish them well."
McIntyre, who has Liam Boyce in a rich vein of form with five goals in two games and Craig Curran back to fitness after long-term injury, admitted not all decisions are entirely about football.
"You've got to sometimes look at the human side and try and help him out," he said of Graham.
"Sometimes, when a player comes and says that to you, he was not a regular starter for us, I've got to add that as well, although he played a good part here.
"In Richard's case, we've been playing him wide midfield.
"I signed a natural left back in the summer and I want a natural wide player, somebody that's used to playing that role."
Graham has signed a one-year contract with the option of a further year and made his debut for Neil Lennon's side as a substitute in their Championship win over St Mirren.
The striker, who spent a season in Dingwall after leaving Dundee United, had agreed to terminate his contract with County by mutual consent.
Graham said: "It's one of the top four clubs in Scotland with a great opportunity to go there and get promotion.
"I enjoyed Ross County, it's a great family club and obviously I won a cup there.
"Once I knew there was interest, I was very keen on working with Neil Lennon. He did exceptionally well at Celtic.
"I've been away from my wife and two children for long spells as well, so getting back down to be with them was additional motivation."
