Derby County have signed defender Curtis Davies from Hull City for an undisclosed fee.

The 32-year-old has agreed a two-year contract with the Rams and is the first signing by manager Gary Rowett.
Davies made 29 appearances for Hull last season as they were relegated from the Premier League.
"I believe, under this manager for a full season, the squad we've got is capable of promotion or at least the play-offs," he told the Derby website.
Davies was with Hull for four years, having previously played for Luton, West Brom, Aston Villa and Birmingham City.
He has played more than 460 games as a professional, scoring 26 goals.
"I believe that, at my age, people start thinking that you want to wind down and look for a bit of security but that is not the case with me; if I'd have wanted that, I would have stayed at Hull," he said.
"This is an opportunity for me to reinvigorate myself. I've enjoyed my time at Hull and there are a lot of people that I'm going to miss but I want to do the best for my career and I believe that is with Derby County."
The Rams finished ninth, 13 points outside the Championship play-off places, under Rowett, who was appointed manager in March following the sacking of Steve McClaren.
