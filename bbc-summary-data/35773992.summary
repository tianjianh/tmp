Queen 'Brexit' story: A shift in how the papers portray the royals?

"It's also the case," Sun editor-in-chief Tony Gallagher told the BBC, "that we knew much more than we published and that remains the case."
Any future revelations won't alter the complaint sitting in the press watchdog's in-tray.
"Queen backs Brexit" was a headline that stuck in the monarchical craw.
It wasn't supported, as far as the palace is concerned, by any of the quotes in the Sun article.
Before the Queen was in its sights, the tabloid had criticised Prince William for being work shy - an accusation echoed in other newspapers.
It's led some to question whether this signals the start of a shift in how the papers portray the royals.
The reality is more likely to be that recent coverage serves as a reminder of the media's complex relationship with the Windsors - a family which over time has been both praised and pilloried in print.
