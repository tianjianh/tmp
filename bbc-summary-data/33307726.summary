The male mallard, nicknamed Usain, had been carrying the bolt for several days at the RSPB nature reserve at Radipole Lake in Weymouth earlier this month.
He was picked up by Weymouth Wildlife Rescue which arranged treatment to have the bolt removed.
Usain - named after sprinter Usain Bolt - has made a full recovery and was released back into the wild on Sunday.
Piddle Valley Vets removed the bolt for free and offered Â£211 - the cost of the treatment - as a reward to catch the person responsible.
Weymouth Wildlife Rescue described the culprit as "absolutely heartless and cruel".
Derek Davey, from the group, said: "Usain is doing really well and it is great to see him back in the wild.
"We're no nearer knowing who did it, it's very hard to find the person unless someone actually saw them do it."
Anyone with information is being encouraged to contact police.
