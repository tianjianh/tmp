The visitors took the lead in the second half through Jack Sampson following an error from the home side.
But James Jennings pulled the hosts level eight minutes later when he latched onto Elliott Frear's free-kick.
Clough broke Macclesfield hearts in the third minute of added time when he found the net from close range to keep Rovers on top of the National League.
Forest Green boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"I thought we should have scored four or five in the first half from set-plays, but we just needed to be more ruthless in front of goal.
"Macclesfield are a good side hanging around the play-offs so it's a massive win for us and caps off a fantastic week.
"There's unbelievable togetherness here and it's showed with the way we're playing this year. Let's just hope it continues to the end.
"We've got a tough month ahead but let's enjoy these times because we've won six out of six in January - enjoy it while we can and look forward to February."
