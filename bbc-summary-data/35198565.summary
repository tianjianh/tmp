BEMs include 96-year-old Lena Charles from Blaengarw, Bridgend, who still organises tea dances and conducts Sunday services in the local chapel.
She was a member of Women's Royal Voluntary Service for more than 40 years and involved in entertaining children from Chernobyl on annual holidays.
"It means quite a lot to me - I never thought for one minute I'd be recognised," she said.
Another recipient with decades of service is Georgina Jones, 92, who was a church organist at Dolwyddelan in the Conwy Valley for 75 years.
"I've been in the church all my life, playing in three or four services on Sundays - the church was my life," she said.
Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said: "These honours recognise the achievements and service of extraordinary Welsh people at home and around the world.
"From our outstanding public figures to those silently serving their communities, they are selected for their dedication, commitment and tireless work in helping to improve the lives of others."
Dame Sian said she was "completely overwhelmed" when she heard about her honour.
"It wasn't anything I'd been thinking of, especially now as I'm really, really busy and I go from play to play," she told the BBC.
"It's a great honour and one I truly wasn't expecting. It's terribly nice - there's always a little part of you that says 'why me, why now'? It doesn't do to say that out loud because someone is sure to say you've got to give it back and I don't want to do that really!"
Dame Sian was born in Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen, Neath Port Talbot, and won a speech award at the National Eisteddfod as a child. She went to Pontardawe Grammar School and Cardiff University before studying drama in London.
She wowed critics as Hedda Gabler on stage in 1957 and had a sometimes tempestuous 20 year marriage to fellow actor Peter O'Toole.
The couple acted together including on films Under Milk Wood and Goodbye, Mr Chips.
Her TV career took off as Emmeline Pankhurst in suffragette drama Shoulder to Shoulder, before winning a best actress Bafta in 1977 for the memorable role of scheming Livia, mother of emperor Tiberius, in the BBC drama series I, Claudius.
Dame Sian has also appeared in West End and Broadway musicals, including Pal Joey, Marlene and Cabaret and as Reverend Mother in sci-fi film Dune.
Awarded the CBE in 2000, the actress now keeps "really, really busy" with stage work, including a recent six months tour of The Importance of Being Earnest.
Dame Sian also appeared in a Christmas edition of The Archers for their version of Calendar Girls, after appearing in the original stage production.
The actress also returned to west Wales for the BBC Wales ancestry series Coming Home and was "stunned" to find her great-great-grandfather had fought at the Battle of Waterloo.
