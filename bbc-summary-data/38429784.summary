[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side, who were beaten 1-0 last Monday, started well as Dan Fitchett's fizzing effort went narrowly wide, while Alan Julian's fantastic save denied Bedsente Gomis.
Sutton spurned further chances through Bradley Hudson-Odoi and Roarie Deacon but were in front at the interval when Maxime Biamou headed home a free-kick in the dying seconds of the half.
And Sutton sealed all three points shortly after the hour mark when Hudson-Odoi fired past Julian following a scramble from a corner.
