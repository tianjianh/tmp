[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Netherlands' bid to qualify for Euro 2016 ended in failure as Robin van Persie scored an own goal in a home defeat by the 10-man Czech Republic.

The Dutch needed to win and for Iceland to beat Turkey to earn a play-off spot, but Van Persie's error saw them go 3-0 down despite Mark Suchy seeing red.
Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Van Persie replied to goals from Pavel Kaderabek and Josef Sural but instead it was Turkey who secured third place.
Fatih Terim's side beat Iceland 1-0.
Turkey had Gokhan Tore dismissed in the 78th minute as their match appeared to be heading for a draw, but Selcuk Inan's last-minute goal saw them claim a dramatic victory.
That result means Turkey qualify for next summer's tournament in France as the highest ranked third-placed team out of all nine qualifying groups.
Ukraine and Norway both finished third in their respective groups and had more points than Turkey.
But results against the sides finishing bottom in their respective groups do not count - leaving Turkey with the most points.
"As a country we really needed this win to feel happy, even for a few hours maybe," said Terim.
"We are so happy to have offered some happiness to our people."
Netherlands coach Danny Blind took over at the start of July after Guus Hiddink left after 10 months in the position.
He has lost three of his four matches in charge but says he has "no intention" of stepping down.
"I'm going to carry on with my work because I'm under contract until 2018 and I believe in this team," Blind added.
"I haven't achieved my goal. The aim was to qualify automatically or via the play-offs and I haven't done that.
"Am I the one to blame? I now have to analyse that. The results weren't good."
Against the Czechs, Van Persie's cushioned header past his own goalkeeper was the low point - and seemed to spark a reaction from the home side as they scored twice in quick succession afterwards.
But they still failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage, with Suchy having been dismissed for a last-man tackle on Manchester United forward Memphis Depay late in the first half.
The Netherlands, who finished third at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, were crowned European champions in 1988 and were third in 1992, 2000 and 2004.
The last time they failed to qualify for a major tournament was the 2002 World Cup. Before that, they were absent from the 1982 and 1986 tournaments and from the 1984 European Championship.
