US concerts by Janet Jackson and Lady Antebellum have been cancelled following a stage collapse that killed five people in Indiana at the weekend.

Jackson had been due to perform at the state fair on Wednesday while the country group were set for Friday.
Organisers said a Maroon 5 and Train show planned for Thursday will now move to the nearby Conseco Fieldhouse, with proceeds going to a remembrance fund.
The stage collapsed on Saturday after strong winds blew its rigging over.
About 45 other people were injured while 12,000 concert-goers awaited the start of a concert by country group Sugarland.
Investigators have put incident down to unforeseeable and isolated high winds, but have launched a further inquiry.
On their website, Lady Antebellum said it had been a "difficult decision" to cancel their show.
The group tweeted: "We're so sorry to cancel this Friday's show, our thoughts are with Indy."
Jackson also wrote on Twitter : "Heartbroken. Prayers and love to Indiana."
Organisers said tickets previously purchased for the Maroon 5 and Train show will be honoured at the new venue where a number of stage, security and restaurant staff are volunteering to make the concert possible.
All proceeds will benefit the Indiana State Fair Remembrance Fund.
The fair reopened on Monday with a memorial service to honour the victims of the collapse.
