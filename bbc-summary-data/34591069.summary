The attack happened in Southend, Essex, on Monday.
The couple were walking home with four takeaway dishes, which cost Â£13.90, when they were stopped by two men who demanded money before assaulting them and making off with the food.
Essex Police said the pair were left "badly shaken" but did not need medical treatment following the attack.
The attack took place in an alleyway between Guildford Road and Prittlewell Street, said police.
"The thieves initially demanded cash but when the husband resisted he was assaulted. The thieves then grabbed the bag of food and fled," said Det Con Richard Siggers.
"We want to hear from any witnesses or anyone with information about the robbers.
"We are especially keen to trace a couple in their 60s who were walking a white dog and passed the victims shortly before the robbery," he added.
The attackers were in their early 20s, with one about 6ft (1.8m) tall and the other 5ft 5in (1.65m).
One was wearing a black jacket and had a black scarf pulled over his face, and the other was wearing blue jeans and a black hooded top, detectives said.
