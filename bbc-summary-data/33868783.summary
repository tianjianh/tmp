Norwich bypass costs rise by £29m

The cost of a planned bypass in Norwich has risen by £29m.

The northern distributor road (NDR) is planned to run from Postwick on the A47 and circumvent the east and north of the city, to connect with the A1067.
Norfolk County Council says delays and increased outlay for environmental factors have raised the cost to £178m.
It has asked the government to pay £15m and will propose paying half of the shortfall itself, at a council meeting on 2 September.
The council says the previous budget of £148m was "based on 2013 prices", and that "construction cost inflation and unavoidable design changes" had bumped up the price.
"The rise in price is largely due to delays as central government reviewed all major infrastructure projects in the early years of the coalition government," the council said.
"To secure development consent, higher and more costly standards are now required in the design of drainage systems, wildlife protection, landscaping and environmental measures.
"These include an additional £1m to be spent on bat barns and crossings."
The project, which opponents say will not solve traffic problems but will "damage the quality of life" for local people, was granted development consent in June.
George Nobbs, Labour leader of Norfolk County Council, said: "It's hugely disappointing that delays beyond our control have caused increased costs and I think it's right that we press the government to do what's right by Norfolk and meet us half way."
A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: "We are currently considering an application from Norfolk County Council and a decision will be made in due course."
