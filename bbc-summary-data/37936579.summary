[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man bought weapons because they 'looked cool'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A businessman who bought three stun guns and 50 extendable batons on an internet auction site has been remanded in custody.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evaldas Vaicekauskas was arrested after Border Force officers intercepted a package from China that he had bought on eBay.
The 23-year-old claimed he had no intention of selling on the weapons and had only bought them because they "looked cool".
He will be sentenced in December.
Dundee Sheriff Court was shown one of the stun guns, which are hidden in torches.
The court was told that the torch section was "fully functional, as opposed to being a stun gun disguised as a torch."
Because of their dual use, the stun guns did not meet the criteria for a mandatory minimum five-year prison sentence under the Firearms Act.
Depute fiscal Eilidh Robertson told the court: "The outside of the package described the contents as "tools", but when the package was opened it was found to contain 50 extendable friction lock batons, each contained within their own holder.
"Within his home address three stun guns were found."
Vaicekauskas told police that he had bought the stun guns on ebay for Â£12 each.
The offences took place at his home in Arbroath and at his business address in Dundee.
Vaicekauskas admitted being concerned in the importation of prohibited goods.
He also admitted a charge under the Firearms Act relating to the stun guns.
Defence solicitor Lee Quimseh said: "My instructions are that there was no intention to sell.
"He simply purchased them because he thought they looked cool and no other reason."
Sheriff Alastair Brown deferred sentence until December and remanded Vaicekauskas in custody.
He said: "The only conceivable inference for importing 50 weapons is an intention to supply to other people.
"Those who import weapons with what appears to be a commercial motivation can expect no sympathy from this court."
