Adult social care outlook 'bleak', warns think tank

The future for adult social care services in England "looks bleak", a think tank has warned.

Chancellor George Osborne announced measures in his Spending Review that would lead to a rise in care budgets.
But the International Longevity Centre said that would only "paper over the cracks" and suggested 1.8 million people had unmet needs for care.
A government spokesman said local authorities had access to an extra ??3.5bn to provide more care.
In last month's spending review, Mr Osborne said he was protecting social care budgets by allowing local authorities to raise council tax by 2% and increasing the amount of money available for the Better Care Fund, a joint pot of money used by councils and the NHS to support care services.
The report by ILC-UK said data from 326 councils indicated that the areas with the highest concentrations of elderly people would be the least able to raise extra funds.
It said the number of over-80s had risen by 800,000 in the last decade.
The report said that 1.86 million people over the age of 50 in England had unmet care needs in 2012/13, a rise of 7% since 2006/07.
Ben Franklin, ILC-UK's head of economics of an ageing society, said: "The future for adult social care looks bleak.
"The social care settlement will be insufficient to meet the growing care needs of an ageing population and does little more than paper over the cracks which many of those who are in need of care are already falling through.
"While some will be able to rely on family to support their needs, increased prevalence of unpaid caring may have adverse consequences for those providing support, for the economy as a whole due to reduced employment, and without additional investment may even lead to an erosion in the quality of care provided."
Caroline Abrahams, Age UK's charity director, said the report reinforced a consensus of experts that government measures would not halt a decline in social care.
"As such it is a wake-up call for the public, women especially, because they make up most family carers.
"Over the last 20 years, the need to provide a system of childcare has been first recognised and then at least partially met, in order to enable more women to work and support decent family incomes," she said.
"Now many of those same women, or sometimes their mothers, could find they have to leave work to care for their own ageing parents, because we are effectively dismantling our system of social care.
Council chiefs, NHS managers and care bosses wrote to the chancellor earlier this month saying that vital care services remained at risk.
