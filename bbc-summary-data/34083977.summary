It comes with spending on so-called "out-of-region placements" forecast to run more than Â£600,000 over budget.
The social work department says it's already working to identify community-based provision wherever possible.
However, it added that establishing appropriate support for such services would take time.
It is hoped the move could replicate the success of a strategy put in place for "looked after kids" which is on course to deliver savings of almost Â£1m.
Jim Dempster, who chairs the social work committee, insisted it was in everyone's interest to tackle the issue.
"For the well-being of the children it is absolutely crucial that they are back in the region - they're amongst people they know in an environment they are familiar with," he said.
"And for us it represents a financial saving.
"That is just a win-win situation."
