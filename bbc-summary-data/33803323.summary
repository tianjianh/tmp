Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) will combine with the beverage maker's German subsidiary (CCEAG) and Coca-Cola Iberian Partners (CCIP).
The company will be called Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP) and will generate about $12.6bn per year.
It hopes to cut costs of up to $375m (??242m) within three years.
The deal is structured as a so-called tax inversion, with CCE moving its corporate headquarters from Atlanta to London, so it can cut exposure to higher US taxes.
Muhtar Kent, Coke's Chief Executive said, "It's a major milestone and major transaction that will benefit all parties involved."
CEE shareholders will own 48% of the new company, CCIP will have 34%, while  Coca-Cola Co. will hold 18%.
The world's largest soft drinks maker has reduced its bottle sizes as customers cut back on the amount of fizzy drinks they consume.
