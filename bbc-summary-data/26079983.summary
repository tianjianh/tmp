[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trevor Gray, 49, of Watnall, Nottinghamshire was found not guilty at Birmingham Crown Court of the rape of a 43-year-old woman.
The former detective sergeant was sentenced to eight years in jail in 2012 but the verdict was quashed in 2013.
A jury cleared Mr Gray in a unanimous verdict after the four-day retrial.
The former detective, who had 25 years experience with the force, was accused of rape by a woman in July 2011.
He was suspended and subsequently dismissed from Nottinghamshire Police.
Det Supt Jackie Alexander of Nottinghamshire Police said: "We take any report of sexual assault and rape extremely seriously and have a duty to investigate such allegations, whoever they are made against.
"The CPS considered it appropriate for this case to be prosecuted through the criminal justice system and having been presented to a jury over four days they have considered the evidence and made a decision to acquit Trevor Gray.
"At this stage it would be inappropriate to comment further pending the outcome of his appeal to be reinstated and today's acquittal."
