Parents from De La Salle College in west Belfast have said they are disappointed with how the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) has responded to ongoing issues at the school.

A group of parents held talks with CCMS and the school's associate principal, Imelda Jordan, on Wednesday evening.
They said they were happy with Ms Jordan's reaction to the problems, but "disgusted" with that of the Catholic education authority.
Chairperson of the Concerned Parent's Committee, Gerry Carroll, expressed frustration at the continued lack of clarity after the meeting with CCMS.
"They're the people who run the show, aren't they? Is there someone else we should go to for information?
"I thought CCMS were the top dogs in all of this. Maybe they're not."
CCMS said it is committed to continuing dialogue with the school.
CEO Jim Clarke said the body was "struck by the genuine concerns expressed by the parents on the impact of the current situation in the school on their children".
He added:  "We all agreed that the education needs and welfare must be paramount for everyone involved."
The group of parents is due to meet the Children's Commissioner on Thursday.
On Tuesday, teachers from the largest union at the school voted for strike action.
In a ballot, 71% of the school's Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) members who returned their ballots voted for industrial action "up to and including strike action".
