A yellow "be aware" warning has been issued and covers the period from 16:00 Friday to 10:00 Saturday.
The Met Office said the conditions would mostly affect high ground, but snow could fall to lower levels during Friday night.
The warning follows high winds and heavy rain during Storms Abigail and Barney.
Snow has fallen on some of Scotland's hills and mountains already this year, and last week there were snowfalls in parts of Aberdeenshire and also the Highlands, including Aviemore.
The latest weather warning has been issued for the Western Isles, Highlands, Orkney, Moray, Aberdeenshire, Tayside, Fife and parts of the Borders.
The Met Office said: "The snow will mainly affect high ground at first but will fall to lower levels on Friday night. 1-4 cm is likely at some lower levels but with 5-10 cm above 150m, with drifting in the strong to gale force north or north westerly winds.
"Indeed severe gales with gusts to 60mph could bring a short period of blizzard conditions to the highest routes later on Friday evening and overnight.
"The more persistent snow and strong winds will have cleared by Saturday morning but ice will be an additional hazard by then, particularly for higher level routes."
The Met Office added that weather was a mark of a "major, but temporary change" following an "exceptionally mild" first half of November.
