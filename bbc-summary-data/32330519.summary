Fire closes Inverness city centre overnight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An investigation is under way following a major fire which closed the centre of Inverness until the early hours of the morning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No-one was injured in the blaze above the M&Co shop in the city's Academy Street.
Emergency services were alerted to the fire at about 22:00 on Wednesday.
Huge plumes of smoke could be seen for miles around. Nine fire vehicles were at the scene including two height appliances.
It took crews three hours to prevent the blaze from spreading to neighbouring shops and bars.
At one point, flames could be seen coming through the roof of the building, which is one of the oldest in the city centre street.
