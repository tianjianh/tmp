[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Palace had struggled to break down the much-changed Ipswich side until McArthur's driving run and curling finish made it 1-0 after 76 minutes.
Jason Lokilo smashed the post before McArthur found the top corner from just inside the area to double the lead.
Manchester City loanee Bersant Celina scored a consolation for Ipswich with a close-range finish in added time.
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy made 11 changes to his side who have won all four of their opening league fixtures and the young Tractor Boys did well to keep their Premier League opposition at bay for the majority of the tie.
When their defences were breached, goalkeeper Dean Gerken was on hand to keep the hosts out, making excellent stops from Yohan Cabaye, Sullay Kaikai and Lokilo to frustrate the home crowd.
However, it was McArthur who eventually made the difference, finding the top corner with two excellent finishes with either foot.
The lively Celina halved the deficit from Ben Morris' cross, but Palace held on to give former Ajax manager De Boer his maiden win.
