The Welsh county are two points behind Gloucestershire after losing to them on Sunday but have a better run-rate.
"It's a position we'd take if someone had offered it at the start of the competition," said Glamorgan head coach Robert Croft.
Glamorgan won the first match between the two sides in 2016 by five wickets in Cardiff.
"We recognise the meat of the tournament is ahead of us and we're grateful for what we've achieved so far, but it doesn't mean a whole heap until we finish the job off," added Croft.
Hampshire, currently with just one win from eight completed matches, have captain James Vince away on England Test duty, while opener Michael Carberry faces further tests on a mystery illness.
The home side go into the match straight from a drawn Championship fixture away to Warwickshire, while they face Sussex in Hove in the T20 on Friday.
Glamorgan are likely to be unchanged, with batsman-wicket-keeper Chris Cooke still being assessed after injections to try to solve a back problem.
Hampshire (from): Weatherley, Alsop, Wheater, Dawson, Ervine (capt), Afridi, Goodwin, McManus, Andrew, Wheal, Best, Taylor, Griffiths.
Glamorgan (from): Lloyd, Wallace, Ingram, Rudolph, Donald, Wagg, Meschede, van der Gugten, Cosker, Hogan, Tait, Morgan.
