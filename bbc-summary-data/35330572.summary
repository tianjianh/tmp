[SN]TITLE[SN]
Charlton Athletic 1-1 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling Charlton's winless run in the Championship extended to 11 matches following a draw at home to Blackburn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Addicks went ahead on the half hour when Johann Berg Gudmundsson's free-kick fell to Harry Lennon, whose effort deflected past Jason Steele.
But Rovers levelled on the stroke of half-time when Jordan Rhodes nodded in Adam Henley's right-wing cross.
Craig Conway and Shane Duffy had headed chances for Rovers after the break while Igor Vetokele tested Steele.
Charlton, who conceded a total of 11 goals in their two previous Championship games, remain four points from safety.
Lennon's second goal for the club, and the first of Jose Riga's second spell as head coach, opened the scoring.
However, Rhodes brought the away side level with his first goal in 10 league games, and Blackburn's second in seven.
Rhodes was inches away from getting on the end of Hope Akpan's cross for a late winner before Steele bravely cleared with his head as Reza Ghoochannejhad looked to pounce on a loose ball.
Blackburn have not won in the Championship for seven games, but Paul Lambert's side are six points above the bottom three.
Addicks fans staged a protest aimed at owner Roland Duchatelet outside the boardroom at The Valley after the match.
Charlton head coach Jose Riga:

"The way the players, my squad, behaved, they worked hard to get that result. I'm happy, although I would have preferred a win.
"I'm just focused on the sporting mission. Surviving is the priority and this is a tough challenge.
"We receive support from the fans and that's the most important thing.
"Last time as manager I found out about the fans of Charlton and they want the same as I want - to stay up."
Blackburn manager Paul Lambert:
"We started the game so well. Charlton scored with their first attack of note and then we came back.
"The atmosphere was waiting to turn pretty bad but that's what happens when supporters don't like what they think is happening at their club."
On transfer speculation surrounding Jordan Rhodes: "It's the same situation as it was when I first came to the club.
"I've not heard anything. I chat with the chief executive and until someone tells me different then it's the same situation."
