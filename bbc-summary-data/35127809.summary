[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost 350 pupils and teachers at an Angus primary school are off sick with the winter vomiting bug.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Only a quarter of pupils at Langlands Primary in Forfar attended class on Thursday. Thirteen teachers were also absent.
There are currently no plans to close the school due to the norovirus outbreak.
Advice on the bug has been sent to parents, with the school's end of term next Tuesday.
A statement from the school said: "We are working with partner agencies and would only close the school on medical grounds if asked to do so by public health officials.
"We are closely monitoring the situation and the school remains open and will open tomorrow (Friday) morning. Should there be any changes to this information, we will notify parents and carers directly."
There are 428 children on the roll and a further 80 pre-school youngsters attend the school.
The school said 329 children and 13 teachers were absent on Thursday.
Norovirus, which causes diarrhoea and vomiting, is one of the most common stomach bugs in the UK.
