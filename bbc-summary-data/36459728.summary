She was greeted with music and poetry as she arrived at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay at about 11:30 BST on Tuesday.
The Only Boys Aloud choir, harpist Anne Denholm and the National Youth Choir of Wales were among the performers.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said all AMs had a duty to work together to "deliver for the people we serve".
Addressing politicians in the Senedd as she opened the fifth Welsh Assembly, the Queen said the institution was "an achievement in which all who care about Wales can take pride".
"Your responsibilities are great and the expectations are high, but I have no doubt you will continue to succeed as you discharge these new duties," she said.
"I wish you every success as you prepare to meet the challenges of these constitutional changes, and to help realise the potential of the assembly for future generations."
First Minister Carwyn Jones emphasised that "no single party" had a majority in the assembly chamber.
"No individual has a monopoly on good ideas and no person should feel excluded from out work," he said.
"It's required of us all, a duty, to be true to our values and to respect the mandate on which we were elected but ultimately to work together.
"To discuss, to compromise and to act in a respectful way that allows us all, collectively, to deliver for the people we serve."
The Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall also attended the royal opening.
Children and young people from a range of schools and organisations across Wales gathered on the steps of the Senedd to welcome them.
As it happened: Royal opening of the Welsh Assembly
A new poem by the National Poet of Wales, Ifor ap Glyn was also presented to mark the Queen's 90th birthday.
Presiding Officer Elin Jones urged AMs to show "passion in our debate, prudence in conciliation".
"We have been elected by the people of this country, and we commit to being their voice and to providing the standard of service and leadership they deserve and demand of us," she added.
The mace was carried into the Senedd chamber by assembly security manager Chetan Patel, before Ms Jones officially welcomes the royal visitors.
A large screen outside the Senedd relayed proceedings to members of the public, who were invited inside for free Welsh cakes and tours of the building after the ceremony.
Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall later attended a reception with AMs at the Wales Millennium Centre, and viewed the field of poppies outside its entrance which commemorates soldiers who died in World War One.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh also opened a new Â£44m brain research centre at Cardiff University.
