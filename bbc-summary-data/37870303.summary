World Cricket League Four: Relegated Jersey beat Italy as father and son make history

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jersey's World League Four campaign ended with victory over Italy, as Tony and Harrison Carlyon became the first father and son to play international cricket together for the island.

Jersey won by 42 runs in the fifth-place play-off game, after narrowly beating hosts and eventual tournament winners the USA the day before.
But losses to Oman, Denmark and Bermuda meant relegation from the division.
Jersey made 250-6 from their 50 overs before bowling out Italy for 208.
Injuries in the Jersey squad saw 46-year-old team manager Tony Carlyon named in the side alongside his 15-year-old son Harrison.
"I never thought that was going to happen to be honest," Carlyon senior told BBC Radio Jersey.
"I think with USA yesterday, there was a lot given for that victory and to come back under these circumstances with people out on their feet and four guys already injured, to win as easily as that was great."
Batting first, a hundred partnership between openers Peter Gough (65) and Harrison Carlyon (32) gave the island side a good start.
Former Jersey all-rounder Tony Carlyon only managed a scratchy nine, but later bowled a tight seven-over spell for 24.
Man-of-the-match Corey Bisson blasted 63 from 47 balls as Jersey posted 250-6.
In reply, a steady start from Italy was derailed by two wickets in the seventh and eighth overs, off-spinner Elliot Miles claiming the second on his way to 3-45.
Italy's captain Damian Crowley took his side past 100 before he was bowled by Rob McBey for 39 in the 25th over.
Four wickets for stand-in captain Charles Perchard took the momentum out of the Italy innings, and they were eventually bowled out for 208.
Both sixth-placed Italy and fifth-placed Jersey will now compete alongside Guernsey in World League Five, with the remaining five places in that tournament still to be decided.
