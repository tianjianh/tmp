Moult's contribution to a 4-2 victory at Fir Park included a 13-minute hat-trick and took his tally to to seven for the season.
"He's scored a fantastic four goals today," McGhee told BBC Scotland.
"We'll see if he can get 20 by Christmas. That would be a fantastic target but it'll be difficult."
Englishman Moult said he was "absolutely buzzing" after becoming the first player to score four goals in a match for Motherwell since Stevie Kirk over 25 years ago.

"13 is lucky for some eh!" he told BBC Scotland. "It means everything to me and hopefully I can better that and get a few more."
Moult scored 18 times for the Fir Park club last season, but it was the 24-year-old's first start of this campaign after shaking off a troublesome groin injury.
The former Wrexham man scored two low finishes in the box as well as a header and a penalty kick. He also had another first-half header disallowed for offside.
"It shows what I can do - a little bit of everything," said Moult, who joined Motherwell in the summer of 2015.

"The first one I scored wasn't off-side apparently so maybe it should have been five!
"I'm thankful for the gaffer for putting me in the team today and hopefully I've repaid him with the goals.
"As soon as the final whistle went I was after the ball. All the boys have put a message on it so I'll be busy tonight reading that."
