The environmental watchdog said it received a large number of complaints to its pollution hotline after a fault caused high-pressure steam venting.
The noise stopped when the fault, which took several hours to investigate, was fixed at about 23.00.
Sepa said its inspectors would be following up the incident with Ineos.
Scott Cumming, 42, who lives in Linlithgow, about seven miles away from the site, said: "It was a bit like the noise from an aircraft landing or taking off.
"It went on for literally hours. I wrote an email to Ineos asking if they could give an explanation but I haven't had a reply from them."
A post on the Sepa Facebook page read: "We're aware of a very loud noise in Grangemouth last night, which caused significant disturbance and public complaints in the wider area.
"This was caused by high pressure steam venting from the Ineos Power Station at Grangemouth, due to a fault.
"It took a numbers of hours to investigate and correct. The noise ceased when it was corrected at 11pm.
"We'll be following the incident up with Ineos."
