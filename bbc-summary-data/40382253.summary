[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concerns are growing for a priest who has been missing from a church in Edinburgh since Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Father Martin Xavier Vazhachira, from the St John The Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Corstorphine, was last seen there at about 13:00.
Police said the 33-year-old had been in Edinburgh since October last year and liked to take walks around the Corstorphine Hill area.
Officers said concern was now growing for his welfare.
Father Vazhachira was described as Indian, about 5ft 5ins tall with a medium build.
He has short, black, slightly curly hair and a clean shaven face.
Insp Craig Rogerson said: "Father Vazhachira has been in Edinburgh since October last year and knows the Corstorphine area fairly well, however, we are also exploring whether he may have ventured further afield and so anyone with information as to his current whereabouts is asked to contact police immediately.
"I would also urge Father Vazhachira to get in touch with us, or with colleagues at the church, as soon as possible to let us know he is safe."
