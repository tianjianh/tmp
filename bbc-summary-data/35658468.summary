Marlborough town crier contest called-off due to lack of candidates

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A contest to find a new town crier for a market town has had to be called-off due to a lack of candidates.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The historic role was put up for grabs by Marlborough Town Council following the retirement of veteran crier Alfie Johnson after 21 years.
Despite a uniform, bell and added bonus of being the town's Ale Taster included in the job perks, the town council admitted it may have been "optimistic".
But town clerk Shelley Parker, said a man had come forward who was "perfect".
Although the role these days is "entirely ceremonial", Mr Johnson said it was important a crier was a "man of the people" and not pompous.
"We've had one in this town for 800 years since the charter of King John in 1204 and it's a tradition," he said.
"It's a thing you don't want to lose because once you lose these old fashioned things - it's gone forever."
Mark Wylie, a professional town crier from nearby Calne, agreed it would not "seem right" if the town did not have "someone striding around in their tights" shouting out the news.
Despite "lots and lots of interest" in the contest initially, the town council admitted that hopefuls may have been put off by the time commitment.
But Ms Parker said a gentleman "well known locally" had come forward who fitted the role perfectly if not the uniform.
"Our current town crier is a very different shape, he's smaller and rounder and the new crier is taller and thinner, so we're going to have to have a new uniform made," she said.
"As to the tights - there are britches but we wouldn't make them [town criers] wear them if they didn't want to."
