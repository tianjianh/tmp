Vintage jets will not be allowed to perform "high-energy aerobatics" over land at air shows after the Shoreham crash, regulators have said.

The Civil Aviation Authority said such planes would be "limited to flypasts", and all Hawker Hunter jets have been temporarily grounded.
At least 11 people died after a Hawker Hunter crashed into traffic on the A27 in West Sussex on Saturday.
Sussex Police have named another victim as Maurice Abrahams of Brighton.
Mr Abrahams' family released a tribute to the 76-year-old chauffeur, who was a former soldier and police officer.
"Maurice is a well-respected and loved father and husband," the statement said.
"He enjoyed his work chauffeuring his beloved Daimler car and he enjoyed gardening."
Meanwhile, the plane wreckage has been removed by crane and no further victims have been found, Sussex Police said.
Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry added: "However, until we have fully completed the search of what is an extensive scene, I must caution that there is still the possibility that we may discover evidence of further victims..."
Police have also said that more than 200 people have called in to report concerns for missing relatives or friends since the incident.
A spokesman for the CAA said the flying restrictions would remain in place until further notice, and it would be conducting "additional risk assessments on all forthcoming civil air displays".
Since the restrictions were announced a host of air shows have been forced to alter their schedules.
The regulator stressed that individual display pilots were only granted approval to fly "following a thorough test of their abilities".
Andrew Hill, the pilot of the crashed jet, has been put in medically-induced coma after being pulled from the wreckage.
The 51-year-old from Sandon, near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, suffered multiple injuries and is in a critical condition.
Mr Hill was set to fly the plane at the Battle of Britain 75th anniversary show in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, the Imperial War Museum (IWM) said.
A spokeswoman for the museum said the event would still take place on 19 and 20 September, but it would be "revised" following the tragedy.
Similarly, Dartmouth Royal Regatta in Devon - which features an air display - will go ahead from Thursday but the routine of a Strikemaster jet has been restricted.
Shoreham air crash: The victims
Meanwhile, the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA), which organises Shoreham Airshow, has defended the event's safety record.
"The team at Shoreham have many years of experience in running air shows throughout the UK and all aircraft have to be certificated and all pilots authorised by the CAA before they are allowed to undertake display routines at any air show," a spokesman said.
West Sussex coroner Penny Schofield warned that work to identify the victims would be a "slow and painstaking operation" as she appealed for the public's "patience and understanding".
She said it may take "several weeks" before all investigations were completed.
"The fire was so intense and the scale of the damage so vast, it means that we must very carefully remove the remains in a way that will lead to a formal identification," she added.
The A27 will need major repairs as a result of the impact of the crash, and is expected to be shut for several days.
Books of condolence have been opened and the flag is flying at half-mast at County Hall in Chichester.
Two of the victims were amateur footballers and the Football League has announced that a minute's silence will be observed prior to all Capital One Cup Round 2 matches on Tuesday and Wednesday as a mark of respect to all those who died.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has offered his condolences to those who have died.
He said: "The government is offering its full support to both the Civil Aviation Authority and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch to ensure everything possible is being done to find out what happened and ensure air displays take place safely and follow the highest standards."
Saturday's crash is the second incident at the Shoreham Airshow, one of the premier air shows in the UK, in recent years.
In September 2007 James Bond stuntman Brian Brown, 49, died when he crashed a World War Two Hurricane after carrying out an unplanned barrel roll at a re-enactment of the Battle of Britain.
