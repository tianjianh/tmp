Tom Wood: Northampton Saints 'have not become a bad team'

Northampton flanker Tom Wood says Saints have not "become a bad team" following a slow start to the season.

Saints, 10th in the Premiership, beat Scarlets in the European Champions Cup.
"We've still got some incredible players amongst our ranks - we've not become a bad team," said Wood.
"We've not quite had the start we wanted but in previous years we've got off to a flyer and fallen flat on our face in Europe or finished top of the league and not taken the trophy."
Jim Mallinder's side, who lost in last season's Premiership semi-final despite finishing top of the table, have only won one of their opening four league matches in 2015-16.
Since Saturday's victory over the Welsh side, Mallinder has ruled himself out of replacing Stuart Lancaster as England boss.
And with players coming back from the World Cup - including England's Wood, Wales wing George North plus new signing and South Africa legend Victor Matfield - Wood says there is reason to be optimistic.
"It's an awfully long season, we're very confident in what we've got, we've taken a few knocks so we're going to have to regroup and come out ready to play again next week," he told BBC Radio Northampton.
"We can't switch off now, it feels like the job's done at the minute but we've got to quickly get back on the horse and ready to go again because an away win now for us invaluable.
"It's still really early days, we know the potential we have now that we have all the internationals back and Victor turning up."
