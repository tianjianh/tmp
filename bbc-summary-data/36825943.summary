Tremors continue after the EU referendum

You know things are fast moving when you lose track of what day it is...

There was a point during the unprecedented political upheaval when I could not understand why the essentially viewed "This Week" was not on the BBC iPlayer to watch over breakfast. Then it dawned. Wrong dawn. Wrong day.
We hurtled into the referendum vote and what followed was a political earthquake of such magnitude the aftershocks keep on coming and they are big, damaging and wrecking political careers.
There was a frantic last two days of campaigning before the quake struck. In the East Midlands we were visited by George Osborne, Chris Grayling, Hilary Benn, and Boris Johnson.
All players when the political fault lines opened in the Tory government and the Labour Party in the extraordinary days which followed.
On the eve of the poll Boris Johnson was with Andrew Bridgen, the rebellious and outspoken local Tory MP and a "Brexiteer" before the word Brexit was invented. Part of what one opponent in his own party called "a self indulgent small rump."
Mr Bridgen called the result with confidence long ago despite all the pundit predictions that we would vote to remain. He said he had been out on the streets and knocking on doors talking to people. Doing what MPs are expected to do.
Mr Bridgen was also the first to publicly call for David Cameron to quit after a leave vote, three weeks before it happened. It is fair to say Mr Bridgen was also happy at George Osborne's defenestration from government. They will now be sharing the back benches.
Mr Bridgen did not see his preference for Prime Minister installed - first Boris Johnson and then Andrea Leadsom.
He wanted a Brexit leader and said the fact Mrs Leadsom caved in to unwelcome attacks from within her own party and the media was a bad day for the Tory party and a bad day for democracy, for there would be no contest for members to vote in.
Other Conservative party members we have spoken to welcomed the swift conclusion to the leadership race. Leigh Higgins who is the area chairman for Leicestershire and Rutland said most members understand it is absolutely in the national interest to have a new government with a strong direction to head in.
Of course those Cabinet members who lost their jobs, like Loughborough's Nicky Morgan and Broxtowe's Anna Soubry, will now have more time to talk to their members and constituents.
But it would be a mistake to assume they didn't because of their roles as Education Secretary and Business Minister respectively. Both have a reputation locally for being in touch with the people who actually vote.
Just look back at their Twitter feeds and see what they do at weekends. There is a lazy clichÃ© about the Westminster bubble and MPs not knowing about the real world.
Most MPs and their teams have a connection with those who vote, which we in the media underestimate at our peril. Labour's John Mann in Bassetlaw called the referendum vote right too. He regularly canvases opinions of local people.
He knew about the misgivings those in his Labour heartland have over immigration which affect the ability to get a job. "Listen to the voters" is his mantra, and then act on what they have to say.
Words echoed by Anna Soubry in one of her last days as minister when she told a meeting of the Midlands Engine that they should not ignore those who voted to leave the EU because they felt left behind - people who need help to get the skills needed to work.
Anna Soubry promises to speak out loudly from the back benches too. The new government will not have an easy ride because there will be two awkward squads and the parliamentary majority remains small.
Andrew Bridgen's side of the the party will watch hawk-like all things Brexit. Anna Soubry has said she will continue to to press her long-standing views on the positive benefits of immigration and the EU.
Labour meanwhile enter a heated summer of another leadership contest following the so-called coup which began in the early hours of a Sunday morning after the sacking of Hilary Benn.
I saw Vernon Coaker, the Gedling MP, resign his shadow cabinet post shortly after appearing on our Sunday Politics programme. He had a text message from Jeremy Corbyn asking him to call. He tried. He was on the phone for ages pacing up and down outside the BBC building in Nottingham.
But he could not get hold of him so had to leave a message on an answer phone. Another tale which perhaps backs up claims of a haphazard leadership the MPs are determined to depose.
Lilian Greenwood said she was undermined repeatedly by Jeremy Corbyn in her role as shadow transport secretary.
"It made me feel like I was wasting my time," she said.
"That my opinion didn't matter. And it made me miserable. I wasn't part of any coup. I didn't plan it.
"I didn't co-ordinate the timing of my resignation with anyone else. I just knew that I could not go on. Things were, and are, falling apart."
Labour members will have the final say. Members not voters. And that is the concern the Parliamentary Labour Party have had all along. They fear that the voters won't back Jeremy Corbyn. And without the voters any hopes of power and a chance to put into practice what they believe in cannot be achieved.
Expect more big tremors before the dust even starts to settle.
