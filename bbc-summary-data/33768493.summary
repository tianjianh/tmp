The hosts went close to opening the scoring, but Lee Molyneux's 35-yard free-kick came back off the post.
The game looked to be heading for extra-time, but Collins rose superbly to head home James Wallace's corner.
Victory gave Nigel Adkins his first win as Blades boss following Saturday's 4-0 drubbing at Gillingham.
