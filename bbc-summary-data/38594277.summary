The 24-year-old joined from Port Vale in 2014 after starting his career in non-league football.
He has scored six goals in 24 appearances for the Lilywhites so far this season.
"I know that they have asked the question and that got refuted pretty quickly," Preston boss Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"We don't want to do anything because Jordan is a good player with a bright future."
