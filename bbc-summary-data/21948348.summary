Ilkeston is one of three towns where a new station is "most likely" to be built, according to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin.
The proposed £5m railway station would form part of Northern Rail's Sheffield to Nottingham route, which includes Alfreton and Langley Mill.
A final decision is expected in May. If approved, the station could open in two years' time.
