Congestion in Glasgow blamed for drop in bus passengers

Congestion in Glasgow is behind an increase in bus journey times and an "alarming" drop in passenger numbers, a transport campaign group is warning.

Greener Journeys, which aims to promote bus and coach use, looked at the impact of congestion on bus travel in the UK.
It concluded that bus speeds in Glasgow were falling faster than anywhere else in the UK and services could be threatened if the trend continues.
Bus operator, First Glasgow, has now called for action to tackle congestion.
The Greener Journey's report said bus speeds in Glasgow were dropping by 15% per decade, compared to an average of 10% for the rest of the UK.
The report said that this had contributed to a 22% decline in passenger numbers across the Strathclyde area in the last decade.
Report author, Professor David Begg, a former chairman of the UK government's Commission for Integrated Transport, said that traffic congestion in Glasgow was a key factor behind the fall in bus speeds and passenger numbers.
"If you combine falling bus speeds with relatively cheap subsidised competition from an impressive urban rail network and cheap and abundant public car parking, it explains why Glasgow has experienced an alarming decline in bus patronage over the past decade," he said.
"Traffic congestion is a disease which, left unchecked, will destroy the bus sector.
"This is a dire and sensational prediction, but the evidence uncovered in this research leads to no other conclusion."
Prof Begg, who has also served as a board member of First Glasgow's parent firm, First Group, added: "Urgent action is required from industry, local government and Whitehall to reduce people's reliance on cars and encourage more sustainable modes of transport."
The report also claimed that if journey times continue to decline at the current rate, bus passenger numbers will drop by between 10% and 14% every 10 years.
First Glasgow said congestion leads to increased operating costs which, in turn, leads to increased fares, further deterring passengers.
The firm's interim managing director, Alex Perry, said: "This report paints a stark picture for bus transport in Glasgow but we believe that by working with our partners and stakeholders in the city to reduce journey times we can turn things around.
"Sadly, significant falls in bus patronage are often portrayed as being primarily due to the actions of the bus operators.
"However, this report lays bare the significant impact congestion has on our city and on bus passengers."
Glasgow City Council said it was "committed" to making public transport more attractive.
Bailie Elaine McDougall, the council's executive member for transport, said: "Glasgow has been very proactive in promoting bus priority and continues to work positively with both the operators and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport.
"Our city centre transport strategy recognises the Renfield Street-Union Street corridor as being a key bus route through the city centre and we are about to start work to introduce traffic management measures which will reduce congestion and improve the flow of buses on this busy city centre street."
Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: "Glasgow could have a high quality, affordable public transport system, cleaner air, good journey times and safety for people walking and cycling, but we need to look to the many other European countries which have achieved all of this for years.
"Public transport must be seen as a public service, deserving public investment and regulation, instead of a free market system which fails so many people.
"Making neighbourhoods easier to get about by walking, cycling and public transport can transform congested, polluted and neglected spaces into healthier, fairer and more vibrant places to live."
