It is the Welsh club's first major cup final in their 100 year history and victory will see them gain a place in Europe next season.
The Swans have enjoyed a remarkable rise over the last 10 years, but how much do you know about Wales' only Premier League club?
David Dulin gives a quick guide to Swansea City.
- Swansea Town FC was formed 1912 and joined the Football League in 1921.
- The club adopted the same all-white strip as Swansea RFC when formed but have since on occasions used black shorts and socks as part of the home kit.
- The club's nickname is the Swans or the Jacks. The reason behind the latter is not clear, but there are two possible origins: One is the reputation of local seamen "Jack Tars" in the early 19th Century, while the other is the black retriever dog called Swansea Jack who rescued no fewer than 27 people from drowning in the River Tawe and Swansea Docks during the 1930s.
- The club became Swansea City in 1971 when the town was granted city status.
- After having to apply for re-election to the league in 1975, the Swans secured successive promotions under player-manager John Toshack in 1978 and 1979.
- The Swans reached the old Division One in 1981 and the following season remained in the top six all campaign before successive relegations followed.
- Swansea City were formally wound up on 20 December 1985. But a group of directors put together a rescue package and permission was granted for the club to continue fixtures.
- During the 2001/02 season the club found itself facing bankruptcy and it took a supporters' buyout of controversial Australian businessman Tony Petty to rescue the Swans.
- The club narrowly avoided relegation from the Football League on the final day of the 2002/03 season but have not looked back since.
- Promotion to League One came in 2005 along with the switch from their Vetch Field home to the Liberty Stadium.
- In 2008, the Swans reached the Championship and in 2011 became the first Welsh club to reach the Premier League.
- This is the club's centenary this season.
- Swansea's all-time top goal scorer is Ivor Allchurch, who found the net 166 times in two spells for the club, between 1949-58 and 1965-68.
- Allchurch is also the club's most capped Wales player, winning 68 caps.
- The record transfer fee paid is Â£5.5m to Valencia for Pablo Hernandez in August 2012
- The record transfer fee received is Â£15m from Liverpool for Joe Allen in August 2012.
The club's first appearance at the old Wembley came in 1994 when they won the Autoglass Trophy - a competition for teams in the lower divisions of the Football League. They won the same competition, albeit under a different name, in 2006.
Before this season, the furthest Swansea had reached in the League Cup (which has had various sponsors before Capital One) was the fourth round.
Should they win on Sunday, next season will be the club's first match in Europe since 1991 when they lost 8-0 to AS Monaco in the European Cup Winners' Cup first round second leg.
Entry to that competition came through the Welsh Cup which the Swans won 11 times but no longer compete in.
The Swans have never won the FA Cup but reached the semi-final in 1926 and 1964.
- Kevin Cullis holds the record for Swansea's shortest-lived manager, lasting just seven days in February 1996. The former Cradley Town youth manager had no experience of senior football management. His tenure was one-and-a-half games after it was reported senior players took charge of a half-time team talk in his second match in charge.
- In 2000, Jamaican striker Walter Boyd hit the headlines for receiving a red card when he came on as a substitute and was sent off before play restarted for striking a Darlington player. That record has since been matched.
- Goalkeeper Willy Gueret was arrested in the directors' box at Bury while celebrating winning promotion from League Two in May 2005. His arrest came for arguing with officers.
- In the same year, Swansea left their Vetch Field home. But while the last league game was taking place - 10 days before the last match was held there - fans stripped all the signage from the North Bank and the club shop to take as souvenirs.
- In 2013, defender Angel Rangel took to the snowy streets of Swansea to give food to homeless people in the city.
- Swansea's Carling Cup semi-final victory over Chelsea was marred when Chelsea's Eden Hazard kicked the ball out from underneath a club ball boy and the player was sent off.
- Cyril the Swan was invented in the late 1990s and made the headlines almost instantly.
- In 1999, he was banned by the club for two matches after clashing with then Norwich City director of football Bryan Hamilton during a League Cup tie.
- In the same year, he was fined Â£1,000 for a solo pitch invasion while celebrating a goal against Millwall in the FA Cup.
- He also appeared on the National Lottery and needed an odd number to be drawn as the bonus ball or he would be replaced by a black Swan called Sid the Cygnet. No 47 came up.
- In 2001, Cyril ripped the head off Millwall's mascot Zampa the Lion and drop-kicked it into the crowd.
- Also that year, he faced an assault claim following an annual mascot grand national meet at Huntingdon racecourse, but that was later dropped.
- In 2005, Cyril married Cybil the Swan and his antics since then have been somewhat muted.
