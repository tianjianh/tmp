[SN]TITLE[SN]
200,000th brick added to Durham Cathedral Lego model

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A model replica of Durham Cathedral, which is made out of Lego, has had its 200,000th brick added to it.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The build of the model started in 2013, with visitors and members of the public adding the bricks.
The 200,000th piece of Lego was bought by a student from South Korea on a visit to Durham Cathedral.
The university group, who are on a visit to the UK, had no idea they would be able to add the 200,000th brick.
Once completed, the model will be 3.84m long, 1.53m wide and 1.7m high.
Each piece of Lego costs Â£1 to buy and the money goes towards exhibitions and improving the historic cathedral.
The model replica needs another 100,000 bricks until it is complete.
