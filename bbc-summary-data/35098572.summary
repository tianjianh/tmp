A Met Police firearms officer is to be suspended after a man was shot dead during an alleged attempt to escape from a prison van.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jermaine Baker, 28, was killed during a police operation near Wood Green Crown Court in north London on Friday.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) confirmed it had launched an investigation into events.
Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Terry said it was a "very difficult time for everyone".
He said: "The exact circumstances that led to Mr Baker's death must be thoroughly and independently examined. That is the role of the IPCC.
"It is only through establishing the full facts, as quickly as possible, as to what took place that day that the best interests of justice and of all those affected can be served."
The IPCC said in a statement: "The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched a homicide investigation into Mr Baker's death. The launch of a criminal investigation does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow.
"As this is now a criminal investigation, the IPCC is limited on what further information can be provided."
The Met Police has agreed to the IPCC suggestion that its officer be suspended.
Mr Terry added: "All of our firearms officers, who are all volunteers, do a job that is difficult and often dangerous. They all fully understand, quite rightly, that they will need to account for their actions if they use lethal force."
He said the IPCC would receive the Met's fullest support.
The Met was listening to concerns raised by communities in Haringey and across the capital, he added.
Four men appeared in court earlier charged with attempting to help prisoners escape.
