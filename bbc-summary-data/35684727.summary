Oscars 2016: Night's best quotes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This year's Oscars have been handed out in Los Angeles. Here is a selection of the night's most memorable quotes from the acceptance speeches, backstage and on the red carpet.

As expected, comedian Rock didn't hold back from the diversity issue, describing the event as "the White People's Choice Awards". He also touched on sexism. Here are just a few of his best lines:
"The in memoriam package - it will just be black people shot by the cops on the way to the movies."
"There weren't black nominees in the '60s - why didn't we protest then? Because we had more important things to protest about. We were too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best cinematographer."
"They said you can't just ask women what dress they're wearing. They ask the men more because men always wear the same thing. If George Clooney showed up with a lime green tux on and a swan coming out of his ass, people would say: 'What are you wearing?'"
And after returning from an ad break, he threw in an 'accidental' Freudian slip: "We're black."
The hotly tipped star used his acceptance speech to draw attention to a cause close to his heart.
"Making The Revenant was about man's relationship to the natural world.  A world we felt in 2015 as the hottest year in history.
"Climate change is real - it's happening right now. It is the most urgent threat right now to our entire species and we need to work now.
"Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted."
The Revenant film-maker also took the opportunity to talk about diversity: "What a great opportunity for our generation to really liberate ourselves from all prejudice and this tribal thinking and to make sure for once and forever that the colour of our skin becomes as irrelevant as the length of our hair."
"This Oscar is going home in a Honda Civic.
"The person who owns this - this Oscar is going to be the nicest thing they ever own in their life - it's going to give them anxiety to keep it in their crappy apartment."
"I've always just adored stories, hearing them, seeing them, being in them.
"So for me to get to work with I think one of the greatest story tellers of our time Steven Spielberg has just been such an honour."
"Our audiences are global and rich in diversity and every facet of our industry should be as well. Everyone in the Hollywood community has a role to play in bringing about the vital changes the industry needs so we can accurately reflect the world today.
"The academy board of governors recently took concrete action and sent a message that inclusion only serves to make us all stronger.
"It's important that the members of the academy and everyone in this room help deliver that message.
"Each of you is an ambassador who can influence people in the industry. It's not enough to listen and agree we must take action."
Sacha Baron Cohen's alter ego Ali G was one of the presenters at the Oscars.
"I is here representing all them whose been overlooked Will Smith, Idris Elbow and of course the amazing black bloke from Star Wars, Darth Vader - this is for you."
Collecting the best film award for the movie about the uncovering of child abuse in the Catholic Church in Boston, Sugar made a direct plea to Pope Francis.
"This film gave a voice to survivors and this Oscar amplifies that voice we hope will become a choir that will resonate all the way to the Vatican. Pope Francis, it's time to protect the children and restore the faith."
"If you don't want big money to control government don't vote for candidates that take money from big banks, oil or weirdo billionaires - stop."
"I share this with our fabulous crew and cast. Eddie [Redmayne], thank you for being the best acting partner, I could never have done it without you, you raised my game. To my parents - thank you for giving me the belief anything can happen, even though I never would have believed this."
"I'm so thrilled for Alicia, her mum was in tears... Alicia's just all heart... she's such a wonderful woman."
As he accepted the Academy Award, he declared it to be "the first Oscar for diversity" on account of the film being about a "man with mental health issues, an amputee and five sex slaves".
"Us Mad Maxers are doing OK tonight [the film won six awards]. It was the best reviewed film of 2015, audiences loved it and to be honoured tonight is more than we ever could have asked for - it took a lot of creative guts."
"He pulled no punches, he wasn't polite. I loved it - I loved that he wasn't fake."
"This film is all about Amy, this is all about showing the world who she really was not her tabloid persona. The beautiful girl, the amazing soul, funny, intelligent, witty, someone special someone who needed looking after.
"We just wanted to make a film to show the world who she really was."
Beavan addressed the controversy from the Baftas, when Stephen Fry referred to her as "a bag lady".
"I don't do frocks and I absolutely don't do heels, I simply can't wear them as I have a bad back, and I look ridiculous in a beautiful gown.
"It's my homage to Mad Max and I didn't get it quite right at the Baftas obviously, the scarf was supposed to be an oily rag."
Sam Smith dedicated his Oscar win for best original song to the LGBT community, "hoping we can all stand here as equals".
Backstage, he said: "It's important to show I care about my community. In the past in my career, people said that I didn't care. I just wanted to make it clear that I really do care."
Speaking on the way into the Vanity Fair party, he joked: "It's only downhill from here... I'm going to retire, I'm done with music!"
On his performance, he said: "It was the worst moment of my life. Singing was horrible. I hated every minute."
And when asked who should sing the next Bond theme, he replied: "The Spice Girls!"
The nine year old star of Room told Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet what it was like attending his first Oscars red carpet:
"I can see lots of legs."
