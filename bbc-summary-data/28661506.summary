A film showing show how Caernarfon's Segontium Roman fort looked around 70 AD has been created by historic monuments body Cadw.
The 'restored' fort has also been superimposed on an image of the town today to give it a sense of scale.
In another project, Caerphilly Castle was restored thanks to CGI in July as part of Cadw's Time Traveller campaign.
Viewers also get to see how the inside of the fort used to look.
CGI designers worked with Cadw experts and used detailed floor plans, aerial footage, artist impressions and detail from the Land Registry Office to create the film.
Cadw heritage officer Tristian Jones says using the video to show visitors how the site looked in its prime rather than just outlines on the ground will help them to tell the story of the fort.
"It's brilliant," he said.
"It takes you inside what the fort would have been like in its heyday and gives you a sense of scale and grandeur."
As well as being uploaded to YouTube, the video will be on show at the fort itself.
The Segontium fort is believed to have once held a regiment of up to 1,000 auxiliary soldiers.
It was modified through to the late 4th Century.
