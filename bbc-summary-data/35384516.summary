The family of a student who has been diagnosed with leukaemia is holding a "spit drive" to try to find a stem cell donor from an ethnic minority.

Lara Casalotti, from Hampstead, is of Thai and Italian heritage and requires a donor from a mixed race person for a stem cell transplant.
Volunteers are asked to go to the O2 Centre on Finchley Road on Saturday to join the bone marrow register.
Her family said a donor was required "urgently... to save her life".
The 24-year-old was diagnosed with blood cancer in December.
Currently only 3% of donors on the register are from a mixed race background.
Writing on Facebook, Lara's family said her "unique heritage" meant "her donor is most likely to come from an Asian/mixed-race background".
"For Lara, and the majority of people who need stem cell transplants, it is a total stranger who provides them hope," they wrote.
People who attend the "spit drive" on Saturday afternoon will have to fill out a form and spit in a tube to register on the donor list.
A campaign to find a donor, called Match4Lara, has gained global attention and led to a sharp rise in the number of people signing up as donors.
Celebrities including Stephen Fry and JK Rowling have also given their support.
