The 34-year-old had missed the French Open last month with a back problem.
His comeback match against American Taylor Fritz went into a second day because of heavy rain, but the Swiss eventually came through 6-4 5-7 6-4.
The result takes Federer joint second with Ivan Lendl for the most wins in the open era with 1,071.
"I can take a lot of confidence out of this match," said the 17-time Grand Slam champion.
"I need to improve a few things, but I served big and I was able to handle three sets over two days, and find some energy at the end of the match."
