Atkinson, 28, played 37 times in League One this season for Southend but has now dropped down a division.
He has won promotion from League Two on three occasions and also played for Bradford in their League Cup final defeat by Swansea in 2013.
"The lad is a real competitor, has huge energy levels and is a welcome addition to the squad," said boss Steve Evans.
Atkinson is no stranger to Mansfield, having spent a month on loan there in 2008 while at Hull City, and has also played for Port Vale, Rochdale, Rotherham and Plymouth.
Evans said he would look to sign two more players, having brought in 11 to replace the same number he released at the end of the campaign.
Goalkeeper Conrad Logan, defenders David Mirfin, Johnny Hunt, Hayden White and Zander Diamond, midfielders Jacob Mellis and Paul Digby, winger Paul Anderson and strikers Lee Angol and Jimmy Spencer have all joined on deals of unspecified lengths.
