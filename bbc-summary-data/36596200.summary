[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Coates replaces Glen Harris, who left the club on Sunday.
The 25-year-old was previously head coach of Leeds United's reserves side, before joining the Belles in 2014.
Doncaster won promotion to the top flight last season, but are bottom of the table after losing their first three games of the season.
"I'm delighted to have been given the chance to take charge of a team with such a great history in the women's game," said Coates.
"The club have supported me throughout my development and I'm looking forward to leading the team forward.
"We now have to focus on developing some momentum for the second half of the season."
