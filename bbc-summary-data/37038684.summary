They will be joined by Helena Bonham Carter, Mindy Kaling and rapper Awkwafina, The Hollywood Reporter said.
Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett are also said to be appearing in the heist movie, which begins filming in October.
The movie is a spin-off from George Clooney and Brad Pitt's hit Ocean's franchise.
The all-female version will be helmed and co-written by Gary Ross, who previously directed The Hunger Games and Pleasantville.
It will be produced by Steven Soderbergh, who directed Clooney's Ocean's Eleven.
The new film, dubbed Oceans Ocho, follows on the heels of the recent all-female remake of Ghostbusters, which failed to meet up to box office expectations.
Released in 2001, Ocean's Eleven told the story of career thief Danny Ocean and his 10 accomplices who plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos at the same time.
A remake of the 1960 Rat Pack movie starring Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, it was followed up with two sequels.
