Irish Famine: Irish government launches programme in Newry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More details have been announced for this year's Irish famine commemoration, which is being held in Northern Ireland for the first time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The annual event commemorates the 19th Century potato famine that devastated the island of Ireland.
About 1m people died from starvation and disease between 1846 and 1851, while another 1.5m emigrated.
The Irish government launched the programme in Newry, County Down, which is hosting the main event in September.
Irish Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Heather Humphreys attended the launch in the city on Saturday.
The main ceremony will take place at the Albert Basin in Newry, close to the Quays shopping centre.
Irish state broadcaster, RTÃ‰, reported that the programme will include a series of lectures and musical events at the Ulster American Folk Park near Omagh, County Tyrone.
Warrenpoint Harbour in County Down, from where thousands of emigrants left Ireland to escape the famine, will also be used as a memorial venue.
The annual famine commemoration was established in 2008.
In April, Ms Humphreys announced that it would be held in Northern Ireland for the first time.
As well as Irish government funding, the event also receives support from Northern Ireland's Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
