Oxfordshire's HIV support service under threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An HIV support service in Oxfordshire could be closed as the county council and the local clinical commissioning group consider withdrawing funding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The service, provided by the Terrence Higgins Trust for the past 16 years, faces not having its £150,000 contract renewed on 31 March.
The county council said it needed to deliver a possible £340m cuts package by 2018.
One campaigner said stopping the service would be "absurd".
Ruari, who has been HIV positive for 15 years, said it had been "a lifeline" when he discovered he had the virus and when his partner died.
He added the NHS could not provide the same level of service in a 15-minute patient slot and that he himself had had to wait three months for help via a normal GP referral.
Jointly funded by the county council and Oxfordshire clinical commissioning group (CCG), the service offers face-to-face support, as well as therapy, prevention resources and respite care.
A petition calling for the potential "dangerous and regressive decision" to be overturned has been signed by nearly 400 people.
The county council, which provides £50,000 of the contract, said it was in the process of saving £290m from 2010 to 2018, and might have to save up to £50m on top of that.
The Oxfordshire CCG said it was "reviewing its options" regarding its £100,000 funding to the trust.
A county council spokesman said: "More people are living longer healthier lives with HIV and there is less stigma attached to the condition.
"As a result the funding of £50,000 was considered no longer appropriate as service users could avail of other support services provided locally by the county council and their health needs are met by the NHS."
He added no decision had yet been made.
The Terrence Higgins Trust said it was "very concerned" by the proposals as it would leave "over 200 people living with HIV with no support services in their area".
