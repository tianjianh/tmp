Rooms for blind retained in Llandudno hotel revamp

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rooms for the visually impaired will be retained when a hotel which formerly catered exclusively for blind people is reopened as a mainstream venue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Belmont Hotel in Llandudno was one of the few hotels in the UK catering entirely for blind guests.
It closed in January due to financial reasons with visitor numbers falling.
The 27-room hotel was sold by the Royal Blind Society (RBS) to developer Mbi, and the two are now working to refit six rooms for the visually impaired.
The venue is due to reopen under its new name, the Heritage Hotel, in April or May.
The company says the rooms will feature "tactile signage, colour contrasts, talking alarm clocks and lifts and large-print menus".
Eileen Harding, chief executive of RBS, said: "We are delighted to work with MBi, who we believe have the interest of our charity at the heart of the project."
