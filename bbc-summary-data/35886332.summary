Reality Check: Do farmers outside EU get more subsidies?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Eustice MP, the Minister of State for Farming, Food and the Marine Environment, and campaigner for Vote Leave, has been talking about how British farmers could be better off if the UK left the European Union.

He said "The UK government will continue to give farmers and the environment as much support - or perhaps even more - as they get now â€¦ after all, non-EU countries like Switzerland and Norway actually give more support to their farmers than we do."
Agriculture in Norway and Switzerland is amongst the most protected in the world.
According to the OECD, 60% of Norwegian farmers' income is generated by state subsidies and other policies. For Swiss farmers it's 55%.
Meanwhile, the average farmer in an EU member state can expect state subsidies to make up around 19% of their annual income.
It should be noted that just because some countries outside the EU offer greater subsidies to farmers, it doesn't automatically mean British farmers could expect the same if Britain left the EU. The only way to ensure greater state support would be to start farming in Norway or Switzerland.
REALITY CHECK VERDICT: True - farmers in some non-EU countries do get higher subsidies, but no reason to think that would be matched in a post-Brexit UK.
