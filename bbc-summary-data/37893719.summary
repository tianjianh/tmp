Nick Jablonka's coursework, titled John Lewis Christmas Advert 2016 - The Snowglobe, has attracted hundreds of thousands of views.
The 18-year-old, who studies in Bournemouth, said the clip got about 200 views when it was first uploaded in June, "but in the past week it went crazy".
The retailer said it was so impressed it was arranging for Mr Jablonka to spend some time with its advert team.
