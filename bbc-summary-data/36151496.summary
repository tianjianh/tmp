Sections of the A591 at Dunmail Raise north of Grasmere were washed away when Storm Desmond hit in December.
The route is still being repaired and the new 1.3km trail is opening later on the west side of the road from Dunmail Raise to southern end of Thirlmere.
It has been built by the Lake District National Park Authority.
There is currently a temporary road in place for vehicles while the A591 is being repaired.
Park ranger Graham Strandring said the new route would boost local businesses.
He said: "It's an important development for us. Businesses have been struggling because of lack of visitors coming through."
