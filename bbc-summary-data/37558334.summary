Carmarthenshire council wins Welsh language rules appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carmarthenshire council has won an appeal against three Welsh language standards and will not have to implement them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The authority has to implement more than 170 language standards imposed by Welsh Language Commissioner, Meri Huws.
But it appealed against three concerning meetings between members of the public and council officials that would not allow for the use of a simultaneous Welsh translator.
They have been granted by Ms Huws.
The regulations, which came into force in March, include requiring public bodies to make it clear they welcome correspondence with the public in Welsh and giving the language priority on bilingual signs.
Organisations involved include the Welsh Government, local councils and the three national parks.
Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith strongly criticised Carmarthenshire council's decision to appeal.
It told BBC Wales' Newyddion 9 programme the decision "sends the wrong message" and instead of providing leadership, it "gives the impression that Carmarthenshire council is trying to avoid its responsibilities".
But the council said it was committed to developing the Welsh language as the main administrative language of the authority.
