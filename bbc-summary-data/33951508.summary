A nurse who was jailed for amassing a hoard of ammunition and explosives has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former soldier Joanne Morris admitted a total of 10 charges and was sentenced to seven years in prison in September.
At the time, police said a raid at her home on Station Road, Bloxwich, had uncovered the largest single haul of its kind in the West Midlands in the last decade.
Morris was struck off the nursing register on Friday.
A hearing held by the Nursing and Midwifery Council ruled she had brought the profession into disrepute.
Morris admitted that her fitness to practise had been impaired as a result of the convictions.
The 49-year-old, who went by the name of Paul Morris at the time of the arrest, was working as a nurse and ambulance controller.
Police were alerted after airport borders agency staff intercepted a parcel containing gun parts addressed to her.
A raid on Morris's home in November 2013 discovered detonators and a total of 1.5kg of explosives, including sticks of plastic explosives and an improvised explosive device (IED).
Police said while there was "no evidence she intended to use them in anger", they "posed a huge risk and were potentially deadly".
The haul also included ammunition presses, bullet casings and gun powder.
