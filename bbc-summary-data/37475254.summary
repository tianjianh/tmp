The 25-year-old moved to Ewood Park from Leicester City in 2013.
Rovers turned down bids for Marshall from Wolves and Fulham during the last transfer window.
"We've sent a new proposal to Ben and his representative and they're deliberating over that," Coyle told BBC Radio Lancashire.
"The talks continue to be positive and that is where we are at the moment."
