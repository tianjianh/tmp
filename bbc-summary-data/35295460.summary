[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Billy Kee fired past Roy Carroll to give Stanley an early lead, and Rommy Boco headed in Piero Mingoia's cross to double the advantage shortly after.
Boco lobbed Carroll and tapped in to make it three, before Ronan Murray's shot from 12 yards gave County hope.
Adam Campbell then slotted in from the edge of the area, but Accrington held on to boost their promotion hopes.
