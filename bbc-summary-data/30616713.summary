England's next game is against Lithuania in a European Championship qualifier at Wembley on 27 March.
The players and manager Roy Hodgson will meet at the national football centre at St George's Park.
Hodgson told the FA website: "We've all agreed we're going to get together. Unfortunately, my time with them won't really begin again until March."
England have a 100% record in the six games they have played since the World Cup, with friendly wins over Norway and Scotland book-ending four Euro 2016 qualifying victories.
They are six points clear after four games in Euro 2016 qualification group E.
Qualifying for the finals in France would provide Hodgson with the opportunity to make up for the dismal World Cup experience in Brazil, when England failed to win a game and were eliminated at the group stage for the first time.
"I am looking forward to seeing the team qualify for France in 2016," said Hodgson, as he looked ahead to the New Year.
"Most importantly, I am looking for constant progression.
"I am looking for us to be a better team at the end of 2015 than we are at the start of it.
"Hopefully we will be a serious competitor when we get to France."
