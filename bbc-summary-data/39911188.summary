[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brechin City 1-0 Alloa Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elliot Ford's first Brechin City goal provided them with a narrow first-leg advantage over Alloa Athletic in the Championship play-off final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Raith Rovers midfielder turned the ball in from 10 yards after set-up work by Finn Graham.
Brechin edged what was a fairly even encounter but they did have to block on the line from Kevin Cawley at the start of the second half.
City travel to Clackmannanshire for Saturday's second leg.
If they do complete victory, it would be the first time Brechin have been in the second tier of Scottish football since 2006.
Darren Dods' side only scraped into the play-offs on the last day of the regular League One season, but have since consigned Raith Rovers to relegation from the Championship.
Their winner against Jim Goodwin's Alloa came about thanks to some tricky play by the impressive Graham on the left flank, as he nutmegged a defender and cut the ball back for 20-year-old Ford to convert left-footed into the corner with the help of a slight deflection.
The hosts will feel they deserved that lead after Ross Caldwell was denied by an excellent one-handed save by Neil Parry in the first half.
The Wasps' best chance came when Calum Waters' cross was nearly finished by Cawley at the back post, but defender Willie Dyer was in the right place at the right time to put it behind for a corner.
Brechin were denied a second when Paul McLean's downward header bounced up and on to the crossbar, then Alloa's Stefan McCluskey watched his effort cleared in a crowded penalty box.
Brechin City manager Darren Dods: "Elliot Ford has come into the team in the last few weeks and he's done excellent. It was a great run into the box and Finn Graham did well too.
"A few of our players stay in Glasgow and Kilmarnock and won't be home until late tonight then up at 07:00 BST tomorrow, so they'll need good sleeps on Thursday and Friday to be ready for the weekend.
"Championship football would be a miracle."
Alloa Athletic manager Jim Goodwin: "Brechin were the better team and played the conditions better than we did. They picked up more second balls and competed.
"We're a passing team and the pitch is not conducive to the way we want to play. We know we need to be better.
"To be honest, I'm delighted to go away with a 1-0 defeat with the way the game was going."
