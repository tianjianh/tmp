Police said about  100 girls from Dartmouth College, South Devon High School, King Edward VI Community College and Kingsbridge Community College had been targeted.
Officers are urging pupils not to accept friend requests from people they do not know.
Facebook has its own guidelines on how to avoid online blackmail.
On its website it says: "If someone is threatening to share things you want to keep private (ex: messages, images, videos) or is asking you to send them money, please use this form to tell us more.
"You should also report this directly to your local law enforcement agency."
It adds that users can also block blackmailers but the "safest thing is never share something you wouldn't want other people seeing".
