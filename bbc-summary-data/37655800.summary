Lewis will play an architect who falls in love with a goat called Sylvia.
He is known to millions from TV shows including Homeland, Billions and Wolf Hall, and last appeared in the West End in American Buffalo two years ago.
The play will run at the Theatre Royal Haymarket for 12 weeks from 24 March. The latest announcement comes a month after Albee died at the age of 88.
One of the playwright's other best-known shows, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, is also returning to the West End next year, starring Imelda Staunton.
Ian Rickson, former artistic director at the Royal Court, is to direct The Goat. His previous work includes Jerusalem, at the Royal Court and in West End, and Hamlet at the Young Vic.
