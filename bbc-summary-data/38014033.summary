Baraka Elias, who is 7ft 4in (2.20m), said he needed hip replacement surgery after hurting himself in a fall.
However, doctors at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, told him that his height meant he would not fit properly in a hospital bed, Mr Elias said.
They also told him their X-ray equipment was unsuitable for someone of his height, he added.
Local media quote doctors at the specialist Muhimbili Orthopaedic Institute in the commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, confirming Mr Elias' story.
Tanzania has poor health services, compared with countries in the west.
