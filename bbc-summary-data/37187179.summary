Zaha rejoined boyhood club Palace from Manchester United last year on a five-and-a-half-year deal.
Palace do not want to sell the 23-year-old but, according to his agent Will Salthouse, the clubs are in talks.
Zaha is understood to be keen on a move to White Hart Lane, where he would play Champions League football this season.
Neither club has commented.
