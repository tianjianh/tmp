Two south of Scotland wind farm projects have been approved by the Scottish government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-turbine Stranoch scheme near New Luce and 18-turbine development at Cloich Forest near Peebles have been given the green light.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown agreed with the findings of public inquiry reporters in both cases.
However, a planning appeal over a wind farm at Hag Law near Romanno Bridge has been refused.
Mr Brown said: "Once the Cloich wind farm is operational it will generate Â£6m for local people and community groups while producing enough electricity to power almost 26,968 homes.
"When complete, the development at Stranoch will power the equivalent of around 34,959 homes and both wind farms will provide a boost to their local economies, creating jobs and supporting local suppliers.
"Renewable energy sources generated more than 57% of gross electricity consumption in Scotland in 2015.
"The growth of onshore wind in recent years has been the key factor in the expansion of renewable energy in Scotland: creating jobs, providing secure and low-carbon energy and delivering significant community benefits."
