[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greg Clarke succeeds Greg Dyke as FA chairman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Football League chairman Greg Clarke has succeeded Greg Dyke as Football Association chairman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clarke, who was also a former Leicester chairman, stepped down from his Football League league role in June.
He was nominated to take over from Dyke last month and that decision has now been ratified by the FA Council.
The new chairman said: "I'm relishing the challenge. It's an honour for me to be joining at such a pivotal point in its recent history."
His first day in the office will be 2 September - two days before England get their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign under way against Slovakia with new manager Sam Allardyce at the helm.
