The track notched up a combined sales and streaming total of 1.76 million, the Official Charts Company said.
As well as spending seven weeks at number one from December 2014, it remained in the UK top 40 for 39 weeks.
The second spot in the 2015 chart went to OMI's Cheerleader with a combined total of 1.52 million.
Hozier's Take Me To Church rounded out the top three with 1.25 million combined sales after spending 20 weeks climbing the chart.
It is the only song in the top five that failed to reach the number one spot, however, peaking at two for four consecutive weeks.
The song that pipped him to the top spot was Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do - which ended up as the fourth best-selling song of the year.
Despite only being released last October, Adele's Hello managed to finish sixth place in the list.
