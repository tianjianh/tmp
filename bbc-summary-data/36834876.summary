[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford ran in eight tries to win the Super League derby at neighbours Wakefield and move above their West Yorkshire rivals in the table.

Trinity led 16-10 at the break after tries from former Cas centre Joe Arundel (2) and stand-off Jacob Miller.
Cas had mustered two first-half scores by Greg Minikin and Oliver Holmes
But they added six more after the break through Andre Savelio, Luke Gale, who also kicked seven goals, Junior Moors, Ryan Hampshire, Minikin and Holmes.
It was a debut try for forward Savelio, who only joined the Tigers on loan from St Helens on Wednesday, but Cas lost Rangi Chase with a back problem while Super League's leading try scorer winger Denny Solomona pulled out with food poisoning..
Wakefield, who lost centre Bill Tupou, second rower Jonny Molloy and loose forward Mickey Sio with injuries, managed just one score in the second half, from winger Reece Lyne, while Liam Finn failied to add to his two first-half kicks.
The Tigers' storming finish, in which they scored five tries in 22 minutes, secured a fourth successive derby win to climb a place into sixth above Wakefield.
Trinity drop to eighth thanks to Widnes beating fifth-placed Catalans, although they were all already guaranteed a top-eight finish ahead of the Super 8s split.
But for Salford's six-point deduction, the injury-hit Wildcats would have ended up in the Qualifiers.
Instead, they can now turn their attention to next Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final against Warrington at Leigh Sports Village  - and their bid to reach a first Wembley final for 37 years.
Wakefield coach Chris Chester:
"We had one guy fit on the bench for the last 35 minutes and that really hurt us. We had a front-rower (David Fifita) who played 65 minutes in the middle which was a great achievement.
"It was a good even contest for 50 minutes then we get a penalty, miss touch and we give a penalty away and concede. It took it away from us.
"I'm not overly disappointed because there was bags of effort out there but we just ran out of troops, and Castleford were too good for us.
"Bill came off with a hamstring injury, Jonny Molloy has got a pectoral issue and Mickey Sio got a sternum injury so those three couldn't come back."
Castleford coach Daryl Powell:
"It's been an incredible effort for us over 23 rounds. 14 players couldn't play today. It's been really tough.
"So for us to end up finishing sixth is an awesome achievement. I'm really proud of the players. We'll reap the rewards in the long run from what's happened this year."
"We were a bit helter-skelter at times but it was really pleasing how we grabbed the game in the second half.
"Savelio did really well. He's trained with us a couple of times and he handled himself really well. He's a good player. I've always rated him - and he fitted into our team really well."
