The Pirates have impressed in the Championship, winning three and drawing one of their opening six games.
"It's not just the trophy, it's putting on that shirt and that performance," joint-head coach Cattle said.
"It's progression and another opportunity for us to build," Cattle added to BBC Radio Cornwall.
Cattle and fellow Pirates coach Alan Paver were part of the Pirates side which won the inaugural British and Irish Cup in 2010.
"The cup's a great competition, it's a change of scenery, but in terms of how you go about your business, nothing changes for us," added the Welshman.
"After six games anybody would have taken being around that top four, that's where everybody endeavours to be.
"But actually doing it is another story, but the boys have put worthy performances in to be there and the challenge now is to keep us in that physical shape so that we can compete with those teams which we're doing so far."
