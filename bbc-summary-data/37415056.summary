Cheltenham Town 0-0 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Strugglers Cheltenham and Stevenage battled out a scrappy goalless draw at Whaddon Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a match of few chances, neither side mustered much in the way of impetus on an uninspiring night in Gloucestershire.
Cheltenham's Billy Waters forced a strong one-handed save from Jamie Jones after eight minutes but the best openings of the first half came within 60 seconds of one another.
Stevenage's Charlie Lee had a header cleared off the line by Jack Barthram on 18 minutes before Danny Wright held up for Harry Pell to fire a low shot across goal which was pushed around the far post by Jones at the other end.
The visitors upped the ante before half-time and Stevenage's Tyler Walker teed up Dale Gorman to fizz over from 18 yards, five minutes after the restart.
Cheltenham then enjoyed their own purple patch and with 13 minutes remaining, Pell's drive from a quick lay-off was scrambled around the upright by Jones.
The game became stretched late on with Kgosi Ntlhe guiding another Cowans free-kick back across goal, where the alert Griffiths pushed away.
