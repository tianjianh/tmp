The 27-year-old was set upon by his attackers while walking in Dumbarton's Queen Mary Avenue at 04:55 on Sunday.
He was released after treatment at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
Police have appealed for help in tracing the men who are described as white, in their early 20s and of average height. They were wearing light-coloured hooded tops.
Det Sgt Stuart Gillies said: "This was a random and unprovoked attack which left the victim with serious injuries.

"I would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious to contact police."
