[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 1-2 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford made it two away wins in four days as strikes from Josh Cullen and Billy Clarke saw them beat MK Dons 2-1.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts made a fast start but City went ahead after just 12 minutes as Mark Marshall's initial shot was pushed by David Martin onto the post and after a scramble in the six-yard box, Cullen popped up to strike from close range.
With the Dons shell-shocked, Bradford doubled their lead five minutes later as Clarke's strike from 20 yards out found the bottom right-hand corner past the out-stretched Martin.
Chasing the game, the Dons upped the pace in the second half and created plenty of chances as City crowded the middle of the park.
Ed Upson came close as his long-range effort hit the post while George Williams tested out Colin Doyle.
But despite their endeavour, the hosts could not make a breakthrough until the fourth minute of injury time as Upson reacted quickest to a rebound after Paul Downing's header hit the crossbar.
