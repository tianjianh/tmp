[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rochdale's League One match against Port Vale has been postponed because of a waterlogged pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fixture was due to start at 19:45 GMT but was called off after a pitch inspection at 17:00 GMT.
A new date for the League One game is yet to be confirmed.
Both 10th-placed Rochdale, who are without a win in seven games and 21st-placed Port Vale, who are on an eight-game winless streak, will have to wait to try to end their poor league runs.
