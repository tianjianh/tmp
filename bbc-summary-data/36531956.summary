Ireland unlikely to appeal against CJ Stander's ban for Springboks game

Ireland look unlikely to appeal against CJ Stander's ban from Saturday's second Test against South Africa.

The Irish are unhappy they have yet to receive the written judgement of disciplinary officer Terry Willis after Stander's first Test red card.
"It's probably a situation where it's probably a little bit too late already [to appeal]," said Ireland skills coach Richie Murphy on Tuesday.
"We're in a situation where we're halfway through the training week."
Stander was sent off midway through the first half in Cape Town after he collided with Pat Lambie and caught the fly-half's head with his hip.
However, Joe Schmidt's Irish side regrouped from the setback to earn their first ever win over the Springboks on South African soil as they clinched a 26-20 victory.
"CJ obviously hasn't been training with the team," added Murphy.
"The process that he's gone through over the last three days has just taken forever. It's been very slow. So that's something that's probably gone against CJ at this stage."
The Irish also have to weigh up the risk of an unsuccessful appeal potentially resulting in an increased ban for the South African-born flanker.
Murphy hinted that Leinster's Rhys Ruddock is likely to be Stander's replacement at Ellis Park this weekend.
"Rhys Ruddock has had a really good season this year," said the Ireland skills coach.
Murphy is expecting the Springboks to significantly improve their display in Johannesburg after their error-ridden performance at Newlands.
"At times we were a little bit lucky at the weekend. South Africa knocked one or two balls on, got stripped once or twice in our 22," said Murphy.
"I think we need to park that now and move on to this week's challenge."
Ireland will clinch the series if they win in Johannesburg on Saturday ahead of the final Test in Port Elizabeth on 25 June.
