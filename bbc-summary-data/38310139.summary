Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock says his half-time team talk helped inspire the turnaround which saw the Bluebirds earn a vital win over Wolves.

Cardiff were 1-0 down at half-time, but triumphed 2-1 to rise out of the Championship relegation zone.
Their vibrant second-half display was unrecognisable from a limp first-half, which prompted Warnock's anger.
"My message was: 'Stop feeling sorry for yourselves, they're there to be beaten'," said Warnock.
He added: "We felt a bit sorry for ourselves with the goal, which was a goalkeeping error.
"It took us 10 or 15 minutes after that, we could have lost the game.
"I was pleased with basically every aspect [of the team] in the second half."
Cardiff's win saw them climb up to 19th place in the Championship table, three points above the relegation zone.
They did so without centre-back Sol Bamba, who was suspended after an extraordinary fit of rage during Saturday's 1-1 draw at Ipswich which saw him clash with opposition players, the fourth official and Warnock.
Bruno Ecuele Manga deputised for Bamba against Wolves to make his first start under Warnock.
The Gabon international did so with a flourish, producing a near faultless display to be named man of the match.
Warnock had previously said Ecuele Manga might be sold during the January transfer window.
But the former Crystal Palace and Sheffield United manager has not ruled out a future for the centre-back at Cardiff.
"It all depends on the finances. Bruno's never been left out of my thoughts, even in training he's been very good," Warnock added.
"He's listened to what I want in a centre-half, he's seen what I ask of Sol [Bamba] and I thought he was just like Sol tonight.
"It was like watching two of them."
