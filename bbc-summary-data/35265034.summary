Hatton Garden heist: Accused 'had no skills to offer gang'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the men accused of being part of the Hatton Garden raid could not have been involved because he lacked any skill to offer the gang, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nick Corsellis, lawyer for Carl Wood, said an "inside man" must have been involved in the raid but his client lacked the expertise to be that person.
Mr Wood and three other men deny taking part in the Â£14m heist.
Four others have already pleaded guilty for their roles in the robbery.
During his closing speech, Mr Corsellis told Woolwich Crown Court the gang were "serious organised criminals" who had put a team together where "each member has to have a role".
"And this is one of the reasons Mr Wood is not guilty. What did he bring to the table?" he said.
Mr Corsellis said it did not follow that his client was the man identified by the prosecution as "Man F" in CCTV footage of the raid.
"Male F was actually a player. An inside man, or linked to the inside man, fully familiar with the inner workings of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit".
Mr Wood lacked such knowledge and would have only been able to act as a "general dogsbody", the lawyer said.
Mr Corsellis asked the jury whether professional criminals would have been prepared to give up part of their millions to a person who would have only been an "extra pair of hands (EPH)".
He called it "illogical" and "implausible" that such a person was involved as "criminals are not charitable people".
Speaking about how the prosecution had said the heist could be turned into a TV programme or film, Mr Corsellis suggested movie titles could include "Bad Grandpas" or "The Enfield Expendables".
"But who would play Carl Wood - the EPH? Do you think Mr Tom Hardy or Mr Vinnie Jones is going to rush to take the part of... the EPH?" he asked.
The case continues.
Daniel Jones, 60, of Park Avenue, Enfield; John Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington; Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield, and Brian Reader, 76, of Dartford Road, Dartford, have all previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary.
