The 23-year-old has signed from Swedish side Djurgarden on a three-year deal for around US$2,25 million.
Colley also had offers from Spain's Espanyol and Germany's Hertha Berlin.
"I joined Genk where there will be less stress because the manager has assured me I will have more playing time," he told BBC Sport.
"It feels great to sign for Genk because it is a great club and a good step for my career." .
The former Real de Banjul player made 44 matches for Djurgarden scoring five goals for them after joining from Finnish side Kups in August 2014.
