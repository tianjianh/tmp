[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harris, 39, was appointed by Salford in April 2014 but had not taken charge of a game since 30 June, with the club saying he was on sick leave.
Assistant coach Ian Watson was placed in temporary charge of the team, who are fifth in The Qualifiers.
"We are pleased to have been able to come to an amicable arrangement with Iestyn Harris," Salford chief executive Martin Vickers told the club website.
"We wish Iestyn all the best in his future career within the game and thank him for his efforts."
Harris, a dual-code Wales international, left his position as assistant coach of Wigan Warriors to take the Salford job.
The Red Devils finished 10th in Super League in 2014 and, having failed to finish in the top eight positions after 23 games this season, are not certain of a top-flight place for next year.
