Profile: Prince Harry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prince Harry has grown up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military and, most recently, in charity work.

He has attempted to walk the line between his public and private lives. Inevitably, he has had to embrace publicity at times in order to promote the good causes he supports, but has also drawn a line when the attention has become too much.
Harry's military career came to an end in June 2015, shortly after he was pushed down to fifth in line to the throne by the birth of his brother Prince William's second child, Charlotte.
During his 10 years in the Armed Forces, Captain Wales, as he became known, saw action in Afghanistan twice, most recently in 2012 to 2013 as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner.
The prince, now 32, has said his Army experience will "stay with me for the rest of my life".
In this new phase of his life centred around voluntary work, he has worked with conservation experts in sub-Saharan Africa.
And, like his mother before him, his work in Africa has also focused on humanitarian causes, via the charity he set up, Sentebale, to help children affected by HIV and Aids.
Last autumn, Harry continued his support of the charity Walking With the Wounded by joining five wounded service personnel for part of their 1,000-mile (1,600km) trek around Britain.
This follows a previous trek with the charity in which he walked 200 miles to the South Pole as patron of the South Pole Allied Challenge 2013.
Harry has publicly supported a number of other military charities too, including Help for Heroes and ABF the Soldiers' Charity.
In March 2014, he launched the Invictus Games for injured members of the armed forces and in May 2016 the second incarnation of the event was held in Orlando.
But as well as his military and charitable work, the prince has previously been in the spotlight for less admirable reasons.
An early upset involved Harry smoking cannabis.
St James's Palace confirmed in January 2002 that the then 17-year-old had "experimented with the drug on several occasions" but said the use was not "regular".
In October 2004, there was a scuffle with a photographer outside a club.
A royal spokesman said at the time that the 20-year-old prince "was hit in the face by a camera when photographers crowded around him".
"In pushing the camera away, it's understood that a photographer's lip was cut," the spokesman added.
In 2005, there was widespread outrage when an image came to light of the prince at a fancy dress birthday party dressed as a Nazi.
Clarence House later issued a statement saying: "Prince Harry has apologised for any offence or embarrassment he has caused. He realises it was a poor choice of costume."
And in 2009, Harry was forced to apologise for using offensive language to describe an Asian member of his Army platoon after video footage of the incident emerged.
St James's Palace said the prince was "extremely sorry for any offence his words might cause" but said he had "used the term without any malice and as a nickname about a highly popular member of his platoon".
Clarence House complained in 2005 that the prince's safety was put at risk when paparazzi followed Harry and his then girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, as they were driven along a dirt track in Botswana.
There was further difficulty for the prince when a former art teacher at Eton claimed she had done some of Harry's A-level coursework - allegations later rejected at a tribunal.
Harry was a constant presence at the London 2012 Games, during which he was an Olympic ambassador.
He was highly visible during the Queen's Jubilee in the same year, and as part of the celebrations completed his first royal solo tour overseas with visits to Belize, the Bahamas, Brazil and Jamaica.
However, photos appeared in August 2012 of the prince and a young woman naked in a Las Vegas hotel room - a reminder of his partying image.
The two photos, first published on US gossip website TMZ, were taken on a private break with friends, with the site reporting the prince was in a group playing "strip billiards".
He later said he had "probably let myself down, I let my family down, I let other people down".
"But at the end of the day I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect."
Prince Harry's military career has undoubtedly been affected by media attention.
He was left disappointed in May 2007 when Army chiefs decided not to send him to Iraq because of "unacceptable risks".
He then spent 10 weeks serving in Afghanistan in 2008 - the first royal in more than 25 years to serve in a war zone - but had to pull out amid concerns for his safety after news leaked of his unpublicised deployment.
He returned to Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot from September 2012 to January 2013, before qualifying as an Apache commander in July 2013.
Despite his decision to leave the Army, Harry will return to work in a voluntary capacity with the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme, supporting wounded or sick servicemen and women.
Born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on 15 September 1984, the prince was christened Henry Charles Albert David by the Archbishop of Canterbury in December 1984 in St George's Chapel, Windsor.
But it was officially announced from the start of his life that he would be known as Harry.
He attended the same schools as his brother William, starting at Jane Mynors' Nursery School in London in September 1987.
In 1989 Prince Harry joined Prince William at Wetherby School, moving to Ludgrove School in Berkshire in September 1992 and entering Eton in 1998.
He left Eton with a grade B in his art A-level and a D in geography. He had dropped his third A-level subject, history of art, after taking the AS-level exam.
Before joining the Army, Harry took a gap year, working on a sheep farm in Australia and with Aids orphans in Lesotho.
Although he is now 32, many people around the world will find it hard to forget the image of him as a 12-year-old at the funeral of his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997.
He walked behind the hearse that carried his mother's coffin to Westminster Abbey, accompanied by his brother, father, grandfather and uncle.
Harry was best man at his brother William's wedding in April 2011 and has since spoken of how hard it was not to have his late mother there.
In recent years he has had counselling to help him deal with his grief.
In a candid interview with the Daily Telegraph, he describes shutting down all of his emotions for nearly 20 years and refusing to thinking about his mother.
This, he said, had a "quite serious effect" on his personal life and his work, and brought him close to a breakdown "on numerous occasions".
As one of the world's most high-profile bachelors, Harry's love life has drawn much interest over the years.
In early 2014 speculation had been mounting that he might propose to girlfriend Cressida Bonas, but the couple then split up.
In late 2016, he confirmed a new relationship with US actress Meghan Markle, but felt forced to issue a statement accusing journalists of harassing her.
He described nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers, attempts by reporters and photographers to get into her home and the "bombardment" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life.
Ms Markle, 35, may not have been a familiar name to British audiences, but she is better known in the US for her role as Rachel Zane in TV drama Suits.
