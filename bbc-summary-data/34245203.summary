The girl suffered injuries to her head, arm and leg in the incident in July 2014, Plymouth Crown Court heard.
Christopher Budd, 20, of Trelawney Gardens, Liskeard, Cornwall, and Ryan Swaddling, 23, from Cleeve Drive, Ivybridge, Devon, both deny dangerous driving.
About 200 people attended the event.
The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: "I thought I was going to die. You could hear screaming. I felt my head and I had a massive bump on it."
She added: "You could hear bodies bang against the car."
Another teenager told the court a car drove over her leg at the meet.
The 17 injured, aged between 12 and 20, were among a crowd watching cars at the B&Q car park in Tavistock Road on 26 July.
One witness told the court: "I fell to the floor and the car went over my leg. I don't remember how I hit my head. I remember everyone looking at me and blood pouring from my head."
Another witness said the vehicles were seeing how fast they could get to a speed bump and trying to create smoke from their tyres.
He added there was one girl on the floor and there was "blood everywhere" after the crash.
The trial continues.
