A 1-0 win against France in Friday's quarter-final ensured Germany's place in the last four, where they will play the hosts in Belo Horizonte.
Speaking before Brazil's 2-1 last-eight victory over Colombia, Low said: "They will have a home advantage.
"The South Americans are fighting for their lives here."
After needing extra time to overcome Algeria in the last 16, Germany produced an improved performance against France, particularly in defence.
Mats Hummels headed home early in the first half, and Low's side restricted France to few clear-cut chances.
"There weren't many goalscoring opportunities, which was part of our plan," added Low.
"We didn't want to give France chances with the quality of strikers they possess. We closed them down well - and that was the key.
"France gave everything to try to force the equaliser, but defenders Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng were excellent and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer did well when called upon."
France coach Didier Deschamps felt there was not a great deal of difference between the two sides, but Germany's experience helped carry them through.
Germany have reached the knockout stage in every World Cup since 1982 whereas France, champions in 1998, went out in the group stage at two of the past three tournaments.
"They are used to playing big matches and have a more experienced team," said Deschamps.
"The players are a bit frustrated as there was not a massive gap but the adventure stops here.
"I am quite proud of what we have achieved so far. I'm hurt and disappointed but there are a lot of positive things happening with this team."
