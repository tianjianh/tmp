Commuters posted pictures of themselves wading through water outside New Malden station on Thursday evening.
Thames Water said the flooding was caused by a burst water main on Coombe Road. It apologised to customers but said it could not estimate how many people were affected.
Police and London Fire Brigade attended the scene, while trains were not stopping at the station.
A Thames Water spokesman said: "We are sorry to anyone affected by the flooding in the New Malden area and to any customers who may be experiencing low pressure or no water.
"Our engineers are on site and are working to isolate the burst pipe and stop the leak."
