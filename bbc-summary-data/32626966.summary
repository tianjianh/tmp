A main route through Swansea city centre could be transformed by a pedestrian-friendly plaza under council plans to boost business.

Trees and seats are planned as part of a radical revamp of the central reservation of Kingsway.
Swansea council hopes the plan will make the city centre more attractive to office developers.
Council leader Rob Stewart said an increase in office workers would create trade for local shops.
"It's clear there aren't enough people currently working or living in Swansea city centre to generate the kind of footfall and spending needed to support our existing traders and attract more investment," he said.
"Urban employment in Swansea is estimated at 19% [of all jobs within the county], while the figure for comparative cities elsewhere is over 30%.
"Transforming Kingsway into an employment district will help Swansea close the gap and revive the city centre's fortunes, but major investment in the look and feel of the area is vital if we're to generate an environment that will attract office and residential developers there."
The council will now look for funding for the scheme, and work out the implications for local bus services, stressing the plan was in its "very early stages".
Talks have already started with potential developers for the Civic Centre and St David's sites.
