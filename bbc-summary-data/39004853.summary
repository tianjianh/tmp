He was arrested at his Small Heath home on Thursday, police said, and was due to appear at Birmingham Youth Court on Friday.
Two firearms and suspected stolen property were seized by police during a search.
The woman was treated for minor injuries in hospital following her ordeal near Yew Tree car park, opposite Frogmoor Lane, Yardley, on 11 December 2016.
Police said then she and her unborn child were "doing well".
