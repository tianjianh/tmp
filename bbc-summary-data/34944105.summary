'Grounded' storks fly again after power lines crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of rescued storks, which were never expected to fly again after hitting power lines, have made a "miraculous" recovery.

Twenty-two of the birds arrived in the UK a year ago from Poland after breaking their wings in the accident.
After regaining enough strength to undergo operations, three were able to take flight again this week.
Shorelands Wildlife Gardens, Norfolk, hopes it will be able to reintroduce the species to England.
Ben Potterton, Shorelands' owner, said: "For a bird to hit a power line, fall to the ground, have all that trauma and veterinary care and then fly again is miraculous.
"They're soaring around as we would expect them to do."
Mr Potterton said it was hoped the wounded birds could breed in captivity, and any chicks introduced to the wild.
