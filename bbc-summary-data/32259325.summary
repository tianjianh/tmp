Ashfield District Council elections: Father and son contest same ward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An estranged father and son are going head to head at the district council elections in Nottinghamshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Hollis is standing as a Liberal Democrat against his father Michael who is standing for Labour in Ashfield District Council's elections on 7 May.
Tom said he has not seen his father, who refused to speak to the BBC, since he was a teenager.
Also standing in the Ashfields ward are Conservative John Baker and Independent Eric Hetherington.
Tom, who is also Nottinghamshire County Councillor, said he was "disappointed and hurt" by his father's decision to stand against him.
"I haven't seen my dad since I was a teenager," he said. "It's fair to say he didn't agree with the life choices I've made."
Michael Hollis declined to comment but a Labour Party spokesman said they are "standing excellent candidates in every ward".
In 2011, Tom became the youngest county councillor in England when he was elected aged 18.
At the time, his father said the whole family had been convinced to switch allegiance from Labour to Liberal Democrat.
Tom's partner Jason Zadrozny recently stood down as the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Ashfield when he was accused child sex offences dating back a decade.
Mr Zadrozny, who denies the allegations, is now standing as an Independent in the district council elections in the Larwood ward.
He faces Linford Gibbons for Labour, Austin Heron for UKIP and Conservative Paul Sheridan.
In a further twist, Mr Zadrozny's Liberal Democrat replacement in the district elections, Philip Smith, is standing against Tom Hollis's mother Helen, who represents Labour.
They are the only candidates contesting The Dales ward on Ashfield District Council.
