Cash machine users doubled their money when an ATM started giving out free cash in North Lanarkshire.

A fault at the Clydesdale Bank machine in Stewarton Street, Wishaw, meant customers received double the amount of money they keyed in.
It is understood about 100 people queued up at the ATM after hearing about the fault at 19:00 on Friday.
A spokeswoman for Clydesdale Bank later said the problem had been corrected quickly.
She said: "We don't operate our ATMs directly as they are outsourced to other suppliers.
"What has happened is that while the machine was being filled, some of the cassettes were placed in the wrong order, meaning that double the amount of money was available."
She added she could not confirm the amount withdrawn, because the bank could not reveal how much was kept in any ATM for security reasons.
In January, dozens of people took advantage of a cash machine in Fintry Road, Dundee, which also paid out double the requested amount.
The machine's operators later said customers would not have to return the extra money.
