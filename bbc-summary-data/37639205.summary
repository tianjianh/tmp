The head of cycling's world governing body Brian Cookson would be "surprised and disappointed" if an investigation into Team Sky and British Cycling finds evidence of wrongdoing.

Cookson ran British Cycling for 17 years, becoming UCI president in 2013.
UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) officials are investigating allegations against Team Sky, which they deny.
The allegations surround therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) and the administering of medication to riders.
Former Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke said last week painkiller Tramadol was "freely offered" when he was riding for Great Britain at the 2012 World Championships.
British Cycling vice chairman Charlie Jackson dismissed claims of a crisis.
He added: "It's been a rollercoaster for a period of time, that is true. We'll fight through this, there are a lot of good people, good volunteers in the sport."
Cookson said Team Sky was established in 2010 so that British Cycling could "trust the development of our riders in a safe, clean environment with the highest levels of integrity".
"In my time as British Cycling president we insisted on the highest possible standards of integrity in anti-doping. I would be surprised and disappointed if things have not been continued at that level," Cookson said. "Let's see what this investigation produces."
Talking about British Cycling's thinking behind setting up Team Sky, Cookson recalled: "We were developing young riders, we were taking them virtually all the way to the top but then for that last few percentage we had to put them in the trust of organisations over which we had no knowledge and very little control.
"We saw the ethical and integrity issues that resulted from that."
Ukad has met with British Cycling's "full co-operation", while Team Sky says it is "confident there has been no wrongdoing" following an internal review.
