David Cameron to meet Francois Hollande for EU reform talks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron is to hold talks on his EU renegotiation with French President Francois Hollande in Paris later, ahead of this week's key summit.

The PM is ramping up his diplomatic push as he seeks EU leaders' agreement on a series of reforms when they gather on Thursday and Friday.
He met German Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks on Friday and will address senior MEPs in Brussels on Tuesday.
Securing French agreement will be vital if there is to be a deal at the summit.
UK proposals for protections for non-eurozone countries are reported to be a sticking point for Mr Holland's government in the renegotiation.
Mr Cameron is seeking legally-binding safeguards for countries that do not use the euro, to ensure they are not discriminated against as the eurozone integrates further.
But France has said it will not support anything which looks like special treatment for the City of London.
For all the headlines about shaking up migrants' access to benefits, there's another issue in this EU renegotiation that is potentially a bit sticky.
On the face of it, it sounds pretty dry: the rules about what powers countries that use the euro will have, and what powers countries, like the UK, that don't use it will have.
The prime minister wants the UK to be protected from being ganged up on by the majority of EU countries that do use the euro.
Those that do use the single currency don't want too much meddling from the margins as they see it.
Enough to talk about, then, for David Cameron and Francois Hollande at the Elysee Palace.
Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk, who is overseeing the renegotiation, has begun a two-day tour of five European countries - beginning with France and Romania - to discuss the draft deal.
The proposed package aimed at keeping the UK in the EU was published at the beginning of February, following months of negotiations between UK and EU officials.
Critics say it falls far short of what is needed but Mr Cameron has said it will deliver the "substantial change" to the EU that he has been demanding.
It includes proposals for an "emergency brake" on benefits, but some countries in eastern Europe, such as Poland, are said to object so moves to scale back welfare payments to migrant workers.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said on Sunday discussions over the membership terms would probably run "right to the wire" of this week's summit.
If a deal is reached, Mr Cameron is expected to hold an in-out referendum on EU membership in June.
However, he has given himself until the end of 2017 to hold the poll so if a deal is not reached it could be held at a later date.
