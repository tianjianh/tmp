Donations have poured in to 34-year-old Paul Gallihawk's JustGiving page since he disappeared during a 750m open water swim on Saturday.
He was reported missing after he failed to collect his bike at Leybourne Lakes in Kent for the cycling stage.
A two-day search for Mr Gallihawk, from Maidstone, ended when rescue teams found his body in the lakes on Monday.
He wrote on his JustGiving page that he was competing to raise money for King's College Hospital in London, which had looked after his father.
Since his disappearance was announced, donations on the page have risen to over £12,500 - more than 4,000% of the target.
Messages of condolence on the page include: "Stars shine bright, yours will shine the brightest tonight! RIP Paul. Thoughts are with your loved ones."
The cause of Mr Gallihawk's death remains unclear but Kent Police is not treating it as suspicious.
Mr Gallihawk's girlfriend, Hayley, said: "He was the most amazing and thoughtful partner. I loved him to bits and always will.
"He was incredible in every way and he always put others before himself."
In a statement, his family said: "[Paul] had such a caring nature and will be sadly missed by all the family, extended family and friends.
"Paul was a brilliant son and brother to Nick - he would do anything to help anyone and would always put them first."
The triathlon event was organised by Ocean Lake Triathlon, based at Leybourne Lake Country Park, near  Larkfield, and Simon Langton School in Canterbury.
