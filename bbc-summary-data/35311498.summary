Starting in north east Wales, Stephen Crabb and Lord Maude's visits include Airbus in Broughton and Wrexham-based financial services company DTCC.
Mr Crabb said he wanted to "showcase our country to the world", and show how the UK government could help companies.
Foreign investment created over 5,000 Welsh jobs in 2015, ministers said.
"Last year 4,000 Welsh companies took their first steps into export, and this year we are already up to 3000," Mr Crabb said as the tour began on Thursday.
"I urge those companies considering exporting to go on the Exporting is Great website or come to the first ever Exporting is Great roadshow in Wales, which kicks off next month."
Lord Maude added: "It has been inspiring seeing the enthusiasm for exporting here in Wales, and hearing the success that can be achieved when companies start to expand overseas.
"With exports approaching Â£3bn each year in Wales alone, there is clearly demand out there for UK products and services."
On Friday, Lord Maude will be in Deeside, visiting Toyota's engine plant and medical supplies firm ConvaTec, where he will meet the Welsh government's Economy Minister Edwina Hart.
UK Trade and Investment, the government department responsible for encouraging investment by overseas firms, works with the Welsh government to bring projects to Wales.
On Wednesday, Mrs Hart announced plans for up to 44 events in 16 countries to raise Wales' trade and tourism profile in 2016-17.
