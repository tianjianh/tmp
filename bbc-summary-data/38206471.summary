Ratko Mladic trial: Final arguments in Bosnia war crimes case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors have begun their closing arguments at the war crimes trial of former Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic in The Hague.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 74-year-old, nicknamed "the Butcher of Bosnia", faces two counts of genocide and nine of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
In the public gallery at the UN tribunal sat some wives and mothers of Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) men and boys slaughtered in Srebrenica.
It is the tribunal's last big trial.
A verdict is expected in 2017, as the closing arguments are expected to last more than a week.
Mr Mladic is a top suspect in the massacre of more than 8,000 men and boys from the Srebrenica enclave. It happened over a few days in the summer of 1995 - part of an alleged plan to exterminate the Bosniaks and create an ethnically pure Serb state.

Today Mr Mladic is physically frail but still watched intently as the prosecution played a video clip in court, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports. It showed him as the commander, in military fatigues, warning Bosniak representatives: "You can either survive or disappear".
He is also accused over the Serbs' 44-month siege of Sarajevo, in which an estimated 10,000 people died.
Mr Mladic was arrested in Serbia in May 2011, and his trial began soon after at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). He had been on the run for 16 years.
The Bosnian Serb political leader during the 1990s war, Radovan Karadzic, was sentenced to 40 years in March.
The ICTY was set up in 1993 and has concluded proceedings for 154 accused, 83 of whom have been sentenced. The only current trial is that of Mr Mladic, and the court's work is scheduled to be wound up.
Before 1993 the only previous international war crimes courts were those established to convict Nazi and Japanese war criminals after World War Two, the ICTY website says.
