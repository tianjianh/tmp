Trump travel ban: Belfast refugee not able to visit family

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Syrian refugee in Belfast has had to cancel travel plans to visit his wife's family because of fears he would be barred from the US and deported.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ban on travel to the United States by people from a list of mainly Muslim countries has caused widespread political protest.
While it is being discussed at top government level, it is also impacting individuals.
Milad Korkis has lived in Northern Ireland for three years.
He is married to Holly, an American, and both work with a Christian charity.
They were due to visit Holly's family in Pennsylvania in April.
"My travel document says that I am from Syria," Mr Korkis said.
"I called the US Consulate here and our friends in the States and they explained the executive order and it says I can't travel to the States and if I get there I'll be deported."
Mr Korkis' wife Holly said she hoped the ban was only temporary.
"I know that there's processes of safety and there's so much going on," she said.
"But my hope for the future is that it will get better and that we'll be able to have a system that works well and that we will be able to see family, because that's a very important part of our life."
The couple said the tickets they bought months ago may not be refundable.
"As a Christian myself, I'm banned from going to the States," Mr Korkis said.
"It does affect, not just Muslims, but also Christians in the Middle East."
