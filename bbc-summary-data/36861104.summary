A senior policeman who abused his role as a school and scouting group treasurer to steal thousands of pounds has been given a suspended jail term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Carr took Â£14,000 from Swindon's Orchid Vale Primary School parent teacher association and the 7th Swindon Scouts, Bournemouth Crown Court heard.
He was a superintendent with Wiltshire Police at the time of his crimes.
Carr, who admitted fraud and theft and has since been sacked, was given a 12-month sentence, suspended for a year.
He failed to deposit money from various fundraising events, forged signatures on the groups' bank accounts and falsified independent reports into their finances.
The court was told 47-year-old Carr had debts of Â£21,000 and could not afford the repayments.
Passing sentence, Judge Brian Forster QC told Carr: "What stands out in this case is that everyone has been left bewildered by what you did.
"On the face of it you were an energetic person, you were very interested in police matters, you were involved in the community and you were a family man.... anyone looking at this case must immediately ask the question 'why?"'
Carr, from Swindon, pleaded guilty at a hearing last month to all 11 charges he faced, and has since paid all the money back.
