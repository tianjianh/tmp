[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After the hosts had a goal disallowed when Ben Strevens was flagged offside, Cheek headed in the opener in the 27th minute.
Graham Stack kept Eastleigh in the game by producing a fine double save to deny Reece Hall-Johnson twice on the stroke of half-time.
But Cheek added a second in the 73rd minute to move Braintree seven points above the relegation zone and leave Eastleigh without a win in 2017.
