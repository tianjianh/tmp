Deakon Wilkins, 24, from Weston-super-Mare, vanished after leaving Motion nightclub in Bristol in the early hours of 14 January.
The footage shows a man, who the police believe to be Mr Wilkins, walking along Cattle Market Road at 04:43 GMT.
Police said the search was "intensive" with a "thorough examination of the city centre both on land and in water".
Det Insp Steve Cartlidge from Avon and Somerset Police said: "Our search for Deakon continues and we will do everything we can to find him."
He asked for anyone who may have driven or cycled down Cattle Market Road early on 14 January to contact them.
He said: "Did you see a man walking along the road or anything unusual? We're still keen on speaking to anyone who was in the Temple Meads area and saw Deakon and who hasn't already made contact with us to get in touch."
Mr Wilkins is described as 5ft 10in (1.78m) tall, of medium build with ginger hair and a tattoo between his neck and chest that says "Rush".
When last seen he was wearing a red fitted jumper, black blazer, dark jeans and red trainers.
