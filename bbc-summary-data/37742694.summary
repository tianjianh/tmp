The announcement came after Yafai stretched his unbeaten record to 20 fights with a third-round stoppage of Nicaraguan Johnson Tellez on Saturday.
Panama's Concepcion defeated Kohei Kono in Tokyo in August to win the belt.
The fight will be on the undercard of IBF heavyweight Anthony Joshua's title defence.
Yafai told Sky Sports: "Now I have the big fight and Concepcion is a great fighter, a two-weight world champion and it has the recipe to be a great fight."
