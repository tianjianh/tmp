[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A thank you note apparently written by the new Star Wars film's producers and sent to the cast and crew confirms that part of the movie was shot in Gloucestershire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The letter was written to mark the final day of shooting on Episode VII.
It thanks the "extraordinary" cast and crew for working "from the deserts of Abu Dhabi, to the Forest of Dean, to the stages of Pinewood".
Star Wars Episode VII is scheduled for release on 18 December 2015.
The BBC went to Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean in July where film crews were assembling, although nobody would confirm that it was for Star Wars.
Film and TV productions shot on location in Puzzlewood include Doctor Who, Merlin, Jack the Giant Slayer and Atlantis.
