53 'rebellion' incidents in Welsh prisons in four years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh prisons have dealt with 53 incidents of rebellion in four years, a report has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures showed the number of incidents in prisons across Wales and England had risen by more than 200% since 2012.
Parc Prison in Bridgend had the highest number of "concerted indiscipline" incidents, with 13 in 2014 and 25 last year.
New standards for reporting incidents were brought in last summer.
An incident is recorded as "concerted indiscipline" if it involves two or more prisoners acting together to defy instruction or against the establishment regime. This includes major disturbances, such as riots.
There were two incidents in Cardiff and Swansea prisons over four years and none in Prescoed, Usk.
Prisons charity the Howard League for Penal Reform said building more prisons was not the answer.
Chief executive Frances Crook said: "Evidence shows that building additional prisons only compounds overcrowding and its consequent problems as the courts send more people to prison every day."
