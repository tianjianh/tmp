[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 1-1 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 30-yard thunderbolt from Finland international Daniel O'Shaughnessy earned Cheltenham an unlikely draw at Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mitch Rose had put the Stags ahead just four minutes into the second half.
Matt Green wriggled between Easah Suliman and Dan Parslow on the left before setting up Rose from 12 yards with a square pass that he stroked home low first time.
That looked likely to be enough as home goalkeeper Scott Shearer had little to do until he picked O'Shaughnessy's stunner out of his net.
A tight first half saw the game fail to catch alight.
But the Robins wasted the best chance after 22 minutes as Billy Waters crossed from the right and picked out an unmarked Harry Pell six yards from goal.
However, Shearer saved his defenders' blushes with a great save low to his left.
Green almost broke through in the 32nd minute only to see Russell Griffiths get down well to his right to turn away his low drive from 20 yards after winning a tussle for the ball.
Cheltenham striker Danny Wright missed a couple of chances to win it in stoppage time as Mansfield heads dropped.
