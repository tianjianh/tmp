Gylfi Sigurdsson: Swansea leave Everton target out for Birmingham friendly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gylfi Sigurdsson has been left out of Swansea's squad for Saturday's friendly at Birmingham City "due to the current transfer speculation surrounding him".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Swans have rejected a £40m offer from Everton for the Iceland midfielder, who they value at £50m, while Leicester have also had a bid turned down this summer.
Sigurdsson did not travel with Swansea for their tour of the United States.
The 27-year-old has since returned to first-team training.
