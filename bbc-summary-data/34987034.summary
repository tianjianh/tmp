[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish government in push to ban pavement parking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish government has pledged to push ahead with legislation make it an offence to park on pavements.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There is dispute over whether Holyrood has the power to change the law, with talks with Westminster underway.
Ministers want to legislate to prevent parked cars from causing a problem for guide dog owners, wheelchair users and parents with pushchairs.
Transport minister Derek McKay said the issue should be addressed by the next government, if not this term.
He said the issue should be championed by any incoming government after next year's Scottish Parliament elections if the current administration was not able to resolve it before then.
He said: "I'm giving a commitment from this government, that if we are re-elected we will legislate on this area.
"But what I'm also doing is working on a cross-party basis to flag up to everyone that if we have consensus from parliament, any incoming government might wish to legislate."
Consultations on the matter have previously won broad support in Scotland, but confusion remains over which parliament has jurisdiction.
Action against pavement parking has also been examined in England and Wales, but talks have been held over giving MSPs power to change the law on the subject.
