Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal joked that his players may be "trying to kill him" after a last-gasp win over Nottingham Forest on Saturday.

Kieran Lee scored twice, his second in the 91st minute, in a 2-1 success.
The Owls have overturned a deficit to win each of their past three Championship home games.
"I talked with my players and if the plan is to try to kill me, they are very near," Carvalhal told BBC Radio Sheffield.
Last season's beaten play-off finalists have not won away from home yet in 2016-17 but have taken 12 points from a possible 15 at Hillsborough, helped by comeback wins over Forest, Bristol City and Wigan.
"My players are fighting and showing me personality," added Wednesday's Portuguese boss Carvalhal. "They are doing fantastic."
