Police in south Georgia said the woman, whose identity has not been released, was struck after the crew for Midnight Rider placed a bed on the railway tracks in Doctortown.
Wayne County Sheriff John Carter said several other people had been injured, two of them seriously.
The crew were testing cameras for a dream sequence, according to The Wrap.
Midnight Rider, which is directed by Randall Miller, stars Tyson Ritter and William Hurt as younger and older versions of the Allman Brothers Band frontman, Gregg.
None of the cast are believed to have been among the 20 people on set at the time of the accident, as filming was not officially scheduled to begin until Monday. However, Miller is understood to have been present.
An eyewitness told Variety that, although the crew were expecting two local trains, a third had arrived unexpectedly. A warning whistle was blown, but they had less than a minute to react.
As the crew rushed off the tracks, Miller and a photographer scrambled to remove the bed. Miller fell and had to be pulled to safety, according to the witness.
They said the train then hit the bed which "exploded". The debris struck and killed a second camera assistant.
Rail company CSX said it was "cooperating fully with authorities as they investigate."
"Initial reports indicate that at least three people were injured, one fatally," said a statement.
"CSX personnel are working with first responders to meet the needs of those injured. A train was en route from Memphis to Savannah when the incident occurred."
