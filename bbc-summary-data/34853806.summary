Jacqui Lambie, who is an independent senator, said in an interview with ABC Radio that stronger screening was needed after Friday's Paris attacks.
She also suggested the Grand Mufti be fitted with one for failing to condemn the attacks strongly enough.
This week a Syrian family became the first of 12,000 refugees to arrive .
Australia  has agreed to take in an  12,000 refugees amid public pressure over Europe's migrant crisis.
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said all those being given refugee status in Australia had been "handpicked" by authorities and faced a rigorous screening process.
Ms Lambie, known for airing controversial views, is one of eight independent senators holding crucial votes in Australia's upper house. But as a senator she is not able to enact legislation.
"I just think that Australia needs to have better scrutiny and vetting of all refugees, including the proposed 12,000 from Syria," she said in the radio interview.
"Maybe the first person who should have an electronic device put on them is the bloody Grand Mufti."
She criticised Dr Ibrahim Abu Mohammed  over a statement he made in the wake of the Paris attacks, which critics said could have been interpreted as a justification for the attacks.
Dr Mohammed later clarified his position, issuing a joint statement with Australia's National Imams Council that he said he had "consistently and unequivocally condemned all forms of terrorist violence".
When questioned whether using a tracking bracelet on the grand mufti would achieve anything, Ms Lambie responded: "Of course it will, because they will be able to ... monitor what is going on and where they're going."
There has been no official response to her call.
