The world number four - one of five leaders at the halfway stage - made a double bogey at the first hole and was eight adrift midway through his round.
But after a front nine of 40, he had five birdies in a back nine of 30.
Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee, the 46-year-old world number 57, carded a 68 to lead at eight under.

Jeunghun Wang, the 20-year-old South Korean who was another joint leader after the second round, had four birdies in his opening seven holes and despite three dropped shots on the way home in blustery conditions at Le Golf National, he returned a 70 for a six under total.
Former world number one Martin Kaymer, who has a victory and four top-10s at Le Golf National, holed from a bunker for an eagle at 16 and shares fifth place alongside Andy Sullivan, who holed a six iron from 187 yards to eagle the par four last.
Lee Westwood, who was five over par midway through his second round on Friday and made the cut by only two strokes, birdied three of his opening four holes in a 67, the day's best round.
The 43-year-old had six birdies and shares 10th place.
McIlroy will play in the penultimate pairing with defending champion Bernd Wiesberger on Sunday.
