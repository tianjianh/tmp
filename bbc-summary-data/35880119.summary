Thirty-two people were killed in the three bomb attacks at Brussels airport and Maelbeek metro station and many more were injured. The toll was reduced from 35 after Belgian authorities found some victims had been counted twice.
The casualties came from a wide variety of countries including Belgium, Colombia, Peru, France, Germany, Britain, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, Spain and the US.
Police say the task of identifying the dead in the attacks was slowed by the violence of the explosions and because there were so many foreigners.
Some 90 people are still in hospital.
A page has been set up on the collaborative website Trello to identify those killed, missing and injured. A Facebook page has also been set up.
The first fatality to be confirmed was that of 37-year-old Peruvian Adelma Tapia Ruiz. Ms Tapia was killed at the airport, where she was with her Belgian husband, Christophe Delcambe, and their twin four-year-old daughters Maureen and Alondra, who all survived.
Ms Tapia's brother, Fernando Tapia Coral, said in an interview that Mr Delcambe followed his daughters outside the gate area shortly before the explosion and could not find his wife after the blast.
Mr Delcambe was reportedly injured while Maureen had shrapnel wounds in one arm. Alondra was not injured, reports said.
Writing on Facebook, Mr Tapia called his sister's death "incomprehensible".
"It is very complicated to describe this pain that we are feeling at home, but as the older brother, I know I have to try.
"It is more difficult still to understand the way that destiny has snatched the life of a loved one, but even more incomprehensible is not being able to be close to her in this family tragedy that today knocked on the doors of my family. Early this morning in the Brussels airport, my sister Adelma Tapia died in the terrorist attack, unable to survive this jihadist attack that we'll never understand."
He said his sister was due to catch a flight to New York where she was meeting their sisters, and had planned to return to Peru this year before setting up a Peruvian restaurant in Brussels.
Leopold Hecht, a Belgian national aged 20, studied law at the Universite Saint-Louis in Brussels. He was killed in the attack on Maelbeek metro in which 19 others died.

"There are no words to describe our distress," university rector Pierre Jadoul told the AFP news agency.
Naji Masri, a student in the same year as Mr Hecht at the university, told AFP: "He was a good student, always in the front row."
On Friday, British national David Dixon, 50, was confirmed to have died in the metro blast.

His family said they had received "the most terrible and devastating news about our beloved David".
British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: "I am deeply saddened to hear David Dixon was killed in the Brussels attacks. My thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family."
Ms Lafquiri, 34, described as a Belgian-Moroccan mother of three, was a physical education teacher at La Vertu Islamic school in Brussels. She took the metro to work every morning but on the day of the attacks she never arrived.

Ms Cain told the BBC that her husband had once said to her that "you can't live your life in fear of a terrorist attack, because living in fear is how they win".

Scores of people were wounded in the attacks including a woman photographed while sitting bloodied and dazed with a leg stretched across a seat at Brussels's Zaventem airport moments after the suicide bomb attack on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, the woman, whose photograph has become the most haunting image of the attacks, was identified as an airline worker from India. Her family in the city of Mumbai have named her as Nidhi Chaphekar, a 40-year-old Jet Airways flight attendant and a mother of two.
Her family say that after an internet search they have now discovered that she is alive and recovering in hospital. Jet Airways say that Amit Motwani, another employee hurt in the airport blasts is also recovering.
Sebastien Bellin, a Brazilian-born father of two and basketball player with the Belgian national team, was among the wounded. He was pictured lying on the airport floor with blood pooled around his leg.
The blast threw him 2m (6ft) into the air and left shrapnel in his left leg and right hip, his father, Jean Bellin, said.
Four Mormon missionaries were also injured by a blast at the airport, their church said, three seriously. One, Mason Wells, 19, was reportedly only one block away from the Boston bombing in 2013, and was in Paris during the gun and bomb attacks there in November.
Two other missionaries, Richard Norby, 66, and Joseph Empey, 20, from Utah were seriously injured, officials from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints said. A fourth, Fanny Clain, suffered minor injuries.
Mr Wells' father, Chad Wells, said he woke up to see the news on TV, before calling the church's mission president in France and finding out his son was injured but alive.
"I'm completely shocked by the news. It's the kind of thing as a parent you never, ever want to wake up to," he said.
"Hopefully he's run his lifelong odds and we're done. I think it will make him a stronger person ... Maybe the Boston experience was there to help him get through this experience."
