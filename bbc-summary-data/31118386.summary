[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The funds will also be used by the university's oat-breeding team to improve the economic sustainability of the staple food.
According to the university, oat crops continue to be challenged by high investments into alternative crops.
The funding was provided by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.
The five-year project will address the challenges facing agriculture and sustainable food production in the UK.
Using genetic tools and resources, the team hopes to improve traits that will increase the production of oats while also enhancing grain yield and quality.
