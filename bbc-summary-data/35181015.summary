[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish League One: Brechin City 4-0 Forfar Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On-loan midfielder Liam Watt bagged a brace as bottom-of-the-table Brechin City secured a victory over fellow League One strugglers Forfar Athletic.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Airdrieonians man Watt placed the ball in the bottom corner following good work from Robert Thomson.
He then turned provider as player-manager Darren Dods headed the second.
Watt and Thomson found the net to put the game beyond the second-bottom side before Forfar defender Gareth Rodger was sent off in the last minute.
The victory takes Brechin to within four points of Forfar, although the Loons have a game in hand over City and Cowdenbeath, who are a further three points ahead.
