Parish councillor Patrick Smith was driving with his wife Christine when they spotted the group near Dunstable.
The Smiths, from Caddington, Bedfordshire, spotted the stowaways on the A5 on Friday.
A total of six people were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences, police said.
The couple were travelling to go shopping when they saw the men exit the lorry.
"It was like something out of a film," Mrs Smith said.
They phoned the police and then watched as the group split up.
"Two of them went into a restaurant car park," Mr Smith said. "We went in there and I grabbed them. I went down on the floor with them.
"When they managed to get away I chased them. I took the car at them - one went in to the ditch."
Mr Smith, who said he spent time in the military and also worked for a security company, said the men got away but he spotted another "a short while after".
He "grabbed him" and put him in his car until the police came.
"He had no option," Mr Smith said. "He had to shut up and sit there."
Mrs Smith said the incident was "quite sad".
