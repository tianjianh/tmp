[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eastleigh 1-1 York City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rousing effort by York was not enough to avoid a 13th match without victory, as they drew at Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Not surprisingly it was the home side who dominated against the basement strugglers, striker Michael Mandron had to be marshalled effectively for Gary Mills's men to hang on in the first half.
Normal service was resumed soon after the interval as Mandron rose to glance in Andy Drury's cross and put the Spitfires in front.
But Simon Heslop had clearly not read the script as he controlled a long ball over the top superbly on his chest, and slid a shot low under the despairing Ryan Clarke to secure an unlikely point for the Minstermen.
