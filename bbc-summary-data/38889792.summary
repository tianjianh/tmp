[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 3-0 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton were too strong for struggling Hartlepool as they eased to a 3-0 victory at Kenilworth Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Hatters led after just five minutes when Luke Gambin's clipped pass was controlled by Danny Hylton and he fired in his 18th of an impressive season.
Alan Sheehan was denied by goalkeeper Joe Fryer before the home side doubled their advantage after just 10 minutes, Gambin driving into the area and finding the bottom corner to score his first Luton goal.
It took Pools 30 minutes to register an attempt of note, defender Scott Harrison heading narrowly wide from a corner.
In the second half, Hartlepool winger Nathan Thomas fired wildly off target for the visitors, while Hylton should have doubled his tally only to fire wastefully over the top.
Isaac Vassell was denied by a good low stop from Fryer, before Pools almost had one back, Michael Woods firing inches over.
Town wrapped up the points late on as Ollie Palmer came off the bench and when the ball ricocheted back into his path, he beat Fryer to open his account for the Hatters.
