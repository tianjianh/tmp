About 100 people have had their holidays in Tenerife cancelled by travel firm Jet2 after a website error.

Prices briefly advertised online for holidays at the Hard Rock Hotel in the Canary Islands were too low, with the company later cancelling bookings made.
Customers were given the option to pay the remainder of the actual price, but this was often nearly double the original advertised fee.
Jet2 apologised to customers affected and said all had received full refunds.
Sarah Crosby, a BBC employee from Bramley in Leeds, originally paid £1,800 for her holiday and was then asked for an extra £1,400.
She said: "It was meant to be a big celebration for my 50th birthday, I've booked time off work for it and now I don't feel like I want to get anywhere else, I had my heart set on that.
"I just think, it's your mistake, you've advertised the holiday at that price, you should honour it for people who pay the money."
Several people told BBC Radio Leeds they had received a booking confirmation and had even reserved their seats on a plane, only for the holiday to be cancelled.
Steve Hanson, from Crossgates in Leeds, booked the trip to celebrate his 30th wedding anniversary and was left feeling "very disappointed".
"My wife has been in tears, you spend thousands of pounds and they don't care, you're just a number," he said.
Where do customers stand on the mix-up?

This sort of scenario has occurred quite a few times with different offers over many years.
In the first instance, if a company makes a genuine mistake on their website or their brochures, particularly in relation to pricing, they can withdraw the price and offer.
But the simple fact of the matter is that there has been an essential change to the terms of the contract.
Regulation 13 of the Package Travel Regulations says you have to be given an upgrade where it's available, a downgrade where it's available with the price difference paid to you or indeed compensation along with a full refund.
A Jet2 spokesperson said: "For a very short period of time, some holidays to the Hard Rock Hotel in Tenerife were incorrectly placed on our website that were not actually available.
"We contacted customers and cancelled these holidays immediately, and we apologise to customers for the error, as well as any disappointment and inconvenience that this may have caused."
