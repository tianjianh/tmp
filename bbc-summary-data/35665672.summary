Poole made his debut off the bench in the dying moments of United's 5-1 win over FC Midtjylland to reach the Europa League last 16.
The defender joined Louis van Gaal's side from Newport County in August, 2015.
"He's an international of the future," Thomas told BBC Wales.
"There's no question about that."
Poole's debut came on the night another teenager, Marcus Rashford, scored twice after starting following Anthony Martial's injury in the warm-up.
Louis van Gaal signed Poole for an undisclosed fee on the same day he paid an initial Â£36m for striker Martial.
Thomas says he had already heard glowing testimony from Old Trafford staff about Poole's progress before his first-team debut.
"It's a big step for the youngster, obviously coming from Newport County, but to make the first-team debut - it makes no difference if it's for a minute or 10 seconds - he's actually made a first-team debut now and he'll be an excited young boy.
"But he knows there's a long way to go in his career, but it's the first step and it's a massive step to make his debut at Old Trafford.
"I've had great reports from the reserves and that and he looks a fine prospect."
Thomas says the Cardiff-born player has all the makings to carve out a successful career in top-flight football.
"He's a very confident young man and making his debut will give him more confidence and he's certainly a Wales star for the future," said Thomas.
"He's got all the attributes. On and off the pitch he's got real, real quality and it's a big boost not just for Man Utd, but for Welsh football as well.
"I don't think there's any question that he will feature more for the first team again this season. Why not?"
