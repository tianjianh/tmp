Ryan Morrish was jailed for six years for causing the deaths of Calvin Trevena and Ann Varran, both 51.
Truro Crown Court heard Morrish lied about his car being stolen after the crash near St Agnes, Cornwall.
Morrish, 27, from Redruth, previously pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol and perverting the course of justice.
The force of the impact threw Ms Varran over a hedge and her body was found in a field next to the B3277.
Mr Trevena's body was found in a ditch.
The couple were walking home in the early hours of 2 August 2015 at the end of St Agnes Carnival.
After the accident Morrish dumped his white Audi S4 in a lay by and set about "spinning a tale" to deceive police.
He left numerous messages on friends' phones asking them if they had taken his car to try and back up his story.
The court heard Ms Varran and Mr Trevena were friends of Morrish's family and had gone on a skiing holiday with them earlier in the year.
In a statement read out in court Ms Varran's son Matt Bonnar said: "I couldn't believe it was you who had caused us so much pain."
Morrish, a manager at Morrish's Fish and Chips shop in Redruth, was sentenced to six years in prison and disqualified from driving for six years.
Following the hearing Mr Bonnar told the BBC: "They absolutely loved each other, the only thing I can take away from this is that they are together."
