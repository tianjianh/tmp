A one-way system will remain in place in a Devon town, as an appeal is launched in an ongoing legal battle.

Devon County Council changed the traffic flow through Totnes in 2013 to make the area safer.
Campaigners took the authority to court and on Monday a judge ordered the council to end the traffic order.
However, the council is now seeking permission to appeal and until it is determined, the traffic flow will remain.
The legal battles have so far cost the authority Â£80,000, against a backdrop of the council having to make Â£46m of cuts, as it deals with a 13% drop in its government funding.
Some traders began legal action after they claimed their businesses had suffered following the decision to change the flow.
BBC presenter Jonathan Dimbleby was among campaigners who marched with protesters against the traffic changes which meant vehicles could no longer be driven up the High Street from the bottom of the town.
A council spokesman said: "We applied to the court for a stay of the decision to remove the current order, which the judge has granted.
"The stay will remain in place until the Court of Appeal decides whether or not to grant us leave to appeal judgement.
"This means that the current traffic order should remain in place until a decision is made on an appeal. We were concerned about the road safety risks of immediately removing the order and we therefore welcome the decision on the stay."
In March, the decision to reverse traffic flow through Totnes town centre was quashed in the High Court.
