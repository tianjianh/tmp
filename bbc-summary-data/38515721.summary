Lurcher cross Bowie is being overlooked by potential new owners "because of his different coloured eyes".
The three-year-old has been at the Dogs' Trust rehoming centre in Bridgend since November and staff hope to find a home for "our blue-eyed boy, Bowie".
Singer Bowie's son Duncan Jones Tweeted: "Hoping someone near that dog might be able to help him find a home."
Bowie the dog was named after the rock star due to his different coloured eyes.
Entertainer Bowie, who died of cancer last January aged 69, had a left pupil that was permanently dilated, which created the illusion that his eyes appeared a different colour.
The dogs home said no-one has shown any interest in this "quirky canine with bundles of energy" who "loves being around people".
"It's such a shame that Bowie has been overlooked so far, but we're confident we'll find a home for him soon," said Angela Wetherall, rehoming centre manager at Dogs Trust Bridgend.
"Not only will you be offering a four-legged friend a happy home but you will be gaining a new best friend."
