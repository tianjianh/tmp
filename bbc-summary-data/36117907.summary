Backlash after Barack Obama EU referendum intervention

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US President Barack Obama has been accused of doing Downing Street's bidding - after he said the UK would be at "the back of the queue" for American trade deals if it left the EU.

Mr Obama was criticised by pro-Brexit campaigners after he warned of the consequences of the UK leaving the EU.
UKIP's Nigel Farage said Mr Obama was "talking down Britain", while Tory Liam Fox said his views were "irrelevant".
Mr Obama, on a three-day UK visit, will meet Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later.
His intervention came on his first full day in the UK and comes just weeks ahead of the 23 June in-out referendum.
Speaking at a joint news conference with Prime Minister David Cameron, Mr Obama said the US "wants Britain's influence to grow - including within Europe".
"The UK is at its best when it's helping to lead a strong European Union. It leverages UK power to be part of the EU.
"I don't think the EU moderates British influence in the world, it magnifies it."
BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Obama's message on trade was "very blunt" and "really upped the ante" in the referendum debate.
Leave campaigners responded angrily, with Mr Farage accusing the US president of doing Mr Cameron's "bidding" and talking down Britain. "I think that's shameful," he added.
Mr Fox said Mr Obama would be leaving the White House soon, and therefore his comments were "largely irrelevant".
He told BBC's Newsnight: "We heard 'you are our best friend, we have a special relationship, and you will get a punishment beating if you leave the EU'.
"This is very much the Downing Street refrain."
Conservative MP Dominic Raab labelled Mr Obama a "lame-duck American president doing an old British friend a political favour".
Downing Street rejected suggestions that lines had been fed to Mr Obama, saying the US president spoke for himself.
Meanwhile, another prominent Leave campaigner - former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith - has tried to move the referendum debate on to immigration.
In an article in the Daily Mail, he says the introduction of a national living wage - a move he supported while in government - will "surely lead to another stampede to our borders".
He adds: "To make the Living Wage work for British people, we need to be able to control the number of people coming in."
Mr and Mrs Obama will spend the second full day of their visit in London on Saturday.
The US president will meet Labour leader Mr Corbyn and visit the Globe Theatre as part of the celebrations marking the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death.
