Child abuse survivors slam 'shambolic' inquiry delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Survivors' groups have criticised a "lack of progress" in the work of a public inquiry into historical allegations of child abuse in Scotland.

They said they felt let down by delays which looked 'shambolic' and suggested incompetence.
The inquiry, announced in December 2014, formally began its work on Thursday, although no panel members have been appointed.
It followed a series of disclosures of abuse in childcare institutions.
In May 2015, leading QC, Susan O'Brien was appointed to chair the inquiry, which will have statutory powers to compel witnesses to give evidence.
Although its work has officially started, no hearings are yet planned. Only a website has been launched.
Ms O'Brien QC said she would give full details of how the inquiry would operate once panel members had been appointed by the Scottish government.
She said: "Once the Scottish government has appointed the inquiry panel members, and I have had a chance to discuss the issues with them, we will set out in detail the ways in which we will run the Inquiry and take evidence from witnesses.
"Counsel to the inquiry will be in touch with survivors' representatives during October to make sure that their views are considered before that happens.
"It would be helpful if all other interested parties made themselves known to the inquiry now, so that their views can also be taken into account."
Jennifer Davidson, director of the Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland, based at the University of Strathclyde, welcomed the formal start of the inquiry.
She said: "This is a historic day for the people of Scotland, particularly survivors and their supporters who have campaigned for a long time to be heard. I hope that survivors can find a way to use their painful experiences and memories to get answers and to ensure this doesn't happen again."
But Alan Draper, parliamentary liaison officer for Incare Abuse Survivors (INCAS) said members were very disappointed at the lack of real progress in the 10 months since the inquiry was announced.
"The failure to appoint a panel, to assist Susan O'Brien, prior to the start date, suggests incompetence and will only result in yet further delays to the work of the inquiry, as we assume that anybody appointed will not be able to start work immediately," he said.
"The whole process is beginning to look shambolic.
"Survivors were feeling euphoric following the announcement of the inquiry, but are now left feeling that they are being let down, yet again, by those in authority."
He said so far the inquiry has no dedicated premises or phone line.
INCAS also criticised the government for failing to include a draft bill in its recent legislative programme, to set aside the time bar which has prevented survivors seeking civil damages many years after their abuse.
Education Secretary Angela Constance said in December 2014 the government would lift the three-year time legal limit on civil actions.
She said this would include compensation claims for damages in cases of historical abuse that took place after 1964.
Welcoming the formal start of the inquiry, Ms Constance said it represented an important landmark.
"I want to reiterate my gratitude to all survivors and their supporters who have helped us reach this point.
"Their willingness to recount such painful experiences was vitally important in helping us set a remit that would deliver the justice they rightly deserve," she said.
"Many of those who have championed this inquiry have been campaigning a long time and I want to reassure them that they will see it conclude within a reasonable timeframe.
Getting here has been a challenge and there is still a long way to go, but I am confident we have taken the time to allow the chair to lay the foundations of an inquiry that will allow us as a society to right historical wrongs."
The inquiry will examine any instance where a child was abused 'in care', at institutions including residential care provided by faith-based organisations; children's homes and secure care.
It will also include those placed in foster care.
During the start-up period, those who believe that they may have information to share are asked to make initial contact with the inquiry either by emailing information@childabuseinquiry.scot or by post at Historical Child Abuse Inquiry, PO Box 24085, Edinburgh, EH7 9EA.
They should only send in their names and addresses, with one sentence about how they can help.
