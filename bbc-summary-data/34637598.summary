Jay Donnelly put the Reds ahead but Andrew Waterworth levelled before Aaron Burns bagged an extra-time double.
Goals from David Cushley and Tony Kane gave Ballymena United a 2-0 victory over Crusaders at Seaview.
Carrick Rangers edged H&W Welders 3-2 while Larne clinched a 2-1 win over fellow Championship side Ards.
It was a first defeat for Cliftonville boss Gerard Lyttle as the Blues fought back to earn a place in the last four.
Donnelly tapped in from Tomas Cosgrove's cross for the opener before Waterworth saw his penalty saved by Peter Burke after Jamie Mulgrew was brought down by George McMullan.
Waterworth made no mistake after the break, meeting Nial Quinn's cross and heading into the roof of the net.
Cosgrove headed against the bar as both teams squandered chances but Linfield found the target early in extra-time when Burns diverted Waterworth's effort into the net.
Johnny Flynn became the second Reds player to be denied by the woodwork before Burns rattled home a penalty following a foul on Guy Bates by Ryan Catney.
Crusaders were dumped out of the League Cup by Institute a fortnight ago and they made another exit as Ballymena secured a deserved victory.
Cushley had smashed against the bar before pouncing on a poor clearance by keeper Sean O'Neill and firing in.

It was quickly followed by Kane rifling across O'Neill and into the top corner.
A Paul Dickson own goal a minute from time sent Carrick through to the semi-finals.
Conor McCloskey's double put Rangers in control but the Welders hit back with a David Rainey penalty and Scott Davidson strike.
Darren Stuart slotted in to give Larne the lead at Bangor Fuels Arena before Gary Dorrian blasted home the equaliser.
An opportunist long-range effort from Paul Maguire restored Larne's advantage while Denver Gage fired against a post as Ards pressed for a late leveller.
The draw for the semi-finals will be made on this week's Saturday Sportsound on Radio Ulster at 17:30 GMT.
