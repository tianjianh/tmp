[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Cup final: Inverness CT v Falkirk player ratings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Vincent scored with just four minutes of normal time left to win Inverness Caledonian Thistle their first ever Scottish Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marley Watkins gave the Highlanders the lead, but following Carl Tremarco's red card, Peter Grant equalised.
That made for a grandstand finish with Vincent's goal ensuring after just 21 years of existence, Inverness have their hands on a major trophy.
Here, BBC Scotland's Richard Wilson gives his marks out of 10 for the two sides.
Dealt with mainly long-range efforts from Falkirk with relative ease. Was almost caught in possession of the ball inside his area, but otherwise was composed throughout.
Spent most of the game in the unfamiliar position of right-back, and only once cut inside onto his stronger left-foot to shoot. Reliable as ever, but not as prominent in an attacking sense as he can be.
In for the suspended Gary Warren, and played with discipline and intent. A strong defender who was solid and reliable throughout.
A less controversial display than the semi-final, when his handball was one of the defining moments. A mobile centre-back, but did find Botti Biabi's pace and elusiveness difficult to deal with.
Was having a good game, attacking dynamically down the left, until he stumbled on the ball inside his own half. Had to be dismissed when he then brought down Blair Alston, and left the field in tears.
Another hard-working display in central midfield, but was less prepared to try his luck with shots from distance than he normally does.
Covered a lot of ground in central midfield as he always does. The industry was particularly necessary when Inverness were reduced to 10 men, but was fortunate when the ball bounced off his knee into his arm on edge of penalty area and he wasn't penalised.
Burst past Peter Grant and Jamie MacDonald to slide the ball into the empty net for the opening goal and stretched the Falkirk defence with his pace and direct running. Also involved in the winning goal, with his shot pushed into Vincent's path.
Created the opening goal for Watkins with a clever reverse pass and was the busiest of Inverness's creative players in the opening half.
Had licence to drift in off right flank but struggled to impose himself on the game. Was expected to be a creative force, but looked forlorn when he was substituted in the 72nd minute for the eventual match-winner Vincent.
Mostly played in a deeper position behind Watkins, but won plenty of high balls in the air and kept up his work rate deep into the game.
Kept on at his players in the second half when Falkirk were in the ascendancy and his willingness to always be positive was eventually rewarded.
Made some regulation saves with typical competence, but will feel that he should have held Watkins' shot rather than push it straight out to Vincent.
Struggled in the first-half with Doran and Tremarco attacking down the left. Was involved in attack after the break, but crosses were seldom effective enough.
Was otherwise having a commanding game, but his slip and misjudgement of the flight of the ball allowed Watkins to break upfield for the winning goal. Looked distraught after the final whistle.
Powerful in the air and made three excellent recovery tackles in the first-half. Topped off an impressive display with the header for Falkirk's equaliser.
Spent the first-half defending and he second-half attacking. The delivery of the ball with his left foot was always effective.
Clipped a volley over when the ball bounced to him inside the area and delivered the free-kick for Grant's equaliser. Was otherwise quieter than might have been expected.
Along with Grant, Falkirk's best performer. Anchored the midfield, passed the ball well and peppered shots on target throughout the game. Unfortunate to be on the losing side.
A busy, terrier-like performance in midfield. Hared around after the ball and played his part as Falkirk dominated possession in the second half.
Played his way to greater prominence after the break, when he moved to a more conventional central midfield role. Passed the ball cleverly and was always capable of carrying it past opponents with his elusive running.
Started on the left flank and made a couple of runs in behind Shinnie in the first-half, but failed to capitalise. Moved up front after the break, but was replaced by Biabi, who was more effective.
Ran the channels and was always available for the ball. Never really had a clear chance on goal, but contributed to Falkirk's build up play until he eventually ran out of stamina late in the game.
His team was well organised in the first-half, but switch to 4-4-2 at the break allowed them to take control of the game and Falkirk deserved to equalise. Did all that he could to influence the outcome of the game.
