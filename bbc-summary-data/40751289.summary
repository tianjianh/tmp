The move, a day after Sauber cancelled their planned switch to Honda engines next year, is a continuation of a relationship that started in 2010.
Sources say the deal is likely to see French Formula 2 frontrunner Charles Leclerc, a Ferrari protege, promoted to Formula 1 with Sauber in 2018.
The deal is for latest-spec engines the Ferrari works team will use - Sauber are using year-old engines this season.
The team this year run Swede Marcus Ericsson and German Pascal Wehrlein. Ericsson's backers are part-owners of the team but Wehrlein is funded by Mercedes.
Team principal Frederic Vasseur said the partnership would "allow us to move forward swiftly and efficiently".
