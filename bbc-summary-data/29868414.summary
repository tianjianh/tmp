Four youths wearing Scream-type masks attacked the 22-year-old as she walked along Sunningdale Road in Denton, Greater Manchester on Friday night.
After being dragged to the ground and sexually assaulted, the woman fought off the gang and raised the alarm.
Police said one youth was chubby and in his early teens while another was tall and wore white trainers.
The attackers were wearing dark clothing.
Supt Neil Evans of Greater Manchester Police said the victim had suffered a "traumatic ordeal".
"Anyone who has been a victim of sexual assault will know just how frightening it must have been for this victim," he said.
"Given the offenders were wearing masks designed to be scary means it must have been a truly harrowing and scary few minutes for this woman.
"She was pushed to the floor and sexually assaulted, leaving her in a state of total shock, and clearly she is extremely distressed."
