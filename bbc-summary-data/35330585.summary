[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton moved up to third in the Championship by beating 10-man Huddersfield, whose five-game unbeaten run in the league came to an end.

Anthony Knockaert set up both goals for the hosts, firstly teeing up Bobby Zamora to send a first-time finish past Town goalkeeper Jed Steer.
Harry Bunn equalised, nodding in Tommy Smith's centre before half-time.
Knockaert crossed for sub James Wilson to head Brighton's winner, before Smith was sent off for two yellow cards.
Former Leicester midfielder Knockaert also hit the post in an excellent personal display which set up a second successive league win for Chris Hughton's side.
With Burnley and Derby facing each other on Monday, Albion took the chance to move up a couple of places in the table, while they are only five points behind second-placed Middlesbrough.
Zamora, who had ended Brighton's six-game goal drought in the 1-0 win at Blackburn seven days earlier, found the net for the second game in a row.
The 35-year-old cleared a corner from inside his own six-yard box and was on hand to meet Knockaert's pass after a swift counter-attack.
Brighton once again failed to keep a clean sheet at home - they have not done so since a 0-0 draw with Preston on 24 October - but it proved academic as Wilson scored the third goal of his loan spell from Manchester United.
Huddersfield's recent momentum was halted by their defeat in Sussex, but the Terriers remain eight points above the bottom three.

Brighton manager Chris Hughton on James Wilson: "The intention is to give him valuable experience and be regularly involved in games. It will toughen him up physically.
"He knows what the Championship is all about now and that is valuable experience for him.
"Ultimately, he'll be sent back after half a season's experience at this level. He scored a really good goal, he's having the benefit of hard-fought and aggressive games, and at the minute it is working out very well."
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner: "I think in the most part of the game we did quite well. If we had got something from the game it wouldn't have been unfair.
"I think it was important not to make early mistakes and unfortunately for us we did.
"In the second half there was nothing much between the sides but at 2-1 down we didn't create enough chances."
