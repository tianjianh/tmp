Flagship Perry Beeches Academy Trust paid Labour Party £5,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A flagship academy chain gave £5,000 to the Labour Party and spent £20,000 with a consultancy firm run by the wife of a school director, a report has found.

Perry Beeches Academy Trust, once praised by ex-prime minister David Cameron, has been criticised by watchdog the Education Funding Agency.
It breached Charity Commission regulations by sponsoring the Labour Finance and Industry Group. The money has since been returned, the EFA said.
The trust has adopted recommendations.
The EFA investigated the trust - which runs five schools in the city - in March after allegations of "novel and contentious use of trust funds and assets" and irregular expenditure.

Information from a whistleblower prompted the investigation, which found an additional salary of £160,000 was paid to chief executive Liam Nolan, over two years, through a third-party agreement - on top of his £120,000-a-year salary. He resigned in May.
The agency's full report, revealed on Thursday, details breaches and failures by the trust to follow its procurement processes.
It looked at how contracts and jobs were awarded and highlighted the employment of Mr Nolan's nephew and niece, the latter being promoted six times in three years.
There was also no evidence of tendering for contracts for legal and PR services worth thousands of pounds or reasons for the payments.
EFA key findings:
In a statement the trust said the report related to historical allegations and board of trustees resigned in April and a new management structure was in place.
The new team has been working "very closely" with the EFA and department for education "to move Perry Beeches The Academy Trust and its schools forward to a better future".
"All recommendations in the report have been adopted by the trust," the spokesman added.
