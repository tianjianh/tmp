Too early to decide on Carlton Cole, says Celtic boss Ronny Deila

Celtic manager Ronny Deila says it is too early to say whether Carlton Cole will join the club.

Cole, 31, is a free agent after leaving West Ham and is training with the Scottish Premiership champions.
"We have a good squad but we are always looking to improve," said Deila. "We are happy he is here.
"He is a target man. He's been good in the two exercises I've seen him doing but he needs more time. He hasn't trained for a while."
Deila, whose side host Raith Rovers in Wednesday's League Cup tie, did not commit to saying how long Cole's trial might run. And, when asked if it might be longer than a week, the Norwegian replied: "We will see how it comes."
Capped seven times by England, Cole has made over 380 senior club appearances, scoring 85 goals in the process, including spells at Chelsea, Aston Villa and the Hammers.
