John has previously dedicated a silver medal to William Lloyd's son (also named William), and the two were joined on the sofa by Lynne Holt, who arranged the transplant.
John hopes to win a darts medal in the Games, where over 700 people including organ donors and recipients will compete to raise awareness of organ donation in the UK.  For more information, including how to attend, visit the British Transplant Games website.
