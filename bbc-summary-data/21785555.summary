Developers behind a scheme to revamp a Swindon leisure centre site have revised the plans in order to ensure the "greatest customer satisfaction".

The new plans from Moirai Capital Investment Ltd will see all the elements of the Â£95m project brought under one roof at the Oasis site.
The scheme will see a snow dome, 7,500-seat concert venue and a hotel built.
Swindon Borough Council wants to transform the 36-year-old swimming pool and sports centre.
The authority said it cannot afford the refurbishment and has offered a 999-year lease on the centre in exchange.
A Morai spokesman said the changes were an "important development" in the planning process of the scheme.
He said: "They reflect a fundamental reconsideration of how the various elements of the scheme work together.
The developers said they wanted to make Swindon the leading town in the South West for sport and recreation.
In addition to the existing Oasis facilities, the scheme will also include a ten-pin bowling hall, multiplex cinema, and restaurants and bars.
The plans will be the subject of a further phase of public consultation.
Keith Williams, Swindon Borough Council's cabinet member for leisure, said: "Understandably there is a great deal of excitement surrounding the scheme and the leisure and employment benefits it will provide to Swindon."
It is hoped 1,700 jobs will be created by the development, of which 1,000 will be permanent.
Subject to planning permission being granted, Morai hopes work on the main development will begin in summer 2014.
