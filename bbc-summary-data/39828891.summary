They were among 150,000 people across Ireland who took part in the Darkness into Light walks to raise funds and awareness of suicide and self harm.
In Belfast, there were walks at Ormeau Park and at Hannahstown in the west of the city.
Walkers gathered at 04:15 BST to enjoy the beauty of sunrise.
Across Northern Ireland, there were also walks in Belleek, Cookstown, Derry, Lisnaskea, Newtownabbey, Rostrevor and Strabane.
The event is support by Electric Ireland.
The mission is to raise funds for the suicide and self harm charities, Pieta House and partnered charities such as Lighthouse.
The event started in 2009 when 400 people walked in Phoenix Park, Dublin.
Since then, it has spread to communities across Ireland and internationally.
