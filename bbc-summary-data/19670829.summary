"We had a good chat and he apologised to me, which was great," said Strauss, 35, who retired from all forms of cricket in August.
Pietersen was left out of England's tour to India on Tuesday.
The texts sent by the batsman to South Africans allegedly criticised Strauss and reportedly gave advice on how to get him out, although Pietersen denied he had offered tactical advice.
The former Middlesex player insisted that his decision to quit the sport had not been forced by the furore surrounding Pietersen, and instead cited poor form with the bat as the main "driver".
A statement issued on behalf of Pietersen after the news broke he would miss the upcoming tour claimed he had apologised to Strauss and also met new skipper Alastair Cook. On Friday Pietersen said he hoped to be back for February's tour of New Zealand.
Speaking at the Professional Cricketers' Association end-of-season awards in Battersea, Strauss told BBC Radio 5 liveSport: "It was good that we spoke and got a few things out in the open.

"We've always been good friends. It was an awkward time this summer for all sorts of people.
"I will have no problems meeting up with Kevin and having a beer with him, definitely.
"We've been through a lot together, we've had huge shared experiences, and nothing changes in that respect."
After the talks, Cook said he was hopeful that the 32-year-old will return to international duty, but reiterated that: "If the issues can be resolved, Kevin has said he is available for selection, but at the moment that can't happen."
Discussions between Pietersen and the England and Wales Cricket Board have been ongoing since the second Test against Proteas at Headingley, when the Surrey man himself cast doubts on his future - a claim he later backtracked from.
