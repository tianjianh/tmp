Merseyside Police's Protecting Vulnerable People Unit visited homes in Wirral, Liverpool, St Helens, Sefton and North Wales on Thursday.
They arrested 14 men for various offences including serious assault, rape, sexual assault, and harassment.
Police said the operation showed victims they would be taken seriously.
Det Supt Chris Green said: "These arrests have been for alleged offences such as choking a woman in front of her children, coercing a partner into non-consensual sex, sending threatening text messages to an ex-girlfriend, and even the attempted robbery of a relative.
"These kind of offences can all form part of a wider pattern of abusive, controlling behaviour that some vulnerable victims sadly suffer for many years before deciding to speak out."
