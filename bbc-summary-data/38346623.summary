Garry Reed joined Swimbridge Primary School in 1982, but retires this Christmas.
Known by his students as "a funny teacher with very good jokes", Mr Reed said he has never arrived at school in North Devon without looking forward to the day ahead.
Russell Hobby, the general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: "Mr Reed is one of the longest-serving heads in the country.
"What a fantastic achievement to have led a school so well for so long"
