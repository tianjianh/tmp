The world's last sea-going paddle steamer is celebrating the 70th anniversary of its maiden voyage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PS Waverley entered service on 16 June 1947, sailing from the Clyde, near Helensburgh, up Loch Long to Arrochar
She was given a celebratory send off with a piper in Glasgow before retracing her first voyage.
Among the 300 people travelling on board were two men who, as children, were passengers on that maiden sailing back in 1947.
Named after Sir Walter Scott's debut novel, she was the second steamship to bear the name PS Waverley
She was built as a replacement for another ship that was sunk during the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940 after being requisitioned as a minesweeper.
PS Waverley was launched the previous year, but materials were so short after the war, there were delays in fitting her boiler.
In 1975, at the end of her working life, she was famously bought for Â£1 by the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society.
She then began a second career as one of the country's best-loved tourist attractions, and now carries about 130,000 passengers a year.
Captain Ross Cochrane said: "Waverley's attraction lies in a mix of things - the heritage, history, social history, maritime history, engineering history and the scenery.
"But I think more than anything, it's just a great day out."
The ship is operated by Waverley Steam Navigation Company Limited.
