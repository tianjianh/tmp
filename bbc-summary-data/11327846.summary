HarperCollins, Christie's UK publisher since 1926, now becomes the legendary crime novelist's exclusive English language publisher worldwide.
CEO Brian Murray said the deal would "enable us to take the brand to even greater heights in the decades ahead".
Christie's grandson, Matthew Prichard, said the family was "delighted".
"My grandmother herself valued her relationship with Collins enormously," he continued.
"It is a tribute to both the lasting popularity of Agatha Christie and the professionalism of HarperCollins that such a long and important publishing partnership will be renewed and expanded."
Christie's novels and short stories have never been out of print since her death in 1976.
The popularity of her work in India has made her one of the country's top 10 English language authors.
