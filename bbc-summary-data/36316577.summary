The list, tweeted by the NHS Grampian Archives account, details causes of admission to the Aberdeen Lunatic Asylum in 1847.
Among the more conventional conditions are death of relatives, fright and head injuries.
Less conventional symptoms include irregular habits and vegetable poison.
The entry on tea attributes "sedentary lifestyle - abuse of tea" as a supposed cause.
NHS Grampian said: "Some of these terms would never be used today, however, documents like this provide a valuable insight into the past."
The health board is urging people to discuss their experiences of mental health, as part of Mental Health Awareness Week.
This year's theme is relationships.
