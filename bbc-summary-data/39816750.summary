The Conservatives now hold 51 seats, Labour have 10, UKIP have lost their only seat and the Independents have had their two seats cut to one.
"I think it's a vote of confidence by the electorate in what we've been doing for the past eight years and a vote in confidence in our future together in Staffordshire," Mr Atkins said.
Ms Woodward: "I'm very disappointed to lose some fantastic colleagues up and down the county; we'll be a much depleted group.
"I'm delighted that my own electors have kept their faith in me and I've been re-elected."
