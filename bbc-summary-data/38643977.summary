Barrow 3-0 Lincoln City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League leaders Lincoln were well beaten by Barrow ahead of their FA Cup fourth-round tie with Championship leaders Brighton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Imps boss Danny Cowley had initially named the same side which started the FA Cup third-round replay against Ipswich, but was forced to make a late change as Sam Habergham was injured during the warm-up so Sean Long came in at left-back.
Barrow - hoping to break into the top six following a winless start to their league action in 2017 - took an early lead through forward Byron Harrison after a free-kick was pumped into the Lincoln penalty area.
Although Lincoln had chances to get back into the match, Richard Bennett secured all three points for the home side on the hour when he converted a knockdown from Paul Turnbull before substitute Ross Hannah added a third from the penalty spot in stoppage time.
