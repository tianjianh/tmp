[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Wales' oldest woman' Nellie Robinson dies aged 109

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman believed to be the oldest in Wales has died aged 109.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Widow Nellie Robinson was born in Yorkshire but spent most of her life in north Wales.
She had been living at the Hafod Mawddach care home in Barmouth, Gwynedd, but died after a short illness in hospital in Bangor.
Her grandson Lee Knight said she was a "typically forthright" Yorkshirewoman who would be well-remembered in Meirionnydd.
Mrs Robinson, who previously lived in Llanfair, near Harlech, began work as a 13-year-old, sewing buttons onto World War One soldiers's uniforms.
Sandra Campbell, manager of the care home, said: "Mrs Robinson lived here for about a year and we're all very sad at her passing.
"It was an honour and a privilege to have met Mrs Robinson, she was a caring and thoughtful lady."
The longest living person in Wales is now believed to be Gwenllian Davies of Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire, who is also 109.
