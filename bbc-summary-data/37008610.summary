The game was first announced in 2014 but suffered delays and a legal challenge over its name from satellite television broadcaster Sky.
It will reach the UK on Wednesday, and PC gamers across the rest of the galaxy on Friday.
BBC Click's Marc Cieslak spoke to its creator Sean Murray, to find out how the game's enormous universe was developed.
