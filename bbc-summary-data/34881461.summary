Paris attacks: Book of condolence for British victim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A book of condolence has been opened for a British man who died in the Paris attacks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nick Alexander 35, of Colchester, Essex, was killed at the Bataclan concert hall, where he was selling band merchandise.
He was a member of St Andrew's Church in Weeley and had been attending since he was a child.
Reverend David Newman said Mr Alexander visited him there just a few weeks ago, having heard he was ill.
He said it was "typical of him to think of others and to actually do something about it."
He said he learned of Mr Alexander's death from his family who worship at the church, where the book can be signed.
"He was a very intelligent boy all the way along. As a youngster, he was always reliable and also good fun.
"He was very thoughtful in his dealings with the older members of the church," he said.
From his earliest days, he was "charming, had integrity and was encouraging of others", he added.
He said the church is in a "complete sense of shock" not only at the "suddenness of the death of a young man" but also at "the wicked arbitrariness of the killing of so many people."
The Anglican vicar said people are starting to think how this "desperately negative event" can be turned into something positive.
"Above all we need to hold on to the memories of a positive young man who lived his life in a very fulfilling way," he said.
An online fundraising page for Mr Alexander's family has raised nearly Â£60,000.
