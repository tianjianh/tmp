The reigning Olympic champions will run again at 00:00 BST and must beat the time set by eighth-fastest China.
Britain's women finished second (41.93 seconds) behind fastest qualifiers Jamaica (41.79) to progress.
The US men qualified fastest (37.65) with Jamaica, without Usain Bolt for the heat, fifth fastest and GB seventh.

A mix-up between Allyson Felix and English Gardner on the second changeover saw the US women out of contention in the second heat.
However, they were judged on appeal to have been obstructed after and will race again later on Thursday.
"I think I got propelled at about 20 miles an hour," said Felix. "When a foreign object comes in front of you, it's going to mess up the momentum and the handover."
There was another shock in the women's event as Dafne Schippers made a changeover error, leading to the Dutch - European champions - going out in the heat.
