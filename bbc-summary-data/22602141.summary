Toby Hockley was on the 100-mile Boudicca Sportive ride in Norfolk on Sunday when he was struck by a car and flung into a hedge, he said.
The incident is being linked to a comment on Twitter by a Norwich woman.
It read: "Definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier. I have right of way - he doesn't even pay road tax!"
The tweet included the hashtag "#Bloodycyclists".
The message has been forwarded to Norfolk Police, who are investigating.
Mr Hockley, 29, from Norwich, was riding with Iceni Velo cycling club on a narrow country lane, about five miles away from the end of the route at Snetterton.
"A car came tearing round the blind corner and narrowly missed a cyclist in front of me," he said.
"She came on to my side of the road, I took the wing mirror off and I went flying off my bike into a hedge.
"She hit me hard, really hard. I am lucky to be alive.
"But I managed to get out of the hedge and stand up.
"The car was nowhere to be seen. She hit me and she was gone.
"All I know is that it was a blonde girl driving."
The freelance chef said he felt battered and bruised but was able to finish the course after a few roadside fixes to his bike.
"I burst out laughing, I couldn't believe how lucky I was and that I was still in one piece," he said.
The comment on Twitter suggested Toby Hockley, as a cyclist, does not pay "road tax".
A road tax does not exist in the UK but the term is commonly and incorrectly used to refer to the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), or "car tax" paid on most motorised vehicles as a tax on emissions.
Roads are funded by all UK taxpayers under general and local taxes.

"I had a hug with my co-rider at the side of the road and was just full of adrenaline.
"But when I finished, the aches and pains set in and I had a bit of sulk in the cafe and had an ice-cream."
Mr Hockley said he was planning to keep the incident to himself so as not to worry his girlfriend but changed his mind after reading Twitter.
"I think she came across as a very silly girl and made herself look like a bit of a fool," he said.
"I'm not angry, I would just like it known that her stupid comment that I don't pay road tax is not an excuse to treat cyclists like second-class citizens."
The woman's Twitter account has been removed.
Norfolk Police said it was investigating and had spoken to both parties.
