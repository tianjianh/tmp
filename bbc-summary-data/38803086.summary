Ed Slater: Leicester Tigers lock handed two-week striking ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester lock Ed Slater has been banned for two weeks by an independent disciplinary panel for striking Glasgow prop Zander Fagerson.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old was cited following video evidence from the 43-0 European Champions Cup defeat by the Warriors.
Slater, who had already been given a two-week club ban, will be free to play again on 6 February.
His disciplinary record, guilty plea and "expression of remorse" saw the four week sanction reduced by half.
As the Tigers' second-rower would have feasibly been considered for Anglo-Welsh Cup fixtures this past weekend, he is deemed to have already served one week of the suspension.
