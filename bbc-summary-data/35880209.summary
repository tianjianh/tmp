After a four-year break to pursue solo projects, the band has got back together to try and build on the 25 top 40 hits they had between 1997 and 2012.
The Wonder Stuff, whose hits have included Size Of  A Cow and Dizzy with comedians Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, will also play Loopallu.
The festival will be held on 30 September and 1 October.
Other acts confirmed include The Selector, Galleon Blast - folk rockers whose line up includes BBC Radio DJ Mark Radcliffe - Manran and Lucy Spraggan, who appeared in 2012's X Factor competition.
