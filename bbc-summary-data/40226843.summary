General election 2017: Welsh MPs wait on Conservative reshuffle news

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Conservative members of Theresa May's government are waiting to hear if they have kept their ministerial jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite losing her majority in the general election, Mrs May remains prime minister with support from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists.
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns and his junior minister Guto Bebb kept their Vale of Glamorgan and Aberconwy seats.
Brexit Minister David Jones saw off a challenge from Labour to hold Clwyd West.
In a shock result, the Conservatives fell eight seats short of the 326 seats needed to maintain control of the House of Commons, but will stay in power under what is expected to be an informal arrangement with the 10-strong Democratic Unionist group.
Mrs May has faced calls to quit from within her own party, with Anna Soubry saying she should consider her position after a "disastrous" campaign.
However, other MPs have urged her to stay on, with Iain Duncan Smith saying a leadership contest would be a "catastrophe".
On Friday, Mrs May confirmed five top cabinet ministers would remain in place, including Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In Wales, the Conservatives lost three seats to Labour despite hoping to make gains.
Welsh Conservative policy director, Darren Millar AM, blamed a campaign which he said focused too much on the personality of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn instead of promoting a "positive vision for the future".
Cabinet Office Minister Ben Gummer was one of a number of Conservative ministers who lost their seats in a Labour fightback, leaving vacancies to be filled in a reshuffle.
In reassembling her ministerial team, Mrs May will be under pressure to choose figures who will help unify the party and restore her authority following a disappointing election result.
Mr Jones, a prominent Brexit campaigner and former Welsh secretary who was brought back into government by Mrs May, told BBC Radio Wales on Friday she was "the strongest leader we have at the moment".
