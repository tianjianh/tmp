The Scrap Trident Coalition's Bairns Not Bombs demonstration aims to shut down the base, which is home to the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system.
Protesters were due to gather outside every gate to the base from 07:00 in an attempt to stop workers from entering.
The blockade, which is part of a series of events organised by Scrap Trident, is due to last until 15:00.
It is aimed at focusing attention on the UK's nuclear deterrent in the run up to next month's general election.
Groups of protestors chained themselves together outside the gate ahead of the shift change at the base. About 40 police officers were standing in front of the entrance.
Thousands attended a march and rally in Glasgow city centre earlier this month to call on the UK government to abandon plans to replace Trident.
Over the weekend leading figures in music, the arts and science, including Nobel prize winner Professor Peter Higgs, comedian Frankie Boyle and Mercury prizewinning band Young Fathers, called for the nuclear deterrent to be scrapped in a letter to the Observer.
The nuclear weapons system came to the fore of the election campaign last week after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon confirmed that a Conservative government would go ahead with the construction of four new Trident nuclear missile submarines to replace the existing fleet of ageing Vanguard-class boats.
He warned that the deterrent would be put at risk by the prospect of Labour leader Ed Miliband entering into a pact with the anti-Trident SNP in the event of a hung parliament in May.
Mr Miliband insisted that Labour is fully committed to renewing the Trident submarine missile fleet.
The SNP opposes the principle of nuclear weapons, with leader Nicola Sturgeon having said that halting the renewal of Britain's nuclear deterrent would be her "absolute priority" if her party holds the balance of power in May.
The Scottish Greens - whose co-convener Patrick Harvie is taking part in the demonstration - also wants the UK's nuclear weapons scrapped.
The Liberal Democrats have said it is "extremely expensive and unnecessary" to replace all four Trident submarines and have proposed a fewer number of vessels instead, which would only be deployed under increased threat from a nuclear-armed country, as opposed to being permanently on patrol.
