A New Zealand jiu-jitsu athlete claims he was "kidnapped" in Rio de Janeiro.

Jason Lee, 27, tweeted: "What did you guys get up to yesterday? I got kidnapped. Go Olympics! #Rio2016."
The athlete says he was taken by men in police uniform and forced to withdraw money from two cash machines.
Lee has been living in Brazil for 10 months, but is not participating in next month's Rio Games - which begin on 5 August - because jiu-jitsu is not an Olympic sport.
Meanwhile, the Australian Olympic team are refusing to move their athletes into the Rio Olympic Village because of concerns about the state of their accommodation.
