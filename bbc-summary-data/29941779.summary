The match against Germany on Sunday, 23 November is a sell-out after the Football Association capped ticket sales because of engineering works on the London Underground.
"We apologise to anyone disappointed but this is a sensible decision based on travel advice," said the FA.
The match, which kicks off at 15:00 GMT, will be shown live on BBC Two.
England's previous largest crowd was 29,092 at Etihad Stadium for a Euro 2005 victory over Finland.
The FA was hoping for a crowd of around 30,000 for the game against Germany, but, with more than 20,000 tickets sold in the last 10 days, the decision to halt sales was made.
The organisation added that, in making the decision, it took into account a previous men's game between England and Andorra in 2009, which attracted 58,000 fans with similar travel restrictions in place.
Both England and European champions Germany have qualified for the 2015 World Cup, which takes place in Canada in June.
