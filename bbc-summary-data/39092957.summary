Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson says his team's performance in Saturday's draw at United Newcastle proved their commitment to the club.

City, who had lost 10 of their previous 13 games, led 2-0 at St James' Park, before the hosts fought back to level.
The Robins are two only points above the relegation zone, though they have a game in hand on 22nd-placed Wigan.
"We were outstanding as a club today. The staff, the players, the fans all came together," said Johnson.
"I was just proud of the club today. There has been a lot of stick flying about this week and rightly so, and of course I bear the brunt of it.
"The players have produced and if anyone was ever in doubt that this was a committed bunch of players then today they will have seen that."
Newcastle's comeback was the second time in the past four games that Bristol City have dropped points from a healthy winning position, having drawn 3-3 with Derby on 11 February after taking a three-goal lead.
"It's not easy but for me, as a young manager having dealt with a tough week and then come against one of the world's leading managers in Rafael Benitez, you take your lessons," added Johnson.
"Today I think we've shown our worth as a staff, as a team and as a club."
