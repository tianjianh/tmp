An infants and nursery school gutted by fire is set to reopen next week, but it is not yet known if all pupils will be able to return at the same time.

The blaze broke out at Coed Eva Primary School, in Cwmbran, at about 02:25 GMT on New Year's Day.
Torfaen council said it would build temporary classrooms within two weeks but rain could delay their installation.
Four teenage boys have been arrested and bailed pending further inquiries.
A council spokesman said the insurance company would only cover the cost of the existing building, which would be minimal compared to the cost of a new building.
Following a meeting with staff, insurers, governors and the council, head teacher Gill Ellis said everyone had been "overwhelmed" by the response from the community.
"Our priority is to now make the school safe for all pupils, restore power to the junior building, and make plans to accommodate the 210 nursery and infant pupils displaced by the fire," she said.
"Staff have started compiling lists of essential equipment that is required to help us deliver an appropriate level of education in the short-term, including items such as pens, paper, desks, chairs, ITC equipment and lockers.
"The school will be shut for the remainder of this week and we are working towards reopening on Monday. I want to thank people for all their messages of support."
Teachers are now considering plans to accommodate all pupils on site using temporary classrooms and extra space in the junior school building.
Meanwhile, demolition workers have assessed the site and fencing will be erected around the fire-damaged building.
Dermot McChrystal, Torfaen council's chief education officer, said a replacement school could take two years, but the priority was to ensure the school's 500 pupils could return to education soon.
