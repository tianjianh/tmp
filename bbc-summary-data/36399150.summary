Cinderford Town have refused promotion to the Southern League Premier Division after winning their league, prompting their manager and some players to quit.

They became Division One South & West champions in April but have chosen not to go up for financial reasons.
Cinderford chairman Ashley Saunders has also resigned from the club.
"I would've liked them to go up and give it a crack and go out there and find extra sponsors," former boss John Brough told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"Luckily with a lot of hard work we achieved what I wanted but, unfortunately, behind the scenes it hasn't gone as well as it has on the pitch."
"I spoke to Stuart [Tait, club committee member] and decided that I wouldn't take the job on for this year with the circumstances."
Saunders, the Gloucestershire-based club's long-standing chairman, resigned last week ahead of the decision, which had to be made before a league deadline.
It means Lincolnshire side Stamford AFC, who finished fourth from bottom and were originally relegated from the Northern Premier League, have been allowed to stay up.
"It was a decision that was for the benefit of the club," Tait told BBC Points West. "We couldn't burden the club to go up with that possibility of doing a Hereford or a Salisbury and coming out.
"We just needed to make sure that we've got a firm foundation."
