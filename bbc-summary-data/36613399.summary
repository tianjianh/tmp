The 31-year-old has won gold medals at the last two Games but will not travel to Brazil this summer.
James led the Cavaliers to the NBA title last week but said on Thursday: "I could use the rest".
James, the NBA's four-time Most Valued Player, is the US team's all-time scoring leader with 273 points and second in career rebounds with 95.
The US are already without Golden State Warriors star Steph Curry, as well as James Harden and Chris Paul.
