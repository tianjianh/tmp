Sonupe was released by Tottenham at the end of last season, having failed to make a senior appearance for the club.
The 20-year-old had a loan spell with St Mirren in 2015, playing in four Scottish Premiership games.
"We will work with him, we will develop him and we think he can develop into an asset for us," manager Rob Page said.
