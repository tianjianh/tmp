[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Modi adviser helps Labour to woo British Indians

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the men credited with the successful election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is urging British Indians to reconnect with the Labour Party.

Manoj Ladwa, a London-based political strategist, is the founder of Indians for Labour, a platform for Indians in Britain to talk to Labour politicians and policy makers.
Mr Ladwa, Mr Modi's director of communications during India's general election in 2014, says Labour needs to do more to appeal to aspirational Indian voters in the UK following its disastrous election result.
A lifelong Labour supporter, Mr Ladwa says the message from Indian doorsteps during the election campaign was clear - Labour needs to re-engage with Indians in Britain.
"A lot of British Indians that I've been speaking to feel that the Labour Party did not address the aspirational vote," he told the BBC Asian Network, in an exclusive interview.
"What about the people in the middle classes, people that traditionally have small businesses, are professionals, that have been sympathetic to the Labour Party, and often significant tax payers."
That's a view echoed by company director Senna Atwal. Although he voted for Labour in previous elections, he said he didn't feel the party offered anything for him in 2015. "I don't think Labour. . . has any support for businesses, and they don't think about entrepreneurial individuals. It was really evident that they were on the back foot."
It is highly likely that Labour politicians have heard this many times since 8 May, but they seem to be in a listening mood.
"We have to have the humility to recognise that the voters are always right," says Sadiq Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting in South London, who is seeking the party's nomination to be London mayor.
"We've got to ask ourselves the questions, to learn the lesson of that defeat and win back the trust and confidence of people who in the past have voted Labour, but now are not."
British Asian voters have traditionally been Labour supporters, but in a BBC Asian Network/ICM poll before the election nearly 25% were undecided about which party to support and 39% said they may change their minds.
A poll for think tank British Future conducted after the election suggests the Conservatives are gaining a greater share of the ethnic minority vote.
In 2010, Labour had 68% of the ethnic minority vote, compared with the Conservatives' 16%.
In 2015, Labour was still in the lead at 52%, but the Conservatives managed to get a third of ethnic minority votes, with the biggest leap amongst British Asians.
Nearly half of Hindus and Sikhs questioned for the Survation survey - in which more than 2,000 people took part - said they voted Conservative. This compared with 25% of Muslims.
If these results were extrapolated across the estimated three million ethnic minority voters in the UK as a whole, the think tank said it would equate to 1.6 million votes for Labour and a million for the Conservatives - the Tories' largest ever figure.
Dr Maria Sobolewska, a lecturer in politics at the University of Manchester, says Labour should be focusing on retaining all ethnic minority voters, rather than concentrating on Indian voters.
"We know that their emotional attachment to the party is getting weaker and weaker," she says.
"At every single election, we see fewer of them identifying as Labour Party supporters, so it's not just the Indians, even though the Indians are the ones who seem to be going the fastest."
Whether the Labour Party and its politicians are able to translate new aspirational policies to attract Indian voters remains to be seen.
The party's desire to reset its appeal to entrepreneurs and middle class voters is a work in progress and Sadiq Khan says they have a lot of work to do before the next election in 2020.
"We've got to be going far more door to door, temple to temple, mosque to mosque to mosque, gurdwara to gurdwara," he says.
"We've got to get away from this 'gatekeeper' politics. Lazy politicians of all parties have relied upon community elders to pass the message to them (voters). We've got to move on from that."
Manoj Ladwa hopes to reiterate this message through Indians for Labour, not just to reconnect voters with the party, but because he thinks Indians in Britain have a crucial role to play economically and culturally.
"There are 1.5 million Indians in this country and India as a country is now emerging as a great economic superpower. Therefore Indians in this country will play a very important role as bridge builders between the UK and India."
