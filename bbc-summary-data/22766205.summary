Cambridge City FC Sawston stadium proposal quashed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals for a new stadium for a city football team may need to be rethought after they were not adopted as part of a council's long-term development plan.

Cambridge City FC had hoped to build a 3,000-capacity ground on land near Sawston in Cambridgeshire.
Following a consultation, South Cambridgeshire District Council said concerns were raised about loss of green belt land and increased traffic.
Club chairman Kevin Satchell said it was "a setback, but we'll push on".
Last month the district and city council also rejected a proposal for a new stadium for the city's other team, Cambridge United, again failing to adopt its initial plans for a site at Trumpington.
However, Cambridge City - a Southern League Premier Division club - is currently "homeless", as its Milton Road ground was sold to developers in 2006.
It will groundshare with nearby team Histon FC until a permanent location can be found.
A public consultation on proposals for a stadium at Dales Manor Business Park in Sawston resulted in 133 objections and 58 representations in support, district councillor for the area, David Bard said.
"So the town was fairly clear," he added.
Mr Satchell added: "It is disappointing because the feedback was not as positive as we had hoped.
"It's a setback to our plans but it is not the end of the road."
Councillor Pippa Corney, the council's cabinet member for planning policy, said: "While we've ruled out the current proposals for a Cambridge City FC stadium in Sawston, if the club is able to find a suitable site in south Cambridgeshire, where planning permission can be granted, we will work with them and the community to make it a success."
