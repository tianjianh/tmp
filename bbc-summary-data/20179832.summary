Digital Goldfish, which creates content for mobile phones, has been purchased for an undisclosed sum.
The company has confirmed that its 15 staff will remain in Dundee.
Ninja Kiwi, founded in Auckland in 2006, has produced about 60 games, including the popular Bloons series. The two firms had been working closely together for several years.
The relationship had seen Digital Goldfish developing the mobile versions of Ninja Kiwi games Bloons and Bloons TD.
The firm will now focus on expanding the New Zealand developer's reach on mobile platforms.
Chris Harris, co-founder of Ninja Kiwi, said: "The Digital Goldfish guys have been great partners for us and have great depth of skill in mobile games development.
"As we continue to build our mobile games reach, joining forces with the Digital Goldfish team is just awesome.
"Blending their mobile expertise with our IP and player base has worked really well for us to date, so this acquisition is strategically very strong for us."
The Dundee team will continue under the management Digital Goldfish co-founders David Hamilton and Barry Petrie.
Mr Petrie said: "What started as a simple license deal developed into the perfect partnership.
"We have collaborated on several successful titles together and racked up millions of downloads in the process. This deal made absolute sense for both parties and was a natural progressive step in the relationship between the two companies.
"We are delighted to become part of the Ninja Kiwi family and are excited for the future as we look to bring existing and new Ninja Kiwi IP to a variety of platforms."
