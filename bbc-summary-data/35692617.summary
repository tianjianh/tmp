Six Nations 2016: Manu Tuilagi in England squad for Wales game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester Tigers centre Manu Tuilagi has been named in a 33-man England training squad for the Six Nations game with Wales at Twickenham.

Tuilagi, who last played for England in 2014, has been out for 15 months with groin and hamstring problems.
Exeter flanker Dave Ewers is also included in the squad, after recovering from a knee injury.
England lead the Six Nations with three wins, while Wales are unbeaten going into the match on 12 March.
Tuilagi has scored 11 tries in 25 England appearances, but his career has been affected by off-field disciplinary problems, including jumping into Auckland harbour during the 2011 World Cup.
The Samoa-born 24-year-old was ruled out of the 2015 World Cup after he pleaded guilty to assaulting two female police officers, although he later said he had "owned up to what I've not done".
He returned to action for his club side Leicester in January but picked up a hamstring injury in his third game back, further delaying his international comeback.
Leicester team-mate Jean de Villiers says England are "better off" with the centre in the squad but believes Tuilagi should not be rushed back by head coach Eddie Jones.
"I can understand Eddie Jones would want to get him involved as soon as possible, but you have to make sure the short-term goals won't halt long-term progress," the former South Africa captain told BBC Radio 5 live.
"He needs to be playing international rugby for another 10 years, so you need to make the right decisions now."
De Villiers added: "Whether he starts or you bring him on for 20 minutes, he will make a big impact and England are better off.
"The balance of the side is so much better with someone like him there."
