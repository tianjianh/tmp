[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ashmolean Museum opens William Blake's studio exhibition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A recreation of the studio where William Blake created some of his most well-known work has opened in Oxford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Blake: Apprentice and Master has opened at the Ashmolean Museum after 19th Century floor plans were unearthed.
Blake created the majority of his books from a printing studio in the Hercules Buildings in Hercules Road, Lambeth.
The studio was destroyed when the building was razed in 1918.
Philip Pullman CBE, president of the Blake Society, said: "William Blake was a complete original; his power was his tenderness, his wit, his graphic line are like no-one else's.
"It's good to remind people every so often about this colossal imagination and his moral vision, which are just as potent now after two hundred years as they were when he brought them into the world."
The exhibition is on until 1 March 2015.
