Clomiphene, which increases testosterone, was detected in the Pontypool player's sample following a Swalec Championship game against Bridgend in October 2015.
Pontypool have sacked lock Scanlon, who cannot play until 23 October, 2017.
He is the 14th registered Welsh Rugby Union player to be on UK Anti-Doping (Ukad)'s list of banned sportspeople.
"All sportspeople are responsible for what they ingest and any substances found in their system, regardless of how they got there," said Ukad legal director Graham Arthur.
"This can be a challenging concept at all levels of sport and athletes must manage the risk of doping at all times by maximising their nutrition first and thoroughly researching all supplements before use."
Scanlon's ban comes in the wake of Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead saying a "societal problem" could be the cause of drug use in Welsh rugby.
During the investigation into Scanlon's failed test, Ukad said he told them via email he was "uncertain as to the source of the clomiphene detected, but believed the source may have been some 'T-booster' (testosterone-booster) tablets ingested sometime in August 2015 when he was recovering from two successive injuries".
In a statement, Pontypool said: "Ukad confirmed that it did not seek to establish that the violation committed by Scanlon was done with intent."
Pontypool chief executive Ben Jeffreys said the club "abides by a zero tolerance policy" on drug use.
Jeffreys added: "This is an exceptionally saddening case that reinforces the importance of all athletes remaining vigilant in ensuring that they are aware of everything they ingest into their system.
"Throughout this process, Adam has conducted himself with impeccable professionalism and has taken full responsibility for this situation.
"Though Adam has been relieved of his sporting duties with Pontypool RFC, he will continue to play a central role in participating in the club's WRU accredited drugs awareness educational programmes, which are conducted on a regular basis."
