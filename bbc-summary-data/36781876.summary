Stephen Muncaster, 47, was found shortly after midnight on Tuesday in the front garden of a property in Magdalen, near King's Lynn.
His wife Allison, 48, was discovered inside the lounge.
Mr Muncaster's nephew, 2002 National Lottery winner Michael Carroll, has declined to comment on the case.

The lottery winner was living with Mr Muncaster and his since estranged wife Kelly at the Magdalen home when he scooped a Â£9.7 million jackpot aged 19 in 2002.
Mr Carroll became known as the "Lotto lout" when he collected his winnings wearing an electronic tag.
He hit the headlines as he gave away chunks of his fortune, but also gave sums to relatives including Mr Muncaster and his then wife Kelly.
Det Supt Paul Durham said the investigation was being treated as a "closed case" and no other parties were involved in the deaths.
Norfolk Police says it will be investigating the background of Stephen Muncaster and his wife Allison to see why "we ended with this catastrophic incident".
Local councillor Sandra Squire, whose Wimbotsham with Fincham Ward borders Magdalen, said: "Magdalen is a tiny village, most people don't even know it exists. We are completely stunned. It's horrendous.
"What concerns me most as a school governor is the road block for the incident is where some of the kids walk past.
"It is transition week anyway, which is very unsettling, so this is even more unsettling for them. Nothing gets past kids."
