[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother died after an emergency Caesarean section, having been refused an elective operation hours earlier, an inquest has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frances Cappuccini, 30, suffered a fatal haemorrhage at Tunbridge Wells Hospital in Kent on 9 October 2012.
A doctor and the NHS hospital trust were cleared of manslaughter in January 2016.
Her husband Tom told the inquest she pleaded with medics to save her life.
Mr Cappuccini said she told him: "If anything happens, just make sure you look after the boys."
He said she was "tearful, agitated and anxious" and had been terrified for months because of the difficult birth of their first son.
The inquest at Gravesend Old Town Hall was told Mrs Cappuccini endured a 12-hour labour despite telling hospital staff she had booked a Caesarean section.
The coroner heard that a piece of placenta had been left in her uterus which led to a large loss of blood.
The family's lawyer suggested the error might not have been made if her choice had been followed.
The inquest is expected to last 10 days.
