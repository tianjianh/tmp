[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inverness to remember executed nurse Edith Cavell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inverness is to hold a memorial service in honour of English World War One nurse Edith Cavell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Cavell served in a hospital in Belgium and treated Allied, as well as German and Austrian, soldiers.
She was executed by a German firing squad on 12 October 1915 after helping Allied prisoners of war to escape to Holland.
A dedication and memorial service will be held at a war memorial and gardens in Inverness named after her.
The events to be held on the 100th anniversary of her death will also see the unveiling of a new memorial stone to the nurse in the gardens.
Inverness' Cavell Gardens War Memorial was constructed to honour men from Inverness and the surrounding area who lost their lives in WW1.
It was one of many places dedicated to the nurse following international condemnation of her killing. After the war, the name of a mountain in Canada was changed to Mount Edith Cavell in her honour.
It now carries the names of armed forces personnel killed on operations and in training in the years since that conflict.
Highland Council and the Royal British Legion Scotland Inverness Branch have organised the commemoration.
Branch chairman Joe Davidson said: "We are proud to assist Highland Council with this venture to erect a new memorial to honour Edith Cavell - a lady who helped so many injured allied soldiers and the enemy alike. She showed great courage even in the face of death.
"She hid many French and Belgian civilians, as well as soldiers, and helped them with a safe passage to safety.
"She was urged to stop by her colleagues but refused, and was arrested on the 4 August 1915 and accused of treason.
"Her trial, it is said, lasted about four minutes and she was condemned to death. Her bravery and courage should be an inspiration to us all."
Ms Cavell was from Swardeston near Norwich.
Two films were also made about her war-time exploits - 1928's Dawn and 1939's Nurse Edith Cavell.
