The event will take place on the Gold Coast in Australia and will be the 17th consecutive Commonwealth Games to be covered by the organisation.
There will be no less than 180 hours of coverage across BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Sport website, iPlayer and radio.
"The Games never fail to deliver those moments that unite the nation," said BBC director of sport Barbara Slater.
"We're delighted that we'll be there to bring all of the action - free to air - to audiences across all of our platforms."
The 2014 Commonwealth Games took place in Glasgow and host country Scotland finished fourth overall in the medals table with a record haul of 19 golds and a best-ever overall tally of 53.
England topped the medal table for the first time in 28 years, Wales surpassed their target of 27 and Northern Ireland reaped their largest tally since the Games was last in Scotland in 1986.
David Grevemberg CBE, Commonwealth Games Federation chief executive, said: "I can't think of a more fitting day than Commonwealth Day to announce that our long-standing broadcast partner, the BBC, has secured our rights for the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games.
"The BBC has a proud and prolific Commonwealth sporting history, and following their inclusive, innovative and extensive free-to-air coverage from Glasgow 2014, I have no doubt that UK sports fans will be transported down under for an inspiring and memorable Games experience in two years' time."
The announcement follows confirmation earlier on Monday that the Games will feature the largest para-sport competition in Commonwealth sporting history, with 300 para-athletes and 38 medal events across seven sports.
