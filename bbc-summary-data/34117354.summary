Real released a statement saying they did everything they could to complete the £29m deal of the 24-year-old, but missed the deadline by two minutes.
But United say they submitted all the paperwork two minutes before 23:00 BST.
The Red Devils added: "The club is delighted that its fan-favourite double player of the year, David De Gea, remains a Manchester United player."
De Gea, who is out of contract next year, has not played this season.
Keylor Navas, 28 - who had been poised to move in the other direction - has been Real's number one since the club allowed Iker Casillas to join Porto.
De Gea joined United from Real's city rivals Atletico Madrid in 2011 in an £18.9m deal.
After several high-profile errors in his first few months in England, he established himself as one of the league's top keepers and made 175 United appearances in total.
United are now set to continue with four keepers for the Premier League season - De Gea, Sergio Romero, who has started all their games so far, Victor Valdes, whom the club failed to sell to Besiktas, and Sam Johnstone.
In January De Gea, who will now go on international duty with Spain, will be able to open talks over a free transfer move to Real next summer.
