EastEnders: Meet the Taylors, the new 'not-to-be-messed-with' family

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two real-life brothers, an actress who has played TWO previous roles in EastEnders, a bloke from Benidorm and a bearded dragon called Rooney - this is the new "not-to-be-messed-with" EastEnders family.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Taylors will, we are assured, make "quite an entrance" when they arrive in Albert Square this summer, giving the resident Walfordians "a rude awakening".
EastEnders executive producer Sean O'Connor describes them as "noisy and brash" who "lack cash" but "have love and warmth in spades".
The announcement has split opinion among fans on the soap's Facebook page, with some worried they are a stereotypical white working-class family and/or a pale imitation of the Millers.
Others have said there should be more ethnic minority families instead, or have questioned whether they would be able to afford to live in the East End these days.
But some are looking forward to what O'Connor described as their "explosive" impact on Walford life.
