330 of them were found hidden in suitcases after they were smuggled into Kuala Lumpar, Malaysia.
Wildlife officials believe they were going to be illegally sold.
The golden-domed ploughshare tortoise is native to Madagascar and, due to poaching, is the most endangered tortoise on the planet.
Madagascar's radiated tortoise is also nearing extinction due to hunting for food and to be kept as a pet - both of which are against the law.
All of the reptiles were found alive, and will now be returned to their home on Madagascar.
