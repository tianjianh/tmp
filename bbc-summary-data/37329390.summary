Easyjet pilots are considering strike action that could fall over the October half term, the airline has confirmed.

A ballot on industrial action is taking place and will conclude on 21 September, the pilots union Balpa said.
In a letter to pilots leaked to The Daily Telegraph, Balpa outlined strike action blaming a "dispute with Easyjet purely concerning pilot fatigue".
The airline said in a statement that it was "committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised".
If pilots vote in favour of industrial action, strikes could take place at any time after the ballot closes.
Balpa told pilots in its letter that "we have been forced to take such extreme measures".
It added: "The core issue of the dispute was that fatigue had risen year on year, to levels pilots and Balpa find unacceptable."
Easyjet, which has around 2,000 UK-based pilots, said pilots' workloads were set by the Civil Aviation Authority.
It said: "Although Balpa has informed us they are balloting their members, Easyjet and Balpa continue to work together...
"We still hope to reach a mutually agreeable solution".
Easyjet operates in more than 30 countries, flying to popular holiday destinations such as France, Italy and Spain.
