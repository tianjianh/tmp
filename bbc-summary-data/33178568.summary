[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross County have signed Stewart Murdoch after the 25-year-old midfielder left English League One side Fleetwood Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murdoch, who started his career with Falkirk, has signed a two-year contract with the Scottish Premiership club.
He left the Bairns to join Fleetwood in 2013 but only made 13 appearances for the side that finished 10th in the season just passed and was released.
Murdoch spent two months on loan to Northampton Town, playing 10 times for the League Two outfit.
He had made 48 appearances for Fleetwood in the previous season, helping them win promotion.
The Aberdeen-born player also has spells on loan to Berwick Rangers and East Fife while with Falkirk.
Murdoch becomes County's second signing in two days following the addition of former Hartlepool United left-back Darren Holden.
