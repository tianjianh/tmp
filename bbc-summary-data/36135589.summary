The striker has been out since February after suffering a knee injury, but has returned to full training.
If he can show he is back to full sharpness, he could regain his place in time to face Hibs at Hampden on 21 May.
"He's in good shape," said Rangers boss Mark Warburton, confirming Tuesday's game at Livingston will come too soon.
"It's just about making sure that he's ready to deliver a good level of performance on Sunday and then is ready for the cup final.
"I want to make sure he gets some training under his belt, but he'll definitely be involved against St Mirren."
Since securing the Championship title, winning the Petrofac Cup and knocking Celtic out of the Scottish Cup semi-final, Rangers have lost to Hibernian and drawn with Alloa, but Warburton insists his players' performance levels will not drop before the final.
The squad will be allowed four days off at the end of the league campaign, then travel south for a friendly, before returning for a week's training ahead of facing Hibs at Hampden.
"We trained very well today and kept it really sharp," Warburton said on Monday. "We have between now and 21 May to be in great shape for what is a huge game for us against a very tough opponent.
"There's no doubt we'll be prepared for that. It's been a tiring few days and if you look at the timing of it, Old Firm, in, playing on the Wednesday, in, it's been a constant with no days off, so it's important that we get the preparation right, deliver results.
"We'll prepare for Sunday and then have the build-up to the final."
Warburton was speaking at the launch of Rangers' season ticket renewal campaign, with prices returning to the same level as the club's last campaign in the top-flight five years ago.
"There's a responsibility on us to deliver a level of performance that is appropriate for that," Warburton added.
"We're not going up there to make up the numbers. The Rangers fans buying season tickets wouldn't accept us going for second, third, fourth, fifth.
"I'm not saying we're going to win it, but we're going to go into that league highly competitive and looking to win every game we go into."
Veteran striker Kenny Miller believes he can play a pivotal role when the club return to the Premiership.
The 36-year-old was frustrated on the sidelines earlier this season, but has scored 19 goals overall, and seven in his last 12 games, including the opening goal of the Old Firm semi-final.
"I feel brand new, I am looking forward to it," Miller said. "And I am looking forward to the cup final, what an opportunity for us to finish the season on a real high and achieve European football, which would be a fantastic achievement.
"We know we have a hard game against Hibs but we will be fully ready and prepared for them."
