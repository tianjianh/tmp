[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Scotland youth international Chris Johnston has signed for Raith Rovers after being released by Kilmarnock.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old winger, who has signed a one-year contract, has become Gary Locke's first capture as manager with the Scottish Championship club.
Winger Bobby Barr had agreed a move to Stark's Park from Greenock Morton under previous manager Ray McKinnon.
Johnston only played once last season because of a cruciate ligament injury.
He had made his debut for Kilmarnock in 2012 and went on to make 69 appearances for the Scottish Premiership club, where he worked for a year under Locke.
The 27-year-old Barr, who was previously with St Johnstone, Albion Rovers, Livingston and Brechin City, made 42 appearances for Rovers' Championship rivals last season.
As Barr arrived in Kirkcaldy, Rovers lost 25-year-old former Partick Thistle midfielder James Craigen, who joined Falkirk after scoring nine goals in 42 appearances for the Kirkcaldy club.
