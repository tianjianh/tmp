Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed they were undertaking excavation work at an address in Cullompton, Devon.
David Williams was jailed for life in 2015 and his wife Pauline for 12 years for putting 10 girls and boys through rape, sexual assault and beatings.
The couple became friends of the Wests in Gloucester in the 1980s.
A police spokesman said: "Following intelligence received, Devon and Cornwall Police are undertaking excavation work at a property in Cullompton, Devon.
"This relates to historic intelligence connected to the address and its former occupants. It is expected to take up to four days to complete.
"Specialist officers will be involved in the excavation, which we hope will have as little impact on the local community as possible."
Last year a court heard that David Williams had boasted of his connections with the Wests, who drank at the Prince Albert pub he ran in Gloucester.
The Williams, who are both in their 50s, started abusing children in the late 1980s when they were running the pub. One victim was seven years old.
They also ran the Victoria Inn in Exeter after moving to the city in the 1990s, where they went on to abuse a string of teenagers.
At their trial, they denied a total of 46 charges of sexual and physical abuse between 1989 and 2004.
David Williams was found guilty of 10 rapes, 13 indecent assaults, five counts of gross indecency, two of cruelty and one of sexual activity with a child.
His wife was found guilty of two rapes and five indecent assaults.
They were found not guilty of eight other allegations involving two other complainants.
Fred West was awaiting trial on 12 murder charges when he hanged himself in prison in January 1995. Rose West was convicted of 10 murders in November 1995 and is serving life.
The charges related to the deaths of young women over a 20-year period.
