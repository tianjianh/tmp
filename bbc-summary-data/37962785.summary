John Sheridan: Notts County could not beat a pub team, says boss after Blackpool loss

John Sheridan says Notts County's 4-0 loss at Blackpool was the worst of his managerial career, and that his side would not have beaten a pub team.

Notts, who have won just once in their past six League Two matches, face National League side Boreham Wood in an FA Cup first-round replay on Tuesday.
"We were totally inept," Sheridan told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"We could be playing the Red Lion on Tuesday and if we play like today any team will beat us."
With County already 3-0 down against the Seasiders, they were reduced to 10 men in the 79th minute after Vadaine Oliver was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Tom Aldred.
Sheridan admits they could have lost by "seven or eight" and was left "a very angry man" at full-time.
"I've been a manager for probably over 500 games now and that is probably the worst performance under my management," the former Oldham, Chesterfield, Plymouth Argyle and Newport County boss said.
"That is harsh for me to say, but I will not accept anything that went on today.
"We were a shambles. We didn't deserve anything and we didn't create a chance. If we are not at the races and perform like today we won't win any games for the rest of the season.
"I hope they realise they need to step up big time - if they don't, then there is something wrong with them."
Alan Smith, the 36-year-old former England, Leeds, Manchester United and Newcastle forward, was one player that drew some praise after the loss at Bloomfield Road.
"Smudge does all right for me. He is the only one that has a bit of fight about him," Sheridan said.
