A primary school will be closed for at least a week due to a mystery smell, Staffordshire County Council said.

About 20 pupils fell ill at Flash Ley Community Primary School and Nursery in Stafford which was evacuated on Friday.
Tests have been carried out to find the source of the unpleasant odour and the site may not open next week, a letter from headteacher Simon Barker said.
The council said some children were sick, but it is not yet known if the smell is connected to their illness.
It is understood parents reported children with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
Ben Adams, Staffordshire County Council's cabinet member for learning and skills, said: "The wellbeing of children and staff in schools is our top priority.
"A decision was therefore taken to close Flash Ley School as a precautionary measure due to a strong odour noticed in some parts of the school.
"Testing was carried out over the weekend and the school will remain closed all week until we receive the results and are satisfied that it is safe to re-open."
Mr Barker wrote to parents: "Although we were hoping to open on Thursday, unfortunately the school will have to remain closed until we receive the results of all tests and are satisfied that the wellbeing of children and staff will not be affected.
"We are also looking at alternative arrangements for all children should the school need to remain closed beyond this week."
