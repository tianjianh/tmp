"The most vulnerable" Syrian refugees could be resettled in Guernsey, the chief minister has told BBC News.

Deputy Jonathan Le Tocq said it was working with the UK government and one option was to "resettle a proportionate number of refugees" in Guernsey.
He said the States was currently assessing the demands on the island and opportunities for potential refugees.
On Tuesday, the States of Jersey said it would not take in any Syrian refugees due to potential legal risks.
Deputy Le Tocq said: "We are assessing whether there will be sufficient access to healthcare, welfare, security and employment opportunities on our island for refugees being resettled directly from camps near Syria."
"We will be seriously considering Jersey's position when formulating our own policy."
The States of Jersey said it had been advised proposals to resettle families could lead to further UK-based refugees coming to Jersey under EU human rights conventions and instead has committed to providing more overseas aid.
Monsignor Nicholas France, the leader of Jersey's Catholic Church, said he was "disappointed" with the decision.
