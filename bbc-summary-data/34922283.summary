Armed police deployed to major public events

Armed police are being deployed to major public events in Devon and Cornwall following the Paris attacks.

Senior officers said it was a precaution, not a response to a specific threat.
Officers are not displaying pistols openly but had them holstered so as "not to undermine principles of largely unarmed policing", the force said.
Teams with more powerful firearms, such as automatic weapons, were on standby to provide backup, it added.

The new armed deployment began at the weekend at a football match between Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City.
Firearms officers were also on standby at the Exeter Chiefs' rugby match against Bordeaux on Saturday.
Although there is no new threat to Devon and Cornwall, this deployment of armed officers is a stark demonstration of how the reality of policing has been transformed.
The Paris attacks have changed the calculations of senior officers.
"Wariness" has very much become the new watchword.
Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton said: "This is a precaution and all about making sure we have the capability to deal with any threat.
"The public should be reassured that, if necessary, we can react and respond."
The deployment of firearms officers will be reviewed regularly, commanders said, and would continue for as long as considered necessary.
