Connor Sparrowhawk inquest: 'No formal logging' of bathing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was no formal process for logging the bathing of a teenager found unconscious in a bath at an Oxfordshire care unit, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connor Sparrowhawk, 18, who had learning difficulties and epilepsy, was being treated in Slade House, in Headington, Oxfordshire, in 2013.
Oxford Coroners Court heard he died later in hospital after being found unresponsive in the water.
The NHS has apologised for a "preventable" death.
An independent report later found that Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust had "failed significantly" in his care and treatment.
The court heard Connor was moved into Slade House - run by Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust - in March 2013 after his behaviour became increasingly aggressive.
The inquest was told Connor was to be woken early on the morning of 4 July to be taken on a bus trip.
But he was discovered submerged and unresponsive in a bath shortly after 09:00 BST. Staff called an ambulance but he died later in hospital.
Pathologist Dr Ben Phillips said his death was likely to have been caused by an epileptic seizure.
Evidence was also given by a support worker on shift who had run Connor a bath.  Jurors heard that staff had been told he should be checked every 15 minutes while in the bath but there was no formal place to log this observation.
The jury was told an independent report commissioned by Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust found the death had been preventable and staff members dispute aspects of its findings.
The coroner told the inquest the trust had apologised to the family for the "preventable" death.
The inquest is expected to last two weeks.
