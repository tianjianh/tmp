Plans are under way to rebuild a fish and chip restaurant and shop units destroyed by fire at a Norfolk seaside resort at the end of July.

The buildings, owned by the Richardsons Holiday Group, were razed to the ground by the fire, described as a second "disaster" at Hemsby.
In 2013, storms flooded the village and cliff falls destroyed chalet homes.
Chief executive Greg Munford said architects were now drawing up plans for new buildings.
He hoped the new units would be complete for next year's holiday season but planners had yet to see the new designs.
"Our first step was to clear the site, which was an eyesore," Mr Munford said.
"We are working on a number of options but the intention is to rebuild on the site and we hope to have plans ready for submission in about five weeks."
Just after the fire, parish council vice chairman Mike Peake, vice chairman of the parish council, said: "It's devastating for all the people here. I think it's an absolute disaster for Hemsby.
"It's a blot on the landscape after the disaster in 2013 when the sea took all the chalets away. What more can happen in Hemsby?"
