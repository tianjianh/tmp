Ms Outen, from Rutland, was forced to leave Happy Socks 400 miles (645km) off Portugal two months ago during a storm.
A crew from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) found the boat near the Cork coast on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Outen, who spent more than four years rowing, cycling and kayaking around the world, said it was "wonderful" her boat was safe.
She tweeted: "Today I got that wonderful sort of news that makes your tummy turn and tears flow and rocks your happy socks off. Happy Socks is safe.
"We are making plans to go and retrieve her from SW Ireland where the RNLI crew in Castletownbere found her.
"A big and very grateful shoutout to the RNLI crew at Castletownbere for bringing her in and letting us know. Go Happy Socks!"
Paul Stevens, of Castletownbere RNLI, said: 'It transpired this boat had been abandoned two months ago, 400 miles west of Portugal by a lone oarswoman who was rowing from Cape Cod to London.
"She abandoned the boat in a hurricane and was picked up by a Canadian vessel," he said.
Ms Outen had planned to row, bike and kayak 25,000km (15,500 miles) around the northern hemisphere.
The adventurer, who is now based in Oxfordshire, became the first woman to row single-handed across the North Pacific in 2013, after failing to cross on her first attempt in 2012.
She then cycled across Canada and the USA and started her final leg rowing across the Atlantic before being caught in a hurricane.
Happy Socks was abandoned after 143 days at sea because of worsening weather conditions and the threat of hurricane Joaquin.
