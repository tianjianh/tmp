The 24-year-old scored four goals in 52 appearances for Stanley last season, including one strike in the play-off semi-final defeat by AFC Wimbledon.
He played 135 times for Stanley after joining on a permanent deal after being released by Watford in 2013.
Mingoia was one of the Stanley players to be offered new deals, but he has signed a two-year contract at the U's.
"A few weeks before (the play-off semi-final) I'd probably made up my mind (to leave)," he told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"I hadn't had any contact with anyone out of respect as we had some important games coming up.
"Unfortunately we lost the game to Wimbledon and then after that you have to start thinking of the future and I had to pick up the phone and see if there was any interest there.
"We discussed a potential deal at Accrington but I said I'd most likely want to move on and they fully understood where I was coming from and it ended pretty happily between me and the manager."
