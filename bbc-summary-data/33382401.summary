[SN]TITLE[SN]
RMT members at CalMac and Argyll Ferries to strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
RMT union members working for Caledonian MacBrayne and Argyll Ferries are to hold a second strike on 10 July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows three days of industrial action by CalMac staff last week which culminated in a 24-hour strike.
The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) has sent out strike ballot papers to about 100 of its members who work for CalMac.
CalMac managing director Martin Dorchester said he was "extremely disappointed" by the RMT's decision.
The Scottish government said it was "very disappointing" that the RMT felt the need to call further strike action on one of the busiest weekends of the summer for ferry services.
Like CalMac, Argyll Ferries is owned by the state-owned David MacBrayne Group.
Talks between CalMac and the RMT are due to be held on Monday.
Talks planned for earlier this week were postponed by the ferry operator due to "unforeseen circumstances".
RMT members at Argyll Ferries did not take part in last week's industrial action, but the union said the staff was increasingly concerned about job security.
CalMac's contract to run the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services comes to an end next year.
The Scottish government has put the contract out to tender, in line with European rules.
The RMT union has concerns that, regardless of who wins, the new contract will see changes in employees' current terms and conditions.
A reduction in staff numbers and pensions are key areas of concern.
The RMT has asked that the government guarantee in the new contract that compulsory redundancies do not happen and existing terms and conditions are continued.

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "Despite the most strenuous efforts to negotiate a settlement on CalMac we are still not getting the clear assurances that we seek that will defend the safety-critical jobs and working conditions that go hand in hand with delivering safe and efficient lifeline ferry services to the communities that we serve.
"It is a cold hard fact that privatisation is all about a race to the bottom in order to maximise profits and our members will not sit back while they are caught in the crossfire of the tendering process."
He added: "Our members on Argyll Ferries now find themselves staring down the barrel of exactly those same kind of attacks on jobs and working conditions and have delivered a massive and rock-solid mandate for action."
Mr Dorchester said: "We are extremely disappointed that the RMT has chosen to continue with strike action.
"The best way to protect the existing terms and conditions of its members is to work with us to ensure we win the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service (CHFS) contract and this action is damaging.
"We are anxious to avoid any more disruption which is not in the best interests of our employees and the communities we serve and would urge all our colleagues to turn out for work."
Two-thirds of state-owned CalMac's ferry services were cancelled last Friday during the 24-hour strike by RMT members, who make up about half of the company's workforce.
The dispute has been triggered by unions' concerns about the new contract to run the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services.
CalMac's current deal to operate the network comes to an end next year.
The Scottish government has put the contract out to tender, in line with European rules.
The unions have raised concerns that, regardless of who wins, the new contract will see changes in employees' current terms and conditions.
A reduction in staff numbers and pensions are key areas of concern.
The unions have asked that the government guarantee in the new contract that compulsory redundancies do not happen and existing terms and conditions are continued.
A Scottish government spokesman said: "We have been continuing to talk with the RMT Union, so it is very disappointing that they feel the need to call further strike action on one of the busiest weekends of the summer for our ferry services.
"Discussions between Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure Keith Brown and RMT representatives took place in London earlier this week and both parties committed to further dialogue."
The spokesman added: "To comply with EU procurement law, Scottish ministers cannot compel bidders to guarantee no compulsory redundancies.
"Bidders can make a voluntary commitment through tendering processes, as was the case in the recent ScotRail franchise.
"We would seek to achieve a similar outcome in the next CHFS contract, regardless of the outcome of the tendering process, and will pursue this objective vigorously.
"This position has been made very clear to the RMT union in recent talks."
