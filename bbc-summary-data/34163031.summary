A street-legal electric racing car built in 1974 has broken the European speed record in its class.

The Enfield 8000 was built to woo drivers during the decade's oil crisis, but only 120 were offered for sale.
Motoring journalist Jonny Smith set a record of 11.27 seconds at 118.38mph, beating the previous 11.5 second record for a 1/4 mile dash.
The car, named Flux Capacitor, broke the record at Santa Pod Raceway on the Bedfordshire-Northamptonshire border.
Mr Smith tweeted: "Good news! Just set new record. So it is definitely the quickest street legal EV in Europe. I am extremely chuffed."
The high cost of building electric cars in the mid-1970s when technology was at an early stage killed off production.
The Santa Pod Raceway, which hosts drag racing and other high speed vehicle events, is based south of Wellingborough.
