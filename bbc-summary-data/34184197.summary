A "mannequin bride" who spent more than 58 hours in a bridal shop window has won £5,000 worth of wedding gifts.

Brides-to-be Kate Holder and Tara Attis modelled their wedding dresses in a 1ft x 3ft window space in Bude, Cornwall from 11:00 BST on Saturday.
It was Ms Holder who emerged as the victor in the bride wars on Monday evening, after clocking up 58.5 hours on show.
She said she has bruised hips from sleeping on the wood in the window.
"I'm very tired and I probably got about four hours sleep each night," she said.
Ms Holder, 27, from Holsworthy, Devon, who said she "had to win", is due to get married in February and said her husband-to-be was "over the moon".
"I had massive support from my family and friends and when I finished I went home and had a glass of wine," she said.
Despite losing, Ms Attis, from St Austell, Cornwall, has reportedly invited Ms Holder to her own wedding.
Shop owner, Emily Benny, said the contest started last year, when the winner remained in the window for 36 hours.
Competitors in both years were allowed to take a toilet break every four hours, but had to sleep in the windows.
