[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The execution of a Virginia man convicted of killing two men has divided one of his victim's families over whether it should move forward.

William Morva, 35, is scheduled to die for the 2006 killings of a security guard and a sheriff's deputy during his attempted escape from a hospital.
The deputy's daughter said she is among the thousands urging Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to grant clemency.
But the deputy's mother said she does not want Morva's life to be spared.
Morva was awaiting trial on 2005 robbery charges when he was taken to the hospital for an injury.
He attacked a sheriff's deputy, stole the official's gun and fatally shot hospital security guard Derrick McFarland, who was unarmed.
Before he was captured near Virginia Tech's Blacksburg campus a day later, Morva shot Sheriff's Deputy Eric Sutphin in the back of the head.
Morva's lawyers argue he suffers from delusional disorder, which is similar to schizophrenia, adding that his condition has worsened because prison doctors have refused to treat him.
They asked Governor McAuliffe to commute his sentence, contending a jury that convicted him without knowing the severity of his condition.
But the governor of Virginia has refused to grant a last-minute stay of execution.
Morva is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 21:00 local time (1:00 GMT).
More than 34,000 people petitioned the Democrat to halt Thursday's execution, including the slain deputy's daughter, Rachel Sutphin.
"I am against the death penalty for religious and moral reasons," Ms Sutphin said in an email to reporters.
"I have fought and will continue to fight for clemency for all death row inmates until Virginia declares the death penalty unconstitutional.
"I have sent my own letter to the Governor showing my support for clemency."
But the deputy's mother, Jeaneen Sutphin, said while she sympathises with Morva's family, she wants the scheduled lethal injection to proceed.
"I have no hatred for this creature who shot him execution-style. I just want justice for my son," she told the Roanoke Times on Wednesday.
The jury that convicted Morva was told he suffered from a personality disorder that resulted in "odd beliefs", but he later was diagnosed with a more severe mental illness,
The US Supreme Court declined to hear Morva's appeal in February.
National mental health advocates, 20 Virginia lawmakers and two United Nations human rights experts have joined calls to block his execution.
The government of Hungary, where Morva is a dual citizen, and the European Union have also urged the governor to intervene.
"We are concerned at Mr Morva's deteriorating psychosocial condition," UN Special Rapporteurs Agnes Callamard and Dainius PÃ»ras said in a statement on Wednesday.
"The denial of reasonable accommodation in detention can be considered a form of discrimination against him because of his mental health condition."
If carried out, Virginia will surpass Oklahoma for second place in a ranking of the US states with the most executions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Virginia and Oklahoma have executed 112 people since the death penalty was re-instated in 1976.
Texas has executed 542 people during the same period.
