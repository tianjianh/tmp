[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man left paralysed following "routine" spinal surgery has received an apology after a High Court battle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phil Scudder, 50, from Crowborough, East Sussex had a decompression operation to remove a slipped disc in 2011.
When he woke from the surgery at the Hurstwood Park Neurological Centre in Haywards Heath he was unable to move his legs. He now uses a wheelchair.
Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust accepted liability.
Mr Scudder, who was a keen motorcyclist, said he was "relieved" the case heard at the High Court in June was now settled.
He added: "It wasn't so much about a settlement. It was about getting an apology.
"Apart from a slipped disc, I was a fit 44-year-old man with a job and hobby I loved when this happened.
"What should have been a routine operation turned into a nightmare which has ended my work, my hobby and led to the breakdown of a long-term relationship."
Mr Scudder, who now lives in St Columb, in Cornwall, said everything in his home had to be adapted to meet his needs.
The High Court will decide in 2018 how much compensation he should receive.
A spokeswoman for Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust said: "The trust apologises to both Mr Scudder and his family for the failures in care relating to his surgery on 8 July 2011, and the impact this has had on his life.
"We very much hope the lawyers can now work together to achieve an early resolution of the claim and settlement for damages."
