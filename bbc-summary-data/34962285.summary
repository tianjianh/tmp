Allegra Stratton's departure follows that of the BBC's economics editor Robert Peston, who was poached by the rival broadcaster last month.
Stratton has been with Newsnight for almost four years. Before that she was The Guardian's political correspondent.
The former BBC producer, who will take up her new role in the new year, said she was "thrilled" to join ITV News.
"It will be a pleasure and a privilege to work alongside such a strong team and I can't wait to get started," he said.
Geoff Hill, the editor of ITV News, said: "I'm absolutely delighted that Allegra will be joining our newsroom.
"She is one of the most talented and knowledgeable journalists in the business, with a long and impressive track record."
Ian Katz, editor of BBC Two's Newsnight, said: "We'll miss her greatly but wish her the very best in her new role."
Stratton's new role will see her reunited with Peston, whose appointment as ITV's new political editor was confirmed in October.
ITV News's Rohit Kachroo will move from UK Editor to the newly created role of Security Editor.
Kachroo said it was "a privilege" to take up the position "at a time when national and global security require so much of our attention".
