The tie looked all but secure for the League One side inside 15 minutes, with goals from Ben Reeves, Brandon Thomas-Asante, and Kieran Agard.
But Joe Tait snatched a quick response in the 19th minute before Andrew Johnson's strike with five minutes to go ensured a grandstand finish.
It took the hosts little more than seven minutes to take the lead when Reeves fired a low right-footed shot past Moors keeper Dan Lowson from the edge of the area.
And the 28-year-old stopper was left picking the ball out of his own net twice in quick succession as MK eased themselves into a comfortable lead.
Thomas-Asante made it 2-0 with a tap in after Dean Lewington's cross found the 17-year-old unmarked in the six-yard box, before Agard's cross-cum-shot bundled its way into the visitors' bottom corner.
But Jason Ainsley's Northern Premier League side - making their first-ever appearance in the first round - got on the scoresheet five minutes later as former Hartlepool defender Tait rose above his marker to meet Craig Gott's cross with a cushioned header into the far corner.
Second half Moors substitute Johnson then made it a nervy finish for the Dons with an emphatic solo goal just five minutes from time - but it proved to be too little too late.
