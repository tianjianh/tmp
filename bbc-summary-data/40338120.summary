Newspaper review: Security nightmare, Catholic housing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "security nightmare" dominates Tuesday's front pages.

All the papers report on the prospect of a Linfield v Celtic match if Linfield make the Champions League qualifier at Windsor Park on 11 July.
The News Letter reports that it would bring about 1,800 Celtic fans to Belfast at the same time that hundreds of Orange Order and loyalist band members travel from Scotland for the Twelfth.
It's a headache for the PSNI, says the Belfast Telegraph, with tensions already "running high" at parades season.
The papers report one option is switching the first leg of the two-match tie to Glasgow or arranging for the 11th night game to be at an earlier time.
It's desperate times for Newry's Daisy Hill hospital, according to The Irish News.
The paper reports that A&E consultants are being offered Â£1,500 a night to stay on call at a 4-star hotel for the "crisis-hit" department.
It claims senior doctors have been "approached informally with the offer" as part of efforts to address staffing problems at the hospital.
However the paper says one medic has revealed that no doctor has taken them up on their offer due to "safety concerns" and "out of embarrassment" of working alongside nurses who are earning considerably less money.
"Catholics are waiting longer to be housed," says the Belfast Telegraph.
The paper cites a new report from the Equality Commission which shows Catholics are waiting longer than Protestants for social housing.
The longest wait for Catholics is 28 months in west Belfast followed by 27 months in south Belfast and 15 in east Belfast.
There's an unpleasant story on the front page of the Daily Mirror.
It says a pensioner from the New Lodge area of north Belfast is "living in hell" after her home was "almost burned down" on Sunday.
The paper claims Jean McMahon has been terrorised by a gang of youths for five years. At the weekend the pallets being gathered for an internment bonfire went up in flames and damaged her home.
Jean told the paper her house now needs new windows says there are questions over the "stability of their roofs and yard walls".
It's official - Northern Ireland rules at golf. Even our caddies are winners - the Belfast Telegraph shows a hug between US open winner Brooks Koepka and his Portrush caddy, Ricky Elliot.
Ricky won a Â£159,000 share of Koepka's first major championship prize money.
The 40-year-old, whose parents and brother still live in Portrush, said golf has always been his "life".
He played professionally for a few years but gave it up to caddy, a move he says he's glad he made.
The Belfast Telegraph reports on a Catholic priest's plans for a speedier Mass, to stop parishioners "nodding off".
Fr Paddy O'Kane, a priest at Holy Family Church in Londonderry's Ballymagrotty area, has made the bold decision to cut his sermons down to five minutes.
Fr O'Kane had the light-bulb moment after a recent trip to Texas. He said he found the "short, sharp and uplifting" sermons better than the longer ones.
However, Presbyterian Chaplain Steve Stockman disagrees and thinks his congregation would be left wanting more if he was to follow suit.
"My sermon is around 25 minutes and if I shorten it to 5 minutes, I would lose my congregation," he says.
"The truth of the matter is that if you are interesting, people will listen to you for an hour."
