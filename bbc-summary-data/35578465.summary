Pompey lifted themselves back into the League Two play-off places with a 3-1 home win against Bristol Rovers.
Smith, on loan from Swindon, scored his side's second goal and his first in three appearances for the club.
"Desire and commitment helped us turn it around from where we were last week," he told BBC Radio Solent.
Portsmouth had been booed off the Fratton Park pitch after a 1-0 defeat against Leyton Orient seven days earlier.
"The gaffer told us a few home truths," Smith added. "The boys knew what we had to do and we came out and did it.
"We wanted to turn it around for ourselves and the fans as nobody deserved that last week.
"We're getting to the business end of the season now and we know what we need to do."
