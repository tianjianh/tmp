Travel delays as Condor Liberation sailings are cancelled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
All sailings on the Condor Liberation ferry from the UK to the Channel Islands have been cancelled with plans to resume a service on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ferry operator found further damage to the exhaust system which required "complex" repairs.
Condor Ferries cancelled day-trip tickets for Saturday and Sunday on the service between the islands and Poole.
The operator has also asked passengers on non-essential journeys until Wednesday to cancel their bookings.
Condor said the repaired ferry would possibly operate "at reduced speed" when it resumes service.
On Sunday the ship will sail from Poole straight to Jersey, then north to Guernsey and back to Poole.
Two services are planned for Monday - an early morning direct service from Poole to Guernsey and back, followed by an afternoon service from Poole direct to Jersey and back.
The sailing on Tuesday will be cancelled for further engineering work and the company said it hoped to resume a normal service on Wednesday.
The initial problem with the exhaust system was discovered on Thursday and repairs were carried out.
The Â£50m Condor Liberation has offered the only fast ferry between Guernsey, Jersey and the UK, since March.
