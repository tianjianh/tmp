Powerhouse Fitness, which has nine stores across the UK, was acquired by Germany-based Sport-Tiedje Group for an undisclosed sum.
Sport-Tiedje currently runs 30 home fitness equipment stores in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.
The company said it would retain the Powerhouse brand name and staff.
Powerhouse Fitness, which is the trading name of Laidir Leisure Ltd, was founded by David Webster in 1980 and opened its first store in Glasgow in 1987.
It now has outlets in London, Glasgow, Nottingham, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Leeds.
In the financial year to June, the company had a turnover of Â£22m.
Sport-Tiedje chief executive Christian Grau said: "Our company philosophy is to offer our customers the best product for them with the best service and at the best price-performance ratio and we will continue to do this in the UK."
