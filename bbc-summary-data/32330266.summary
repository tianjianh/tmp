Pupils at a Llandudno school have been banned from the town's Asda store.

The supermarket chain said it took the action against those from Ysgol John Bright after trouble was caused at the store before the Easter break.
But the school's head teacher Graham Davies told BBC Wales he was "not aware" there would be a blanket ban and has spoken to the store's manager.
Asda said it would continue to work with the school to reach a positive outcome.
A spokesperson added: "Following a number of complaints from customers about the school children causing trouble, we've taken the decision to enforce a temporary ban on groups of children during school time."
Ronnie Hughes, deputy leader of Conwy council, said the store had "gone too far" stopping all pupils in the school's uniform from going in.
