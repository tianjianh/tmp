Tom Hamer improved his own British record in the S14 200m freestyle, while Mikey Jones gained the qualifying mark in the S6 400m freestyle.
Steph Millward is in line for her third Games after managing the standard in the S9 400m freestyle.
Ellie Simmonds set a second qualifying time in her S6 400m freestyle.
