The eight-part series is Silverback Films' "most ambitious project to date", featuring never-before-filmed areas of the Earth's remaining wilderness and its inhabitants.
Producers will travel to ice caps, deep oceans, deserts and remote forests.
It will not air on Netflix until 2019 as it will take four years to make.
"Our Planet is going to raise the bar for natural history landmarks," said Alastair Fothergill from Silverback Films.
"We will reveal the most amazing sights on Earth and show them in ways they have never been seen before."
The programme will premiere across all of Netflix's territories in 2019.
The team enjoyed huge success with award-winning series Blue Planet, Planet Earth and Frozen Planet, with Planet Earth being sold to 130 countries.
However, producers say this will be the largest project of its kind ever attempted, introducing viewers to some of the world's rarest animals and species.
The team will be using new 4K camera technology, an ultra-high-definition format that has been used for filming The Hobbit, James Cameron's forthcoming Avatar sequels and Netflix drama House of Cards.
Silverback Films is currently also making a landmark series for BBC One called The Hunt, and has made several films for Disneynature.
