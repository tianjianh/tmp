Gay wedding canon Jeremy Pemberton has NHS job offer withdrawn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first gay British clergyman to marry a same-sex partner has had an NHS job offer withdrawn because a bishop will not give the licence needed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeremy Pemberton currently works as an NHS chaplain in Lincolnshire, but has been blocked from taking a new job with the NHS in Nottinghamshire.
He was also told he could not work as a priest in Nottinghamshire after he married his partner in April.
His case was raised in the House of Lords earlier this week.
The Acting Bishop for Southwell and Nottingham, the Rt Revd Richard Inwood, issued a statement on 9 July.
He said: "In its pastoral guidance on same-sex marriage, the House of Bishops said that getting married to someone of the same sex was clearly at variance with the teaching of the Church of England.
"The statement said it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same-sex marriage, given the need for clergy to model the Church's teaching in their lives.
"In view of this, and having spoken to the Reverend Jeremy Pemberton, his permission to officiate in the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham was revoked.
"In light of the pastoral guidance and for reasons of consistency, I am unable to issue a licence to Jeremy Pemberton for the post of chaplaincy and bereavement manager, in the Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Trust."
Mr Pemberton told BBC Radio Nottingham he was "very, very disappointed" not to be able to take up the post of chaplaincy and bereavement manager for Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust after the offer was withdrawn on Friday.
"I've now been treated, I think, in an unfair and rather harsh way in Southwell and Nottingham, whereas I'm now going to carry on doing the job I have been doing in Lincolnshire where I have a licence," he said.
"So I've been treated in an inconsistent way, and the House of Bishops can't agree amongst themselves what ought to be the processes that somebody who enters a same-sex marriage should go through."
NHS chaplains are funded by the NHS rather than the Church of England, but a chaplain needs a licence from the relevant diocese.
The Acting Bishop for Southwell and Nottingham, the Rt Revd Richard Inwood, revoked Mr Pemberton's permission to officiate as a priest in June and wrote to the trust in July saying he would not give Mr Pemberton a licence for the new job.
The trust said it was considering its response after receiving the bishop's letter on 7 July, then withdrew the job offer on 1 August.
Mr Pemberton said: "I think the problem now is that it appears that I'm stuck in the job I'm doing, and if I try to move I could be blocked.
"There are, to be honest, quite a lot of gay and lesbian Church of England chaplains working in the health service.
"Now we don't know, if any of them try to move, will the same thing happen to them, and should it?"
He said he did not know this would happen when he married his partner.
"I didn't, and neither did the House of Bishops, appear to know what would happen," he said.
"As soon as they put their pastoral guidance out that very obvious question was asked of them, and the bishops said, 'Oh no, we don't know, we will have to take it on a case-by-case basis.'
"I'm not going to bow out gracefully and take a low profile.
"I think this needs to be tested [legally] and I think in due course it probably will be somewhere."
