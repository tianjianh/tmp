A survey showed tourism businesses in Wales saw a 32% rise in visitors during the May half term compared to in 2016.
In June Cardiff hosted the UEFA Champions League Finals and on Sunday about 10,000 cyclists will take part in the Velothon.
Mr Skates said a "summer of sporting legends" was boosting the industry,
"Already this year we have successfully hosted the giants of Real Madrid and Juventus on the UEFA Champions League Final and welcomed the ICC Champions trophy to Wales," he said.
"The Seniors Opens is yet another opportunity for Wales to demonstrate our capabilities in hosting world class sporting events, a real summer of sporting legends."
According to the recent Wales Tourism Barometer - which surveyed 884 industry representatives - 87% of businesses feel confident about trade ahead of the summer holidays.
Out of these 33% said they felt "very confident" about the season.
Meanwhile 33% of businesses are reporting profits are up in 2017 compared to the previous year.
Out of those surveyed 18% of businesses said the reason for the increased profits was because more people were holidaying in the UK rather than going abroad.
