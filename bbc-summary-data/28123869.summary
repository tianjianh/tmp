Four men and a woman have been jailed for conspiring to traffic women into the UK for sexual exploitation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The gang trafficked more than 100 women into the UK, some of whom were forced into prostitution and raped.
Vishal Chaudhary, 35, described as "the boss" was sentenced to 12 years, Krisztian Abel, 33, to 10 years, Attila Kovacs, 33, was given six years and Kunal Chaudhary, 32, got five years.
Szilvia Abel, 24, was sentenced to three years at Croydon Crown Court.
During sentencing Judge Gower said of the gang: "Over a period of six years it exploited hundreds of women and was a sophisticated business. Over the years [it] must have generated hundreds of thousands of pounds."
The court heard Vishal Chaudhary, of Peninsula Square, Canary Wharf, was the "leading figure in these conspiracies, the boss" and funded a luxury lifestyle from the crime.
Following sentencing, the boyfriend of one of the victims, told the BBC: "I really wish they could have got a life sentence, because effectively that's what they've done.
"They've taken people's lives away. They [the victims] don't have any prospects of work or anything like that and now they're completely damaged."
The court heard the women were recruited from Hungary with offers of cleaning and nannying jobs in London.
Instead they worked in one of 40 brothels operated by the gang across the city from a base in Brent Cross and would have to see up to 20 men a day.
Det Ch Insp Michael Forteath from Scotland Yard said: "It is hugely exploitative and behind each one of these jobs we deal with is a wake of human misery and exploitation."
Attila Kovacs is a Hungarian national from Highview Gardens in Enfield; Krisztian Abel is also Hungarian and from Green Lane, Ilford; His sister Szilvia Abel is from Budapest.
Kunal Chaudhary is a British national from Fog Lane, Manchester.
