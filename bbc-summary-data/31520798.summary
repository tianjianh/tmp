If you think they're super cute, then you'd better start booking your ticket to the Moomin ballet now.

But for those of you who find them a bit creepy - it's best to stay away from Helsinki in March because that's when the Finnish National Ballet is putting on the show.
This is the first time Tove Jansson's characters have been made into a dance.
"Although the body of the Moomins isn't the most flexible," the website promises they will feature in the show.
Other characters will "take care of the classical ballet part" in the production, which will tell the story of Comet Moominland.
"When everything is not well in the Moominvalley, Moomintroll and his friends heads to the Observatory on the Lonely Mountains," explains the show's synopsis.
"In the Observatory they are told that the comet will hit the Earth within a few days. Will the Moominvalley survive?"
If you can make your way to Finland, adult tickets will set you back 42 euros (Â£32.50) each.
The show is said to be suitable for children over the age of four - but even if you're a bit older than that and still find the Moomins a little scary, you might also want an adult to accompany you.
