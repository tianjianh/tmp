[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) Lancaster - known as Thumper - landed safely at RAF Coningsby after it misfired during a training flight.
The crew evacuated safely and the aircraft will now be assessed by engineers.
Last year, the only other flying Lancaster had an engine fire whilst visiting the UK.
Sqd Ldr Emma Watkins said: "The Lancaster suffered what appears to be an engine fire during a practice run this afternoon.
"The aircraft has landed safely and all the crew are fine."
During a tour in 2014, Vera - owned by the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum - was hit by an engine fire during a flight in County Durham.
It was due to fly at the Bournemouth Air Festival as well as the Shoreham Air Show and the Gedling Show in Nottinghamshire as part of a two-month UK tour.
Vera was loaned an engine by the BBMF in order for it to return home.
