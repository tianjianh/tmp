Tim Farron: Helping migrants 'decent and in our interests'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's just two months since Tim Farron was elected as the new Liberal Democrat party leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In his victory speech he set out his liberal credentials with this rallying cry: "If you think it is wrong to demonise immigrants, the young, the poor, foreigners, Brussels, the English, the Scots - join us."
He promised to be an outspoken leader, and today he attacked the government for scaremongering over the migrant situation in Calais.
Last month, Mr Farron visited the camp in the French port for himself. He told me: "What David Cameron was reacting to was not the reality.
"We were not talking about thousands of people swarming through the tunnel every night - we were talking about a few dozen, maybe one hundred or so maximum - the same people every night trying to get across.
"And one of the reasons is because the UK government had turned its back on its EU colleagues and wasn't providing a common solution."
He said he met desperate people, including a 14-year-old orphaned boy from Syria who ended up with two broken legs after attempting to cross to the UK.
Mr Farron has called on the government to do more to help refugees fleeing war-torn countries.
"What I desperately want our government to understand is we are talking about desperate people and we have a track record over the centuries of being a country which is open to those refugees - not just because we're decent - though it is because we're decent - but also because it's in our interests," he said.
"Just look at the impact in our country and our economy for instance for our open door to the Ugandan Asians who fled the terrible dictator Idi Amin in the 1970s - so I want us to act decently but also in our own self interest."
The government has already pledged to allow 20,000 refugees to come to the UK over the next four and a half year but Mr Farron says it should be three times that number.
20,000
more refugees will be resettled in the UK by 2020
4,980
Syrian asylum seekers have been allowed to stay since 2011
25,771 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to end June 2015
2,204 were from Syria
87% of Syrian requests for asylum were granted
145 Syrian asylum seekers have been removed from the UK since 2011
But of course the Liberal Democrats are no longer in government and they were annihilated at the polls in May, with their number of MPs being reduced from 56 to just eight.
In the South East, both Lib Dem MPs - Stephen Lloyd in Eastbourne and former Home Office minister Norman Baker in Lewes - paid the price of being in coalition and lost their seats.
So away from the crisis in Calais,  Mr Farron has a tough job at home - trying to rebuild his party from the grassroots up.
The Liberal Democrats' party conference is being held in Bournemouth between 19 and 23 September.
