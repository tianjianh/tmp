Defending champions England face New Zealand in Belfast on Saturday.
The 32-year-old, a World Cup winner in 2014, left the field in the first half of England's 20-3 semi-final victory over France on Tuesday for a head-injury assessment but did not return.
"Danielle has delivered outstanding performances throughout," said head coach Simon Middleton.
"It's disappointing to lose her for the final but we have a number of strong options available to us as we begin preparing."
Waterman, who made her Test debut in 2003 and has won 74 caps, does not have enough time to complete the game's 'return to play' protocols after failing her HIA on Tuesday.
She is the only England player to have started every match at the World Cup but misses out on playing in a fourth World Cup final.
Emily Scott, who represented Britain at the 2016 Olympics and was part of England's Grand Slam winning campaign earlier in the year, has been called up as a replacement.
She was originally named in England's 28-strong squad but to withdraw with injury.
"Emily can cover both fly-half and full-back positions and has invaluable experience playing in major tournaments," said Middleton.
"It was disappointing for Emily to miss out initially but she has successfully completed her rehab and is fit and ready to go."
