The 35-year-old is in his second spell with the Spireites, who were relegated from League One this season, and has made 211 league appearances for the club.
Evatt has also had spells with Derby, QPR and Blackpool.
He told the club website: "The club is very close to my heart and I'm settled in the area so I turned down offers from elsewhere in order to stay."
