[SN]TITLE[SN]
No place for smacking in society - children's commissioner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Smacking has no place in modern society, Wales' children's commissioner Sally Holland has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Holland reiterated her call for a smacking ban in the wake of plans for parental discipline to be devolved to the assembly.
The move, if passed, would make it possible for AMs to pass to outlaw smacking in Wales.
Welsh Labour has promised to seek cross-party support to end the defence of reasonable punishment.
New powers in the Wales Bill, due to be approved by the House of Lords on Tuesday, would clear up the assembly's power to change the law and introduce a ban by removing the defence.
Dr Holland told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme: "Most of us of a certain generation, including myself, were smacked as children.
"What I would say is it just doesn't have a place in modern civilised society.
"And I see this really as a human rights issue, because all we are trying to do is give children the same rights against being hit as adults have."
Dr Holland said Wales had been "going around circles" debating the issue for years and hoped to see a ban in the next couple of years.
She added that she did not expect to see a wave of parents being criminalised - and that there would be a "high bar" for prosecutions when children had been persistently harmed.
AMs voted against a smacking ban in Wales in 2015.
Since then, the Children's Secretary Carl Sargeant said he hoped "to take forward, on a cross-party basis, legislation that will remove the defence of reasonable punishment".
One man in Carmarthen told BBC Radio Wales the best way of disciplining children was to take things like iPads away from them.
A woman said smacking "in the right way" was a good thing.
"When I was young, if I did something wrong [and] then I had a smack, then I knew not to do it again," she added.
