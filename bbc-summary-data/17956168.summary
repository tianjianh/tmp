An event has been held to mark the 160th anniversary of birth of Alice Liddell, the inspiration behind Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.

Celebrations have included a massive Mad Hatter-themed tea party on Llandudno's promenade.
Organisers are now waiting to see if they have also earned a world record for the largest number of jam tarts eaten at an Alice event.
Liddell spent her holidays at the family's second home in the Conwy town.
Lewis Carroll, the pen-name adopted by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, developed the story of Alice in Wonderland while visiting the Liddell home in Oxford.
It is also claimed that it was young Alice herself who begged Carroll to put his story down in writing, leading to its publication in 1865.
The connection with Liddell and Llandudno has long been established, and the town once boasted an Alice visitor centre.
But the attraction closed in 2008, the same year the Liddell house, the old Gogarth Abbey Hotel, was also demolished.
Organisers hope that Friday's event will help strengthen Llandudno's connection to Alice in Wonderland.
Last year, Conwy council revealed it was developing an interactive Alice in Wonderland trail around the town.
The Alice event also marks the start of Llandudno's annual Victorian Extravaganza, a three-day bank holiday weeked celebrating the seaside resort Victorian past.
