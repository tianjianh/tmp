At Reading Crown Court on Wednesday, Joseph Storr, 25, admitted killing Warren Duke, 48, at his Slough house on Christmas Eve 2015.
Storr was suffering with mental health problems when he stabbed Mr Duke, who had taken him into his home as a favour for a friend, police said.
He will be sentenced on 22 June.
The force said officers were called to Jellicoe Close in the Cippenham area of the Berkshire town at 18:40 GMT on the day of the attack.
Paramedics were unable to save Mr Duke and a post-mortem examination later revealed he had died as a result of a single stab wound to the neck.
Det Supt Nora Holford said: "Storr had nowhere to stay at the time of the offence. Mr Duke agreed to Storr sleeping at his house as a favour to one of his friends.
"Storr and Mr Duke were the only two people in the house at the time of the offence so we will never know exactly what happened on the evening of Christmas Eve 2015."
She added that it was a "tragic case" and her thoughts were with Mr Duke's friends and family.
