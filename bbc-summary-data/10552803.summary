Discarded banana skins are still being found on Britain's highest mountain despite warnings from conservationists.

The John Muir Trust has carried out its latest clean-up of Ben Nevis after the thaw of winter snow.
Last September, trust volunteers found as many as 1,000 banana skins dropped at the summit.
Walkers and climbers were warned that the skins take up to two years to break down and did not biodegrade as quickly as they may think.
Plastic bottle and tissues have also been collected in the latest clean-up.
Sarah Lewis, trust conservation officer, said most walkers and climbers dealt with their litter responsibly.
She added: "But it is clear that some people just don't see the impact that their litter has - 100,000 people climb up Ben Nevis every year, so if even a tiny minority of them leave their litter it can quickly build up."
