[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are appealing for witnesses to a crash on the M5 in Gloucestershire which injured 16 people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The accident, involving two HGVs and five cars, happened just before 14:00 BST on the southbound carriageway near Michaelwood services on Saturday.
A 23-year-old man from Coventry suffered serious head injuries and is in a critical condition in Southmead Hospital in Bristol.
A woman, 19, in the same car, was taken to Southmead with pelvic injuries.
Inspector Frazer Davey said: "The rescue of the driver and passenger of the most damaged car took some considerable time due to the severity of the impact and the subsequent damage to the car.
"The two occupants of that vehicle were taken to hospital where miraculously their injuries are non-life threatening."
Gloucestershire Police said they wanted to speak to any witnesses who have not yet contacted them, which included "at least one person who was stood on the nearby footbridge and witnessed the entire incident."
The southbound carriageway was closed until 21:20 BST but all lanes on both carriageways are now open.
