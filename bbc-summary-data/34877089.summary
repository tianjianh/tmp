[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has announced it is re-examining its policy on transgender prisoners following the death of a woman in a male prison in Leeds.

Vikki Thompson was being held at Armley where she was found dead on Friday. She told her friends she would kill herself if she was sent to a male prison.
The incident prompted the prisons minister to respond to an urgent question in the House of Commons.
Andrew Selous told a debate they are "reviewing prison service instruction".

Tim Farron, Lib Dem leader, tweeted: "We must reform the law urgently."
Cat Smith, shadow minister for women and equalities, asked if the policy guidelines for transgender prisoners were adequate, and if they are being properly applied.
Mr Selous responded: "Her death like all others in custody is a tragedy and we are totally committed to reducing the number of deaths in prisons.
"We believe that Vikki Thompson was being looked after in accordance with the relevant procedures, but that is now a matter for the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and Coroner."
He said a review of the policy relating to the care of transgender prisoners had begun earlier this year, and revised policy guidance will be issued and implemented "in due course".
It is estimated there are around 80 transgender prisoners in the UK, although the Ministry of Justice does not keep precise figures.
The debate also follows a transgender woman being sent to a men's prison in Bristol.

85,977 prisoners are men, according to the latest figures
3,935 prisoners are female
Tara Hudson, from Bath, was later transferred to a female prison after a campaign to get her moved.
Ms Smith said: "I first raised the issue of Tara Hudson, a young trans woman who was placed in a men's prison on the floor of this house on the 3rd of November.
"It's a tragedy that within three weeks of that, we are once again discussing the issue of trans prisoners."
Jackie Brooklyn, Ms Hudson's mother, said her daughter was "absolutely heartbroken and disgusted" when she heard about Vikki Thompson's death.
She said: "I just think if she was living as a woman she should have been put in a ladies' jail, possibly under segregation for her welfare."
Greg Mulholland, Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West, said: "It really seems like something from another era to be putting a transgender woman into a man's prison.
"The tragic consequences of that is there needs to be an inquiry into how this happened. It's certainly time to change the guidelines to avoid this happening again."
Thompson, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, was handed a 12-month jail term in August which was suspended for 24 months.
The BBC understands she later breached the terms of the sentence and was remanded in custody at Bradford Crown Court.
An investigation into her death has been launched, the Prison Service said.
West Yorkshire Police said her death was not being treated as suspicious.
An inquest into Vikki Thompson's death is expected to be opened next week in Wakefield.
