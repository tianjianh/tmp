Australian Marc Leishman captured his maiden European Tour title with a six-shot victory at the Nedbank Challenge in Sun City, South Africa.

One stroke ahead going into the final round, the world number 47 dropped a shot at the third but holed six birdies in a five-under 67 to win on 19 under.
Henrik Stenson retained second after four birdies and four bogeys in a 72.
Englishman Chris Wood was third after a 68 and defending champion Danny Willett was 11 behind Leishman in joint fourth.
It was Leishman's first title since his maiden PGA Tour victory at the Travelers Championship in 2012.
He shot the lowest round of the week with a 64 at The Open in July and led the Championship with six holes to play before losing in a three-man play-off won by American Zach Johnson.
Leishman's bogey at the third was his only one in the lowest round of the day, and he made just three in total over the 72 holes at the Gary Player Country Club this week.
"I knew it was going to be a really tough day, I knew I had to play well," he said. "I'm really pleased that I could play as well as I did and have a little bit of a buffer there at the end."
