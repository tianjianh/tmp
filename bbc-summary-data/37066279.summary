The 21-year-old scored 523.85 points to finish behind China's Cao Yuan, who ended on 547.60, with Germany's Patrick Hausding taking bronze (498.90).
Laugher's silver was GB's 50th medal at Rio 2016 and third in the diving pool.
He and Chris Mears won the 3m synchro, while Tom Daley and Dan Goodfellow took bronze in the 10m synchro.
Ireland's Oliver Dingley, who, like Laugher, is from Harrogate in North Yorkshire, finished eighth with 442.90.
"I always knew I could medal at these Olympic Games," said Laugher. "I have been rising each year but obviously doing it is a completely different story."

Laugher, who won bronze at last year's World Aquatics Championships in Kazan, only qualified from his semi-final by 2.10 points, in the 12th and final qualifying position.
"There are so many nerves, pressure and weather conditions around these Olympics, it is really hard to get on the board and do it and I showed that in the semi-final in the morning," he added.
"I had luck on my side and I was in that final - and that was when I could really let loose, there was no pressure, no nerves."
Leon Taylor, Olympic silver medallist
"It was a monumental effort by Laugher.  He was all over the place in the preliminary round and semi-final.
"But it doesn't matter, he has come out this evening and delivered."
