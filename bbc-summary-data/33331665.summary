Suspicious packages which sparked the evacuation of Exeter city centre were actually abandoned suitcases filled with wires and electrical components.

Two suitcases were reported to police on Monday morning but a bomb disposal team found they were non-explosive.
The cases had been removed from a skip and abandoned.
Officers said they were "aware of the disruption" caused by the evacuation, adding that the images explained their "safety first approach".
Controlled explosions were made on both suitcases by a Royal Navy bomb disposal team.
Supt Keith Perkin said the cases, with old computer materials and electrical wiring sticking out, had been dumped in a skip.
"Later, another person took these cases from the skip but abandoned them on York Road and King William Street," he said.
"There was no malicious intent in relation to the placing of the cases and this individual has been given words of advice in relation to this matter."
Supt Perkin said he was aware of the disruption to city businesses and said the police response decision was not taken lightly.
"However, I hope these images of the cases will offer some understanding to the public on why we adopted a safety first approach," he added.
"I would like to personally offer my thanks to all of our communities and partner agencies for their role in what was a professional response yesterday, and to reassure you all that Exeter very much remains a safe place to live and visit."
