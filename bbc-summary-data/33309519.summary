Talks expected between Caledonian MacBrayne and RMT

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Caledonian MacBrayne and the RMT union are due to hold talks in an effort to resolve a dispute over job security and pensions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two thirds of state-owned CalMac's ferry services were cancelled on Friday during a 24-hour strike by RMT members.
The dispute centres on concerns that Clyde and Hebrides ferry routes could be taken over by private firm Serco.
The RMT wants the Scottish government's new contract to guarantee job security and pensions.
