Kesh GP Michelle Mellotte struck off medical register over patient loan fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Fermanagh GP who dishonestly exploited and took advantage of a vulnerable elderly patient, when she failed to repay a £10,000 loan, has been struck off the medical register.

Michelle Mellotte, 61, took the money from Michael McGrory in February 2010, saying it would be repaid that summer.
But, it was only returned following the start of a police investigation.
Ms Mellotte knew her patient was suffering from Alzheimer's when she asked him for the loan.
She went to his home to "ask him for a favour" and he agreed to sign a cheque for £10,000 with an endorsement that it would be paid back in the summer of 2010.
In April, Ms Mellotte admitted fraud by abuse of her role and was given a suspended prison sentence and was suspended from the medical register.
Last week, the ruling was endorsed following a hearing by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in St James's Buildings in Manchester.
The tribunal noted that Ms Mellotte, who did not attend the hearing, did not oppose the GMC's case against he.
In written submissions, the former doctor's legal team stated she accepted the "appropriate sanction" was erasure.
Summarising the case against her, the tribunal chairman, Sean Ell, said: "The tribunal has determined that Dr Mellotte has put patients at unwarranted risk of harm, she has brought the profession into disrepute, she has breached fundamental tenets of the profession and her integrity cannot be relied upon."
She will no longer be able to practice as a doctor in the UK.
