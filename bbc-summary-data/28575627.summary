The trouble happened in the second half as Northern Ireland took a 2-1 win.
One of the Mexicans aimed a kick at the head of a Northern Ireland player lying on the ground during the disturbances.
Mexicans Raul Monala Gudino, Carlos Arreola and Kevin Gutierrez were sent off with Northern Ireland's Robbie McDaid also dismissed.
The first brawl led to Gudino, Arreola and McDaid being dismissed while Gutierrez was then red-carded by referee Tim Marshall in the closing stages.
The second brawl broke out with some three or four minutes of normal time left and the referee opted to blow the final whistle when order was finally restored.
Referee Marshall confirmed afterwards that the result would stand and that he had not abandoned the fixture.
Victor Guzman put Mexico ahead seven minutes into the second half but substitutes Mikhail Kennedy [82] and Sean Mullan [88] scored late goals for Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland manager Stephen Craigan said that he had been left "disgusted" by the scenes and competition organisers are certain to launch an investigation into what went on.
With Canada drawing 1-1 in Wednesday's other Elite Section game, Northern Ireland will lift the trophy at the Ballymena Showgrounds on Friday night if they avoid defeat against the Canadians.
In the Premier Section, Manchester United set up a semi-final with Partick Thistle at the Coleraine Showgrounds on Thursday night despite being held to a 2-2 draw by CSKA Moscow.
The Russian outfit will face French club Vendee in Thursday's second semi-final at the Riada Stadium.
Vendee confirmed their place in the semi-finals by edging out Co Antrim 2-1 while Partick's 3-2 win over the Chertanovo Academy booked the Scottish club's berth in the last four.
Nikita Kasatkin put CSKA Moscow ahead after seven minutes against United but the Old Trafford giants went in 2-1 up at half-time after goals from Callum Gribben and Marcus Rashford.
Mikhail Solovyev equalised for CSKA 15 minutes into the second half and both sides appeared content with the result which earned them semi-final places.
The Junior semi-finals will see County Antrim facing Chilean club O'Higgins FC at Scroggy Road with Plymouth Argyle taking on Brazilians SC Corinthians in the other last-four clash at Seahaven.
Antrim ensured their semi-final spot with a battling 3-2 win over Swindon Town while the Chileans ended Rangers's hopes by winning 1-0 at the Riada Stadium.
Plymouth strolled into the semi-finals by hammering Sydney United 6-2 while SC Corinthians clinched a 3-0 win in the battle of the Americas against Chivas Guadalajara.
