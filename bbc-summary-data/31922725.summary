The confirmation follows a media report suggesting Trinity Mirror could buy the Daily Express newspaper.
Trinity said it was at an early stage of evaluating assets, and there was no certainty a deal would be reached.
Northern & Shell is owned by businessman Richard Desmond.
"The board of Trinity Mirror notes the recent media speculation and confirms that it is at an early stage of evaluating certain of Northern & Shell's assets," the firm said in a statement.
The Times newspaper reported on Tuesday that Trinity Mirror was in talks with Mr Desmond about buying the Daily Express.
How far the talks have progressed is unclear as yet, but the Times reported that Mr Desmond could stand to gain up to Â£100m should the sale go ahead.
It is also unclear whether Trinity Mirror would also make a bid for the Daily Star newspaper.
Trinity Mirror shares rose more than 2% following the announcement.
Northern & Shell newspaper titles include the Daily Express, the Sunday Express, the Daily Star and the Daily Star Sunday. Magazine titles it owns include OK!
