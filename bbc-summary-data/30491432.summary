Ex-paramedic pleads guilty after Walsall Manor Hospital death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former paramedic has admitted failing in his duty after the death of a man who collapsed outside a hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Cope, 47, died from a heart attack after suffering chest pains near the A&E department at Walsall's Manor Hospital in June 2012.
Matthew Geary, 36, from Manor Avenue, Great Wyrley, Staffordshire, admitted at Wolverhampton Crown Court to failing to discharge a duty.
He was given bail and will be sentenced on a date to be fixed.
A 45-year-old woman, who has denied the same charge, is due for trial on 12 January, but the prosecution has discontinued a case against a 55-year-old man, who had been facing the same charge.
Mr Cope went for a drink after being left in an A&E waiting room and collapsed outside.
