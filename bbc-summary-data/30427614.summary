The blaze started at the disused building on the corner of Littleton Street and Bradgate Street, Leicester shortly after 03:00 GMT.
The building suffered a large amount of structural damage but an attached chimney remained unaffected and stable.
Matthew Cane, from Leicestershire Fire and Rescue, said the building had been "well alight" on their arrival.
"We have managed to contain the fire to the building and a couple of units next to it," he said.
He said the fire service was working with police to trace the owners of the units which suffered some minor damage.
Some surrounding roads were closed while firefighters dealt with the blaze.
Mr Cane said officers would remain at the site throughout Thursday to dampen down.
