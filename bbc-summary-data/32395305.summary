Rush hour Tube passengers had to "climb over barriers" to escape overcrowding after a derailed engineering train caused delays to morning services.

The Central Line was closed between White City and Marble Arch following the midnight derailment at Holland Park.
The knock-on effects built up along the rest of the line and platforms became jam-packed.
Eventually Wanstead and South Woodford stations had to be closed as well.
The Rail Maritime and Transport union said four workers who suffered injuries including whiplash in the derailment were treated in hospital but were later released.
Problems for frustrated passengers increased when they tried to switch to other lines only to find trains there overcrowded too.
Vivan Jayant tweeted: "The ONE DAY I decide to take the @centralline...."
He said: "The pavement was completely packed and people were climbing over the barriers and jumping down to walk along the road."
Mr Jayant abandoned his journey at White City and took a bus after being unable to get onto the Circle Line at Wood Lane.
Central Line operations director Peter McNaught apologised to travellers and said: "This is due to the part-suspension of the line which was caused by a derailed engineering train during the night.
"Our engineers are working as quickly as possible to restore services on the line."
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch is looking into the derailment.
