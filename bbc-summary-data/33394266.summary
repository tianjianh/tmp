Police said four offenders, arriving on stolen motorbikes, entered the jewellers on Newport Street, Bolton, at 16:45 BST on Friday.
Staff were threatened and several glass cabinets were smashed in the robbery.
Officers said a 66-year-old passer-by tried to stop the group's escape by attempting to knock them off their bikes using an advertising billboard.
The man was struck by one of the fleeing motorbikes and was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
