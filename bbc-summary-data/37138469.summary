Lawro's Premier League predictions v Olympic champion Laura Trott

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of different guests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this week's Premier League fixtures is four-time Olympic cycling champion Laura Trott.
Trott is a Tottenham fan and told BBC Sport: "My mum and dad support Spurs but my sister supported Arsenal because my granddad was a Gunners fan.
"You know how it is with siblings - I just chose the team my sister didn't like."

You can make your own predictions now, compare them to Lawro and other fans and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the new BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last week, Lawro got six correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 90 points.
He beat comedians Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson, who got four correct results, with one perfect score, for a total of 70 points.
All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.
This is an interesting one. Going forward, Tottenham have not really started firing properly yet but they have still shown why they are very hard to beat.
Mauricio Pochettino's teams always protect their back four and summer signing Victor Wanyama does that job very well because he covers so much ground.
I don't think Liverpool's defeat by Burnley will knock their confidence, but the way that game went for them could happen a lot this season, especially against teams from the bottom half of the Premier League.

The way the Reds are set up and with the players they have got, I think they are going to win quite a few games easily but, when teams score against them first, it is going to be difficult for them.
Burnley were very rigid, and very well organised and defended very deep. Although Liverpool have lots players that can give them options up front, they are all quite similar and do not allow them to mix up their style of play when they are chasing a game.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Laura's prediction: I'm going with Tottenham but I don't think we are going to run away with it. 2-1
I was at Burnley's defeat at Accrington in the EFL Cup on Wednesday for BBC Radio 5 live but I effectively saw the Clarets' reserves because Sam Vokes was the only player likely to start on Saturday who started that game too.
So I don't think that result will spoil Burnley's week after their excellent win over Liverpool, but this is still a tough task for them.

Chelsea have just done enough to win both their league games so far and the way they have done it, with late goals, will have given their players a lot of belief.
They know they are fit and competitive already at this stage of the season and, on top of that, even if they go behind in the future they will now think they will still go on and win.
I don't see them having to do things the hard way on Saturday, though.
I expect Burnley to be in their usual 4-4-2 formation. They will be hard to break down, and will not care about not seeing much of the ball after winning last week with only 19% possession.
But that was after they scored an early goal and I don't see the same thing happening again at Stamford Bridge.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Laura's prediction: 2-1
I think it is ridiculous that Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew is already perceived to be under pressure.
We have only had two league games, but supposedly it is because of Palace's poor run in the second half of last season - they did not win a league game between 19 December and 9 April.
I always think you should take the season as a whole anyway, but just looking at the above ignores Palace's run to the FA Cup final.
Also, Pardew has just spent Â£27m on Christian Benteke - why would you give him that sort of money and then give him two games to save his job?

Like Palace, Bournemouth are yet to pick up a point this season, but thankfully nobody seems to be saying Eddie Howe's future is in doubt.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Laura's prediction: 1-0
The scoreline was a bit harsh on Stoke in their 4-1 defeat by Manchester City last week but I agreed with the penalty decision for City's opener because Ryan Shawcross has been doing that for years.
Everton have made a strong start and have integrated their new players in nicely, and I am backing them to continue that on Saturday.
I think Ronald Koeman is an excellent manager and he was really clever when he made Ross Barkley captain for the Toffees' EFL Cup win over Yeovil.
Koeman was basically saying 'you're a local lad and a great talent, go and show me what you can do'.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Laura's prediction: 2-1
Swansea worry me a little bit after seeing their first two games of the season.
They were rather fortunate to beat Burnley on the opening weekend, and then they got turned over at home by Hull.

Against the Tigers, they did not look like a team that had gelled - they were more like a bunch of strangers. It is early days, of course, but they have a lot of work to do.
I not predicting the Swans will be relegated, but what I am saying is that, as things stand, would I be surprised if they finish 15th or 16th? I would say no.
I also do not see them getting anything at Leicester. The Foxes' draw with Arsenal was a bit of a nothing game but I think they will be back on song for this one.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Laura's prediction: 1-0
What I have seen of Southampton so far does not change my opinion that this is going to be their hardest season for a while.
I know their recruitment is very good but if you keep selling all of your best players then, sooner or later, it catches up with you.
As far as this game is concerned, I'm going for a draw, which will be a much better result for Sunderland. They are still trying to strengthen, especially in midfield.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Laura's prediction: 1-2
Here are two more teams who are without a win but we know that with Arsenal it will just be a matter of time. Watford might have a longer wait.
The Gunners looked a lot stronger defensively with Laurent Koscielny back in the side against Leicester and I think they will pick up three points here.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Laura's prediction: 1-0
Hats off to Hull for their start to the season with six points out of six, and the way they are playing too.
But this is the Tigers' toughest game so far by a long way. This Manchester United side can score goals from all over the pitch and they are starting to get their swagger back too.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Laura's prediction: 0-2
Middlesbrough have got four points from their first two games and look solid defensively but I still expect West Brom to find a way through.
The Baggies are looking to do some business before the transfer window shuts because I think Tony Pulis knows he has to strengthen, but their set-piece strength should see them through on Sunday.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Laura's prediction: 1-2
It is a case of so far, so good for Pep Guardiola and Manchester City, who are safely into the group stage of the Champions League and have won both Premier League games so far.

It is brave of Guardiola to let Joe Hart leave but my worry for City is up front. Wilfried Bony has been linked with West Ham and, if they let him go, they are short of cover in attack.
If anything happens to Sergio Aguero, that only leaves Kelechi Iheanacho to lead the line - and he is a doubt himself after picking up an injury against Steaua Bucharest.
I still fancy City to win this one, though.
West Ham have been hit by a few injuries and were pretty ordinary for long spells against Bournemouth last week, although the most important thing for them was winning the game.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Laura's prediction: 1-0
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
