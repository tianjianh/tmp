Cardiff are five points off the top six after Fulham won 2-1 at Craven Cottage.
Slade was frustrated his side did not capitalise on play-off rivals Sheffield Wednesday's 4-1 defeat at Bristol City.
"Unfortunately we couldn't close that gap because we couldn't take what would have been a precious point at the end," Slade said after Fulham's late winner.
"We'll keep going. There's no way we're giving that up.
"There's 15 points to play for and we're going to do our very best right to the very end and try and pick us many points as we can."
Lex Immers' header gave Cardiff the lead but Scott Parker's brought Fulham level in the opening minute of the second half.
Emerson Hyndman struck from close range following a scramble at a corner in stoppage time to secure victory for Fulham.
Slade said defeat was harsh on Cardiff, who remain seventh and five points behind sixth-placed Wednesday who they face away on 30 April.
"Of course you're hurt when you lose a football match and it was an important game," Slade added.
"We've had a setback and we'll need to dust ourselves down, need to get over that and focus on our remaining games."
