[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Fortescue died at the Boconnoc estate near Lostwithiel in Cornwall.
In a joint statement, Mr Fortescue's family said he would be deeply missed, and they were "proud of all that Anthony created at Boconnoc".
Police said a 69-year-old man was found shortly before midday on Monday and the death was not being treated as suspicious. A file is being prepared for the coroner.
The Office of High Sheriff is regarded as a non-political Royal appointment which supports the Crown and the judiciary.
In a statement issued on behalf of the Fortescue family it said: "It is with great sadness that the Boconnoc Estate confirm the untimely and sudden death of Anthony Fortescue at his home yesterday."
The family said Mr Fortescue had been "instrumental - with his wife Elizabeth and two daughters, Clare and Sarah, in revitalising the Estate and restoring Boconnoc House".
Elizabeth Fortescue said. "Our daughters Clare and Sarah and I are so proud of all that Anthony created at Boconnoc. We and all the team at Boconnoc will miss him so deeply."
South East Cornwall MP Sheryll Murray tweeted: "Very sad to hear of the loss of my good friend Anthony Fortescue.  My thoughts are with his wife and daughters."
Boconnoc house and estate date back to 1086 but were virtually abandoned for 30 years after World War II until the Fortescues began restoring it in 1997.
The house has been home to two British Prime Ministers and has been used as a location for films and television series.
