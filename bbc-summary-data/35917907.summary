The Latics, who were relegated last season, are second in League One and a point behind leaders Burton.
"I am very fortunate that I have got a good group of players and squad to pick from," he told BBC Radio Manchester.
"I don't worry about this group. They have shown time and again their character and determination to win and take this club back up the leagues."
Former Scotland defender Caldwell continued: "I hope we do it (win automatic promotion) convincingly. At the minute we're a team full of confidence and belief, and we'll continue to do that."
Monday's 1-0 win against Rochdale, which came three days after a 4-1 win away at Swindon, extended Wigan's unbeaten run in League One to 18 games.
"We have to recover from what is a very difficult period," Caldwell added. "To play two games in three days is a big ask physically."
Caldwell's side were forced to work for their three points in an edgy 1-0 win against Dale, who played for nearly an hour with 10 men after Ian Henderson was sent off for kicking out at Jason Pearce.
"I would be very disappointed if any of my players reacted the way their player reacted, you can't do that in football, everyone knows that," he said.
"At home it can be difficult against 10 men at times. It galvanises the away team and it did that with Rochdale who had great desire."
