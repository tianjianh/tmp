Akhtar Javeed, 56, was shot during a robbery at his business premises in Digbeth, Birmingham, on 3 February.
One man, Suraj Mistry, 26, has been convicted of his manslaughter.
But police are looking for Tahir Zarif who, the prosecution, say shot Mr Javeed in the legs, throat and mouth and is thought to be in Pakistan.
Mr Zarif is said to have passed through Heathrow Airport with his mother five days after the killing.
On Tuesday, at Birmingham Crown Court, Mistry, of Laundon Way, Leicester, was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter and conspiracy to commit robbery.
On Wednesday he was also convicted of possession of firearms with intent to cause fear of violence.
Lemar Wali, 19, also of Osmaston Road, who drove to the scene but said he did not know his accomplices were armed, was cleared of murder, manslaughter and firearms charges but convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery.
Sander Van Aalten, 50, of Kyrwicks Lane, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to rob before the start of the trial.
Mr Javeed's daughter, Lilas Javeed, from Ilford, north east London, said: "There has been three people brought to justice. It's three less criminals roaming the streets but of course it's very important for us that the other person [Zarif] is brought back.
"I have faith that the relevant authorities will work together to bring him back and face trial so that we can get justice.
"I do believe the police and the relevant authorities will work their hardest to bring him back," said Mrs Javeed.
"I don't want to think about the idea that he will get away with it."
Det Ch Insp Martin Slevin, of West Midlands Police, said the convicted men had planned the robbery for weeks.
"We would urge anybody who has information where Tahir Zarif is currently living or being harboured to contact West Midlands Police, or Crimestoppers in confidence," he said.
The raid was launched after sacked delivery driver Sander Van Aalten, 50, provided the gang with a plan of the warehouse.
The Dutch national had worked at Mr Javeed's fast food warehouse, Direct Source 3, but was fired for his timekeeping.
Mistry and Mr Zarif, 25, of Osmaston Park Road, Derby,  were joint owners of a Derby car modification business that had run into financial difficulties, police said.
Mistry was being threatened by a gang he owed money to, police said. He had reported the threats but later dropped his complaint.
