[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A junior psychiatrist who assessed a new mother before she fell to her death with her baby was "unaware" of her previous self-harming, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anna Bleakley worked with Charlotte Bevan during the two days before she was found dead in Avon Gorge.
Ms Bleakley told the inquest: "I saw her bond with her baby."
Ms Bevan and her daughter vanished from St Michael's Hospital, Bristol on 2 December 2014.
The doctor saw Ms Bevan, who suffered from depression and schizophrenia, at 14:15 on 1 December.
She told the court her patient was honest about stopping taking her medication, risperidone, a few months earlier, as she wanted to breastfeed.
Ms Bleakley told Avon Coroner Maria Voisin that she did not know her patient was more at risk of relapse because she had just given birth and was unaware of her previous self-harming.
Her last visit to see Ms Bevan was at 16:09 on 2 December, the day she disappeared.
Ms Bleakley said she was not worried about Ms Bevan as "she was a very natural mother" and "spoke about her future".
It was agreed the patient would re-start her medication and continue to breast feed.
The court heard written statements from other doctors describing Ms Bevan as "unkempt" which was given as a sign of relapse.
But Ms Bleakley said she did not notice her patient's appearance, denied that she "felt out of her depth" but did "feel the need for a senior review" of her case.
She also had no inkling that Ms Bevan would leave the hospital that evening.
Ms Bevan and Zaani Tiana Bevan Malbrouck vanished from St Michael's Hospital, Bristol on 2 December. They were caught on CCTV leaving the hospital at 20:36 GMT.
Her body and her baby's body were found on 3 and 4 December respectively.
The inquest continues.
