Carl Davies murder: Man jailed for 15 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A French man has been jailed for 15 years for the murder of a former Royal Marine on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Davies from Sittingbourne, Kent, was 33 when he was killed in November 2011.
The teacher was stabbed, beaten and his body dumped in a ravine. His death was treated as an accident until post-mortem tests showed he had stab wounds.
Vincent Madoure, 30, was found guilty of murder in a trial on the island.
Mr Davies's family had waited more than five years for a trial.
After the hearing, his mother, Maria Davies, said: "All we ever wanted was truth and justice for our son.
"It's like a living nightmare that never ends. We will never ever be complete as a family, but my baby boy can now rest in peace."
Mr Davies had only been on the French-governed island for two days when he was attacked.
Four men were charged with his murder in 2013, but cases against three of them were dropped.
The trial of remaining defendant, Madoure began three days ago.
Local reporter Lisa Mela said there were still many unanswered questions about the case.
She said: "Where exactly did Carl Davies die? How was his body brought to the place where he was discovered on the side of the road? None of these questions have been answered during this trial.
"One person has been convicted but there are many shadows in this case."
Lawyers for former cleaner Madoure have said they plan to appeal against the verdict.
