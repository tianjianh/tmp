BBC Radio Lincolnshire's Charlotte Wright collapsed while jogging in the uphill area of Lincoln in November.
The reunion happened live on air after the station made an appeal in programmes and on social media.
Steve Race and Josie Vincent gave Charlotte CPR until an ambulance arrived.
Mr Race, from Colchester, who was visiting relatives in Lincoln at the time, was first on the scene.

He said he phoned emergency services and started giving CPR, which he learned in Army Cadets, with support from a call handler.
"I was panicking a lot, but the call handler helped with the timings," he said.
Josie Vincent, who is a nurse at St Barnabas hospice in the city, said she was passing by and pulled up to ask if she could help.
She said she then took over from Steve doing CPR.
Ms Vincent said: "I just thought she is too young to die, and I'm not going to stop."
Meeting them for the first time this morning, Mrs Wright said: "Josie and Steve are really humble, and are playing down their efforts that morning - but as far as I'm concerned they are my hero and heroine, along with my husband who has been amazing.
"I hope we can stay in touch, and I can remind them with photos of me and my family from time to time to show how grateful we all are."
Mrs Wright, who is one of BBC Radio Lincolnshire's longest serving newsreaders, added she hoped more people would learn CPR so other people facing similar situations could be helped.
