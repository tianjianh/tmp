A "dangerous" prisoner believed to be armed with a razor blade has escaped from a hospital in Wiltshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michal Kisiel, 30, left Salisbury District Hospital at 19:00 BST after receiving treatment for a head wound.
Wiltshire Police said the inmate is believed to be in possession of a blade and the public are urged not to approach him.
One line of inquiry officers are pursuing is that the escape may have been pre-planned and he had assistance.
A spokesman said officers were concentrating on transport routes out of the city, liaising with neighbouring forces.
The force is using dogs and a drone to search for him and has scrambled a helicopter too.
Kisiel, who sometimes uses the Christian name Michael or spells his surname Kisier, is described as white, 5ft 6in tall with blond hair and of medium build with tattoos on his neck.
He was last seen wearing grey tracksuit bottoms and a black T-shirt with blue trainers.
Insp Pete Sparrow said Kisiel was found on his cell floor with a head injury and medical advice was that he needed to go to hospital.
"Whilst there he managed to overpower his prison guards and escaped," he said.
"He's not a local person, he's originally from Poland and his offences were in Luton.
"He's left without money or a mobile phone, he's just escaped with the clothes he was wearing.
"He's going to be somewhere local unless he's received some help from someone who may have unwittingly picked up someone hitchhiking.
"In overpowering the guards he's left with a razor blade... he's a dangerous person armed with a dangerous weapon.
"Please don't approach him but call 999."
The Ministry for Justice confirmed a prisoner from HMP Erlestoke had escaped while on an escorted hospital visit on Tuesday.
