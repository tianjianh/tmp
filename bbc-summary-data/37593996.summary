[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a game of few chances, the hosts finally took the lead with ten minutes remaining when defender Dan Butler deflected a cross into his own net under pressure from Yeovil's Tom Eaves.
Newport, who have only won once all season, only managed two shots on target in the match.
The victory lifts Yeovil to 15th.
Newport County boss Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales: "I thought it was a very tight encounter. Both sides played some decent football in patches.
"We certainly did not look like a bottom of the table side. We were undone by a defensive error. But the lads went about their work in a very positive and constructive way."
