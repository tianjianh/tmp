BBC move would 'transform' Belfast city centre, council says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belfast City Council has said a BBC relocation to a site beside the Ulster University campus would lead to a "comprehensive transformation" of that part of the city.

BBC Northern Ireland is planning to move from its premises at Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue.
The corporation has yet to decide on a site.
The council has set out its preferred options for the broadcaster in its regeneration and investment strategy.
It said lands to the rear of Belfast Central Library, a site north of Great Patrick Street or the stalled Royal Exchange development could all be suitable.
It has recommended that a working group involving the BBC, the council, the universities and other agencies should be formed.
The Ulster University is currently building a major extension to its Belfast campus on the northern edge of the city centre.
Adjacent streets are also due to be redeveloped as part of the Northside scheme.
The council strategy expresses hope that a major department store, such as John Lewis, will anchor the Royal Exchange development.
But it states that if the retail option is not possible the BBC "would be an obvious candidate" as an anchor tenant.
The BBC has previously been linked with a move to Titanic Quarter or as part of the redevelopment of Great Victoria Street station.
The council's strategy also contains details of its Â£19m city centre investment fund.
It could be used to make loan or equity funding to developments or for the council to buy development sites.
