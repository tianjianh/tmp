The ex-Bluebirds striker has been appointed player development manager to oversee the club's youth development as they progress to the first team.
"He's always been around the academy but now I see him looking for the younger players we want, looking to put people into first team," Warnock said.
"I don't think you cannot take advantage of him being here."
And Warnock added: "Craig knows what I'm looking for.
"You pick the brains of people who you think can help you, and that's what we're doing.
"It won't stop him if a job comes with more opportunities, we'll say well done and off you go.
"But in the meantime I think it will do him the world of good working with me and the club and the development."
The 37-year-old former Wales captain ended his career with the Bluebirds in 2014 and made 91 appearances during two spells with his hometown club.
Bellamy, who also played for Manchester City, Celtic and in two spells with Liverpool, has been a volunteer academy coach with Cardiff after calling time on his playing career.
Warnock, who succeeded Paul Trollope as Cardiff manager in October, says the former Wales striker will be an asset to the club as he embarks on his coaching career.
"When you look at Craig's record, where he's been what he does, Craig just being there gets 20% more from the kids, but his knowledge of where to go, how to make the runs, [and] not just with kids.
"I can see him coming in with us [senior team] now and again, because you can never know enough in this game, no matter how old you are.
"When you've got a young player having Craig Bellamy telling you what to do it's something special, not many clubs can say that - he can even tell me a few things about strikers.
"He's still passionate, you don't lose that. I have to calm him down at times."
