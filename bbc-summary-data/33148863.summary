Local boat workers Lee Baron and Mark Harding saw the mammal in Liverpool Bay at about 15:00 BST on 9 June.
There has been an increase in sightings of dolphins and porpoises there in recent years because of improved water quality, said the Sea Watch Foundation, which monitors ocean wildlife.
Records show humpbacks were last seen in the bay in 1938 and 1863.
Mr Baron, from Warrington, Cheshire, works as a pilot coxswain, helping cargo ships navigate in and out of the Merseyside port.
The 32-year-old, who filmed the whale on his mobile phone, said: "We were just heading back in at quite a low speed when we saw what looked like a sailing boat flapping about in the water.
"But then we got closer and realised it was a whale.
"It was bobbing about and then it dived and that was it, we didn't see it again.
"We see quite a lot of wildlife and dolphins and we are always keeping an eye out, but this was a really special experience."
