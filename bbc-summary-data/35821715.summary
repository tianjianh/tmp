[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The racist killer of Glasgow schoolboy Kriss Donald has been ordered to serve an extra 20 months in jail for hitting another prisoner with a metal bar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Imran Shahid was the ringleader of a gang which killed the 15-year-old in 2004. He was jailed for a minimum of 25 years for the murder.
He admitted attacking Patrick Sandeman in Perth Prison on 5 August 2014.
Shahid, 39, who is now in HMP Grampian, will serve the 20 months after his minimum 25-year term has expired.
Passing sentence at Perth Sheriff Court, Sheriff William Wood told Shahid: "Assault with a weapon is always taken seriously and striking someone on the head with a metal bar will inevitably attract a prison sentence."
Shahid had claimed he carried out the attack after hearing about a plot to attack him inside Perth Prison.
The court heard that the metal bar came from gym equipment he was allowed to have inside his cell.
He was seen on prison CCTV coming out of his cell with the ten inch pole, before grabbing Sandeman and raining blows down on him.
Prison officers pulled the men apart after which Shahid threw the metal pole into a bin and walked off.
Sandeman did not sustain serious injury in the attack and declined medical treatment.
Kriss Donald was abducted in the Pollokshields area of Glasgow, stabbed several times, and then set on fire.
Shahid, his brother Zeeshan Shahid and Faisal Mushtaq were all sentenced to life in November 2006 after being found guilty of murdering the 15-year-old.
He was said to have led a gang which snatched Kriss because he was white.
Last year judges ruled that Shahid, who has spent many years in segregation, had been unlawfully kept in solitary confinement for a total of 14 months.
They ruled this had violated the European Convention on Human Rights but said he should not be eligible for damages.
