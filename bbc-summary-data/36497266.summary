The FTSE 100 index was down 81.67 points, or 1.3%, at 6,150.22, with all shares in the index trading lower.
Banking shares led the falls, with Barclays and Standard Chartered both down by 2.7%.
Insurer Standard Life fell 2.4% after UBS cut its price target for the company's shares.
Falling oil and metals prices also hit commodity-related stocks, which helped to drag the FTSE lower.
Analysts also said that uncertainty over the outcome of the UK's referendum on EU membership was affecting the markets.
"Unless polls begin to turn around and show an overwhelming bias towards Remain it is likely that the next two weeks will be characterised by uncertainly and risk aversion," said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG.
Tesco shares slipped 2% as the retailer said it had sold the Giraffe restaurant chain and its majority stake in Turkish business Kipa.
Outside the FTSE 100, shares in brewing firm Fuller Smith & Turner fell 1p to 1074p following its latest results. Adjusted pre-tax profits for the year to 26 March rose 12% to £40.9m.
Shares in womenswear retailer Bonmarche rose 3p to 130.50p despite its full-year profits dropping to £9.6m from £12.4m. The company said the trading environment had been "particularly tough".
On the currency markets, the pound fell 0.1% against the dollar to $1.4445 but edged up 0.05% against the euro to €1.2778.
