The move includes reducing the prominence of photos, introducing new technology, and asking users to sign an anti-discrimination agreement.
A study last year found that people with names that suggested they were black were discriminated against.

In an email to users, chief executive Brian Chesky apologised for being slow to address the concerns.
"Bias and discrimination have no place on Airbnb, and we have zero tolerance for them," said Mr Chesky. "Unfortunately, we have been slow to address these problems, and for this I am sorry."
The statement follows a report commissioned by the company from Laura Murphy, a former official with the American Civil Liberties Union.
