India v South Africa: Ajinkya Rahane lifts hosts in Delhi

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
India finished the opening day of the final Test against South Africa on 231-7 - the highest score of the series.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neither side had amassed more than 215 in an innings in the previous three Tests and India, who lead 2-0, were struggling on 66-3 and 139-6 in Delhi.
But Ajinkya Rahane hit 89 not out in half-century partnerships with Virat Kohli (44) and Ravindra Jadeja (24).
Recalled fast bowler Kyle Abbott (3-23) and spinner Dane Piedt (4-101) were the only South African wicket takers.
Piedt, 25, playing just his second Test, took four of the first five wickets to fall, including that of Kohli whose fluent 70-run stand with Rahane was ended in bizarre fashion.
The India captain, who won the toss for a fourth time, smashed a full-blooded sweep into Temba Bavuma at short-leg and after the ball ballooned into the air, wicketkeeper Dane Vilas dived forward to take the catch.
That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before Rahane, who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in his first half century at home, steadied the innings and took India beyond 200.
Rahane was helped by Jadeja, whose 59-ball innings was ended by a smart Dean Elgar catch at midwicket off the bowling of Abbott.
South African Abbott, who had earlier bowled Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha, conceded just 23 runs in 17 overs to continue his push to start the four-Test series against England, which begins on 26 December in Durban.
