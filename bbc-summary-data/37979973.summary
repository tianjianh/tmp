[SN]TITLE[SN]
NI First Minister Arlene Foster to meet Irish PM over Brexit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Arlene Foster is to meet Taoiseach (Irish prime minster) Enda Kenny in Dublin later to discuss the implications of Brexit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will be their first political meeting since Mrs Foster told the DUP conference that Irish government officials were talking down Northern Ireland's economy.
She said they appeared to care about the views of Northern Ireland people.
But she accused them of attempting to poach NI's foreign investors.
In response, Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said he was both surprised and concerned.
Although the first minister and the Taoiseach both laid wreaths at a remembrance ceremony in Enniskillen at the weekend, this will be the first opportunity for a political discussion between the two since Mrs Foster's criticism.
A senior DUP source told the BBC the talks would address the practical consequences of Brexit, serving as preparation for a bigger North/South ministerial meeting on Friday.
Questioned about whether Mrs Foster would tone down her warnings about poaching investors, the DUP source insisted Mrs Foster's message had been heard loud and clear in Dublin and had had the desired effect.
