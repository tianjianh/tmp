With the clock red, Murphy crashed through under the posts to punish the hosts, who had been on top.
The Scots, without a tournament win since 2010, led 15-10 at half-time thanks to two Jade Konkel tries.
Sene Naoupu, Alison Miller and Lindsay Peat also touched down as the visitors earned a bonus point.
Scotland also pick up a bonus point following a hugely improved display but will be bitterly disappointed not to have ended their long losing streak in this competition.
Sarah Law and Helen Nelson both missed straightforward kicks and much of the second half was played in Irish territory.
Scotland were ahead inside five minutes when Louise McMillan broke clear and was held at the line, with player-of-the-match Konkel forcing her way over for the opening try which was converted by Law.
Ireland responded immediately, hemming the hosts in their 22 and Naoupu ploughed in at the corner after Scotland coughed up possession.
With the Scots toiling in the scrum, Irish captain Paula Fitzpatrick fumbled what should have been a simple score but Miller soon added a second score with the home defence stretched.
Konkel, Scotland's only full-time player, again powered her way through a gap from close range, with Law this time pushing the conversion from right in front of the posts wide, only to make amends with a sweetly-struck penalty soon after.
Scotland were down to 14 early in the second half, with Lindsey Smith guilty of a line-out tackle in the air, and Ireland took advantage when Peat raced in to score.
For the third time, Nora Stapleton failed to convert from a difficult angle.
Scotland then put together some impressive sequences, with replacement scrum-half Jenny Maxwell injecting fresh pace in the Cumbernauld rain.
Two great breaks, from Lisa Thomson and Chloe Rollie, cut the Irish defence to ribbons but the hosts could not capitalise on their pressure, with Law and Nelson failing to land penalties.
With the clock into 79 minutes, Ireland kicked a penalty into the corner and kept their composure from the line-out, despite being held up on the line a couple of times, for Murphy to break Scottish hearts, with Stapleton adding the extras.
