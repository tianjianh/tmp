Three people had to be treated for the effects of smoke as a result of blaze fire in Braintree on Tuesday evening.

A fire service spokesman said: "The fire is thought to have been started accidentally by the occupant's dog who had jumped up at the cooker and turned the cooker on.
"Items left on the cooker then caught light. The house is no longer habitable."
The owners returned home to find the house on fire and went in unsuccessfully to try and rescue the dog.
