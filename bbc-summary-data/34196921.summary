[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scotland a special place for the Queen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland has held a special place in the Queen's affections from a very young age.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She was a regular and enthusiastic visitor to Glamis Castle in Angus, the home of her mother's family, as she revealed in a letter to her grandparents.
"Darling Granny: Thank you very, very much for having us to stay with you at Glamis.
"It was one of the happiest weeks I have ever spent.
"With lots of love, from Lillibet."
That letter was written when the Queen was 11 and staying at Balmoral Castle, another of her favourite places.
Scotland has always also played a significant role in her Royal duties.
When she became Queen, on the death of her father King George VI, one of her first official tasks was to plant a cherry tree at the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, the parish church for the Palace of Holyrood House.
And after the Coronation, the first to be televised live, huge crowds lined the streets of the Scottish capital as she received the Honours of Scotland - the Scottish crown, sceptre and sword of state.
When she travelled to Glasgow, the city's George Square was so packed with well-wishers that 300 people were injured in the crush.
But Richard Finlay, professor of History at Strathclyde University, said there was also controversy during the early years of the Queen's reign.
"There was the optimism because she was young, it was after the war, she represented youth and hope and aspiration.
"But her Royal advisors put their foot in it by insisting on the numeral two, and of course there hadn't been an Elizabeth who was Queen of Scotland before.
"And many middle class Scots got quite irate about this, because it was seen to be ignoring Scottish history."
He said there were attempts to blow up pillar boxes with the EIIR emblem on them and anger when, in a Christmas message from New Zealand, the Queen described herself as Queen of England.
Over the years, affection for the monarch, and interest in her visits to Scotland have waxed and waned.
But Professor Christopher Smout, the Historiographer Royal, told the BBC the Queen has embraced the new Scotland and has opened each session of the new Holyrood Parliament.
He said this showed her abiding interest in what happens in her northern kingdom.
"People in Scotland don't appreciate the degree to which she is Queen of Scotland.
"This is really very odd since she is descended from Scottish kings like Robert the Bruce for example, and she is not descended from horrible English kings like Henry VIII."
During her long reign, the Queen has visited almost every part of Scotland, receiving bouquets and less traditional gifts, launching ships, opening bridges and buildings, like the new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.
And she always spends a summer holiday in Scotland, whether touring the Western Isles in the Royal Yacht Britannia or staying at Balmoral.
Crowds along the Borders rail route, which the Queen officially opened, offered testament to her abiding appeal.
But Richard Finlay warned against conflating Elizabeth the person with the institution of monarchy when they are quite distinct things.
"The only idea people have of monarchy is the current Queen," he said.
"While the Queen may be popular as an individual, there is a tendency to translate that as support for the institution of monarchy.
"The big issue will be when the Queen goes and you have the issue of succession.
"There will be a lot of expectation, and re-evaluation about what we expect from the institution of monarchy, because it won't be the same."
