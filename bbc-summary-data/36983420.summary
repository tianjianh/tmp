Mrs Gandhi was admitted to Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital on Wednesday after sustaining an injury during a campaign event in the city of Varanasi.
Doctors say Mrs Gandhi is making "steady progress".
In 2011 Mrs Gandhi went to the US to receive surgery for an undisclosed medical condition.
In 2014, she was admitted to a Delhi hospital for treatment of an infection. And in 2013, she was taken to a hospital for a few hours after she fell ill in parliament.
On Tuesday, Mrs Gandhi suffered from viral fever and dehydration during a party campaign in Varanasi, the constituency of rival politician and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Uttar Pradesh state. She also reportedly had a fall.
The surgery on Thursday lasted nearly two hours, but a statement from the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency, said she was recovering well.
Reports say she is likely to be discharged in a week.
Mrs Gandhi, 69, is the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
She is the head of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has governed India for most of the time since independence in 1947.
Her party lost the 2014 general elections to Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
