The 24-year-old has played in 66 T20 games and 36 one-day matches, taking 72 wickets and scoring almost 1,000 runs across the two formats.
"I'm delighted to have signed. I can't wait to get on the pitch with this group of talented girls," she said.
"Hopefully I can add to the spin and batting department and help push for the Championship."
Wyatt's arrival will add to Sussex's bowling options following the loss of Holly Colvin, who retired at the end of last season.
Sussex director of women's cricket Charlotte Burton said: "It is fantastic news that Danni will be joining. She is a talented all-rounder who will strengthen all departments for us and will be a great addition with the ball, having lost Holly to retirement."
