[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barcelona 1-0 Granada

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defending champions Barcelona moved into second in La Liga with a narrow victory against winless Granada.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rafinha scored the only goal, acrobatically hooking in from close range after Neymar's effort hit a post.
Neymar and Luis Suarez were both denied as Barca dominated against the league's bottom side, who have never taken a point at the Nou Camp.
Barca remain two points behind rivals and league leaders Real Madrid, who won 4-1 at Alaves.
Sevilla slipped two places to fourth as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Sporting Gijon.
Barcelona have had a difficult week, reporting La Liga president Javier Tebas to Spain's highest sports court after he questioned the players' conduct in a heated 3-2 win at Valencia.
Barca coach Luis Enrique spoke in the build-up about the importance of his team focusing on Granada, but they produced a largely disappointing display against a team they were expected to beat comfortably.
Chances were rare for the home side, with Lionel Messi almost anonymous.
Following Rafinha's goal, Neymar was picked out by Sergi Roberto's cross but was denied by Granada keeper Guillermo Ochoa's diving save.
Suarez, La Liga's top scorer with seven goals in 10 matches, missed an even better chance, planting a free header straight at the Mexican.
But Barca never looked like relinquishing their lead, seeing out a win which lifted them above Atletico and Sevilla.
They also appeared to come through the match without any injuries, before Tuesday's trip to Manchester City in the Champions League.
