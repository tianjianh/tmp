An exhibition dedicated to fashion designer Alexander McQueen has broken the Victoria & Albert (V&A) Museum's attendance record, attracting more than 480,000 people in five months.

That is 100,000 more than expected, the V&A's deputy director Tim Reeve said.
The show, titled Savage Beauty, was so popular that it stayed open all night over its final two weekends.
"We have a lot of experience running big exhibitions, but we did not predict it would be that big," Mr Reeve said.
The ticket tally beat previous hit exhibitions including the Art Deco exhibition, which sold 359,499 tickets in 2003, and 2013's David Bowie show, which attracted 311,956 visitors.
The exhibition, which closed on Sunday, showed elaborate costumes McQueen designed, including a dress of razor clams and a skirt made from plywood.
It spanned his career from his degree show to his death at the age of 40 in 2010.
