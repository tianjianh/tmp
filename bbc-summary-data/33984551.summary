The 6ft-long (1.8m) Arctic wolf, worth Â£32,000, is thought to have been poached in the early hours of 3 August.
Three men, who are being hunted by police, were invited back to the Chelsea apartment and reportedly left at about 05:00 BST.
All three suspects are white and believed to be in their early 20s.
The wolf was bought six years ago from a taxidermy shop and has yellow glass eyes and white fur with black speckles on its back, shoulders and ears.
Det Sgt Sean Lyons, from Kensington and Chelsea CID, said: "This is a unique item and I am appealing to anyone who may know the three suspects or have information about the stolen arctic wolf to contact police."
