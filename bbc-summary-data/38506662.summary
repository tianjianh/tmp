David Jeffrey: Ballymena manager's patience running out after Glenavon defeat

Ballymena United boss David Jeffrey has warned his players that his patience is being stretched after the Braidmen lost a 3-1 lead in Tuesday's 4-3 home Premiership defeat by Glenavon.

Greg Moorhouse's hat-trick saw Glenavon snatch victory but Jeffrey said all the opposition goals had been preventable.
"If the players aren't able to learn and eradicate the mistakes, then you've got to see how do you sort that out.
"That's usually when you look to bring other players in," added Jeffrey.
Jeffrey said that Ballymena's defensive short-comings would have been masked in Tuesday's thrilling contest but for the "stupendous and unbelievable display" of Glenavon goalkeeper Jonathan Tuffey.

"He made save after save after save after save and the simple difference between the teams was Jonathan.
"But I've actually looked at all four (Glenavon) goals and they were all preventable and we keep saying that.
"There was at least one if not two mistakes, within all the goals that we conceded.
"And with the greatest of respect, Glenavon did not have to work overly hard to score their goals."
Following Tuesday's "frustrating" defeat, Jeffrey repeated his season-long mantra that his task at Ballymena is a "work in progress" but in the next breath acknowledged that he may be busy during the remainder of the current transfer window.
"Now is the time we have got to take a little bit of a closer look.
"We have got this far on the journey, how do we kick on?
"We're learning all the time about players. We'll see where that journey takes us."
