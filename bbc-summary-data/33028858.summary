[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ticket issued to parking fraudster outside court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An osteopath was given a ticket for parking in a disabled bay outside court while he was inside admitting misusing his dead mother's disabled badge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nigel Graham, 55, of Southbourne, Bournemouth, admitted misuse of a blue badge and fraud by false representation at Southampton Magistrates' Court.
The osteopath was then filmed leaving court to find he had been given a parking ticket from Southampton City Council for parking in a disabled bay.
Graham is to be sentenced on 26 June.
He admitted to magistrates one count of misusing a blue badge and five counts of fraud by false representation.
His solicitor said his client admitted he should not have been using his mother's badge, who died in 2002, but claimed he was carrying disabled people in his car at the time.
Graham was initially caught using the badge in King's Road car park in Southampton in July last year and appealed.
After this it emerged he had been using his mother's and late father-in-law's badges in Bournemouth and Christchurch.
The fraud by false representation charges relate to sending the council incorrect information when claiming he had been using the blue badge legitimately.
It is believed the ticket outside the court was issued because the blue badge Graham was using was not displayed in the right place. It is not known if the badge on display was his dead mother's.
