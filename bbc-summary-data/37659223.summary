Several bookmakers had suspended betting on the Italian being the next Premier League manager to lose his job.
But, on the eve of Saturday's home match with champions Leicester, he said: "I am trying to find out who put the money on, it's very difficult."
Former Italy boss Conte, 47, replaced interim boss Guus Hiddink in the summer, having agreed a deal in April.
The Londoners won their first three Premier League games, but a run of one victory in their past four has seen them drop to seventh.
And the build-up to Saturday's game (12:30 BST) has been dominated by talk about Conte's position.
"It is difficult to talk about the situation because I am focused about my work and improving the team," he said.
"I have a good relationship and communication with the club.
"We are working very hard to change the situation of the past. We are trying to build something important for the present and future."
Saturday's game will pit Blues midfielder N'Golo Kante against Leicester for the first time since he joined Chelsea for Â£30m in the summer.
The 25-year-old won the Premier League in his only season as a Foxes player.
Conte said: "Kante is an important player. He is a fantastic player with good stamina, technique and personality.
"He brought a great will to fight and he is a humble man. I like him and these types of players, those who put the team before himself."
