[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 1-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mat Sadler's second-half equaliser earned Shrewsbury a valuable point at nine-man Northampton Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marc Richards' header gave Northampton a 21st-minute lead, but Sadler headed home Shrewsbury's equaliser midway through the second period, while home pair David Buchanan and John-Joe O'Toole were both sent off.
Shrewsbury started brightly as Louis Dodds fired wide and Alex Rodman's header was saved by home goalkeeper Adam Smith.
But the Cobblers broke the deadlock when Richards headed home Hiram Boateng's cross.
Dodds went close as Shrewsbury looked for a quick response, but Shaun Whalley was thwarted by Smith and Ryan Yates missed from close range.
Northampton almost doubled their advantage when Alex Revell's near-post effort was saved by Jayson Leutwiler, while Dodds saw Smith tip his shot over the crossbar before the goalkeeper kept out his header from the subsequent corner.
The Cobblers were reduced to 10 men when Buchanan picked up a second caution early in the second half and Shrewsbury equalised in the 66th minute when Whalley's free-kick was headed home by Sadler.
Whalley was denied by Smith and Stephen Humphrys also went close as Shrewsbury chased the winner.
O'Toole was sent off in stoppage time after picking up his second caution and Shrewsbury went close to snatching victory when Jack Grimmer headed wide.
