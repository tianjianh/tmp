National Express West Midlands said it is installing technology on 1,500 buses through its network in the next two years.
A spokesman said the move will speed up routes and make fewer buses over-run.
Customers had complained drivers not giving change lost them money if they lacked exact change and added time on their journeys.
A Swift card can already been used on National Express buses in the area. It works in a similar way to Oyster cards used across London's transport system.

National Express confirmed Swift travel cards and cash would still be accepted on the network.
Jens Mullak, from Init Innovations in Transport, which is developing the systems for National Express West Midlands, said there is a "growing trend" for contactless payment around the world.
"I think it's a gradual process, but with the popularity of contactless bank cards and the usage of mobile phones this will surely more and more replace cash payments."
