Fit-again Walsall midfielder Isaiah Osbourne has signed a new one-year contract following an injury-wrecked first season with the Saddlers.

The 28-year-old ex-Aston Villa trainee signed for Walsall in September 2015, but then suffered a knee injury and is still to make his debut.
"I've spent time with him in the past year," said head coach Jon Whitney.
"He's been through some tough days in and out of hospital with his injury. But together we saw a chink of light."
As well as loan spells with Nottingham Forest, Middlesbrough and Sheffield Wednesday during his five years at Villa, Birmingham-born Osbourne has also played for Hibernian, Blackpool and Scunthorpe United.
He is now fit to resume a career that has been stalled since he last turned out for Scunthorpe in April 2015.
His presence will add to the 11 new signings available to Whitney when he picks a much-altered side for the Saddlers' first home game of the season on Saturday - at home to AFC Wimbledon.
Of the 14 players on the field when Walsall's League One play-off hopes were ended by promoted Barnsley in May, only four remain at Bescot.
