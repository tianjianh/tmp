Power Court, near the town's railway station, has been identified by the club as the ideal location for a new ground.
The club confirmed the land's purchase had been completed ahead of schedule after a planning application was submitted in August.
The Hatters have been at their current stadium, Kenilworth Road, since 1905.
They hope to move by 2020.
The football club's sister company, 2020 Developments, made the announcement on Twitter on Friday.
It said: "POWER IN OUR HANDS! We are delighted to announce that the transaction for 2020 Developments to purchase the freehold for Power Court from British Land PLC has been completed this morning ahead of schedule.
"The future is bright, the future is orange!"
Luton Town Football Club chief executive, Gary Sweet, said: "I am so pleased to be able to confirm this key deal for the football club and the town as a whole.
"It is a milestone achievement in the history of both. We see this as vital for the regeneration of an historic part of Luton town centre."
The Hatters hope to help fund the new stadium by developing a site they own near junction 10 of the M1.
Newlands Park would have retail, leisure and office facilities, but a Luton Borough Council report highlighted concerns about the plans.
It said the development could damage "trade, footfall and investment".
The club claimed there was "no evidence" the scheme would have a negative impact and concerns had been addressed.
Planning applications for both the Power Court and Newlands Park sites will be considered in the new year.
