The 118,200 standard tickets, which cost Â£228 plus Â£5 booking fee, went on sale at 09:00 BST on Sunday and were snapped up by fans in 30 minutes.
Glastonbury said: "We have, once again, been staggered by the sheer number of people from around the world who hoped to come to the festival, with demand significantly outstripping supply."
The line-up will be revealed next year.
"We're sorry to all of those who missed out," organisers said in a statement. "We really wish we could fit you all in.
"But there will be a resale of any returned tickets in the spring, and registration will open again in the next few days. Thank you for your incredible support."
Many unsuccessful fans reported a struggle to access the ticket site on Sunday morning.
Those wishing to attend had to register online in advance, and those who did manage to book were required to pay a Â£50 deposit.
The remaining balance will be required by the first week of April. Any tickets that have not been paid for will then go back on sale.
The first batch of 16,800 tickets - for combined coach travel and festival entry - sold out in 20 minutes on Thursday.
Coldplay and Adele are among the favourites to headline in 2016, while Muse have told Q magazine they would like to play.
Last month, festival organiser Michael Eavis told BBC Newsbeat he had booked the headliners for the next two years.
He said four of the six acts have headlined before, while the other two will top the bill for the first time.
Kanye West, Florence and the Machine and The Who headlined this summer.
