A binman has been sacked for mixing up a businessman's rubbish outside his home - knowing it would go uncollected.

Brij Dhande was left puzzled as to why his recycling was sometimes being collected and other times labelled as contaminated with other waste.
After installing CCTV outside his West Bromwich home, he caught the man transferring rubbish from one bin into his recycling.
Contractor Serco apologised for the "completely unacceptable behaviour".
"I'm struggling to explain it," Mr Dhande said.
"I've never met the man and have no idea what's behind it and without talking to him we're going to be at a loss."
The IT businessman said the mystery began about seven months ago and followed no regular pattern as to when his rubbish would and would not be collected.
"I've had to go through the bin sometimes to sort out the rubbish, which isn't very nice - it's not very nice for anyone to do," he said.
"Also, as taxpayers, we're paying their wages. So for somebody to do that to someone who is paying their livelihood, you're not getting the service you're paying for."
But after installing the cameras at his home on All Saints Way, something Mr Dhande said he was planning to do despite the mystery, he managed to capture the man at Tuesday morning.
John Mason, Serco's general contract manager, said the firm valued the efforts resident make to separate waste.
"We expect our teams to uphold the highest standards and we are clear that the behaviour in this video is completely unacceptable. I would like to apologise and to reassure residents that we are taking this incident extremely seriously.
"I can confirm that the employee concerned no longer works for the company, and I will also be speaking to all our teams to remind them of their responsibilities.
Sandwell Council leader Steve Eling said: "This is totally unacceptable and we're glad that Serco have dealt with it swiftly."
