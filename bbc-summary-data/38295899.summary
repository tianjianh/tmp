Prestatyn runner up in Great British High Street contest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Denbighshire seaside town has narrowly missed out in the final of a competition to find the best high streets in the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The judges in the Great British High Street competition decided that Falmouth in Cornwall should be given first place in the coastal community category.
Prestatyn and the Lincolnshire resort of Cleethorpes were named runners up.
The competition attracted more than 900 entries.
It is run by the UK government's communities department.
Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: "Our high streets are going from strength to strength as this year's Great British High Street competition shows.
"Town centres are being revitalised, with vacancy rates falling over the last year."
