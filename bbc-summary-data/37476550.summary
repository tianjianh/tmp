Ian Bashford, 60, from Bromley, London, died when he hit a support vehicle during the 35th Duo Normand race.
His son, Neil, described him as "loyal" and someone who "doted on his young grandkids".
The Foreign Office said it was in contact with local authorities and was ready to provide assistance to the father-of-two's family.
Mr Bashford said: "Dad was the straightest arrow you ever met. His sense of right and wrong shaped his character, and he couldn't have been more loyal to those around him.
"He loved his cycling, and doted on his young grandkids.
"He will be sorely missed by his family, and all those close to him at work and in the world of cycling."
Mr Bashford had been taking part in the 54km (33 miles) time-trial in Normandy when he died during the final descent of the road race.
His cycling partner Peter Gray said: "They [emergency services] worked on him for about 30 to 40 minutes to try to revive him but he died."
Police are said to be investigating why a vehicle swerved into his path 200m (650ft) from the finish line.
