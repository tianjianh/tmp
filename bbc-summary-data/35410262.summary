MSPs slam Westminster's Trade Union Bill in Holyrood debate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MSPs have voiced dissent against the UK government's Trade Union Bill during a debate at Holyrood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The matter was debated by the full parliament after a report condemning the Westminster bill was put together by the devolution committee.
The SNP and Scottish Labour are both strongly opposed to the bill, and have made efforts to have it blocked north of the border.
Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone alone defended the bill as "reasonable".
Members lined up to speak out against the legislation, which seeks to tighten regulations on trade unions and make it more difficult to call strikes.
MSPs voted to support the conclusions of the committee by 99 to 14, while an amendment from Labour calling on parties to support efforts to block the bill was also overwhelmingly accepted.
Leading the debate, SNP minister Roseanna Cunningham described the "poorly thought-out bill" as being "nothing more than an ideological attack on trade unions, with no evidence to underpin it".
She earlier attempted to lodge a legislative consent memorandum, a special motion which would have allowed the Scottish Parliament to block the bill from applying north of the border, but this was rejected by Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick.
Scottish Labour is making efforts to have Holyrood's standing orders changed to allow such a motion to be lodged.
The party has voiced opposition to the bill repeatedly, with one MSP ejected from the chamber while protesting against Ms Marwick's decision.
Labour MSP Neil Findlay said the "vast majority" of MSPs opposed the bill, which he called an "aggressive, regressive and an unwarranted ideological attack on workers' rights".
Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur added his voice to those opposing the bill, saying it had "no place in Scotland, frankly no place anywhere in the UK".
There was however some division among the parties opposing the bill, with SNP MSP Mark McDonald criticising Labour for not supporting his party's attempts to have employment law devolved to Holyrood.
Only Mr Johnstone spoke in defence of the bill, accusing other members of trying to "out-left each other". He was the sole member of the devolution committee to dissent from the conclusions carried in its report.
He said the bill fulfilled a Conservative manifesto promise, saying people had "real concerns" about strikes.
He said it would "increase transparency" and reiterated the Tory position that unemployment and trade unions laws were reserved to Westminster.
