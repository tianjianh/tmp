Ironbridge Power Station will stop generating electricity next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Operator E-On said it has 50 hours of its licensed operating hours left, which will end in the middle of next week.
The station, in Shropshire, had to close by the end of the year or after a set number of operating hours under EU environmental regulations.
E-On said no decision had yet been reached about the future of the station's well-known cooling towers.
The station, originally coal-fired, was converted to burn wood pellets in 2013 ahead of its planned closure this year.
It can generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of up to 750,000 homes.
