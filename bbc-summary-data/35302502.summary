Business Minister Fergus Ewing has announced an economic forum will be held in Hawick after an historic knitwear firm entered administration.

He was speaking after visiting Hawick Knitwear where more than 100 jobs were lost last week.
A further 56 posts are under threat at the firm with a manufacturing tradition going back more than 140 years.
Mr Ewing said he would chair a "round table forum" on local economic issues to be held in the town on 2 February.
Hawick Knitwear went into administration last week with the immediate loss of more than 100 jobs.
"Given the scale of the situation facing Hawick Knitwear, I will convene a round table for businesses in Hawick," said Mr Ewing.
"This will be a chance for me to listen to local businesses and understand the challenges they currently face and to explore potential opportunities and what support might be needed to help businesses bring those to fruition."
MSP John Lamont said any move which sought to "explore potential opportunities for Hawick" was clearly to be welcomed.
"However, a single meeting clearly falls far short of what I and others having been calling for," he added.
"We would like to see a dedicated task force for the town's textiles industry.
"Hawick needs a longer term plan for jobs and a single meeting is simply not enough to tackle the challenges faced by the textiles industry."
