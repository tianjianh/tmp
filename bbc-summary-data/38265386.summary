Both players' deals with the English Championship side begin on 1 January.
Centre-back Boyle, 25, and winger Horgan, 24, were in the last Republic of Ireland squad for November's World Cup qualifier in Austria.
They helped Dundalk to three League of Ireland titles and the group stages of this season's Europa League.
"Both players have had great seasons in their league and in Europe," boss Simon Grayson told the club website.
"They are young, hungry and looking to improve and will be excellent acquisitions for us."
