Paul McGinn: Dundee defender joins Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Chesterfield have signed defender Paul McGinn on a two-year deal after his departure from Scottish Premiership club Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McGinn made 78 appearances for Dundee after joining in June 2014 following the end of his contract at Dumbarton.
The 25-year-old started his career at Queen's Park, playing in 80 games for the club before signing for the Sons.
"He is very athletic and comes highly recommended," Spireites chief executive Chris Turner told the club website.
"Paul's arrival will greatly strengthen the level of competition for a place on the right-hand side of defence."
Meanwhile, defender Daryll Meggatt has left Dundee by mutual consent one year into a two-year contract.
