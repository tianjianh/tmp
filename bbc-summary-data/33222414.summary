Bristol North Baths: Development 'near completion'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A redevelopment of the troubled Bristol North Baths complex will be finished "within the next 10-12 weeks", the project's developers have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work started on the Gloucester Road site in August 2012 to build a library, health centre and flats after the baths closed in October 2005.
Chatsworth Homes said the project had been "beset with problems" but is now "very close to being fully resolved".
Bristol City Council has invested more than Â£3m in the project.
For many years community groups had called for the run-down site to be refurbished.
The authority lent Chatsworth Homes more than Â£3m to develop the site but halted the project amid concerns about the quality of work.
It brought in consultants but would not make the findings of their Â£40,000 report public.
But the BBC understands the document identified several "failings" relating to fire risks, access problems and structural issues.
The report said some of the "substandard work" had been covered by ceilings or concrete and could have gone unnoticed.
Chatsworth Homes described the report as "half accurate" and "half smoke and mirrors".
Assistant mayor, Simon Cook, said all the issues raised by the consultants have been or are being resolved at the developer's cost.
"While we appreciate there are concerns over the development, the appointment of contractors, advisers or staff by Chatsworth Homes is a matter over which Bristol City Council has no direct control."
