An eight-year-old boy has been rescued after getting into difficulties off Downhill beach, near Castlerock in County Londonderry.

The boy was about 50m out to sea on Tuesday afternoon and trying to stay afloat on a bodyboard when he became distressed.
An RNLI lifeguard, Ray Cunningham, brought him safely to shore, where he was met by his mother.
Mr Cunningham said the boy had been "very lucky".
He said the child was on his bodyboard outside the red and yellow flags set up by lifeguards "to indicate the safest area to enjoy the water, when he showed signs of being in difficulty".
"It was a nice day but we would urge people who want to enjoy the sea to stay between the flags and be vigilant for rip currents," Mr Cunningham added.
"This young boy was very lucky, he was working so hard to try and get back to the shore but he was going nowhere and becoming exhausted.
"He was pretty shaken by the ordeal but thankfully had no injuries."
