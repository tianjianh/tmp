The 21-year-old England Under-21 cap, who was introduced to Celtic fans at half-time during Saturday's 3-1 win over St Johnstone, can play in central defence or at left-back.
"So for us he's going to be important," Celtic manager Deila told BBC Scotland.
"He can play two or three positions and he has a lot of ability."
Blackett made 12 appearances for the English Premier League club last season and has had previous loan spells at Blackpool and Birmingham City.
However, his only United appearnces this season have been in pre-season friendlies.
"He's a very good football player, first of all, that's the most important thing and he has high ambitions," said Deila.
"He wants to come and play and be important in a team and at United he has been a little bit out of the team."
