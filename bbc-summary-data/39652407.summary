The Cardiff and Met defender is in the 18-man squad for the Sultan Azlan Shah Tournament in Malaysia.
The 22-year-old is set to make his Great Britain debut in a tournament featuring four of the world's top eight teams.
"The aim is to get into the Olympic squad for Tokyo 2020, but that's still a long way off yet," he said.
"Being selected for this upcoming tournament in Malaysia gives me a confidence boost.
"It gives me a great chance to play against some of the best teams in the world and get my first caps."
Kyriakides was part of Wales' 2014 Commonwealth Games squad in Glasgow and recently played in the team which missed out on this summer's World Cup qualifiers.
Great Britain play India in their opening game on Saturday, 29 April and will also face hosts Malaysia, Japan, New Zealand and world champions Australia.
Wales coach Zach Jones will also be part of Great Britain's coaching team for the invitational event.
"That's a massive boost for me," Kyriakides told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I know he's a brilliant coach and that will give me confidence when I'm out playing on the pitch."
Swansea-born Kyriakides is now part of the Great Britain Hockey senior programme, having been recognised as a high potential player.
He trains two days a week with the Great Britain centralised training programme at the home of British hockey and centre of excellence at Bisham Abbey.
"I'm training on a Thursday and a Friday each week at the moment," Kyriakides added.
"But I'm hoping to try and get a full-time contract at some point within the next four years."
