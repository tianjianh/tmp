The initiative will take hockey activities into 500 primary schools across the UK, while 100 hockey camps will be run in Everyone Active fitness centres in England over the three-year period.
"Hockey is a sport that has changed my life and I have loved being a part of it," says Alex, who won gold with the women's team at Rio 2016.
"I was very lucky to be introduced to the game quite young and I just want as many young people to have that opportunity as possible."
The academy is contacting primary schools across England to enquire whether they want to sign up for a whole academic year of after-school hockey provision for children aged 7-11. The hockey camps will be launched in the coming weeks.
"Programmes like this are critical for us to keep developing the game," said Richard Beer, development director of England Hockey.
"Hockey at this age is a totally gender-neutral sport and really allows everyone in the class to take part, whatever their capabilities. That's why primary school teachers like it so much."
Any schools or parents wishing to register their interest can email sarahbeattie@everyoneactive.com
