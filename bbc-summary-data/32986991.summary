Stormont parties should stand by agreement, says Cameron

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Prime Minister has called on parties in Northern Ireland to stand by the Stormont House Agreement.

David Cameron said the agreement needed to be implemented and the Executive needed to have a deliverable budget.
But finding a solution to Stormont's crisis over welfare reform will take "exceptional resolve and leadership", the Irish foreign minister has said.
Charlie Flanagan's comments came after talks in Belfast to end the impasse ended without agreement on Tuesday.
In the first prime minster's question time of the new parliament on Wednesday, DUP MP Nigel Dodds called on Mr Cameron to do all he could to protect the integrity of the agreement.
The prime minister said everyone party to the agreement should implement it in full.
The Stormont Executive parties met with Mr Flanagan and Secretary of State Theresa Villiers and afterwards Ms Villiers said the situation "looks increasingly grim".
She said "time is running out" to resolve the impasse and the Stormont House Agreement would be "in jeopardy".
The agreement was struck between the parties and the British and Irish governments in December.
It contains a range of measures including ways to deal with the legacy of the Troubles, but it is facing collapse over a failure to agree welfare reform.
In March, Sinn Féin dramatically withdrew its support for the agreement.
Ahead of Tuesday's talks, the DUP said it would bring forward a budget as if welfare changes had already been implemented.
DUP sources said that if the budget proceeds without the financial situation envisaged by the Stormont House Agreement underpinning it, either the Treasury would have to intervene or Ms Villiers would have to push welfare reform through via Westminster legislation.
Stormont sources told the BBC a "semi-fictional" budget could buy a bit more time for departments to continue to operate.
Ms Villiers did not refer to the DUP's plan in her statement.
Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy said his party was "prepared to consider any constructive suggestion anybody brings".
"The weakness is that it doesn't seem to take account of the fact that should we even agree a budget - a fantasy budget or a real budget - in the next number of weeks, that could be further undermined by further in-year cuts imposed on us by the Treasury," he said.
TUV leader Jim Allister said: "Even by Stormont's standards, talk of a fictional budget takes some beating."
Last week, the Welfare Reform Bill failed to pass at Stormont when Sinn Féin and the SDLP put forward a petition of concern, a blocking mechanism that meant it did not get the required cross-community support.
