There were more than 2,000 family doctors in September 2014, excluding registrars, retainers and locums working in around 460 practices.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the statistics showed Welsh ministers' "commitment to invest in our NHS".
But Plaid Cymru highlighted a 1% fall in GP numbers from 2013/14, warning a "recruitment crisis is looming".
Plaid health spokeswoman Elin Jones said the fact that 23% of GPs were aged 55 or over and nearing retirement age needed to addressed.
