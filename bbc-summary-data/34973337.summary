Bangor's Pontio, which is part of the university, was due to open over a year ago but had been blighted by delays and rising costs.
It starts showing the new film about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, directed by Bangor University graduate, Danny Boyle, from Tuesday.
The £50m centre has a theatre, bars, restaurant and business spaces.
"It's the beginning of another journey," said Pontio artistic director Elen ap Robert.
"The cinema is back in Bangor at last. Hallelujah. That's something we are all looking forward to."
The centre, which held an open day at the weekend, replaces the former Theatr Gwynedd which closed in October 2008.
