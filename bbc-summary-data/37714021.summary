[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on charging the father and first husband of a woman believed to have been a victim of a so-called "honour killing" has been delayed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Samia Shahid, 28, from Bradford, died in Pakistan in July.
Chaudhry Muhammad Shakeel is accused of her murder while her father Chaudhry Muhammad Shahid is being held as an accessory to murder.
A judge has adjourned the case until 29 October after Ms Shahid's second husband requested the case be moved.

Syed Mukhtar Kazim has lodged a petition with the High Court in Lahore asking for the case to be moved to the city from Jhelum.
He claims in his petition that his life has been threatened if he visits Jhelum.
Lawyers for Mr Shakeel and Mr Shahid have previously claimed there is no evidence to support charges against their clients.
Ms Shahid, a beautician, married Mr Kazim in Leeds in 2014 and the couple then moved to Dubai.
Mr Kazim has claimed his wife, who died whilst visiting relatives in Pakistan, was killed because her family disapproved of their marriage.
Initially, it was claimed she had died of a heart attack but a post-mortem examination confirmed she had been strangled.
