The ruling VMRO-DPMNE, led by former conservative Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, declared itself the winner, despite votes still being counted.
But the SDSM social democrats also claimed a narrow victory.
There were no exit polls for Sunday's election, called two years early as part of a Western-brokered agreement to end a paralysing political crisis.
Vlatko Gjorcev, a senior official in Mr Gruevski's party, told supporters at the group's headquarters: "We won once again. Tonight, today on December 11, the tenth victory in a row."
Meanwhile SDSM leader Zoran Zaev, quoted by AFP news agency, told a cheering crowd. "We are the winners!"
