Every year the cultural festival the National Eisteddfod appoints new members at a special ceremony.
Others honoured in 2015 include folk singer Sian James along with musician and filmmaker Endaf Emlyn.
They will be honoured by the Gorsedd of the Bards in Meifod, Powys, on 7 August.
Traditionally, Gorsedd members dress in blue, green or white robes and choose a bardic name when inducted.
Winners of the main competitions at the National Eisteddfod are honoured with white robes.
Green robes are for people's contribution to the arts with the blue robes for their work in the fields of law, science, sports, media, as well as local and national activities.
BBC presenter Jones trained as a ballet dancer before going on to grace the nation's television screens.
Although she spoke English at home, she was educated at Welsh-speaking schools, Ysgol Gymraeg Rhydaman and Ysgol Gyfun Maes Yr Yrfa, both in Carmarthenshire,
Gethin, a keen rugby player, trained as a lawyer before turning to local government, where he worked as chief executive of Taff Ely Council, before being appointed WRU president.
Sian James, who has released eight collections of her work as a folk singer, harpist and composer, will receive her green robes.
Emlyn, also receiving his robes, is known as an innovator of Welsh pop music.
Best known for his 1974 album, Salem, he also released several albums as a solo artist and with the band Injaroc.
Head of the Gorsedd of the Bards is the arch druid, an elected post with a term of three years.
The arch druid conducts the gorsedd ceremonies during eisteddfod week, which runs from 1 to 8 August.
A full list of those being honoured will be available on the eisteddfod website.
