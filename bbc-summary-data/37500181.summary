[SN]TITLE[SN]
Glentoran appoint Gary Haveron as new manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gary Haveron is the new manager of Glentoran after the Premiership club selected the former Carrick boss ahead of Colin Nixon and his brother Alan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Haveron quit Carrick in May after keeping them in the Premiership and he replaces Alan Kernaghan following his resignation last month.
His first match in charge is against rivals Linfield on Saturday.
The Nixon brothers, who would have managed together at the Oval, are former Glentoran players.
The club made their decision to appoint Haveron after the trio were interviewed on Tuesday night.
Former Coleraine and Ballymena United player Haveron left Carrick after a controversial end to last season.
Rangers avoided relegation by finishing 10th but the club was later charged for failing to implement Haveron's touchline ban against Dungannnon.
It could have resulted in Carrick losing three points and being relegated but the Irish FA decided not to apply any sanction following a hearing.
The Nixons are now at Championship club H&W Welders.
Colin, who made a record 792 appearances for Glentoran, works with the Welders U20 side while Alan is first-team coach.
Glentoran have made a poor start to the season and lie 10th in the Premiership standings while Kernaghan stepped down after a shock League Cup defeat by Annagh United.
