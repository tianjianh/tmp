[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwegian firm Marine Harvest has confirmed that it will cut 80 jobs in Scotland, including those at fish farms and offices.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forty-four posts are to go at its operations across sites in Lochaber, 12 in Mallaig, 11 in Skye and Lochalsh, four in Wester Ross and three in Lewis.
Two jobs are also to be cut in Argyll, two in South Uist and two in Rosyth.
Marine Harvest, the world's largest fish farmer, said the job cuts would make it more efficient and sustainable.
The jobs going in Lochaber include office staff in Fort William and workers at a fish processing plant near the town.
The company employs 658 people at more than 50 sites in Scotland.
It operates four hatcheries, five freshwater loch sites and 48 sea farms.
Its farm operations are situated across Skye, the Western Isles, Lochaber, Wester Ross and Argyll.
Live fish are harvested at a site at Mallaig and processed at Marine Harvest's Blar Mhor processing plant in Fort William. The company has offices at Fort William and Rosyth in Fife.
Thomas MacLennan, chairman of Highland Council's Lochaber area committee, said the lose of jobs would be "a blow" to the Highlands.
He said: "This will undoubtedly have a huge impact on our remote and fragile areas.
"Whilst this is disappointing news, it should hopefully leave Marine Harvest in a stronger position to face the future."
