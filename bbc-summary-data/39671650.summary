About 25 musicians took part in a mass outdoor rendition of the iconic sax solo from Gerry Rafferty's Baker Street.
It was organised as a tribute to the late singer in the week he would have celebrated his 70th birthday.
Paisley-born Rafferty died aged 63 in 2011, after a long illness.
The musical moment came as Paisley bids to be UK City of Culture 2021.
The bid is due to be lodged with the UK government next week and the event has been part-funded by the 2021 bid team.
Rafferty's daughter, Martha, has given her backing to the event, which took place at Paisley Cross at 13:00.
She said: "My father was very proud of his Paisley roots and I am sure he would have been supportive of the town's UK City of Culture bid.
"To have so many people playing the Baker Street solo together in the town centre is a unique idea and I am sure it will make a great spectacle.
"Let's hope they're all in tune! I am looking forward to hearing it."
The bid's director, Jean Cameron, said: "This event is a tribute to one of Paisley's best musical exports and a song known the world over.
"As well as marking what would have been Gerry's birthday it's also a great way to shine a spotlight on the town as we prepare to submit the bid, which will feature Paisley's incredible musical legacy."
