Gareth Bale is set to return for Real Madrid, giving new hope he will make Wales' Euro 2016 qualifier against Bosnia-Herzegovina on 10 October.

Real visit fierce rivals Atletico Madrid six days earlier in La Liga.
The Spanish club's boss Rafael Benitez hopes Bale, who has been out with a calf problem, and James Rodriguez will recover from injury in time.
"I am very cautious, but they are recovering well," said former Liverpool manager Benitez.
"We will see how they are once they begin to train with the team next week."
Bale limped out of Real's 4-0 Champions League win over Shakhtar Donetsk on 16 September and a scan later confirmed the injury.
The 26-year-old has scored six of Wales' nine goals to spearhead their bid to reach the finals of a major tournament for the first time since the 1958 World Cup.
After travelling to Zenica to face Bosnia-Herzegovina, they then host Andorra on Tuesday 13 October.
Chris Coleman's side need a point to qualify for the Euro 2016 finals, which will take place in France.
