Kevin Hart gave Dundee the lead while Brett Switzer doubled their advantage before the end of the first period.
The 2016-17 Elite League champions fought back, however, as Joey Haddad pulled one back for the Devils.
The Welsh side levelled through Mark Louis before Joey Martin and Andrew Hotham scored a fourth late on.
The Devils are aiming to win ice hockey's grand slam after winning both the Elite League and Challenge Cup this season.
They face either Belfast Giants or Sheffield Steelers in Sunday's final at the National Ice Centre, Nottingham.
The Giants and Steelers face each other for a place in the final later on Saturday.
