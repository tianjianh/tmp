More than 2,000 items were sold in total, with the Fifa Player of the Century selling his entire collection of awards and even his old passports.
The 75-year-old's World Cup winner's medal from 1970 fetched £346,000 on the final day of the sale, while his 1,000th game crown went for £162,000.
Some of the proceeds will go to a children's hospital in Brazil.
Pele's 1958 and 1962 World Cup medals were sold collectively for £340,000, while a replica of the Jules Rimet trophy made for Pele after his third World Cup success went for £394,000.
The player's football boots worn in the film Escape To Victory went for just over £8,000.
Pele said: "Having donated a significant portion of my collection to the city of Santos, I have decided to allow fans and collectors to own a piece of my history as well.
"I hope they treasure these artefacts and share my story with their children and generations to come."
