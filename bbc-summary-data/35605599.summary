James Short: London Irish wary of Exeter Chiefs winger's return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Irish assistant coach Richard Whiffin admits he is pleased winger James Short has made a flying start to his first season at Exeter Chiefs.

The 26-year-old left Irish in July and has gone on to score nine tries in 15 appearances for the Chiefs.
Short returns to his former club for the first time on Sunday after making the switch to the south west.
"I'm pleased he's gone down there and really shown his attacking capability," Whiffin told BBC Sport.
"When he was here, we really wanted him to break through. There were just a few things in the other parts of his game that we felt needed work.
"He's certainly gone down to Exeter and shown how good a player he is."
A Premiership winner with Saracens in 2011, Short found his opportunities limited in his one season with the Exiles.
"He probably didn't get the rub of the green," Whiffin added. "You've got to remember the guys we had fit and available for us at the time.
"Alex Lewington, Topsy Ojo and Andrew Fenby were all in the top 20 for line-breaks and clean breaks in that season.
"They were playing outstandingly well in their own right."
Bottom of the table Irish will hope to win a fourth successive home game against a Chiefs side who have lost three of their last five Premiership games.
