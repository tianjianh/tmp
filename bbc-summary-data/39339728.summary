Badminton Scotland made the announcement at the latest Big Hit Festival - part of the Glasgow 2017 legacy programme, which aims to introduce 30,000 more youngsters to badminton.
"I played badminton when I was young and got to junior international level," she said. "I'm thrilled the World Championships is coming to Glasgow."
"I don't play anymore but I'm a huge fan and love to watch it, so it's great to have the chance to promote the event and the sport."
Murray was joined by Commonwealth Games and European badminton silver medallist Kirsty Gilmour at the event at the Peak Leisure Centre in Stirling Sports Village, alongside 85 pupils from local primary schools.
The children received a coaching session from Glasgow Sport Young Leaders from Dunfermline High School and primary and secondary teachers who are attending a continuing professional development course, also as part of Glasgow 2017 legacy.

Billy Garrett, head of sport at the city's cultural and sporting organisation Glasgow Life, said: "A huge part of our legacy campaign is introducing young people to badminton and ensuring they are given the appropriate support to continue playing if they wish to do so.
"That's why it's so great to have people like Judy on board - to help us promote not only Glasgow 2017, but also the sport itself."
Murray joins Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon, Scotland rugby international Finn Russell and golfer Catriona Matthew in support of the tournament and ongoing efforts to develop the sport.
Chief executive of Badminton Scotland Anne Smillie, said: "I am delighted to have Judy involved with our legacy Programme. She and Finn were both at the Big Hit Festival on finals day at the Scottish Open Grand Prix and saw first-hand how excited and eager the youngsters were."
