[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 0-1 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nauris Bulvitis secured Plymouth a win over Blackpool, who played the last 20 minutes with 10 men after Jack Payne was sent off six minutes into his debut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Seasiders missed a host of chances. In the 23rd minute Armand Gnanduillet was clear through on goal but Luke McCormick rushed out to block before Mark Cullen's downward header came back off the bar.
And Cullen missed a golden opportunity after 41 minutes when he met Brad Potts' cross but missed the target from six yards.
Plymouth took the lead five minutes after the break. Sam Slocombe initially produced a brilliant save to deny Ryan Donaldson but Argyle kept the pressure on and Bulvitis headed home Graham Carey's cross from six yards.
Gary Bowyer brought on Payne but his debut was short-lived as he brought down Jake Jervis and, as the last man, was shown a straight red card after 70 minutes.
Blackpool thought they had equalised with eight minutes remaining, but Gnanduillet's effort was superbly headed off the line by Gary Miller.
