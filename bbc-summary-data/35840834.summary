By lunchtime, the benchmark FTSE 100 index was up 19.14 points, or 0.31%, at 6,220.26.
Anglo American was the best performing miner, up 3.5%, while BHP Billiton was 3% higher.
But the top gainers were Standard Chartered and Sports Direct, which both added more than 8%.
Mining firms had been boosted on Thursday by rising commodity prices, which were helped by the weakening of the US dollar.
The dollar fell on Thursday, after the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, but also indicated that it expected fewer rate rises this year than previously forecast.
On the currency markets on Friday, the pound was steady against the dollar at $1.4477. Against the euro, it was 0.25% higher at â‚¬1.2828.
