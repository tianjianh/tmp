Ambassador gives 'Iraq defence' for UK's Syria drone strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A letter written to the UN Security Council has offered an additional justification for an RAF drone attack in Syria, which killed two Britons.

British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said it was lawful as part of a "collective self-defence of Iraq".
The RAF attack last month killed its target - Cardiff-born Reyaad Khan, 21 - and also Ruhul Amin, 26, from Aberdeen.
On Monday, David Cameron said Khan was killed because he was planning attacks and posed a direct threat to the UK.
Since Mr Cameron told the Commons of the deaths he has come under pressure from Labour MPs to publish the legal advice behind the action.
It was the first targeted UK drone attack on a British citizen.
It is believed Khan and Amin had travelled to Syria to fight for the Islamic State (IS) group, also known as ISIL.
In his letter Mr Rycroft reiterated Mr Cameron's assertion that there was a direct threat to the UK, but also added: "ISIL is engaged in an ongoing armed attack against Iraq, and therefore action against ISIL in Syria is lawful in the collective self-defence of Iraq".
Two years ago, MPs rejected possible UK military action in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad's government. Last September, MPs approved British participation in air strikes against IS targets in Iraq only.
Although MPs rejected military action in Syria, Mr Cameron said Attorney General Jeremy Wright had agreed there was a "clear legal basis" for the RAF strike to go ahead.
The human rights group Reprieve said the legal justification for the attack seemed to be changing, and Mr Rycroft's letter demonstrated the need for a full explanation from the government.
