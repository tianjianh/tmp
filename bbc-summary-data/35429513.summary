Residents in Rudry, Waterloo and Draethen have volunteered to track motorists driving through the narrow country lanes.
Speeding motorists will be sent a warning letter rather than a fine.
Part of the initiative Community Speed Watch, funding for the handheld speed gun and digital display has come from Gwent's Police and Crime Commissioner.
Project coordinator Sian Tucker told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme that drivers used the roads as a "rat run" between the M4 motorway exit and Caerphilly town.
She said: "The volume of traffic that goes through here and the speed that they travel has been a concern for the neighbourhoods for about four or five years."
Residents hoped to reduce speeds to 20mph (32km/h) in the villages and 40mph (64km/h) in the lanes, she added.
Gwent Police Sgt Steve Parsons, regional coordinator for GoSafe, said the scheme was "assisting the communities in giving them a voice".
