A self-portrait by David Bowie has gone under the hammer in Edinburgh, making four-times its valuation.

The artwork, titled DHEAD, was originally donated for the fundraising ARTAID 98 exhibition in the city in 1998.
His portrait was auctioned during Lyon & Turnbull's contemporary paintings sale, making Â£22,500. It had been valued at between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000.
Bowie died on 10 January this year after a battle with liver cancer.
A one-time art school student, Bowie's paintings focus on abstract head studies influenced by the bizarreness and esotericism of 1930s era German Expressionist art.
Charlotte Riordan, picture specialist at Lyon & Turnbull, said: "Best known of course as a singer/songwriter, Bowie's entire career was spent actively blurring the lines between the art forms of music, performance and design; the visual playing as big a part as the aural."
