[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bognor Regis mother Gintare Suminaite admits killing baby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has pleaded guilty to killing her newborn girl shortly after giving birth in the bathroom of her West Sussex home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gintare Suminaite, of Bognor Regis, had faced a murder charge but prosecutors accepted her guilty plea for infanticide.
Prosecutor Ed Brown QC asked for the murder charge to lie on file.
The Old Bailey heard Suminaite, 30, had been mentally disturbed from the effects of giving birth on 5 April.
The charge stated Suminaite caused the death of her daughter "by compression of the neck with a ligature or by manual compression of the neck".
Mr Justice Nicol adjourned sentencing until 23 January for further reports to be prepared.
He told Suminaite, of Aldwick Road, who was helped by a Lithuanian interpreter, all sentencing options remained open and remanded her in custody.
The case was "out of the ordinary", he added.
