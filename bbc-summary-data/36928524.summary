Loris Karius: Liverpool goalkeeper ruled out with broken hand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius has been ruled out for eight to 10 weeks with a broken hand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
German Karius, 22, suffered the injury in Liverpool's friendly defeat against Chelsea in America on Wednesday and will return to England for surgery.
Karius joined the Anfield side from manager Jurgen Klopp's former club Mainz for Â£4.7m in May.
The Reds are left with two fit senior goalkeepers in Simon Mignolet and 39-year-old Alex Manninger.
Veteran goalkeeper Manninger, who played for Arsenal from 1997 to 2002, signed a short-term deal after being released by FC Augsburg last month.
