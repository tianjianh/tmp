[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leeds United 1-0 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Wood's first-half header was enough to earn Leeds a narrow victory over Ipswich at Elland Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old netted for the fourth game in a row as he met Charlie Taylor's cross and sent the ball past Bartosz Białkowski in goal.
New Zealand international Wood almost doubled his and the hosts' tally before half-time but was denied by Christophe Berra's last-ditch tackle.
Ipswich managed just a single shot on target as Leeds took all three points.
Following the home side's opener, Ipswich went close as Grant Ward's low volley from the edge of the box was deflected just wide of Robert Green's right post.
However, Leeds remained dominant and Hadi Sacko shot wide when he only had Bialkowski to beat before the Tractor Boys' keeper was forced to pull off an excellent save at full stretch to tip over Kalvin Phillips' free-kick.
The visitors almost earned a point with five minutes remaining but Freddie Sears' 20-yard free-kick just sailed over the top of the bar.
Leeds head coach Garry Monk:
"Each time the team goes onto the pitch, and you can see it when I look at the start of the season to now, that understanding of what is expected and how we are going to do it is getting better.
"We are taking steps forward for sure. Improvements are there and when you look at that first game, it is pleasing.
"I have a plan that I work to and everyone is clear with that, they understand exactly where they need to get."
REACTION: Leeds United manager Garry Monk speaks to BBC Radio Leeds
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"I thought Chris Wood was outstanding, the focal point and the big difference in the team. When they hit it up there they stuck up there and he ran in the channels.
"He showed why he had good money (spent on him) and why he's a good player. Leeds have a very good player. He played well.
"Even the free-kick at the end, I know Freddie (Sears) hit the target twice last week, but he's probably too close [to score] and we let them off the hook.
