Mr Todd's car is used as a private ambulance and in the video a passer-by asks an officer why he was being issued with a ticket.
The officer said he was not allowed to use blue lights as the car was a private vehicle and he was not an ambulance driver.
Mr Todd told the BBC: "I was set up and someone took a video."
He said he would consider taking the incident "further" with the police and was planning to make a formal complaint.
Mr Todd came fourth in the mayoral race and received 5,344 votes (8.3%). Labour's Ros Jones was elected with 32,631 votes (50.9%).
