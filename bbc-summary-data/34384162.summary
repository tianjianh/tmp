Olympic team pursuit champion Dani King is concentrating on road racing after being left out of British Cycling's track plans for Rio 2016.

King, who won gold at London 2012 alongside Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell, says the event's change from 3km to 4km is behind the decision.
It comes less than a year after she broke five ribs and suffered a collapsed lung in a training accident.
"I'm excited looking forward to the road now," she told BBC Radio Solent.
Hampshire-born King, who trains in Cardiff, was also left out of the recent squad for the Road World Championships last weekend, where Great Britain's Lizzie Armitstead took gold in the women's road race.
"Because I'd been focusing on the track up until the end of July, the selectors didn't think I'd have enough endurance for the World Championships," the 24-year-old said.
"I disagreed though as I did a six-day stage race prior to the worlds, where I finished in the top 20 on general classification and I'd done a lot of work for my team-mates.
"But, it was last-minute that I wanted to have myself put in the mix, so I understand it from that point of view. But it's still frustrating, as I was there competing in the team time trial anyway."
King has re-signed for road team Wiggle Honda for another year as her focus turns to the Rio Olympics and has also announced her engagement to fianc√© Matt Rowe.
"It's exciting going forward for my personal ambitions as well as getting in the team for Rio," she added.
"I'm going to meet with the selectors in the winter to make sure I'm completely clear in my mind what they're looking for."
