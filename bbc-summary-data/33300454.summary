Scott McDonald suggests there is "a huge chance" he could return for a third spell with Motherwell but says there is interest from other clubs.

The 31-year-old striker spent the second half of last season at Fir Park and helped Well avoid relegation.
"It is quite easy for me to make that choice, but I have got other options further afield - abroad," he said.
"I did state I want to get back down to England again - I do feel there's some unfinished business there."
McDonald revealed there had been talks with clubs in England as well as Motherwell but suggested it was "early days" as many managers and chief executives had only just returned from summer holidays.
"Obviously it's nice to have a few offers, because we know that in football at the moment it's difficult times for a lot of players," he told BBC Scotland.
"It will be decided with me and the family. My wife's pregnant again, a big bearing on everything, so it's taking a bit more time than usual to get it over the line on what we want next."
McDonald, who won 26 caps for Australia, spent three years with Motherwell and had a similar spell at Celtic before time in England with Middlesbrough and Millwall.
He returned to Fir Park after being released by the Lions and scored five times in 13 appearances before Motherwell beat Rangers in the play-off final.
"Motherwell have been very good to me over the time I was there - this time and the time before," said McDonald, who added that the club had a strong place in his heart.
"We've always loved living in Scotland, me and my family, and I still have my house up there as well."
John Sutton has left Well for St Johnstone and Lee Erwin has joined Leeds United this summer, with manager Ian Baraclough already recruiting David Clarkson after his exit from Dundee and fellow striker Wes Fletcher after his release by York City.
McDonald was full of praise for the man who took over from Stuart McCall midway through the season.
"It was obviously difficult circumstances, but thankfully we got through it in the end and it was a fantastic ending to what was probably a disappointing season all round for the club," he said.
"I fully believe that, with the manager in place, and the assistant that's there now, the club's in great hands and I think it's on the up again."
