[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burton Albion 1-2 Newcastle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dwight Gayle and Mo Diame were at their ruthless best in front of goal as Championship leaders Newcastle won their first-ever meeting with Burton to ensure they top the table at Christmas.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gayle flicked in the opener after fine play from Matt Ritchie on the break.
Burton quickly levelled when Lloyd Dyer slotted in Jackson Irvine's cross.
But Diame showed great strength to go through on goal and coolly slot the away side's second, and the Magpies just about edged a calmer second half.
Ritchie and Gayle both missed decent chances to extend Newcastle's lead, while Lucas Akins did blaze a great chance over the bar for the Brewers, who also had a late spell of pressure.
But Newcastle, who move four points clear of second-placed Brighton prior to the Seagulls' evening kick-off against Birmingham, had their extra quality up front to thank for their victory.
The Brewers had a daunting task trying to contain the team with the best away defence, best away points tally and most goals scored on the road.
They were unfortunate to trail at the break, and could easily have been ahead had Magpies defender Paul Dummett not made a wonderful last-ditch clearance.
But ultimately, with Jonjo Shelvey dictating play from midfield, Newcastle's extra quality told in the final third to ensure the hosts remain in 21st position, having one just once in their last eight league matches.
Burton boss Nigel Clough:
"A couple of errors in the lead-up to their goals has cost us, but apart from that I thought our lads were outstanding today, in everything that they did.
"Their effort and honesty shines through to us, but alongside that today they played with quality.
"We have put two great performances together in the last four days and got no points, and I think that will change in the second half of the season."
Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez told BBC Newcastle:
"We have shown the team is strong enough and showed that we have confidence in ourselves. This is really good for the future.
"Now, we enjoy Christmas, our fans will be happy and I wish everyone a Merry Christmas. I'm really pleased, they can spend time with their families and watch the table and enjoy."
