[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts have not named another keeper in their 13-man squad for the first Test in Durban on 26 December and the second in Cape Town on 2 January.
De Villiers, 31, has kept in 23 of his 102 Tests, most recently against West Indies in January.
Cricket South Africa said the move was to boost the side's batting depth after the recent 3-0 series defeat in India.
De Villiers, who is third in the International Cricket Council Test batting rankings, has scored 7,864 runs at an average of 51.39.
Wicketkeeper Dane Vilas has been dropped after his struggles with the bat and gloves in India, while Quinton de Kock also misses out.
With seamer Vernon Philander still injured, Kyle Abbott retains his place in the pace attack alongside Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Kagiso Rabada.
Uncapped batsman Rilee Rossouw is also included, with off-spinner Dane Piedt selected as the only specialist spinner ahead of Simon Harmer and Imran Tahir.
England face the number one-ranked Test side in a four-Test series before five one-day internationals and two Twenty20 internationals.
South Africa squad for first two Tests: Hashim Amla (capt), AB de Villiers (wk), Kyle Abbott, Temba Bavuma, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Dean Elgar, Morne Morkel, Dane Piedt, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Dale Steyn, Stiaan van Zyl.
