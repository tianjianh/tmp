[SN]TITLE[SN]
Voluntary Living Wage call to lift standards in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are too many people in Wales for whom a "secure and decent paid job is just a pipedream," a think tank has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bevan Foundation outlined what it thinks Wales' economic priorities should be, following an invitation for views from the Welsh Government.
They include all public sector employers paying workers the voluntary Living Wage within a year.
The Welsh Government said it will consider the report.
In October it was announced the UK voluntary Living Wage was to rise to Â£8.45 per hour.
The foundation's submission said despite Wales' good performance "some major challenges remain."
These are highlighted as a shortage of jobs in some part of the country.
For example Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taff have barely half the number of jobs per head of working-age population compared with the UK average.
The report said where there has been employment growth, much of the increase has been in self-employment, part-time working and temporary jobs.
The report said wages, especially low wages, have been stagnant over the last six years with some parts of Wales experiencing a decrease in earnings.
In Blaenau Gwent earnings have not kept up with inflation, meaning the average worker is more than Â£70 a week worse off than in 2002.
Brexit was said to pose a new challenge, with concerns about the consequences for Wales' 500 foreign-owned companies and its Â£1 billion of exports each quarter.
The Bevan Foundation recommends that the Welsh Government's economic policies should promote "inclusive growth".
This involves combining the aim of growing prosperity, such as increasing employment, with the aim of increasing inclusion, such as addressing low wages.
The report said: "The Welsh Government has made good progress in encouraging the adoption of the voluntary Living Wage in the public sector, including the NHS, further education colleges and some local authorities."
But it adds that "much more could be done to increase take-up."
The foundation calls on the Welsh Government to require all public sector employers to pay the voluntary Living Wage to workers within a year, and to sub-contractors by 2019.
Inclusive growth should also address inequalities in the labour market.
The report states less than half of disabled people are in work, as are less than two-thirds of people from an ethnic minority.
The report concludes by saying: "Although Wales' economy and employment have made good progress, there are still too many people in Wales for whom a secure, decently paid job is just a pipedream.
"We welcome the Welsh Government's commitment to prosperity for all, and recommend that its commitment be turned into reality."
The Welsh Government said it welcomed the report.
A spokesman said: "We will consider it along with the others we have received as we take forward our work to build the confident, bright, prosperous and dynamic economy all parts of Wales deserve.
"We are also developing a fresh approach to improving prosperity in the south Wales valleys, which is being driven by a new ministerial taskforce."
