Australian federal parliament cleaners have launched a week-long strike in a bid for higher pay.

Pay rates for cleaners, whose numbers have been slashed in recent years, remain frozen at 2012 rates.
The United Voice union said the low pay rates were particularly hard to take in light of revelations about MPs abusing taxpayer-funded expenses.
Former lower house speaker Bronwyn Bishop resigned earlier this month because of her use of expenses.
The union is pushing for a pay increase of A$1.80 per hour, bringing pay rates up to A$22.90 ($16.90, Â£10.80) per hour.
Last year, changes introduced by the Abbott government pushed pay rates for full time contract cleaners who work in government offices back to 2012 levels, said the union.
"The Coalition's treatment of government cleaners is unfair and unwarranted," union representative Lyndal Ryan said in a press release.
"Frankly, it's not a good look ... Self-indulgence and waste of taxpayers' money could not be more stark," said Ms Ryan.
