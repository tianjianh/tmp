The sweet side of Mexico's Day of the Dead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Day of the Dead is one of Mexico's biggest celebrations when families remember those who have passed away.

The first of November is known as Day of the Innocents and is dedicated to children who have died, while 2 November is dedicated to adults who have died.
On both days families visit graveyards and decorate tombs with marigolds, the traditional flower of the Day of the Dead.
They also build private altars at home and on the tombstones, on which they display the favourite food of their loved ones to encourage them to visit during this period.
The BBC's Katy Watson photographed some of the typical foods and decorations made for this celebration.
