The 23-year-old joined City in the summer having spent his entire career at Wolves, and impressed in the Grecians' win at Leyton Orient.
It was McAlinden's first league start since the end of August, as he deputised for the concussed Lee Holmes.
"He's earned it, he's done very well in training and I think he's settling," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon.
"He's beginning to get some confidence, it always happens when you leave a club you've been at for years and years like he has with Wolves.
"Suddenly you're at a new place and your career's changing direction, he's got to find his feet and he's doing that."
