The Cypriot, 31, reached the third round at London 2012 and was due to appear in his third Games in Rio.
In a statement on Facebook, the 2006 Australian Open finalist said he still had "niggling" pain in his elbow.
"Unless I am 100% fit and healthy to compete, I shall not participate at the Olympics because I would be doing injustice to my country," he said.
Baghdatis will now continue with rehabilitation in time for the US Open, which begins on 29 August.
Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic and world number eight Tomas Berdych have also opted out of the Olympics.
