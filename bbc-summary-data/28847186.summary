Nathan Tyson opened the scoring from the penalty spot against a sluggish Watford, who made a host of changes.
The Hornets sparked into life in the 31st minute when Lloyd Dyer scored from a smart flick from Odion Ighalo.
But after the break, Doncaster were quickly into their stride and when Liam Wakefield converted on 52 minutes there was no way back for Watford.
Doncaster travel to Premier League Fulham in the third round.
Doncaster manager Paul Dickov: "I thought we were outstanding. We've come to a very good team who are flying high at the minute and really took the game to them.
"I've just looked at some of the stats. I think they had one shot on target so defensively that shows you how good we were, especially with a really young back four.
"And I thought going forward, some of the breaks, we kept the ball, we moved the ball at pace and I'm delighted for the boys."
Watford head coach Beppe Sannino: "For me tonight, this was a night I was disappointed for a lot of people, the fans here at Vicarage Road and they deserve another show.
"Doncaster played better than us and they deserved it."
