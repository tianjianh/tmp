The pastime, known as "drifting", involves driving at high speed and is illegal when done on public roads.
One drifting enthusiast, who wished to remain anonymous, said drifting was "dangerous" and there had been "close calls" but "there hadn't been a crash to date".
Another enthusiast said safety precautions were taken and the group worked "all year round" to build and prepare the cars.
"We don't build them to smash them up and harm people, we come up here out of the way."
Drifters say they are forced to take to public roads because private landowners and race tracks will not let them practise off-road.
An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said they could be charged with various offences such as dangerous driving and "could even go to prison".
He said drifting on public roads put lives at risk and the gorge was not a suitable location, but he said police would be supportive if they found a more suitable place to practise.
