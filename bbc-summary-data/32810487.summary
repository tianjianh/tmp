Olive Cooke death: Poppy seller had depression, inquest hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 92-year-old woman who was found dead in the Avon Gorge had "long term issues with periodic depression", an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Olive Cooke was one of the UK's longest-serving poppy sellers and had collected money in Bristol for the Royal British Legion for 76 years.
Media coverage of her death focussed on suggestions she had been overwhelmed by junk mail from charities.
An inquest into her death was opened and adjourned until 16 July.
Avon Coroner's Court heard that Mrs Cooke was pronounced dead at 18:20 on 6 May by a paramedic and was formally identified by her grandson.
She had complained to her local newspaper last year about the amount of requests for donations she was receiving.
A friend told the BBC that while he would not blame her death entirely on charities "pestering" her, she had been "under pressure".
Coroner's officer Linda Grove told the hearing: "This lady had long term issues with periodic depression and low mood."
The coverage of her death led Prime Minister David Cameron to pay tribute to her and to urge the Fundraising Standards Board to look at the case.
Her family said the charity requests, while "intrusive", were not to blame for her death. They said she had left a note to explain the reasons for her death which had mentioned depression and being elderly.
Mrs Cooke, from Fishponds, started selling poppies at the age of 16 as her father was an active Royal British Legion member having served in World War One.
She said it took on new meaning for her when her first husband was killed in action in World War Two.
