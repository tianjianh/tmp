It happened in an alleyway off Cromwell Street on Thursday at about 19:00 GMT.
Gloucestershire Police said the three people who attacked the man, who lives in sheltered housing, demanded money then stole his cigarettes.
A 36-year-old local man arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm has been bailed until 9 June.
Det Con Aimee Batt said: "This was a savage attack on a vulnerable man who suffered very nasty injuries.
"We're carrying out extensive inquiries, that includes forensic and CCTV work, but in the meantime we're really eager to hear from people who may have seen something suspicious or know anything about the assault."
