[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost 1,000 people in the South Eastern Health Trust are waiting for an urgent appointment to see a cardiologist, according to a report.

That compares with just 300 people in the largest trust area, Belfast.
It is thought that the problem in the South Eastern Trust is down to staffing issues in that area.
The trust - which covers Newtownards, County Down and Lisburn, said it has been unable to fill two consultant cardiologist posts.
There is also the added problem of staff sickness and increase in the number of referrals.
The South Eastern Trust serves a population of approximately 345,000 people with a budget of almost Â£500m.
The figures also show that 364 people are waiting up to a year for their first urgent consultant-led appointment at the Ulster Hospital, while in every other trust the waiting list for this type of appointment is zero.
In a statement, South Eastern Trust said:  "We have recently lost two consultant cardiologists who both required to relocate.
"Despite strenuous efforts, we have, so far, been unable to fill these vital posts and, combined with the constant increase in the number of cardiology referrals, this has led to an unfortunate increase in waiting times for appointments.
"We are taking every possible measure to address this."
