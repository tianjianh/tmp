A Teesside council is warning of hundreds of further job losses as it struggles to shave millions of pounds from its budget.

Stockton Council has already shed 700 jobs over the past five years and saved an estimated £34m.
It says it must find further savings of £17m over the next three years, which could mean up to 400 posts going.
Union officials warned that "basic services" like refuse collection and social care would be hardest hit.
A council spokesman blamed the cuts on reduced funding from central government adding the authority would "deliver less over time".
He said: "Despite making £34m of savings in the last five years, additional reductions to the council's budget mean a further £17.2m of savings need to be delivered.
"Whilst we will continue to do all we can to protect the most vulnerable of our residents and areas of greatest need, we do need to plan for further changes to help us deliver the required savings.
"Since 2010, 700 posts have been removed from the organisation and we expect the reduction of a further 400 over the next four years.
"By having a plan we can manage this as sensitively as possible and minimise compulsory redundancies although this is becoming increasingly difficult."
Mike Hill, regional organiser of the union Unison, said: "These cuts will mean basic things like emptying the bins, looking after parks and grounds and social care will all start to creak."
A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: "Local authorities have worked hard over the past five years to deliver a better deal for local taxpayers, keeping council tax down while public satisfaction with services has been maintained.
"However, like the rest of the public sector, councils have to play their part in tackling the deficit."
