Norman castle wall found under former Gloucester prison

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "huge" Norman castle wall has been discovered during the redevelopment of the former Gloucester prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Archaeologist Neil Holbrook said the "massive structure" was found beneath the redundant jail's exercise yard.
He said the "huge tower keep" was built in the early 12th Century and would have been a "major landscape feature".
The prison shut in March 2013 and was bought by City and Country Group, which is running a public consultation on its future use.
Mr Holbrook said it was important to redevelop the site "whilst preserving this important archaeology".
He said the castle was demolished in 1787 and the walls had "never been seen in the last 200 years".
