Police said a 15-year-old boy was arrested in connection with incidents in Glasgow, Clydebank, Campbeltown and Lanarkshire.
A spokesperson said: "Police Scotland takes hoax calls extremely seriously. They divert police resources and cause disruption and alarm to the public."
A report will be sent to the Scottish Children's Reporter Administrator.
The boy is not being held in custody.
Pupils were moved out of some school buildings for a time after a spate of hoax calls across Scotland last week.
At the time, Police Scotland said the threats were "not credible" but some sites were evacuated temporarily as a precaution.
