Two high-rise buildings in Merseyside have failed cladding fire tests following the Grenfell Tower tragedy.

The fire service said cladding was being "removed immediately" on Cygnet and Wren House on St James Drive, Bootle.
Landlords One Vision Housing said it was to ensure the safety of its tenants "as a precautionary measure".
Cladding on 34 other tower blocks in 17 council areas in England has already failed the tests.
Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said it had carried out joint inspections with One Vision Housing, Sefton Council and local authority housing teams.
Whilst the cladding met building regulations the fire service said it did not meet the latest Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) test criteria.
One Vision Housing said in a statement on its website: "As a precautionary measure to ensure the continued safety of our tenants, One Vision Housing have taken the decision to remove the cladding from the two blocks with immediate effect, to allow for further investigations."
The tower blocks have not been evacuated while the work takes place.
The fire service said it was working with One Vision Housing to offer advice to residents at the scene.
The Grenfell Tower fire in north Kensington on 14 June started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests, police say.
