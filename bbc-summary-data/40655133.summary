The 29-year-old underwent a medical on Wednesday after agreeing personal terms and a three-year contract.
Mannone, who joined the Black Cats from Arsenal in 2013, made 13 appearances in all competitions last season.
The Italian's arrival bolsters Jaap Stam's goalkeeping options following the departure of Ali Al-Habsi to Saudi club Al-Hilal.
Sunderland also sold England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to Everton earlier this summer.
