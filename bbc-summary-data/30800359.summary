Georgia Williams: Eighth West Mercia Police worker faces inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An eighth West Mercia Police worker has been issued with a misconduct notice over dealings with Georgia Williams killer Jamie Reynolds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reynolds strangled the 17-year-old in 2012, four years after a caution for trying to strangle another teenager.
Devon and Cornwall Police are investigating West Mercia Police's earlier dealings with the killer, from Wellington, Shropshire.
Seven officers received misconduct notices in September and November.
Georgia's body was found in woodland off the Nant-y-Garth pass, near Wrexham, four days after she went missing.
Reynolds had hanged the teenager in a sexually motivated attack in Wellington before dumping her body.
