The 22-year-old, who has made 32 career appearances for the Blues, is Frank de Boer's first signing since taking charge last month.
"Palace have a very strong team and I'd like to be a part of that this season," said Loftus-Cheek.
"I live not too far away, I was born in Lewisham and Palace are a good club."
Loftus-Cheek made three league appearance when Chelsea won the title in 2014-15 and six substitute appearance when they were champions again in 2016-17.
De Boer's side begin their season with a home fixture against promoted Huddersfield Town on 12 August.
