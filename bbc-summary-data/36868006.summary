[SN]TITLE[SN]
M5 partially shut for nine hours after double lorry crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Part of a motorway was shut for more than nine hours after a crash involving two lorries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The M5 northbound was shut at junctions four and five for the M42 to allow recovery of the vehicles.
Highways England said emergency resurfacing was required due to a "large diesel spill" caused by the accident, which damaged the road.
The motorway was closed from about midnight and reopened at about 09:30 BST.
