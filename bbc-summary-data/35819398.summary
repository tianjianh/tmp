The works, lasting six weeks, will see part of the A4 Bath Road in Calcot resurfaced ahead of the Ikea store opening in Pincents Lane Retail Park.
West Berkshire Council said the work to replace the road surface, which starts on Friday, will be carried out at night and during off-peak hours.
The £10m development is expected to be open in the summer.
The retailer has already spent £4m on improving junctions and widening the road to improve access to the new store.
The Conservative-run council said the works would be a "significant investment in Calcot's road network".
It added the new road surface would reduce the need for further work in the area and last 10-15 years.
