Exeter Chiefs' England trio Jack Nowell, Henry Slade and Luke Cowan-Dickie have signed new contracts with the Premiership club.

All three players have agreed deals that run until the summer of 2019.
Wing Nowell, 23, has played a part in all but one game under England head coach Eddie Jones.
Centre Slade, 23, has yet to feature under Jones, but both he and hooker Cowan-Dickie, 23, were in the squad which whitewashed Australia in June.
"It's great that they've come through our academy," Exeter head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Sport.
"They're international-quality players who want to stay at the club long term, and that in itself talks about what we're all about.
"We want to be a club where they can realise their international and club ambitions."
Nowell scored a try in Exeter's first-ever Premiership final appearance in May, which they lost to Saracens, with Slade having a hand in the score.
The highly-rated centre, who can also play at fly-half, missed six months of last season after breaking his leg in the Devon side's win at Wasps.
Cowan-Dickie is currently vying with Saracens number two Jamie George to be England's second-choice hooker behind captain Dylan Hartley.
"It wasn't a difficult process, they were all keen to stay and we were keen to keep them," added Baxter. "It was business that was all wrapped up pretty quickly."
