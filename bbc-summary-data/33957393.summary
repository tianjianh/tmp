[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The newly-elected leader of Scottish Labour wants people in Scotland to join the party and "stand for us" at next year's Holyrood election.

MSP Kezia Dugdale said Labour had some "excellent" MSPs but in order to turn around the party's fortunes "new faces" were needed.
She takes over the reins in the wake of Labour losing 40 of its 41 Scots MPs.
Ms Dugdale said she would start "renewing" the party with MSP Alex Rowley who was elected her deputy.
Scottish Labour begins a new chapter after former MP Jim Murphy stood down as its leader in June, just six months after winning the post.
At 33, Ms Dugdale has become the youngest leader of the party north of the border.
She beat MSP Ken Macintosh to the top position with 72% of the vote. Mr Rowley saw off Glasgow City council leader Gordon Matheson and fellow MSP Richard Baker to win the deputy's post.
Ms Dugdale told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that she did not underestimate the size of the challenge and that it would be "an incredible task to renew the Scottish Labour Party, to put it back on the front foot".
On her approach to creating a "new generation" of MSPs, she said: "It is not about age, it is about outlook - so yes, I want to bring new people into the Labour Party.
"I am asking people who share our values to come and shape our future, to join our party and think about standing next year.
"It is a recognition that we have to renew our party, we have to make sure that it meets the hopes and aspirations the people of Scotland have for us.
"We have disappointed them in the past, many of them are angry with us - I get that, and I want to turn it around, and that involves some new faces."
Ms Dugdale explained that candidate selection would be a "democratic process" and she would "trust" the membership to make the right decisions.
The UK Labour Party is in the process of electing a new leader after Ed Miliband stepped down following a general election result in which it lost to the Conservatives.
Ms Dugdale has not publicly declared who she will be voting for, but she said all four candidates would make good leaders and she would be happy to work with any one of them.
She said she trusted the choice the Labour membership would make ahead of that result on 12 September.
Ms Dugdale was also interviewed on  BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour in which she talked about the need to have a 50/50 gender balance inside the Scottish Parliament.
She said: "I co-founded a campaign called women 50/50 with Alison Johnson, a Green MSP, a Yes voting MSP, to campaign for a 50/50 parliament - a legal requirement that the Scottish Parliament must be 50% women and 50% men.
"That is one example of where my feminist principles will drive me in and force me to ensure that the politics we have in Scotland reflects the diversity we have in society."
In addition, Ms Dugdale spoke about her SNP-supporting father, Jeff Dugdale.
She told the programme: "He has not always been in the SNP, he actually used to be a Tory - he was a Tory for the best part of his life. He moved to the SNP, he was one of those people who joined the SNP having voted 'yes' in the referendum and he held on to that deep rooted belief in independence."
Ms Dugdale laughed and said: "He is wrong on many things, you would expect me to say that. But it is good, every family has got a diverse mix of opinion in it and that is what makes a dinner table conversation so interesting, don't you think?"
