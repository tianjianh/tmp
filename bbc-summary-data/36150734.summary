A new Birmingham marathon has been announced more than 30 years after the city held its last 26.2 mile run.

The Birmingham International Marathon and half marathon will be held in October 2017, organisers said.
It is expected to follow in the footsteps the People's Marathon, which ran between 1980 and 1985.
The race has been created by the Great Run company behind the Great Birmingham 10K and the Great Birmingham Run in partnership with the city council.
A provisional route starting at the Alexander Stadium and finishing on Broad Street has been proposed.
There will be themed miles along the course to celebrate the city's cultural diversity, organisers said.
Birmingham was hailed as the birthplace of the open-to-all marathon when elite runner John Walker launched the People's Marathon on 11 May 1980.
Athletics Weekly wrote at the time: "In years to come, when marathon fields several thousand strong will be commonplace in Britain, it will be seen that the event which triggered off the mass long-distance running movement in this country was the inaugural People's Marathon."
Mark Hollinshead, chief executive of the Great Run Company, said he hoped the new marathon would become the trials for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.
"Not only will this be a great event for British elite runners, we will also aim to attract runners of all abilities from the UK and beyond, to run for charity, for the challenge or just for fun," he said.
Steve Hollingworth, Birmingham City Council's assistant director for sport, events and parks said: "It will encourage more residents to become physically active and have access to a full complement of running events in the city."
