Mrs May will replace David Cameron as both PM and Tory leader after he takes part in his final PMQs on Wednesday.
Ms Sturgeon congratulated the 59-year-old and wished her well "in a difficult and demanding job".
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson also congratulated Mrs May on her new role.
She said she would give her "full support" at a time when the country "needed certainty".
Mrs May will take over from Mr Cameron who tendered his resignation in the wake of the EU referendum result.
The UK electorate voted by 52% to 48% to end the country's membership of the EU.
In Scotland, voters decided by 62% to 38% to remain in Europe.
After Mrs May was confirmed as the next PM, Ms Sturgeon said: "I congratulate Theresa May on her success, and wish her well in what will be a difficult and demanding job.
"I am determined to work with her constructively wherever possible on issues of common interest and concern.
"Top of those is the issue of our continued place in the European Union, and I expect early engagement with the incoming prime minister on that subject as we look to maintain Scotland's EU status, in line with the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland."
Ms Sturgeon added: "As part of her pitch to her Conservative colleagues earlier today, Ms May made clear that she would be pressing ahead with plans to leave the EU - as such, it is vital that Scotland is involved and consulted at every step of the way.
"But that involvement does not mean we accept that Scotland should leave the EU. On the contrary.
"I have made clear that I intend to pursue every possible avenue to secure Scotland's continued place in Europe and in the world's biggest single market, and that all options must be on the table in order to achieve that. That is something I reiterate today to the incoming prime minister."
MSP Ms Davidson, who had backed Mrs May to become Tory leader, said the country needed "certainty and stability going forward".
She added: "In Mrs May we will have a prime minister who has the experience, the judgement and the leadership to start that job from day one."
"The dignified manner of Andrea Leadsom's withdrawal today allows for that transition to be as swift and smooth as possible."
Scottish Labour also offered its congratulations to Mrs May.
However, MSP Jackie Baillie said the new PM needed to show "with her actions" that this government would deliver for working people across Scotland.
