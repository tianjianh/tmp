They will discuss the latest findings in treatment, outcomes and prevention of the disease.
It is the first time that Northern Ireland has hosted the international conference.
Dr Anna Gavin of the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, said the number of people diagnosed with the disease in NI was likely to increase.
"We have an aging population," she said.
"Some of the work that is going to be presented at the conference indicates that in the next 20 years, we are going to see two thirds  of an increase in the number of cancer patients that are diagnosed in Northern Ireland and across the UK.
"So that means we have to be smarter with the resources that we have."
About 11,000 people in Northern Ireland are currently living with cancer.
The conference, organised by Queen's University, will be attended by patients, charities and chief medical officers from the UK and Ireland.
Up to 500 people are taking part in the Belfast event at the Europa Hotel.
The Northern Ireland Cancer Registry is funded by the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and hosted by Queens University Belfast.
