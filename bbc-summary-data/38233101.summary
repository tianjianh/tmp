Four ships have been deployed by the Indian navy to rescue the stranded tourists and bring them from Havelock island to the main city of Port Blair.
Every year thousands of tourists visit the coral reef-fringed Andaman islands.
The archipelago of hundreds of islands sits at least 1,000 km (600 miles) from the mainland, and is closer to the coast of Myanmar.
Reports said some 800 tourists were stranded on Havelock island and a spokesperson of the Indian navy tweeted that four of its ships had sailed from Port Blair and were "in the area".
A choppy sea was making rescue operations difficult, reports said.
The meteorological department has predicted that the islands would receive heavy rains over the next 48 hours, which could turn into a cyclonic storm.
