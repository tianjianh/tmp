NI terrorism: Police conduct new search in Larne

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are searching an area in Larne in connection with Northern Ireland-related terrorism investigation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last week, a serving Royal Marine, Ciar√°n Maxwell, was arrested in Somerset as part of the investigation after searches in Larne and Devon.
The 30-year-old marine is still being questioned.
The arrest is understood to be connected to the discovery of two arms dumps near the County Antrim town earlier this year.
These finds were thought to be linked to dissident republican paramilitaries.
