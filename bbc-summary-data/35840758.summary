Joe Schmidt: Ireland coach to decide on his future after tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joe Schmidt says he will decide whether he will coach Ireland to the 2019 Rugby World Cup after this summer's tour to South Africa.

Schmidt's current contract as the Irish head coach runs until summer 2017.
Ireland will be keen to retain the 50-year-old who has led them to two Six Nations victories in three years.
"It is something I have committed to making a decision on once we get back from Africa," said Schmidt, when asked about his future.
"It's really important there is a clear pathway for players and to know there is some continuity there, or if that continuity is going to be with someone else.
"I am conscious of my responsibility there."
If he decides to leave the Ireland post, former Leinster boss Schmidt could seek a Super Rugby coaching role in his native New Zealand and start a quest to coach the All Blacks.
Schmidt explained the decision on his long-term coaching future was down to far more than simply the enjoyment factor he gets from leading Ireland.
His son Luke suffers from epilepsy and Schmidt suggested his next move will have as much to do with what best suits his family as anything else.
"There are some factors outside of rugby that tend to dictate for me," said Schmidt. "We will be a little bit further down the track with some of those decisions as well."
Schmidt was appointed Ireland coach in April 2013, taking over from Declan Kidney.
Ireland can salvage a third-place finish from their lacklustre Six Nations with victory over Scotland in Dublin on Saturday.
Schmidt's men drew with Wales and lost in France and England before thumping Italy 58-15 last weekend.
