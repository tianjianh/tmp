Phil Burleigh's late try gave Edinburgh back-to-back wins and clinched the 1872 Cup, but Townsend could only praise the effort his players put in.
"The effort both teams put in showed how much this meant to them," he said.
"I have to praise the players' efforts to get back from three points behind to get the win, but it wasn't meant to be today."
With seven minutes left, Alan Solomons' team trailed to a Mark Bennett try and six points from Duncan Weir to three penalties for Sam Hidalgo-Clyne.
Burleigh's score put Edinburgh 14-11 in front and Glasgow piled on pressure in the game's dying embers but could not break the home defence.
Edinburgh go fourth, while Pro12 holders Glasgow remain eighth.
"Fair play to Edinburgh, that's two weeks now they've taken their opportunities. It's a sign of a confident team," Townsend told BBC Scotland.
"We look at that second half and we didn't kick on from what we did in the first half."
Edinburgh had won the first leg 23-11 on Sunday, but Townsend was happy with the response of his side and called for more of the same ahead of the European Champions Cup game with Racing '92.
"We've got a hard working group that will work hard to get better," he said.
"We'll have to take on the lessons we learned this week because next week's going to be even tougher."
