The 27-year-old joined the Saints in summer 2014 from FC Twente and has since scored 13 goals for them.
"The club showed a lot of effort to keep me," he said. "There were also other possibilities.
"But, we recognised that the best is that I stay in Southampton, and I want to mention they put in a lot of effort for that, and I appreciate that."
Southampton host Watford in their opening game of the Premier League season on Saturday at 15:00 BST.
