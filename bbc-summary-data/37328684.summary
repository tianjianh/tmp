English Football League: A song of pastry delight is among five things you may have missed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Make a good impression, go the extra mile, work for your supper, ignore your boss and try to smile - all fairly normal points to follow at work.

It also sums up a few of the stories on a busy day of English Football League action.
Here are five things you may have missed, with the added treat of a little something to look forward to on Sunday as well.
Clayton Donaldson refused to let a first-half penalty miss, firm instructions not to take another spot-kick and hollers from the sideline distract him from becoming Birmingham City's match-winner against Fulham.
The 32-year-old had a 26th-minute spot-kick saved by Cottagers goalkeeper David Button and the clear message from Blues manager Garry Rowett at half-time was for the striker, who had already missed another penalty this season, to stand aside next time one needed taking.
It took all of four minutes to show he was not listening to his boss, however, as he won a debate with team-mate Jacques Maghoma to take the next penalty - and score Birmingham's winner at Craven Cottage after Che Adams was brought down by Floyd Ayite.
Rowett said the Blues management "were shouting" at him not to do it, but quickly praised Donaldson for his stubborn self belief.
"We told Mags to take it at half-time," Rowett told BBC WM. "It shows a lot of character from Clayton to take it.
"But I have to say that I think if he had missed it he would have needed that character to walk back into the dressing room."
Start in a World Cup qualifier on Tuesday, fly back from the Middle East during the week, regain your starting spot in the Championship and score your first goal for the club on Saturday.
It's fair to say Huddersfield Town's Australia international midfielder Aaron Mooy has had a busy few days.
Following his efforts in helping the Socceroos to a 1-0 victory over the United Arad Emirates, the Manchester City loanee made the 3,521-mile trip back from Abu Dhabi to jump straight back into the action for the Terriers to score a fine 25-yard winner for the Championship leaders in their West Yorkshire derby against Leeds United.
But this tale is not just one of a intrepid traveller.
The goal was Huddersfield's ninth in the Championship - and Mooy the ninth different goalscorer for the Terriers in the league this season.
And that is not the whole story, as Leeds United manager Garry Monk felt Mooy should have been sent off for what he called a "horrendous" challenge on Liam Bridcutt.
Football chants. Some go viral, some are tasteless and some are just plain delicious.
Jon 'Beast' Parkin has graced some impressive stages in his career, playing as high as Championship level, and he is still well capable of a bit of goalscoring magic in the bottom tier of the EFL.
The big forward could probably do a job for the Pro-12 rugby union side Newport Gwent Dragons, who share Rodney Parade with County, but his two goals were enough to earn Newport a draw against Cheltenham.
And he was recognised for his efforts by the County faithful in song, with the added bonus of having a pastie promised to him for a third. While the 34-year-old, who is with his 14th club, failed to bag a hat-trick, no-one could say he did not deserve to tuck into a tasty pastry after ensuring the hosts earned a point.
Striker Adam Armstrong is man who knows how to make a memorable first impression.
He made his debut on loan from Newcastle United for League One side Coventry City last season, scoring a brace to mark the occasion.
Eleven months on and, on his debut on loan for Barnsley in the Championship, he managed to produce another memorable moment with a fine winner against Preston, backheeling his way around a defender and curling past the goalkeeper.
Do yourself a favour, find the footage and let a little magic into your life.
The year was 1995, Michael and Janet Jackson collaborated on their hit Scream and Blackburn Rovers were flying the English flag in the Champions League as Premier League title holders.
It is not exactly a Champagne moment when almost 21 years to the day since the Lancashire club played their first group game in the competition, they sit bottom of the Championship with two points from six games.
While England international Alan Shearer was banging in the goals for Rovers more than two decades ago, Blackburn needed on-loan Southampton striker Sam Gallagher to pop up with a header to salvage a draw against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Saturday.
If today's Blackburn flashback has got you in a nostalgic mood, Sunday will be a real treat as Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest write a rather unwanted chapter in European football.
For the first time in any domestic league, two former European Cup winners meet in the second tier.
You have to rewind more than three decades, to a time that predates the Champions League as we know it, when Forest and Villa reigned supreme on the continent.
While the pictures above of Reds captain John McGovern lifting the European Cup in Munich in 1979, Peter Shilton with Forest hands still on the trophy 12 months later and Dennis Mortimer claiming the silverware for Villa in 1982 are snapshots to a glorious past, you can join us on the BBC Sport website on Sunday to follow live text commentary from Villa Park. Kick off is 13:15 BST.
