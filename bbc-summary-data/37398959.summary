Leroy Houston said he felt like he "had never left" Bath after making a try-scoring return for the club.

The forward rejoined the Premiership side on a short-term deal this week and helped the Blue, Black and Whites beat Worcester 37-22 on Saturday.
"The support here is unbelievable. I'm still on a high because the fans show me so much love," the 29-year-old Australian said.
"I was just happy to be back with the boys. I didn't expect to score a try."
Houston left Bath this summer to rejoin Australian Super Rugby side Queensland Reds in a bid to further his international ambitions.
However, the back-rower returned to The Rec on a contract until the end of October while Taulupe Faletau recovers from injury.
"I'm here for six weeks, then I'm back to Australia with the Reds," uncapped Houston added.
"I'm hoping to get back into contention for the Wallaby autumn tour coming up."
Australia, who suffered a 3-0 Test series whitewash at home against England in the summer, beat Argentina 36-20 to move up to second in the Rugby Championship on Saturday.
However, New Zealand - who beat the Wallabies home and away last month - have sealed the title with two matches to spare after beating South Africa 41-13 in Christchurch.
Asked if he thought Australia coach Michael Cheika was keeping an eye on him, Houston said: "I'm not too sure. He's got heaps to concentrate on at the moment.
"If he's not, I'm not sad about it. But fingers crossed, he is."
