The hosts dominated for much of the game, with Emile Sinclair seeing a shot rebound off both posts for the Lions in the first half.
Elliott Frear had a shot well saved by Dan Atkinson for Rovers, while Sinclair again hit the woodwork after the break.
But Brett Williams secured victory when he fired the ball in off the bar from Keanu Marsh-Brown's pull-back.
The result leaves Forest Green second in the table, two points off leaders Cheltenham.
Forest Green assistant manager Jamie Day told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"We rode our luck a little bit at times and Steve Arnold pulled off a couple of good saves and bodies were thrown on the line and we managed to snatch it at the end.
"All round there was some good performances - David Pipe did well in front of the back four and all the back four put in a shift.
"I can't praise the boys highly enough, they got the three points which we needed."
