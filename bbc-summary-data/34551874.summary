A "wanted" poster has been issued by a council trying to trace the culprit who dumped children's toys in a ditch in Cambridgeshire.

The toys, which include a skateboard, bike and buggy, were left in Downham Road in Ely.
The poster by East Cambridgeshire District Council stresses it wants to "keep our district clean".
It says: "Wanted: the person who fly-tipped this waste." Fly-tippers can be fined up to £50,000.
The council's website says: "Fly-tipping is not only unsightly, inconsiderate, dangerous and expensive to clean up, it is also illegal".
It adds that offenders can be fined as much as £50,000 or receive a six-month prison sentence.
A spokesperson for East Cambridgeshire District Council said: "An issue we often have as a local authority is gathering the evidence against those small minority of people who fly-tip.
"This is why our enforcement officer recently started putting up posters at locations near to where things have been dumped to help get information."
