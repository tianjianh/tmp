Explosive moments in the BHS saga

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Death threats, insults and apologies all featured in the most explosive session yet in the continuing investigation into the demise of BHS.

BHS chief executive Darren Topp and his financial lieutenant Michael Hitchcock were clear where they thought the blame lay. Dominic Chappell, said Hitchcock, was a "premier league liar" and "Sunday pub-league retailer" who had his "fingers in the till".
When Darren Topp objected to a Â£1.5 million transfer to a company owned by a friend and fellow board member of Dominic Chappell, Topp told MPs that Mr Chappell threatened to kill him. Mr Topp said he believed that Mr Chappell owned a gun - something Mr Chappell has since denied. Extraordinary.
Pantomime aside - Mr Topp and Mr Hitchcock were clear in the belief that BHS could have been saved if promises made by Chappell to provide funding for the business had been kept.
Dominic Chappell hit back saying the BHS management failed to hit trading targets and then trained his fire on Sir Philip Green, from whom he bought the business for Â£1. Although he sold it, Sir Philip remained involved thanks to a loan outstanding to the company which according to Mr Chappell "he used to beat us with" and ultimately used to trigger administration.
Sir Philip failed to secure trade credit to give comfort to suppliers, was unwilling to help solve the pensions deficit and also scuppered a last minute sale to Sports Direct owner, Mike Ashley.
Sir Philip will have his say next week, but the BBC understands he will reject the notion he aided and abetted in the death of BHS and it is hard to see what he would have to gain financially or reputationally by its collapse. About 11,000 jobs and thousands of short-changed pensioners are paying the price for this epic failure.
What we have learnt for sure is that Retail Acquisitions Limited, the company set up to buy BHS from Sir Philip, was not a normal company.
Some directors resigned the minute the deal was done as they felt uncomfortable that the board was becoming stuffed with friends of Dominic Chappell. This is a board remember that voted in favour of using company money to refinance the mortgage of Mr Chappell's father.
The stage is now set for Sir Philip Green to take the hot seat next Wednesday. He calls the shots at BHS's former parent company Arcadia and its ultimate owner Taveta Investments, which in turn is owned by his wife Lady Tina Green. That set up is not exactly normal either.
