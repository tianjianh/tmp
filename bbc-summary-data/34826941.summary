The Frenchman finished with a 26-second advantage over Northern Ireland's Kris Meeke, who was second.
Volkswagen Motorsport's Ogier, 31, secured his third successive title in September in a dominant season with co-driver Julien Ingrassia.
Wales' Elfyn Evans finished sixth in the race and seventh in the championship.
Finland's Jari-Matti Latvala finished second in the drivers' standings ahead of Andreas Mikkelsen of Norway, who was third in Wales
Meeke and co-driver Paul Nagle were fifth overall in the driver's Championship with his Citroen team runners-up in the manufacturers' championship behind Volkswagen.
Ogier's victory on a storm-lashed weekend in Wales was his eighth win of the season but his thoughts were with those affected by Friday's deadly attacks in Paris.
"We're happy to finish the season like that from a sporting view, but my mind wasn't really there this weekend," Ogier said.
"It was hard to carry on after the tragedy in France and our thoughts were with the people.
"We wanted this victory as our small sign for those who have been touched, and to show we must be even stronger against these things."
