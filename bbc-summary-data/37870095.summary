A woman who works with survival expert Bear Grylls has broken the record for running the Wales Coastal Path.

Sarah Thomson from Newquay, Cornwall, covered the 870-mile route in 23 days - smashing the record of 40 days.
She set off from Chester in October and was due to finish on Friday, but after passing Cardiff kept running towards her final destination of Chepstow and arrived there on Thursday.
Ms Thomson said she had "surprisingly few low points".
"A few families have taken me in and cooked for me along the way, and passers-by have offered high fives, jelly beans and cheers - a couple of youth hostels have let me stay for free too," the ultra marathon runner said.
"Physically it has been really tough. My feet are literally numb stumps at the end of my legs now."
