Halep, the world number four, has already said she will play in the tie.
Romania have four other players in the top 100.
GB captain Anne Keothavong's team kept their promotion hopes alive last month with a 2-1 win over Croatia. and while she will hope to call on Johanna Konta, the world number 11 is not at her best on clay.
British number two Heather Watson is currently ranked 108 but has a strong Fed Cup record with 25 wins and only seven losses.
It is the third time Britain have reached the World Group II play-offs in the past six years, with the team then captained by Judy Murray losing to Sweden and Argentina in 2012 and 2013 respectively.
