Nurseries and childminders to face tougher inspections

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nurseries and childminders in England will face tougher inspections under proposals announced by Ofsted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Under the plans, childcare providers currently classed as "satisfactory" will be dubbed "requiring improvement" and undergo extra inspections.
The move follows concerns that nurseries are not improving fast enough, particularly in deprived areas.
The Pre-School Learning Alliance warned that real improvements would require better funding for childcare.
Chief inspector of education Sir Michael Wilshaw announced a consultation on the proposals in a speech to an invited audience in London.
Similar changes were made to school inspection ratings last year.
Ofsted says that evidence from inspections shows that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are not improving fast enough between inspections, particularly in poorer areas.
The latest Ofsted figures show that in 2012 the majority of England's nurseries and childminders were judged "good" (62%) or "outstanding" (12%) by inspectors - but 25% were judged "satisfactory", with 1% classed as "inadequate".
Under the proposed changes from September, only "good" or better will be deemed acceptable by Ofsted.
The watchdog says the proposals "will raise expectations and tackle weaker settings".
Nurseries and pre-schools "requiring improvement" will undergo more frequent inspections and will have a maximum of four years to achieve a "good" rating.
Those that fail to do this are likely then to be judged "inadequate" and may face closure.
"We all know from the research that children's early years are a period of rapid development and vital for building a secure foundation for future personal and academic success," Sir Michael said.
"Parents, whatever their circumstances, want their children to access good-quality childcare and get a good early education that sets them up well for statutory schooling.
"Yet too many providers are not good enough, particularly in the most deprived areas. We must be tougher on weak settings."
Sir Michael added that Ofsted would encourage good or outstanding childcare providers to support weaker ones.
Ofsted's most recent report on early years providers said that, despite an overall improvement, many children were not well prepared for school, particularly in poor areas.
The report, analysing inspection reports from 2011-12, said: "It is a concern that 34% of children are not working securely in communication, language and literacy by the end of the early years foundation stage.
"It is also worse in deprived areas, where 41% of children are not working securely in communication, language and literacy," it adds.
Sir Michael said that inspections would also include a focus on qualifications held by early years staff. Earlier this year the ministers announced plans to allow nurseries and childminders to look after more children, but only if there is a qualified graduate present.
Ministers also said it was not acceptable that childcare professionals are not required to have at least GCSE grade C in English and maths.
Commenting on Ofsted's announcement, education and childcare minister Elizabeth Truss said: "I want to see more teacher-led nursery classes where children are learning so that they arrive at school ready to progress."
Prof Andy Goodwyn, of the University of Reading's Institute of Education, warned: "What the sector needs is not tougher inspection but better investment and a period of stability to allow its staff to build up their skills.
"It needs to become an attractive and high-status sector that can attract graduates who can see a real career path and a sustainable future.  The very last thing it needs is more threats, disguised as yet another crusade to 'raise standards'."
Groups representing childcare providers broadly welcomed the focus on improvement with some reservations. Neil Leitch, of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: "While we welcome the aspiration of high-quality childcare, without a rethink on policy and adequate funding from government, we struggle to see how a real improvement will be made."
Purnima Tanuku, of the National Day Nurseries Association, urged the government "to make sure that there are sufficient support mechanisms in place to help weaker settings get better".
She warned that local authority cuts had reduced the amount of local improvement work and free training for staff.
Anand Shukla, of the Daycare Trust, added: "We are particularly concerned by the suggestion that Ofsted will be the sole arbiter of quality in the early years. Ofsted is ultimately a regulator with a limited remit and is not resourced to enable it to influence providers in all parts of England.
"Local authorities tend to have local intelligence and are closest to providers."
Catherine Farrell, of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, said: "These new grades can only be introduced if Ofsted's own inspection judgements are more robust and if government recognises that providers will still need support and advice on how to improve."
