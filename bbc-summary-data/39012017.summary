[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 0-0 Yeovil Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County maintained their unbeaten home record under new boss Kevin Nolan with a goalless draw against fellow strugglers Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a game of very few chances, Jorge Grant had a shot saved in the first minute when he latched on to a clever pass by Mark Yeates.
Playing a 3-5-2 system, Yeovil showed very little ambition going forward and it was a question of whether County could find that moment of quality.
But for all of their possession, Artur Krysiak remained untroubled as Jorge Grant flicked a corner over the bar from close range.
Notts continued to ask questions of the visitors' defence early in the second half, with on-loan Nottingham Forest midfielder Grant looking their best hope of a goal.
He saw a shot deflected into the side netting, before Yeates tried his luck with a close-range shot which was beaten away by Krysiak.
Adam Collin was a virtual bystander in Notts' goal and Yeovil's lack of drive prompted their fans to chant 'attack'.
They nearly scored late on when Alex Lawless had a shot brilliantly tipped away by Collin as both sides were forced to settle for a point in a drab encounter.
