Disorder broke out before the match against Vitesse Arnhem in the Europa League fixture in August.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said riot police quelled the violence, which lasted about 10 minutes.
Six men, all from Southampton, were handed Football Banning Orders at the city's magistrates' court.
The CPS applied for four-year orders for Richard Bridle, 28, of Brookwood Road and Jack Jameson, 21, of English Road.
Outer Circle resident James Whitlock, 23, Samuel Coleman, 23, of Effingham Gardens, Thomas Kitcher, 22, of Penny House, and 20-year-old Burke Drive resident Luke Fairhurst,  were banned for three years.
A CPS spokesman said: "Prior to the match there was a large gathering of followers of both teams in the Korenmarkt area of Arnhem. The atmosphere had initially between good-natured between the two sets of opposing supporters.
"However, a large group of Vitesse Arnhem supporters then entered the square and fighting broke out between them and Southampton's supporters.
"When the police moved in to prevent the disorder, the violence continued, with chairs from nearby bars thrown at police officers and opposing followers.
"The violence involved hundreds of individuals and lasted for a period of approximately 10 minutes and it was not until riot police and officers on horseback moved in that order were restored."
Southampton won the game 2-0 but were knocked out in the next round by Danish side FC Midtjylland, who were in turn eliminated by Manchester United this week.
