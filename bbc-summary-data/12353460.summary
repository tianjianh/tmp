[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Independent Complaints Commission (IPCC) has decided not to investigate the circumstances around the death of a Suffolk woman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alison Studd, 36, of Pauline Street, Ipswich, was found critically injured in Withipoll Street, Ipswich, on 26 January and died the next day.
Suffolk Police had contact with Miss Studd in the days before her death.
The IPCC has informed the force that the investigation should remain a local police matter.
John Grimwood, 28, of no fixed address, has been charged with Miss Studd's murder and will appear at Ipswich Crown Court on 28 April.
A similar voluntary referral was also made to the IPCC in January in relation to the death of Martin Edwards who was found in his flat on Old Foundry Road on Christmas Day.
Police officers were called to Pipers Court in the day before Mr Edwards' death and the IPCC has confirmed a supervised investigation will take place into the case.
Patrick Heggarty, 51, of Limerick Close, Ipswich, Christopher Page, 37, and Timothy Bailey, 28, both of no fixed address, have been charged with Mr Edwards' murder.
