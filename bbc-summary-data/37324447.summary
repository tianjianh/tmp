South Africa's Caster Semenya won her first international 400m race at the Diamond League meeting in Brussels.

The 25-year-old, who won Olympic gold over 800m, beat a field featuring five Rio 2016 finalists, including bronze medallist Shericka Jackson.
Semenya set a personal best of 50.40 seconds to win in Belgium.
Adam Gemili also set a personal best - in the 200m - but fellow Briton Eilidh Doyle was fifth in the 400m hurdles and missed out on the Diamond League title.
Semenya won the 400m, 800m and 1500m on the same day at the South African trials in April, but chose to focus on the 800m in Rio.
She was subject to gender testing after winning world 800m gold in 2009 but was cleared to compete by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2010 after being sidelined for 11 months.
Gemili, 22, clocked 19.97 seconds to finish second behind Jamaican Julian Forte, who was given the same time - also a lifetime best.
"I'm happy with the result," said Gemili. "I managed to run a PB so that gives me confidence for next season."
Doyle held a six-point advantage going into the season-ending race but the Scot drifted back off the final bend as American Cassandra Tate won the race and the series.
"It was one race too many," said Doyle, 29.
"After a really consistent season, this one killed me. In the last 50 metres I had nothing left in the tank."
