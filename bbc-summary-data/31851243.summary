[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to shake up bin collection services in Sheffield to save £3.4m have been outlined by the council.

Among the proposals are plans to introduce shared bins, scrap extra Christmas collections and charge £20 for replacement black bins.
A public consultation on the issue will run until 1 April.
Sheffield City Council claimed the proposed changes were the result of government-imposed cuts which have meant it must save £63m by 2016.
Under plans to introduce shared bins it said: "Shared bins will be provided, rather than individual bins for every household, in areas where there is limited space at each property to store bins, and there is space in the local amenity to provide shared bins".
Councillor Julie Dore, the Labour leader of Sheffield City Council, said: "Part of our budget savings involve coming up with proposals for our waste service that increase efficiency where possible, while still providing a good service for everyone in the city.
"We welcome people's views and will act upon them so that we do what is best for Sheffield in terms of waste management and recycling."
