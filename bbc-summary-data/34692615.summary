It said the majority of the incidents on Saturday were located in the Southern Command Area (36%).
Most involved rubbish and bonfires. There were a number of calls about tyres that had been set alight.
Twenty-five of the incidents were bonfire-related with NIFRS crews only having to take action seven times.
