[SN]TITLE[SN]
DNA database for dog mess considered by Flintshire council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forensic science could be used to catch out dog owners who fail to clean up after their pets.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flintshire council has agreed to consider the merits of a DNA database for dog mess, which it hopes would make it much easier to track down and fine owners who do not dispose of waste.
Swabs from dogs' cheeks would be entered into a voluntary database.
Dog mess in public places would be matched to the database to identify the owner, who would be fined Â£75.
Councillor Arnold Woolley hopes to establish a cross-party group and carry out a feasibility study.
He wants dog owners to pay about Â£30 to join the database - with a more expensive annual licence fee for those who refuse.
