Members of the public have the chance to vote for their preferred World War One sculpture for a Lincolnshire park.

The winning sculpture, out of four designs, would be built and installed in Wyndham Park in Grantham.
A plaque, inscribed with the winner's name, will be displayed with the sculpture.
South Kesteven District Council and Wyndham Park Forum, which commissioned the competition, shortlisted the designs in April.
The four designs have been based around World War One and/or The Machine Gun Corps, which was based at nearby Belton House during the war.
John Knowles, chairman of the forum, said: "We encourage people to come and have a look at the designs in depth and choose which they feel they would like to see feature in the park.
"We feel it's right the public have the final say about which design they wish to see commemorate such an emotive part of the town's and Britain's history."
People will be able to vote when the four designs go on display at the Isaac Newton Centre, in Grantham, on 16 May and Wyndham Park on 17 May.
The memorial was commissioned after the announcement of initial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund in January.
