Paul Mapps, 26, of Trinant, Caerphilly, stabbed Ian Davies, 27, with a kitchen knife at a house party in January.
The court heard the men had been good friends but their relationship became "somewhat volatile" when Mr Davies starting dating Mapps' sister Dawn, 30.
Mapps was found guilty by a majority verdict at Cardiff Crown Court.
He attacked Mr Davies with a kitchen knife after he turned up at his sister's birthday party.
Mapps denied murder and said he stabbed his friend in self defence after he came at him with a vodka bottle.
But a jury found him guilty after a two-week trial.
Judge Neil Bidder QC jailed him for life and told him he must serve a minimum of 20 years in prison.
He said: "I am sure that I can reject any suggestion you were acting in self defence when you stabbed him.
"You plainly have difficulty in controlling your anger, despite undertaking a previous anger management course.
"There is only one sentence I can impose and that is life imprisonment. You will serve a minimum of 20 years in jail and will only be released  if you are deemed no longer a danger to the public.
"You may never be released."
After the hearing, Mr Davies' sister Carrie said the family felt justice had been served.
"Although the outcome doesn't ease our great sense of loss, we can now start to move forward with our lives, and focus our efforts on looking after and supporting Caine, Ian's six-year-old son."
