[SN]TITLE[SN]
Toddler 'breathalysed' by joking police in Cheshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An underage motorist who was stopped by police for her erratic driving was let off - even though she had consumed "a couple of bottles" and had no licence, insurance or MOT.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fortunately the "young offender" was a nosy toddler who had trundled up to officers in her pink plastic car to see what was going on.
The officers had been trying to seize a genuinely uninsured vehicle at the time in Runcorn, Cheshire.
Playing along, the officers pretended to take a breath test from the girl after asking her parents if she had been drinking that morning.
"She's had a couple of bottles," they quipped.
A Cheshire Police spokesman said: "Thankfully, the tot's reading was clear and she was free to go."
