York City have appointed former Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara as manager following the departure of Russ Wilcox.

The 42-year-old, who has also previously managed Partick Thistle, represented Scotland 33 times and played more than 250 games for Celtic.
McNamara will be assisted by former team-mate Simon Donnelly.
Wilcox, 51, left the Minstermen last week and Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Crawley means they have now gone 10 games in League Two without a win.
McNamara's first game in charge of the Bootham Crescent side will be Saturday's FA Cup first round tie against Accrington.
He told BBC Radio York: "I'm delighted to be here and glad to get everything done and dusted.
"The first priority is to win on Saturday and get through to the next round of the FA Cup but longer term it's about getting back to winning ways and kicking on up the league.
"Hopefully I can bring a winning mentality and a style of football that people look forward to seeing."
After a distinguished playing career, which included the 1998 World Cup in France and a Uefa Cup final appearance for Celtic in 2003, McNamara's first managerial stint came at Partick.
He left them in second place in the Scottish First Division table when he moved to Tannadice in January 2013.
Dundee United finished fourth and fifth in the Scottish Premiership under McNamara, but they made a poor start to this season and he was sacked in September.
