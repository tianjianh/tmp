[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bradshaw had a transfer request accepted by the Saddlers on Wednesday and has passed a medical at Oakwell.
The 23-year-old won his first Wales cap in a friendly against Ukraine in March, but did not make their Euro 2016 squad after suffering a calf injury.
"Tom will fit in well with our playing philosophy," Tykes boss Paul Heckingbottom told the club website.
He had one year left to run on his contract at Walsall, who he joined from Shrewsbury in June 2014.
He scored 20 goals for the Saddlers last season as they were beaten by Barnsley in the League One play-offs.
