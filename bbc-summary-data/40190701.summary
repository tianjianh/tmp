Henry VII statue to be delivered to hometown of Pembroke

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Pembrokeshire town steeped in history is preparing to unveil a new bronze statue which commemorates its most famous son.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Henry VII - or Henry Tudor - was born at Pembroke Castle in 1457, the son of Margaret Beaufort and Edmund Tudor.
He went on to become the only Welshman to sit on the English throne.
The 2.4m (8ft) high bronze statue will be delivered on Thursday and unveiled on the Mill Bridge in Pembroke during a ceremony on Saturday at 14:00 BST.
Local people have contributed Â£20,000 towards the cost of the statue, with Pembrokeshire council and Valero also contributing a total of Â£30,000.
It was modelled in clay by sculptor Harriet Addyman before being cast in bronze.
People in the town hope a Henry VII centre can eventually be established in Pembroke and money has been secured for a feasibility study.
Town councillor Linda Asman said she had been "inspired" to pursue the idea after visiting the Richard III Visitor Centre in Leicester.
She said people were "really interested" in the idea.
Backed by a small force of French soldiers, Henry Tudor landed at Mill Bay in Milford Haven in August 1485 and called on the Welsh to rally to his banner.
He went on to defeat Richard III at the battle of Bosworth Field and to bring a measure of peace and stability as king.
Some Welsh poets referred to him as Y Mab Darogan - the Son of Destiny - who would lead the Welsh from oppression.
His chief supporter in Wales was Rhys ap Thomas, whose homes included Carew Castle, near Pembroke.
