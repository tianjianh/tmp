Bristol volunteers to set up more refugee field kitchens on Greek Islands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group of food waste campaigners from Bristol who travelled to a Greek island to help feed refuges are looking to expand their operation.

Volunteers from the Skipchen organisation travelled to Lesbos in November to build a field kitchen.
Sam Joseph, co-founder of Skipchen, said other bodies had seen their work and want them to repeat the project on other islands.
The group had previously run a cafe in Bristol stocked with unwanted food.
Mr Joseph said they had always planned to return home once the Lesbos kitchen was up-and-running with local labour.
He said other agencies had seen their operation, next to the Lesbos migrant centre, and had asked if they would set up on other nearby islands where refugees are also landing.
Mr Joseph added many of those arriving were "heavily-traumatised" yet "full of hope" for their future.
"It's been a real learning curve working in these environments," he said.
"Sadly I don't think we're going to see these problems get better in the future... if anything they might get worse."
Earlier this week at least 34 people drowned off the coast of Turkey after their boats sank during an attempted crossing to Lesbos.
The narrow stretch of water is one of the key crossing points for the significant number of refugees and migrants from Syria and other countries trying to reach the EU.
