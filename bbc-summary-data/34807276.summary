A Borders councillor has said she believes Syrian refugees due to be resettled in the Galashiels area will be made to feel "very welcome".

The authority has agreed to start talks with the Home Office to take up to 10 families over the next four years.
Two families will initially be resettled in the Galashiels area with other places considered in future.
Councillor Frances Renton said she was confident local people would make the new arrivals feel welcome.
"Ideally I would like the Borders to do more but we are doing what is in line with other local authorities and what is in line with what is coming from the Scottish government," she said.
"Overall, the response has been very positive - I have had a number of phone calls and emails offering help."
She said there was opposition to the scheme but that had been the view of "very few" people.
"I think the Borders will do what the Borders do - and that is warm to these people and make them feel very welcome," she said.
Scotland is to take approximately 350 of the 1,000 Syrian refugees who are due to arrive in Britain before Christmas.
