The boy, named by the school as Toby, died in hospital after being struck by a car in Canford Heath on Wednesday.
Kate Carter, executive head teacher of Canford Heath Infant School, described Toby as "delightful and warm-natured".
A book of condolence has been opened at the school and the local authority is offering counselling for children and adults affected by the tragedy.
Ms Carter said: "We are truly devastated that one of our wonderful pupils, Toby, who was just seven, from Canford Heath Infant School, has tragically died following a road traffic accident...
"Toby, who was in our Panthers class in Year Two, was the most delightful, warm-natured and popular little boy who lit up our school. He will be a huge loss to all of us at Canford Heath Infants, especially to his friends and all the staff, who absolutely adored him."
Ms Carter said the local authority was offering "extra pastoral care and counselling support" for any child or adult who has been affected by this tragedy.
She added: "There will also be a book of condolence in the entrance to Canford Heath Infant School from Friday morning for anyone who wishes to sign it and leave their best wishes for Toby's family. Everyone in our trust, and I am sure across Canford Heath as a whole community, send their deepest and most heart-felt condolences and love to Toby's family at this most terrible of times."
Residents have called for urgent safety changes on Sherborn Crescent, where the crash happened.
A petition calling for traffic calming measures has gathered thousands of signatures.
A crowdfunding page set up by friends to pay for the boy's funeral has also raised more than Â£6,500.
Dorset Police said the car driver involved, a woman in her 50s, had been interviewed and there was no evidence that she had been speeding.
