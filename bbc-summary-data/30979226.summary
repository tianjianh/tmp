The award from animation company Aardman and festival organisers is to honour those who are "worthy heirs to the earliest silent film comedians".
The duo were presented with personalised versions of Aardman's Morph and Chas characters for their 25-year contribution to visual comedy.
Previous winners include Eric Sykes, Michael Palin and The Goodies.
Reeves and Mortimer have starred in several programmes together on TV, including Vic Reeves' Big Night Out, House of Fools and quiz show Shooting Stars.
At the presentation at Bristol Old Vic on Sunday, they shared clips and anecdotes about their work and video messages from artist Damien Hirst, Ulrika Jonsson and comedians Jo Brand, Jack Dee, Charlie Higson and Matt Lucas.
David Sproxton, co-owner of Aardman, said it was "important to keep alive an interest in visual humour".
He said: "It's one of the few ways in which we can unite people of all ages, backgrounds, nationalities, languages and cultures.
"So we are delighted to see this year's award going to Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, in recognition of the attention they have paid to using visual and physical gags throughout their careers."
Other winners of the same award include Barry Humphries and June Whitfield.
