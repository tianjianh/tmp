[SN]TITLE[SN]
One in 10 residents object to South Cave homes plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 600 people in an East Yorkshire village have objected to plans for 119 new homes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With a population of fewer than 5,000, nearly one in 10 people in South Cave expressed opposition to the plans by Gladman Developments.
The developer wants to build on land off Little Wold Lane.
South Cave Parish Council has also objected to the proposal, saying it would cause "landscape harm" in the picturesque village.
A local campaign group, Save Our Valley, is co-ordinating opposition to the development.
Villagers claim the new housing would run parallel to the Wolds Way, a national walking trail, "seriously impacting" on views across the valley.
Concerns have also been raised about increased flooding risk and congestion.
Gladman said the development would "provide a choice of housing to meet the needs of the area, whilst respecting and enhancing the site's environmental and cultural assets".
The development would include access roads and landscaping, together with a play area.
The standard consultation on the proposals finishes on 7 April.
