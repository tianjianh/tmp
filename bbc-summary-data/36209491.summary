Gareth Bale says he has "turned a corner" at Real Madrid after helping them reach a second Champions League final in three seasons.

Bale's deflected shot saw Real beat Manchester City 1-0 in Wednesday's second leg of their semi-final.
Having faced criticism last year, the Wales forward is now aiming to win a second Champions League title in three seasons with Real.
"I feel like I am maturing," Bale told BT Sport.
"My Spanish is getting better and I'm integrating more with the team.
"I feel like I have turned a corner in that sense and I'm enjoying my football here.
"The reason I came to Real Madrid was to win Champions Leagues. I've got one already and I have got another chance to win another."
Bale scored in Real's 2014 Champions League final win against Atletico Madrid to clinch the club's 10th European Cup.
The two arch rivals will now meet again in this season's final on 28 May.
Although Real's winner against Manchester City was deemed a Fernando own goal, Bale has enjoyed his most productive campaign for the Spanish giants.
The 26-year-old has scored 19 La Liga goals so far this term, including four in his last three league games.
Bale also hit the bar with a second-half header against City, leaving him without a Champions League goal since December 2014.
"It doesn't matter who scores or whether it's an own goal or not," he added.
"The main thing is we have a chance to win the Champions League again.
"I felt we were close to killing the game off but couldn't get clear cut chances."
