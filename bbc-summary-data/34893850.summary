Eddie Jones: England coach supports RFU overseas player rule

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New England head coach Eddie Jones says he will maintain the Rugby Football Union's policy of not picking players based overseas unless there are "exceptional circumstances".

England have not fielded the past two winners of the European Player of the Year award because they play in France.
Toulon's Steffon Armitage won the award in 2014, with Clermont Auvergne's Nick Abendanon doing likewise this year.
"I believe the current laws are the right regulation to have," said Jones.
"I had a good discussion with RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie on that area and I understand."
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek, Jones said he had been on "both sides of the fence" having twice worked for Premiership club Saracens.
He added: "I understand the relationship with the RFU. I understand, in terms of the RFU, what they want."
Jones was named as England's first foreign head coach on Friday and will start his role on 1 December.
The 55-year-old Australian has agreed a four-year deal to succeed Stuart Lancaster, who departed in the wake of England's early World Cup exit.
Jones reiterated he plans to speak to captain Chris Robshaw about his position.
"I'll sit down with Chris and have a chat with him," he said.
"I'll see where his head is at, see what he wants to do in the future, and talk about if he meets the right demands of what I want from the captain."
Asked about his reputation for being demanding and a disciplinarian, Jones said: "As you get older, you learn to understand people better.
"You understand what players need. Some players do need to be spoken to harshly whereas others need an arm around the shoulder. You learn to also understand that with your staff.
"Discipline is about understanding what you need to do to win. Every team that wins has discipline so if someone described me as that, I would take that as being fairly positive."
