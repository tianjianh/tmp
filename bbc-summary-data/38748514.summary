[SN]TITLE[SN]
Uist Wool to become a social enterprise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A community benefit society set up to revive the traditional wool industry in parts of the Western Isles is to become a trading social enterprise.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uist Wool operates a spinning mill and centre on the island of Grimsay between North Uist and Benbecula.
It was established in 2011 to provide training and employment.
The social enterprise structure will allow it to put profits it makes back into the organisation for pursuing other aims.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise is to provide a Â£90,000 grant to help Uist Wool make its transition.
The organisation spins a range of yarns for knitting and weaving using local fleece. It specialises in one of the oldest native Scottish sheep breeds, the Hebridean.
