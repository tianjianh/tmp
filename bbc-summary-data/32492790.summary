Natural Resources Wales's first staff survey also found one in five thought the organisation was well managed.
First Minister Carwyn Jones acknowledged NRW's "difficult birth" but said it had made "good progress".
NRW chief executive Emyr Roberts said he was proud of the staff after a period of unprecedented change.
He added that an action plan would be developed to improve where necessary.
Just over half of its 2,000 staff took part in the survey.
First Minister Jones was questioned how he read the results of the staff survey by Welsh Assembly Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies at First Minister's Questions on Tuesday.
He responded: "It was always going to be difficult to bring three quangos together and I pay tribute to those involved in doing that.
"Nevertheless it's important that businesses continue to have faith in Natural Resources Wales."
