It followed pre-planned raids on their addresses early on Tuesday, in the Sparkhill area of the city.
The suspects - three aged 19 and one aged 24 - are suspected of fundraising in the UK and travelling to train for terrorist purposes in Pakistan.
Eight others have already been charged in connection with the investigation, known as Operation Pitsford.
Seven of those are currently on remand after appearing in court.
Detectives have an initial 48 hours to question the four men arrested on Tuesday.
Officers must then either charge them, release them, or apply for a warrant to question them further.
West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said the arrests were not in response to any immediate threat to public safety.
Officers were unarmed during the operation, a police spokesman added.
