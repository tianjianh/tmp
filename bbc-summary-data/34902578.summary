[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Burglars used sledgehammers to smash their way into Drumragh Integrated College on Sunday night.
The principal, Nigel Frith, said money was taken and those responsible had cut telephone wires and broken alarms.
Mr Frith said the school would reopen on Tuesday.
He said the main damage had been caused to doors and furniture.
"They have taken surprisingly little," he said.
"The main problem for us is going to be getting the repairs to the building and getting everything up and running again.
"Our first concern this morning was children arriving at school.
"We had an operation that went quite well, to send children home immediately who were being dropped off by parents."
Mr Frith said the phone lines were not working when staff and pupils arrived at the school.
"We were relying on children to use their own mobile phones to contact their parents and liaise with us".
He said the school would be in contact with parents if it was not possible to open on Tuesday.
Police have appealed for information about the incident and said "considerable damage" had been caused to the premises.
