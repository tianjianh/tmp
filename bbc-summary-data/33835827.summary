A man caught wearing a hockey mask and carrying a two-foot long (61cm) sword in a shopping bag in a London street has been told he will be jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Abdullahi Hassan Abdullahi, 21, of Elthorne Road, Archway, admitted carrying an offensive weapon.
Highbury Magistrates' Court heard members of the public called police, who arrested him in Islington shortly after midnight on Thursday.
A district judge told him: "You can anticipate a sentence of imprisonment"
The court heard he was carrying the blade in a "bag for life" which he dumped - along with the mask - when he saw police.
Anthony McKen, defending, blamed his client's behaviour on peer pressure and fear of violence and Abdullahi said he was carrying the sword for self defence.
But District Judge Mary Connolly said: "If he is in fear of violence why is he out at night with a hockey mask and sword? You are at home behind closed doors.
"Peer pressure doesn't put you out on the street."
She added: "This is a really serious offence. You are found out at night wearing a hockey mask carrying a very large offensive weapon in dangerous circumstances because others were around.
"You can anticipate a sentence of imprisonment - that is what is going to happen to you. It is a question of length."
He was released on bail to appear at Blackfriars Crown Court for sentencing on 1 September.
