Acen King, three, died in Little Rock after a motorist opened fire on his grandmother's car, as he thought she was driving too slowly, US police say.
Gary Holmes was arrested on Thursday night and faces charges of terroristic acts and capital murder.
The 33-year-old surrendered after he was turned in by family members, officials told US media.
He pleaded not guilty on Friday, after refusing to appear before Little Rock District Court Judge Alice Lightle, according to local media reports.
He is being held without bond at the Pulaski County jail.
Authorities had offered a $40,000 (Â£32,600) reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.
According to an affidavit released on Friday, Mr Holmes had been travelling in a vehicle with his girlfriend and her one-year-old child.
Police say the road rage incident escalated after a man in a black Chevrolet Impala began sounding his car horn at Acen's grandmother, Kim King-Macon, because he felt she was not moving quickly enough through a stop sign, and she honked her horn in reply.
He opened fire, saying "that's what you get for following me around", according to police.
Ms King-Macon drove away before pulling in at a shopping centre car park to discover that her grandson had been shot.
Police released 911 recordings in which a woman can be heard screaming: "Acen has been shot! Oh my God!"
Acen died shortly afterwards in hospital.
