The American broke down in tears after confirming she had dislocated her right patella and ruptured her patellar tendon in Thursday's fall.
The injury will require surgery, which will sideline the 32-year-old for some time.
"I will get through this and I will get back out there," she said on Saturday.
Mattek-Sands said she will fly to New York on Sunday to seek further medical advice.
"I was coming to the net and all I remember is hearing this pop in my leg. Everything is kinda slow after that," she said.
"I remember my knee feeling tight and I took a look at it and something was wrong. I just for a second thought maybe I could adjust it, and I knew it was either dislocated or broken.
"It was one of the most painful injures I've had, and I've had a few."
Rafael Nadal partially tore his patellar tendon in 2013, with a doctor at the time saying tendon recovery takes "a long time".
In an emotional video message, Mattek-Sands thanked fans for their messages of support, and praised her opponent, Sorana Cirstea.
Romanian Cirstea comforted Mattek-Sands as she lay on the court, alongside her doubles partner Lucie Safarova and Mattek-Sand's husband, Justin.
"I'm a pretty positive person naturally but there's moments when it helps to hear so many positive things from fans," she said.
"I remember Sorana talking to me and telling me it's going to be OK and I think that's amazing.
"We're all competitors on tour and yet some of these girls are my friends and in that moment, she was there as my friend, no matter that we're in the middle of a match. It means a lot to me."
