Dai Young: Welsh sides want Wales and Wasps lock Bradley Davies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales lock Bradley Davies is a target for Welsh regions, according to his director of rugby at Wasps, Dai Young.

Former Cardiff Blues player Davies has been linked with a return to the Arms Park, but his former Blues boss Young says they have not made an approach.
Ex-Wales prop Young did, however, say Davies could return to the country of his birth on a national dual contract.
"We've certainly had interest from regions within Wales, who are really keen on taking Brad back," said Young.
"And I think the [Welsh Rugby] Union will be keen on a dual contract situation as well.
"He's away with the Six Nations now. When he comes back we will sit down and decide between us what is the right path.
"He's certainly got an avenue to go back and we've just got to make sure between us it's the right thing for the club and the right thing for Brad."
Davies has a year left on his current contract at Wasps, who he joined from the Blues in 2014.
If one of the Welsh regions were to sign him this summer, they would have to negotiate a transfer fee with the English Premiership side for his early release.
"Some of the regions in Wales have shown an interest in Brad with the view of him going back home," Young added.
"I've read articles that the Blues are interested but we certainly have had nothing from the Blues. But other regions have shown an interest.
"It's still early days in these discussions - he's still under contract with us here at Wasps.
"We would still like to keep him. Obviously there are other factors in this regard - family and so on and the best for Brad's rugby career."
