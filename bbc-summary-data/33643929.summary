[SN]TITLE[SN]
Croatia deducted Euro 2016 point for pitch swastika

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Croatia have been deducted a point from Euro 2016 qualifying Group H as punishment for a swastika painted on the pitch before a match against Italy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uefa also fined the Croatian Football Federation (CFF) 100,000 Euros (Â£70,000) and ordered their next two games to be played in an empty stadium.
Croatia are also barred from holding qualifiers in Split, which hosted the 1-1 draw with Italy on 12 June.
The CFF claim the incident was an act of "sabotage" and can appeal.
Croatia remain top of Group H, a point above Italy, even with the deduction.
The top two teams from each group automatically qualify for next summer's finals in France.
