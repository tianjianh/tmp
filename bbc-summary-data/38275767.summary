Residents in thousands of homes across Greater Manchester have been told to boil their water until further notice after a fault at a treatment works.

About 17,000 properties have been affected in Tameside, Saddleworth and Greenfield, United Utilities said.
The fault at Buckton Castle has now been fixed but some untreated water has entered the local pipe network.
The company said the advice will stand for at least another 48 hours but schools could open as normal on Monday.
Martin Padley, director of water and scientific services, said the warning was a "precaution".
Water should be boiled for drinking, food preparation and brushing of teeth.
Customers can continue to use tap water for general domestic purposes such as bathing and flushing toilets.
If the water looks dirty or cloudy, the company recommends waiting until the water has cleared before washing clothes.
A list of postcodes affected is on the United Utilities website.
