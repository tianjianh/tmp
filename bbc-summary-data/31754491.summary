The 35-year-old Bulgarian played for Villa from 2006 to 2012, when he was diagnosed with acute leukaemia.
Petrov is in remission but he was forced to retire in May 2013.

"I would never bring him in to be a mascot. He's got a very technical and gifted mind, I want him in here as quick as possible," said Sherwood.
"Stan will always have a place at this football club while I'm manager."
Petrov made 218 appearances in all competitions for Villa, who he joined in 2006 after seven years at Celtic, and earned 92 Bulgaria caps.
Earlier this season, he began playing for Wychall Wanderers over-35s in a West Midlands Sunday league.
Villa are 17th in the Premier League but managed their first win in 13 league games when defeating West Brom 2-1 on Tuesday.
The sides meet again at Villa Park on Saturday in an FA Cup quarter-final, which is live on BBC One, BBC Radio 5 live and the BBC Sport website (17:30 GMT).
