The Rome club will also have to close three sections of the Stadio Olimpico ground for their next two Serie A home games.
The match was stopped for three minutes in the second half after some fans aimed racist chants at Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly.
League leaders Napoli won 2-0.
Senegal international Koulibaly, 24, praised referee Massimiliano Irrati for stopping the match.
After the match, Lazio manager Stefano Pioli said: "I would not have stopped the match. It was chanting from the minority, but I don't think they were racist. We also have players of colour and they are treated well."
The club have frequently been punished in the past for similar offences.
A spokesman for Serie A's disciplinary office said the club's North End, Tevere North End and Monte Mario North End must be closed for two matches.
This includes a one-match sanction which had been suspended for a year after racist chants from some fans in their home match against Genoa on 10 February 2015.
