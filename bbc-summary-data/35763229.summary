Researchers say they have discovered a new frog species with distinctive yellow eyebrows in Colombia.

The frog has a dark camouflage pattern which allows it to blend in with the rocky soil on which it dwells.
Researchers with the Humboldt Institute found the frog, which they named Pristimantis macrummendozai, in the Iguaquen Merchan moorlands, in central Boyaca province.
Colombia is one of the world's most biologically diverse countries.
Researchers said that the species was well adapted to its moorland surroundings.
They said that female Pristimantis took advantage of the moist soil to lay their eggs in the ground.
According to their studies, the Pristimanti's preferred breeding environment was at high altitude, above 3,500m (11,500ft).
Environmentalists in Colombia have been fighting for the country's moorlands to be protected.
Last month, they celebrated when Colombia's constitutional court banned mining in the moorlands, arguing that it could cause irreversible damage to their fragile ecosystem.
