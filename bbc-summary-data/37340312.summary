Couple spend wedding night in custody

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple spent their wedding night in custody after starting a disturbance in an off-licence three hours after they were married, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graeme and Margaret Leslie admitted behaving in a threatening and abusive manner in Montrose High Street.
The wedding went ahead after bail conditions banning the pair from seeing each other were lifted a week earlier.
Forfar Sheriff Court was told the couple hosted a small reception in a pub following the wedding.
The court heard the couple stopped on the way home to pick up drinks from the Party Time off-licence in Montrose High Street.
Depute fiscal Jill Drummond said a row broke out after Mr Leslie selected two bottles of cider from the shop, prompting another customer to say: "That'll give you some hangover."
Leslie swore at the man and after being told that he would not be served, knocked over bottles of alcohol, causing them to smash on the floor.
Miss Drummond said Leslie was told to calm down and he went outside and was prevented from re-entering the shop.
Mrs Leslie then entered the shop and, referring to the smashed bottles, shouted at a shop assistant: "Graeme didn't do that, you've ruined my wedding day, I'm going to kill you."
The court heard that the newlywed couple shouted abuse at officers in Arbroath police station following their arrest.
Graeme Leslie, 61, and Margaret Leslie, 56, of St Cyrus, Montrose, admitted behaving in a threatening and abusive manner.
Nick Markowski, defending Mr Leslie, said: "He is still wearing his wedding attire today.
"He has spent his first three days married in cells of one variety or another."
Nick Whelan, for Mrs Leslie, said: "She didn't envisage spending her wedding night in a police station but that's exactly what happened."
Sheriff Gregor Murray deferred sentence until October for reports.
He remanded Graeme Leslie in custody and released Margaret Leslie on bail.
Sheriff Murray said: "Your role was lesser, Mrs Leslie, but one of your comments puts you in danger of a custodial sentence."
