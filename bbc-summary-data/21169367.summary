Mark Lawrenson's FA Cup predictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

His opponent for the FA Cup fourth round is Arsenal Ladies striker Kelly Smith, a three-time Women's FA Cup winner.
Success for the Gunners' men's team has been harder to come by in recent years but Smith, an Arsenal fan and season-ticket holder, thinks their trophy drought could soon be over.
She told BBC Sport: "The FA Cup is the main trophy we can contend for so I think all eyes and focus will be on that.
"Arsenal are trying to push for a Champions League spot, which will be difficult, but the FA Cup is the one trophy they will want to try and win.
"I know the fans are frustrated because we haven't won a trophy for eight years but I still think Arsene Wenger is the man for the job. He has money to spend now and hopefully he can strengthen the squad in this transfer window.
"Theo Walcott's new deal has provided a boost too and I don't see any reason why Arsenal cannot go all the way."
Smith is backing Arsenal to beat Brighton on Saturday but thinks Luton will spring a surprise against Norwich, while Lawro is tipping Millwall to pile on the pain for Aston Villa on Friday night and MK Dons to shock QPR.
* Away team to win at home in the replay
A correct result is worth ONE point, while a correct score earns THREE points.
Last week, Lawro took on actor and comedian Russell Brand.
Lawro got three results right, including one perfect score, and his score of five saw him beat Brand's tally of three (three correct results with no scores).
Both Lawro and MOTD commentator Guy Mowbray pick up an extra point this week after correctly predicting the result of Wednesday's rearranged game between Arsenal and West Ham, but his other Boxing Day opponent Marco Gabbiadini got the outcome wrong.
This season, we will also be keeping a record of the total scores for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all Lawro's predictions had come off (also at the bottom of the page).
