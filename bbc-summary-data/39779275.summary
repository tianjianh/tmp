Two lorries, two vans and a car crashed on the westbound carriageway of the M55 at junction 3, Kirkham, Lancashire, at about 08:45 BST, closing the motorway.
A 53-year-old man from Chorley was pronounced dead at the scene.
A 34-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving. Police are appealing for witnesses.
The eastbound carriageway has fully reopened, while all but one lane of the westbound carriageway remain closed between junctions one and three.
