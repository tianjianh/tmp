Sean Raggett had the chance to put the home side ahead in the first half but he volleyed over from close range.
The game failed to improve after the break and the most excitement came when referee Dean Treleaven limped off with an injury.
Lois Maynard had the best chance of the second half but his late effort was comfortable for Dover's Mitch Walker.
