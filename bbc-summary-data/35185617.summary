The line from Llandudno Junction, Conwy, and Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, was shut after water reached platform level at North Llanrwst station.
In Ceredigion, a tree has been removed from the line between Aberystwyth and Birmingham International after a reported landslip at Llanbadarn.
Network Rail said it was "pulling out the stops" to keep services running.
On Anglesey, speed restrictions remain in place around Gaerwen due to flooding. Network Rail said the situation would be monitored as more heavy rain is forecast for Wednesday.
Wales route managing director, Paul McMahon said: "We're working really hard to keep services running, but unfortunately the Conwy Valley line will be closed for several days with flood waters having reached platform level at North Llanwrst.
"Elsewhere in Wales the impact on services has been relatively limited so far. However, we are monitoring the situation very closely, and with more bad weather predicted it's really important passengers check before they travel, via the National Rail Enquiries website or by calling 03457 48 49 50."
Four flood warnings are in place for north and south west Wales, along with dozens of alerts.
