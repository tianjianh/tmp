The classic line-up of Guns N' Roses have announced their first concerts in the UK and Ireland since 1993.

The band kick off their 19-date European tour at Dublin's Slane Castle on 22 May, 2017; and visit the London Stadium on 16 June.
Other dates are scheduled in Paris, Stockholm and Madrid.
Eagle-eyed fans have spotted a gap in the band's schedule during the Glastonbury festival, suggesting they could be the Sunday night headliners.
Guitarist Slash previously played there as a solo artist in 2010.
The original members of Guns N' Roses reformed in January after years of acrimony.
Singer Axl Rose, guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan launched their comeback in April with two well-received performances in Las Vegas; followed by a headline set at the Coachella festival, where Rose had to sing from a "throne" after breaking his foot.
The band spent the rest of 2016 touring North and South America; while Rose also played several shows with AC/DC, whose singer Brian Johnson had to quit touring due to hearing difficulties.
By playing Slane Castle next year, the band will be revisiting one of the most tense shows of their two-year Use Your Illusion Tour.
Twenty-five years ago, Rose skipped a sound check at the venue, and arrived by helicopter long after he was due on stage. While they waited, the rest of the band were sent a crate of Irish whiskey and a barrel of Guinness by U2.
"Axl Rose nearly induced a nervous breakdown," wrote the castle's owner Lord Henry Mountcharles, years later. "However, it was a magic show. It kicked off the 90s."
Despite starting the show more than an hour late, Guns N' Roses appeared to enjoy the show, too.
"Playing in sunshine - it's a new concept," remarked Axl, who played impromptu covers of Black Sabbath's It's Alright and U2's One alongside hits like November Rain, Paradise City and Welcome To The Jungle.
Speaking on Monday, Lord Mountcharles said he was "thrilled" to be welcoming the band into his back garden after 25 years.
Tickets for Guns N' Roses European tour go on sale this week. Full information is available on the band's website.
