Cardiff City manager Russell Slade expressed frustration after his side failed to take their chances in the 0-0 draw against MK Dons.

Debutant Tom Lawrence, signed on loan from Leicester City on deadline day, squandered two chances as Cardiff drew a blank against the Championship strugglers.
"We had a couple of chances that came back off the post and some that went narrowly wide," Slade said.
"It was really frustrating."
Slade added: "We have lost goals from the team with players being out injured and leaving the club, so we are looking at the players coming in to get them for us.
"But their goalkeeper was outstanding today and you have to give a lot of credit to them."
Cardiff remain ninth in the Championship and five points behind sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday, who occupy the final play-off spot.
The Bluebirds were looking to secure a second successive win after winning at Huddersfield Town and a win over MK Dons would have taken them to within two points of the play-off spots.
Slade bemoaned Cardiff's inability to capitalise on results elsewhere going their way.
"We can only control what we do in the league, but we are even more frustrated when we look at the table and see we could have taken advantage," Slade added.
"As a group we were hoping to get back-to-back wins, but it wasn't to be.
"We know we still have a good chance of reaching the top six."
