The man was arrested after police surrounded the home in Birkenhead, Merseyside, for more than six hours.
He had locked himself in a room with the eight-month-old baby, who was safely rescued just before 14:30 GMT, police said.
The 25-year-old has been arrested on on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, affray and drug offences.
Specialist negotiators were sent to the house in Raffles Road to persuade him to come out.
Other weapons were also recovered from the scene, Merseyside Police said.
The force confirmed officers were initially sent to the house at 08:10 GMT as part of an investigation into cannabis cultivation.
The man then allegedly became "abusive" and barricaded himself in the room before the incident was brought to an end.
