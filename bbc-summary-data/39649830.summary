The pre-tournament favourite was beaten 10-8 in the first round, with his agent saying Trump was unable to talk to the media because he was feeling unwell.
His failure to appear is a breach of his contract with World Snooker.
The world number two, 27, faces a fine from the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).
World number 54 McLeod, who plays Scotland's Stephen Maguire in the second round, described his win as the "best of his career".
The 1000-1 outsider, 46, said: "To beat Judd Trump on centre stage is brilliant. I have always known I am capable of it; it is actually producing when you need to and I have done it."
McLeod said he was not interested in whether Trump was unwell or injured, with the world number two seemingly grimacing in pain with a shoulder or arm problem during the course of the match.
"He was 4-0 up and he didn't look that injured, so what can I do?" said McLeod.
"I had to deal with holding myself together. I am the oldest player left in the tournament. At 46 you have your aches and pains.
"Age is just a number; it's how you look after yourself and I think I am doing OK."
