[SN]TITLE[SN]
Health of Western Isles children's teeth improves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new report suggests that children in the Western Isles have some of the lowest levels of tooth decay in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The islands have been ranked second best in the country with 82.8% of primary seven-aged children having no signs of tooth decay.
Eight years ago half of the Western Isles' P7 pupils had teeth of a quality that fell below the Scottish average.
NHS Western Isles said the national Childsmile campaign has helped.
The NHS Scotland project was launched in the islands in 2008.
