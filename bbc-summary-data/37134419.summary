The pair, regarded by many as the greatest players of all time, have played out the last two Olympic finals, with Lin winning on both occasions.
But, amid huge interest in their home countries, Lee won 15-21 21-11 22-20 in a classic 79-minute encounter.
He could now become Malaysia's first Olympic gold medallist.
"This is my last Olympics and I have never won the gold medal so now it's just one more step," the Malaysian, 33, said.
"I think it's good for my retirement."
The pair have dominated men's badminton in recent years, with Lin leading the head-to-head record 25-11 before the match, including wins in two Olympic and two World Championship finals.
The match in Rio is likely to be their last in the Olympics, with Lin, 32, a year younger than his rival.
Lin said: "I feel relieved because today's match has ended.
"I think today's biggest result is that our audience - no matter if they are here live or watching on TV - can enjoy a really good match that has the best quality ever. I think that is one of the best points."
Lee will play Chen Long of China in Saturday's final at 13:20 BST.
