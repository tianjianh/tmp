Waltham St Lawrence gypsy camp win latest round in eviction battle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gypsies living on a site in Berkshire have won the latest round in a four-year battle to evict them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A High Court judge ruled Windsor & Maidenhead council had not sufficiently proven the travellers would be given a suitable alternative site nearby.
The ten families have set up home in Waltham St Lawrence, on greenbelt land they own but do not have planning permission to live on.
The Gypsy Council helping the families was not available for comment.
Two previous judicial reviews from the High Court were both found in favour of the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead.
But at an appeal hearing Mr Justice Mostyn granted permission for a judicial review over the council's decision to evict occupants from the site, based on a lack of "alternative pitches".
Councillor Michael John Saunders, cabinet member for planning and property, said the council was "of course disappointed".
The case will be considered at a substantive hearing on a date to be confirmed by the court.
Another appeal by the travellers for a judicial review over a council decision to decline a planning application made last year was not upheld.
