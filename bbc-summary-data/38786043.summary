Welsh Premier League Aberystwyth Town, Rhyl, Cardiff Met and Cefn Druids were all humbled by lower league opposition.
Prestatyn thrashed Aberystwyth Town 5-1, 10-man Caernarfon Town beat Rhyl 3-2, Guilsfield beat Cardiff Met 4-2 while Llanfair sunk Cefn Druids 4-1.
Meanwhile, reigning Welsh Cup holders The New Saints beat Llanelli 7-0.
Cymru Alliance leaders Prestatyn coasted through against Aberystwyth Town courtesy of an own goal from Sam Rodon, a first-half goal from Noah Edwards and a second-half hat-trick from James Stead. Luke Sherbon ensured the Welsh Premier League side got on the scoresheet, however.
Caernarfon Town, who are second in the Cymru Alliance, beat Rhyl in extra time despite having Nathan Craig sent off as Carl Owen struck in the 116th minute to see them through.
Jamie Davies scored a hat-trick for Llanfair United as they came from behind to comfortably beat Cefn Druids after Steve Blenkinsop put the Welsh Premier League side in front early on.
