Les Gibson, from County Durham, was flying Odin on the Glen Muick estate when they became separated last week.
He has been back to search for the bird of prey, but without success.
Mr Gibson said he has kept birds for many years, but this was the first one he had lost. He hopes the public can come to his aid.
Mr Gibson, of Consett, hopes Odin will be hunting and killing to survive.
He told BBC Scotland: "I had been flying him all week on the hills. He would normally go off for a good distance and come back, but he just kept going.
"I was able to track him for a while - he has transmitters on his tail - but it got dark.
"The weather was so bad the following morning we had to come off the hill."
Mr Gibson added of two-year-old Odin: "As long as he catches food he will be OK.
"If I can find him then hopefully I can get him back. If he has not had too much food he would come down to me, but if he's full of food he would not bother.
"He has leather straps hanging from his legs - you would not mistake him for a wild one.
"The (transmitter) batteries only last so long.
"It has always been a dream, he would have been my last bird and he would have seen me out."
