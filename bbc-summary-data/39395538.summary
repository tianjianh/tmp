Football League Division Three: Armagh face Tipperary battle for promotion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Armagh will battle with Tipperary for a Football League Division Three promotion spot next Sunday after the Premier County lost to Louth on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Louth beat last year's All-Ireland semi-finalists 0-16 to 0-12 in Thurles to go top on 10 points.
Following their 1-12 to 0-13 win over Antrim on Saturday, Armagh have nine points while Tipperary are on eight.
Ciaran McKeever hit Armagh's goal while Antrim had a CJ McGourty penalty saved as they stay in relegation trouble.
Antrim will go into the final weekend of round robin games third from bottom but almost certainly needing a home victory over Longford to survive.
McKeever netted as a close first half ended 1-3 to 0-6 before five points without reply saw Armagh surge clear.
Antrim closed the gap to three points when McGourty's penalty was superbly saved by Armagh keeper Blaine Hughes.
Saffrons pair Conor Murray and Stephen Beatty were red-carded late on along with Armagh's Stephen Sheridan.
McKeever's goal was the highlight of a low-key first half between the Ulster rivals, with the centre half-forward palming in to finish a fine Orchard move.
That gave Armagh a one-point lead after two CJ McGourty frees helped Antrim into an early advantage.
McKeever slotted over the final score of the half to level but Armagh were guilty of wayward finishing, registering 11 wides in the opening 35 minutes.
The side exchanged points on the restart and it was all-square before Armagh took charge.
Unanswered points from Charlie Vernon (2), Aidan Forker, Jamie Clarke and Anto Duffy gave the hosts a five-point cushion.
But Antrim showed resilience by hitting the next two points and then being awarded a penalty after a foul on Conor Murray.
McGourty stepped up and his strike was kept out by an excellent save from Hughes in a decisive moment in the game.
An unsavoury finale saw Murray, Sheridan and Beatty shown straight red cards for violent conduct in separate incidents while Armagh substitute Aidan Forker and Antrim's Conor Hamill were black-carded.
Armagh secured a hard-fought win and they are a point clear of Louth and Tipperary although having played an additional game.
Kieran McGeeney's team take on Tipperary in their final game as they chase promotion while Antrim are seventh to remain in relegation danger.
"We're delighted to get that victory and I'm happy to make any contribution," said Armagh defender Vernon, who scored two points.
"Antrim were very good tactically and they deserve credit - they caused us problems on the counter-attack.
"We now face a big game against Tipperary and it's a major challenge for us before the championship."
