British Cycling will be exonerated over allegations of wrongdoing, says its former technical director Shane Sutton.

The organisation is being investigated by UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) over claims regarding medication given to riders.
"The success is built off evidence-based programmes and the evidence will come out," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
Sutton left British Cycling in April amid allegations of sexism - though he denies the "specific claims" - and will attend a hearing this week.
"It's something I'm not at liberty to talk about but this is sport - you never say never," the 59-year-old Australian told Sportsweek when asked if he might return to his post.
"We'll have to wait and see. People have talked about it but nobody has asked me to go back. Let's just let time run its course."
After a week in which BBC Sport revealed that British Cycling chief executive Ian Drake is to leave, Sutton said he welcomed the chance for the sport to clear its name after a series of damaging stories.
In an interview last month with BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford denied that they "cross the line" in the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

That came after it was revealed Sir Bradley Wiggins sought therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) to take anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone for allergies and respiratory issues - something the cyclist said was to "put himself back on a level playing field".
"Our record at British Cycling speaks for itself and our record at Sky is brilliant - they have endorsed clean cycling from day one," Sutton added.
"I am strong in the belief that we have a great leader in Sir Dave Brailsford and, from a clean sport perspective, he has been a great enforcer - so let the truth come out and let's move on."
Sutton also denied knowing what was inside a medical package allegedly delivered to France by a British Cycling coach on the day Wiggins won the Criterium du Dauphine in 2011.
He did, though, offer his support to 36-year-old Wiggins, Britain's most decorated Olympian and a Tour de France winner in 2012, describing him as "one of the greats, if not the greatest athlete ever".
"I work with Wiggins and from what I have read and seen, there is no wrongdoing on his part," he said.
"We need to get back behind him. We are talking about a true professional here."
