Spending Review: George Osborne defends tax credits U-turn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chancellor George Osborne has denied his Spending Review U-turn on tax credits was a sign of weakness.

He said he had listened to critics of the planned cuts and was "able to help" because the economy is stronger.
Economists claim low paid families will still be out of pocket due to other changes announced on Wednesday.
Labour's John McDonnell has meanwhile lashed out at "hypocrites" who mocked him for brandishing Chairman Mao's Little Red Book in the Commons.
The shadow chancellor insisted he was being "ironic" and the stunt, during his response to Mr Osborne's Spending Review, had raised an important issue about the sale of UK assets to China in a "flamboyant and jocular" way.
However, he did apologise to a former prisoner in a Maoist labour camp who said she found his use of the communist dictator's words "chilling".
Mr Osborne is touring the media studios to defend his Spending Review and Autumn Statement, which included a total of £21.5bn cuts to a string of Whitehall departments and £12bn in welfare cuts.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Osborne denied the government was being pushed around by its opponents.
He insisted that his central judgement - to save £12bn in welfare spending by 2020 - was the right one but that "people raised concerns and I listened to them".
Improved public finances and a stronger economy have enabled him to "smooth the transition" to a lower welfare, higher wage economy, he added.
But the Spending Review was "not an end to difficult decisions" and he said that government departments still faced difficult choices.
The chancellor was forced to rethink plans to cut £4.4bn from tax credits from April after they were rejected by the House of Lords.
Both the SNP and Labour claim scrapping tax credit cuts was a victory for their parties, who had called for them to be reversed, but they said a fresh squeeze on housing benefits announced on Wednesday and the move to Universal Credit will hit low paid families.
The Resolution Foundation think tank has calculated that once the welfare cuts work their way through, working households on Universal Credit, the replacement for tax credits will lose an average of £1,200 in 2020, rising to £1,300 for those with children. For some families, they say, the loss will be as much as £3,000.
The think tank has also worked out that families at the bottom half will lose on average, £650 from all of the changes made in the Summer Budget and the Autumn Statement.
Overall police spending will be protected in real terms, amounting to an increase of £900m in cash terms by 2019/20, although this also depends on income from local precepts - money raised through council tax by individual forces.
Local councils will also be allowed to levy and extra 2% on council tax to pay for social care.
Analysis by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggests householders are set to pay £2.7bn more in council tax by 2020/2, despite a Conservative manifesto promise to help keep council taxes low.
Other revenue-raising measures included a new 3% surcharge on stamp duty for the purchase of second homes and buy-to-let rental properties.
