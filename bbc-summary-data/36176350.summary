The hosts failed to create many clear chances in a drab match and had midfielder George Thorne taken off with a serious leg injury late on.
McGoldrick fired in the winner from the spot after Teddy Bishop was brought down in the area by Richard Keogh.
The Rams finish fifth and will host Hull in the first leg of the play-offs.
Derby face the Tigers at the iPro Stadium on 14 May, with the reverse fixture at Hull's KCOM Stadium on 17 May.
Ipswich finish the season a place outside the play-offs in seventh place, five points adrift of Sheffield Wednesday.
The hosts had to play the final eight minutes of the match with 10 men because of Thorne's injury, which he sustained in a challenge with Jonathan Douglas.
Derby head coach Darren Wassall: "I've talked about the importance of the squad and we've got an abundance of midfield players, so if George is seriously injured that's the only shining light we've got.

"Ultimately this result doesn't matter. In the big scheme of things it's inconsequential because next week's results are the ones that will define our season."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy: "It was a good away performance and it's given me a lot of encouragement for next season.
"We've finished on a high, we've played 46 games and there's no point wishing or hoping, that's not me, the reality is we weren't good enough to get into the play-offs."
