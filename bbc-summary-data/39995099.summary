Lancashire v Yorkshire: Peter Handscomb hits 76-ball century as Roses rivals draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peter Handscomb's 76-ball century for Yorkshire was the highlight on day four as their Roses match with Lancashire at Old Trafford ended in a draw.

The Australia batsman (101 not out) hit 12 fours and a six in his first Championship ton for the Tykes, who were 177-1 when play was curtailed.
There was little prospect of a win for either side once Lancashire, who began on 264-6, had avoided the follow-on.
Ryan McLaren (84) and Simon Kerrigan (59) helped them to 432 all out.
McLaren and Stephen Parry (39) got them past their first target of 299, ensuring their first-innings deficit would be below 150, before Kerrigan and Tom Bailey (40) added useful lower-order runs.
Kerrigan marked his 100th first-class match with only his second half-century, but was bowled by Tim Bresnan three runs short of his career-best score of 62 not out.
Lancashire and England seamer James Anderson, who is waiting to discover the full extent of the groin injury he suffered while bowling on day one, batted with a runner and then did not bowl in Yorkshire's second innings.
The hosts collected 10 points to remain unbeaten in the County Championship in 2017, but they have not beaten Yorkshire in Championship cricket since 2011.
Yorkshire, for whom opener Alex Lees made 62 not out in the second innings, claimed nine points.
Lancashire captain Steven Croft told BBC Radio Manchester:
"To come out with one more point than them is slightly pleasing, but we got ourselves in a good position and unfortunately lost Jimmy Anderson, which made it a lot harder.
"In that sense, we're a little bit disappointed. But, all in all, it was a good game played by two good sides. We lost about 50 overs to rain.
"From there, it was going to be tough to get a result on that wicket. We felt the pitch might spin a bit more. There was a bit in it that first day.
"Shiv Chanderpaul had a brilliant innings as usual and Ryan McLaren down the order."
Yorkshire coach Andrew Gale told BBC Radio Leeds:
"It was a bit attritional. I'm disappointed we lost the time through rain because it could have been a good game. But we played some good cricket.
"We've spoken about taking our half chances. It's something we haven't always done this year. When you look back at the games we've played. Hampshire at home, the first morning of the fourth day, we dropped a couple of half chances.
"We dropped Shiv in this game when he was on 40-odd. Players like that on pitches like that make you pay. You just have to be a little bit more ruthless and concentrate harder.
"We felt we had the better of the cricket, but Lancashire stuck at it well and fought their way back into it. But it's a mini series. We've got them again in a week's time on our patch."
