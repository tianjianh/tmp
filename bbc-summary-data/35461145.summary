[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has been jailed for life for beating his wife to death using a can of paint, a battery and a mallet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Adrian Goldsmith, 50, known as "Otis", murdered 49-year-old Jill Goldsmith at their home in Northampton last March.
He was told he must serve a minimum term of 15 years.
A jury dismissed his claim that he acted in self-defence after he admitted in court that he stabbed himself.
Goldsmith wiped his eyes as he was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court.
His wife, who was found dead in the foetal position in a pool of blood in their porch, had more than 70 injuries, the court heard.
Judge Paul Glenn said she would have suffered before she died in the "spontaneous" attack.
"She must have been in terror as she fought for her life," he said.
Goldsmith had "lied repeatedly" to the police, doctors and the prison chaplain, the Judge added.
Goldsmith, who served with Northamptonshire Police for 28 years, had told officers that his wife attacked him before hitting herself on the back of the head with a mallet.

He disapproved of her smoking cannabis and was frustrated by her [lack of] sex drive as she went through the menopause, the three week trial heard.
The couple lived next to Northamptonshire Police's HQ in Wootton Hall Park, where computer logs showed that at 12:40 GMT on 26 March Mrs Goldsmith was looking at houses online.
Half an hour later, her husband called 999 to say she had tried to kill him.
He was arrested at their home, where his colleagues found him holding a kitchen knife and broken glass.
Goldsmith had typed up notes saying he was "ready to explode" and had "scared Jill", who had called him a "Jekyll and Hyde" character.
John Lloyd-Jones QC, prosecuting, said he was a "commended, hard-working officer and murderer all wrapped up in one".
A victim impact statement by Mrs Goldsmith's son, Charlie Bailey, was read to the court before the sentence was handed down.
Mr Bailey said: "He has left me feeling that there is a massive part of me missing. He should have known above everyone how to calm things down."
