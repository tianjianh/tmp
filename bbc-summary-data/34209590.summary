A man whose dog killed his grandmother at their Cardiff home has been jailed for five-and-a-half years.

Rhona Greve, 64, suffered neck and face injuries when she was bitten 16 times by Craig Greve's American bulldog on 20 March, Cardiff Crown Court heard.
Greve, 23, of Ely, already banned from owning dogs, admitted being the owner of a dangerously out-of-control dog.
His defence claimed Mrs Greve may have survived if an ambulance had not taken 98 minutes to arrive.
John Charles Rees QC, defending, said there was a "a possibility, indeed a probability" that she would not have died.
The alarm was raised at about 11:00 GMT, but more than 30 minutes later, only a rapid response paramedic turned up.
But Mrs Greve's condition had worsened - she was losing consciousness and suffered a cardiac arrest.
Medical director of the Welsh Ambulance Service Brendan Lloyd said: "Following Mrs Greve's tragic death, the trust began an investigation in order to gain a proper and full understanding into our response on that day.
"This investigation is still under way and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage."
On the day of the attack, Greve returned to their house from the pub, and from the back door he could see his grandmother being savaged by the seven stone (44kg) dog, Solo, through the glass.
At just 5ft 5in tall, Mrs Greve would not have been able to control the dog.
David Elias, prosecuting, said a neighbour heard her calling "Craig, Craig, my arm is hurting", but Greve did not call an ambulance or police at any point.
Police officers arrived just after 10:00 GMT and Greve lied, claiming his grandmother owned Solo.
Greve had been banned from owning or having control of any dog three years ago following an incident with a previous pet called Zac, which attacked another animal.
It was not the first time Solo had attacked Mrs Greve - in 2013, she went to casualty with a ragged puncture wound to her right arm.
After Greve was told his grandmother had died, he said: "No. My life is over. What have I done? I'm going to kill myself," the court heard.
He had been previously jailed for trying to strangle his grandmother.
The cause of death was described as cardiac arrest following multiple dog bites in a woman with heart disease. The court was told injuries included serious neck and face wounds and fractured ribs.
Recorder of Cardiff Eleri Rees said she had been the victim of a "vicious and sustained attack".
"She must have suffered excruciating pain, fear and distress," she added.
