Police said 270 drivers were found to be over the alcohol limit, 12 more than last year.
Its operation ran from 27 November to 2 January.
The figure includes motorists who were unfit to drive, or who were unable or refused to give a sample.
ACC Alan Todd said said: "While the number of detections is slightly higher than last year, it's difficult to accept this situation as a success - we shouldn't be detecting anyone drink-driving."
One motorist was found to be almost five times over the limit, he said.
"It's disappointing that despite our warnings, a minority of people completely disregarded the safety of themselves and others by continuing this shameful and incredibly dangerous practice," he said.
