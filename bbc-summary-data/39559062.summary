Rhys Webb: Past troubles temper Wales scrum-half's Lions hopes

Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb says being selected for the 2017 British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand would be the pinnacle of his career.

But he is philosophical about the prospect after missing the 2015 Rugby World Cup through injury.
Webb is a leading contender to be named in the Lions squad on 19 April and said: "If it happens, it happens, and it would be a dream come true.
"But I know what it's like to miss out on these big competitions."
Webb suffered a serious ankle injury in September 2015, a matter of weeks before the start of the World Cup, and played no part in Wales reaching the quarter-finals.
And the 28-year-old says such experiences are helping him stay focused on helping his region the Ospreys in the Pro12.
"The Lions is obviously the best of the best, but I've missed out on the World Cup and I know what it's like," Webb told 5 Live's Rugby Union Weekly podcast.
"Don't get me wrong, as the time is getting closer, the more motivational videos from past Lions are popping up on Twitter, and I would love to bits to be a part of it.
"But we've got to win the league first.
"It would be the pinnacle of my career, but we've got the Blues on Saturday, and that is the final game ahead of the announcement next week."
Ospreys are third in the Pro12 table - seven points adrift of second-placed Munster - and face Cardiff Blues this weekend as part of Welsh rugby's Judgment Day double-header at the Principality Stadium.
"We've had three disappointing results - Treviso, the [Challenge Cup] quarter-final [against Stade Francais], and Leinster on the weekend - so we are on a bit of a tricky losing streak," Webb added.
"But we are in total control of where we are in the league, the boys have a had a great season so far.
"It's about trying to stay positive and get that momentum now this weekend, in a full Principality Stadium against our local rivals the Blues."
