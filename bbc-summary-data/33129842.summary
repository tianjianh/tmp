[SN]TITLE[SN]
Australia sex abuse inquiry to focus on entertainment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Australian inquiry into institutional child sex abuse is to focus on the entertainment industry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Philip Reed, the head of the Royal Commission, said anyone who has experience or knowledge of abuses should come forward.
It follows several high-profile convictions in Australia and abroad, including entertainer Rolf Harris.
The commission is investigating how schools, churches and the government responded to child abuse cases.
It was set up following pressure from lawmakers amid police claims that the Roman Catholic Church had concealed evidence of paedophile priests.
Television networks, production companies, casting agencies and other entertainment organisations will be put under the spotlight in the expanded inquiry.
Harris was jailed last year for indecent assaults against four girls, and sparked further fury when a British newspaper revealed he had written a song in jail calling his victims "slimy little woodworm".
He was prosecuted in Britain as part of Operation Yewtree, set up in the wake of revelations  that television presenter Jimmy Savile was a prolific abuser.
