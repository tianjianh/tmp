Thirty one artists and craft makers have been selected out of more than 400 who applied for studios at a £4.2m development in Plymouth.

Demand "far outstripped" the availability, said founders of Ocean Studios at the Royal William Yard.
All applications were put to a panel of experts who decided who got the rented studios at the former naval yard.
The aim is to offer artists space to create, sell their work and get help from business advisors.
Leigh Mason, joint founder of the development, which opens in July, said: "We're so pleased with our carefully selected collective of residents and we know they are equally as excited as us to get in there and start doing what they do best.
"It was exactly for these creative talents and diversity of practice that we created this inspiring space in the first place."
For those who were not successful, there are associate programmes, short courses and a communal working space for many more than those in the studios.
Successful applicants Nadja Wüthrich and Nicholas Leverington have relocated from Switzerland to pursue ceramics and photography.
Mr Leverington said: "We looked at many places to relocate to, and we believe that Ocean Studios is perhaps the most exciting development for artists in the UK at this moment.
"We think it will bring a lot of artists to Plymouth."
