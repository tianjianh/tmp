[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Bache, 51, from Portsmouth, was assaulted ahead of England's match against Russia in Marseille on 11 June.
Mr Bache was reported to have suffered severe brain injuries and a cardiac arrest and had to be put in an induced coma.
He is being treated at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth.
His friend, Crispin Harwood, said Mr Bache arrived in the UK by air ambulance on Friday afternoon.
Mr Harwood said his friend did not need "specialist neurological equipment or treatment" but would have an operation in due course to repair broken bones in his face.
The hospital said it could not comment on Mr Bache's condition.
Friends of Mr Bache, known as "Pepe", set up a web page which raised more than Â£27,000 for the cost of the air ambulance and any future medical needs.
The page said that Mr Bache's life had been saved by a French policeman, Patrice Martin, who performed CPR.
