Two dogs stolen from a garden in West Lothian have died after being hit by a car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two Lurchers were stolen along with seven eight-week-old Shih Tzu puppies, from Glendevon Park, Winchburgh, between 07:30 and 18:00 on Wednesday.
The Lurchers were hit by a Honda Civic at about 22:10 on Thursday on the B9020 near Tippet Knowe Road.
One of the dogs died on impact and the other was taken to a vet, where it was put down with the owner's permission.
PC John Jackson, of Police Scotland, said: "At this time, we believe the Lurchers may have been left to roam and as a consequence their owners have very sadly lost their dogs.
"We are still appealing for anyone who may have information about the whereabouts of the seven Shih Tzu puppies to come forward, so we can reunite them with their mum and rightful owners.
"The Shih Tzu puppies are worth around Â£650 each and if you are offered a puppy matching this description, which seems disproportionately cheap and the mother is unavailable to view, please get in touch."
