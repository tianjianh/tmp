Camran Green, 17, originally from Wednesbury, West Midlands, was knifed in the stomach at an address in Shakespeare Road on 2 October.
Bristol Crown Court heard Steven Sharpe, 31, from Cheltenham planned to rob Mr Green of money. Sharpe pleaded guilty to the murder.
He also admitted assaulting three police detention officers.
The judge told Sharpe he must serve a minimum of 24 years and six months of his life sentence.
The court was told Mr Green travelled to Gloucestershire to supply drugs through the so-called "county lines" drugs network.
Sharpe was said to have been high on heroin and cocaine at the time and planned to rob Mr Green of his takings.
The robbery went wrong and Sharpe stabbed Mr Green a single time in the body with a 14in blade.
The weapon was described by the prosecution as being a hunting knife or a "Rambo" knife.
Sharpe fled the scene on his bike and evaded police for three days until his arrest on 5 October.
Gloucestershire Police said when Sharpe was taken into custody, he spat at and assaulted three police detention officers.
Jurors were told Mr Green was under the care of social services at the time of his death and had been in foster care.
Det Ch Insp Ruth Mather said: "Drug gangs from big cities have been using vulnerable young men on a frequent basis as drug runners in smaller towns to do their dirty work for them.
"Camran was being used in this way - basing himself at Sharpe's girlfriend's address to deal crack cocaine and heroin for gang leaders in Birmingham.
"Tragically Camran had his life taken as a result of that work."
Chief executive of Dudley Council, Sarah Norman, said:  "This is a tragic case and our thoughts are with the family.
"As it will be subject to an independent serious case review, we cannot comment any further at this time.
"However, we are fully committed to learning any lessons that come out of the serious case review."
