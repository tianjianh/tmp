The suitcase was originally left in a station locker, but after no-one returned to claim it, it was taken to left luggage and opened by staff.
"There was an abnormal odour when we opened the suitcase. Then we saw hair," an unnamed employee told reporters.
The victim was a woman aged between 70 and 90 and about 140cm (4ft 7ins) tall.
She had been folded into a yellow suitcase measuring about 70cm by 50cm by 25cm.
Japanese media quoted police as saying the suitcase was removed from the unlocked locker at JR Tokyo train station on 26 April. It had been sitting in the left luggage storage area, before it was opened on Sunday.
Police said there were no obvious injuries to the body, and were investigating the cause of death. Police were also examining security camera footage to try to determine who left the case behind.
