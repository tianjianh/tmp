Dutch riot police have broken up a rally in support of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hours after a minister was refused entry to the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam.

Police carried out mounted charges at the protesters, who had gathered outside the consulate as the diplomatic row between the two nations escalated.
The Turkish minister has been sent to Germany, Rotterdam's mayor says.
Protesters were reportedly throwing bottles and mobbing police cars.
Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, Turkey's minister of family and social policies, had arrived by road on Saturday ahead of a rally planned to help harness the votes of Turks living in the Netherlands.
They will be voting in a referendum next month on whether to expand Mr Erdogan's powers.
But when she arrived, Dutch authorities refused to allow her entry to the consulate, sparking a stream of angry tweets.
Ms Kaya has since left the Netherlands, the mayor of Rotterdam confirmed early on Sunday morning.
