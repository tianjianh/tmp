[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swiss-based Falcon Travel is to operate weekly charter flights from Zurich from May.
A 100-seater Fokker 100 aircraft will operate into Inverness until August. The service will also return in 2016 and 2017.
It marks a return to Inverness by Falcon, which previously operated flights between the two cities.
Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (Hial) said the new service could lead to a tourism boost worth almost Â£1m for the local economy.
Inverness Airport general manager Graeme Bell said: "We are delighted that Falcon Travel have committed to operate this service for three years.
"Inverness and the Highlands have a great deal to offer Swiss visitors and we will be working closely with Inverness and Loch Ness Tourism BID and other tourism agencies to ensure we make the most of this opportunity."
