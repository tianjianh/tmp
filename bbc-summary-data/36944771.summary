[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who killed his parents and was later found dead had been arrested for chasing a stranger with a knife days earlier, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Convicted rapist Ashraf Amrani, 30, was on bail when his body was discovered on a roof in Westbourne Park Road, west London, last February.
His parents Hassan, 72, and Zohra, 59, were found dead earlier.
Their bodies were discovered when police went to inform the couple of their son's arrest.
Amrani had been arrested three days earlier for affray.
Hassan Amrani was found fully clothed in a bath in the upstairs of his flat with a stab wound to his stomach.
Mrs Amrani was found lifeless in the foetal position in a downstairs bathroom.
An inquest at the Royal Courts of Justice heard their son had a "significant" head injury and what appeared to be a number of self-inflicted wounds when he was found.
Coroner Bernard Richmond QC said in his opening remarks that there was "no suggestion that anyone other than Ashraf Amrani is responsible for the killings."
On 10 February 2015, Amrani was arrested on suspicion of affray, having reportedly pursued a stranger down the the street with a large knife, the court heard.
He was taken to St Mary's Hospital after falling ill from having taken ecstasy.
He was later released on bail and left hospital the following day.
Witness statements from neighbours, friends and colleagues spoke of how Amrani had been acting in an unsettling manner in the week leading up to his death, with several speculating that he was on drugs.
One friend, Trevor Brown, said Amrani had visited his house on 12 February and acted in a threatening way, at one stage taking a knife out of a kitchen drawer and pacing around.
Amrani had served several years in prison following his conviction for rape in 2010.
Relatives said he felt "shackled" by his licence conditions, which had forced him to move in with his parents.
Asked when Amrani started using drugs following his release from prison, his brother-in-law Jalil Essbai told the court: "When he started to find it difficult in life, when he couldn't find work and couldn't support himself - about a year after he came out of prison."
He added: "He felt very shackled, basically."
Amrani had a history of drug abuse and his family had sought to get him psychiatric care in the past.
The court was also told how Amrani's "volatile" relationship with his mother had forced her to leave home to stay with relatives at times.
