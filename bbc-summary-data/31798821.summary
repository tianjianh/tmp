Visitors to a Somerset hospital continue to be restricted after a norovirus outbreak closed three wards.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Weston General Hospital will only be open to visitors for two hours a day until further notice, with a maximum of two visitors per patient.
Children under 11 will also not be admitted.
The hospital said the restrictions remained in place as it believed the winter vomiting bug was brought in by a visitor last week
Uphill and Kewstoke wards and the Stroke Unit remain closed after the outbreak was detected.
The hospital has urged people not to go there if they are feeling unwell with sickness, diarrhoea or fever.
The latest outbreak follows two others which occurred at Weston General Hospital over the Christmas period.
