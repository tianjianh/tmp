[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Haitian President Leslie Manigat has died after a long illness at the age of 83.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Manigat won polls in 1988 that were considered illegitimate, and served for less than six months before being removed in a military coup.
He ran for president in 2006, coming second. His wife, Mirlande Manigat, ran in the 2010 elections, losing to current leader Michel Martelly.
Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe said his death left "a huge void" in Haiti.
Mr Martelly said Mr Manigat's death was "sad news".
The former academic was Haiti's first elected president after a popular revolt in 1986 overthrew President-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier, who relied on a brutal militia to control the country.
Mr Duvalier is accused of massive corruption, repression and human rights abuses.
