Morgan Technical Ceramics fined £180,000 over crush death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Wrexham company has been fined £180,000 after a man was crushed by heavy machinery at a Ruabon factory.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Michael Williams, 51, of Acrefair, died after being struck by a half-tonne power press on 3 December 2012 at Vauxhall Industrial Estate.
Mold Crown Court heard the lifting operation was unsafe and Mr Williams was not properly trained in lifting non-standard loads.
Morgan Technical Ceramics Ltd had admitted failing to ensure his safety.
The court heard a maintenance supervisor was moving the power press on a pallet truck when it toppled over, striking Mr Williams.
He died from his injuries at the scene.
As well as the fine, the firm must also pay £23,000 in costs.
