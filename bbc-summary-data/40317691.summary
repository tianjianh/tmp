Livesey lost out to Brazil's Ketleyn Quadros in her gold-medal contest.

"It feels great to be back competing at this level," said Conway, who was taking part in her second competition back since winning bronze at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.
"I am happy with how I fought and looking forward to a few days in the sun. Then it's back to training for the Worlds in September."
