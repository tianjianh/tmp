Flanker Sam Cane replaces former skipper Richie McCaw while Aaron Cruden starts at fly-half in place of Dan Carter.
Uncapped pair Ardie Savea and Seta Tamanivalu are among the replacements.
"We're well aware that this is a good Welsh team and not one that we'll underestimate," Hansen said.
"Whilst the opposition might believe that we're vulnerable because it's our first Test and we have lost some experienced players, we don't have that mindset."
New Zealand team to face Wales: Ben Smith, Waisake Naholo, Malakai Fekitoa, Ryan Crotty, Julian Savea, Aaron Cruden, Aaron Smith; Kieran Read (captain), Sam Cane, Jerome Kaino, Brodie Retallick, Luke Romano; Owen Franks, Dane Coles, Joe Moody.
Replacements: Nathan Harris, Wyatt Crockett, Charlie Faumuina, Patrick Tuipulotu, Ardie Savea, TJ Perenara, Beauden Barrett, Seta Tamanivalu.
