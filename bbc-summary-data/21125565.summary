Oxford exploitation trial: Girl 'told she would be shot'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 14-year-old girl was told she would be shot if she did not obey a man she then had sex with in a park, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The girl is one of six alleged victims of nine men accused of grooming and exploiting children in Oxford.
She described being taken to parks and flats where she was given drugs and alcohol and had sex with men.
The men, from Oxford and Berkshire, deny 51 counts relating to girls aged between 11 and 15 from 2004 to 2012.
The alleged victim told jurors at the Old Bailey she was living in a children's home when she was 14.
She said she would run away with a friend to meet a group of Asian men in Oxford that she knew as K-Dog, Jammy, Khan and Acter.
The jury heard the men were nice to the girl at first but later became "demanding" and "threatening".
When asked why she did it the girl said: "I felt I didn't have a choice".
On one occasion the jury heard she had been drinking in a field with one of the men.
She told the court: "He started pulling his zip down on his trousers.
"He said that if I didn't do as I was told he knew someone that would shoot me."
The court heard she would be taken to places where other men would have sex with her.
Jurors were told that in August 2006 she went to a flat with a friend. The friend left and 11 men arrived.
The alleged victim said she went to the bedroom and had sex with a man who is not before the court.
She told jurors the man said he was going to "bring another man in", adding: "They told me if they ask, to say I was 16."
The court heard the girl thought she was going to have to have sex with all 11 men so she tried to jump out of the window, but it was too small.
Instead she called police, but the next day withdrew her statement.
She told the jury: "I was scared and I didn't want any trouble."
The trial is expected to last until April. The defendants are all in custody.
The defendants are:
