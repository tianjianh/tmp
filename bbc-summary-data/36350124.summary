Oliver Lancashire: Shrewsbury Town sign Rochdale defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury have made Rochdale defender Oliver Lancashire their first summer signing on an initial two-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old, who has the option for a third year, was out of contract after three years at Spotland.
Town have offered new deals to captain Nat Knight-Percival, Junior Brown, James Wesolowski and keepers Jayson Leutwiler, Mark Halstead and England Under-18 international Callum Burton.
Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro tops the list of eight Shrewsbury players to be let go.
On the back of their narrow brush with relegation back to League Two, defenders Jermaine Grandison, Zak Whitbread and Mickey Demetriou, midfielder Jordan Clark, wingers Elliot Grandin and James Caton and striker Scott Vernon are the other seven not to be offered new deals.
Akpa Akpro three times scored important late goals for Shrewsbury over the final two months of the season.
He scored the equalisers at home to both Scunthorpe United and Bradford City and the winner at Gillingham, three results which ultimately kept the Town up by four points.
