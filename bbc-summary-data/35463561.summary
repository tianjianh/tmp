[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man denies causing friend's death by careless driving

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has denied causing the death of a friend by careless driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joel Jones, now 24, is accused after the death of Jack McKenzie, 18, who was involved in a crash near Peterchurch, Herefordshire, on 3 September 2010.
Mr Jones, of Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, struck a hay baler's wheel because he was driving too far to the right of the road, Hereford Crown Court heard.
The prosecution said he was driving at "more speed" than was appropriate but was not exceeding the speed limit.
His speed was estimated at being between 40mph and 50mph when the crash happened at 23:30 BST, the court heard.
It was told the two students at Hereford Sixth Form College were in a Vauxhall Corsa when the car was involved in a collision with a seven-tonne hay baler being pulled by a tractor.
A "competent driver" would slow down or pull over while going past the tractor, the prosecution said.
The court was told following the crash, a Fiat Punto was also involved in a collision with the Corsa, which had been on the opposite side of the road to the tractor.
Mr McKenzie, who was originally from Hereford, died.
Mr Jones was also injured, the court heard.
The trial continues.
