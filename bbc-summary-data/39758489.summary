Tony Mowbray: Blackburn boss questions Huddersfield changes as Birmingham win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers boss Tony Mowbray has questioned the decision of Huddersfield manager David Wagner to make 10 changes for the Terriers' defeat by Birmingham.

Mowbray's side beat Aston Villa 1-0 to boost their hopes of survival but Huddersfield lost 2-0 at 10-man Birmingham, also fighting relegation.
It leaves Rovers in the Championship's bottom three on goal difference.
"Maybe he [Wagner] is not aware of the way the British game is played, and the integrity of all the leagues," he said.
"Everybody should be trying to win every game."
Huddersfield went into their match against Harry Redknapp's Blues already assured of their place in the play-offs.
Birmingham had forward Che Adams sent-off on 23 minutes but managed to score both goals after the red card to move up to 20th, two points above Rovers and 21st-placed Nottingham Forest with just one match remaining.
"Huddersfield have to look after themselves, I suppose - they're in the play-offs, so if he wants to rest everybody then so be it," added Mowbray to BBC Radio Lancashire.
"I'm not sure I would've done that [made 10 changes], personally, but I don't want to stand here and question the integrity of the game.
"It's disappointing that 10 men from Birmingham City can win 2-0 against a team in the top six who have been winning pretty consistently all year."
"It suggests that the changes did have a big impact on the game."
