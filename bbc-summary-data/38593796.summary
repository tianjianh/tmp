Island Games 2017: Craig Gascoyne recalled to Jersey table tennis squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jersey have recalled Craig Gascoyne to the Island Games table tennis squad for the 2017 event in Gotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The sport's former development officer in Jersey was controversially omitted from the squad when the island hosted the last Games in 2015.
He is joined by 2015 singles silver-medallist Jordan Wykes, Josh Band and Luc Miller in the men's team.
Irene Bree and Kelsey Le Maistre are in the women's squad, with 2015 bronze medallist Sofia Uddnas not going.
Gascoyne won men's singles silver at the 2009 and 2011 Games and has also won three doubles bronze medals and a team silver and bronze.
