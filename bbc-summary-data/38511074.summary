The 21-year-old former Aston Villa trainee had a trial with the League One side in December, and impressed enough for an offer to be made.
He also spent time at Walsall and Solihull Moors before moving to the Pics in February 2015.
"This is an excellent chance for me to make the step up into league football," he said.
The last professional footballer to start his career at Walsall-based Northern Premier League side Rushall was defender Zat Knight, who played Premier League football for Fulham, Aston Villa and Bolton Wanderers, as well as winning two caps for England.
