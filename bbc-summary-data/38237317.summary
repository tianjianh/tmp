[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth Albion head coach Dan Parkes has left the National One club after five months in charge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parkes left National Three South West side Brixham to take over at Albion after Graham Dawe was sacked.
"I've realised that the job requires more time and commitment than I am able to give as I have also got a business to run," Parkes told BBC South West.
Under his leadership, Albion won 10 of their 14 National One matches and are third in the table.
"I've loved my time as coach at the club and I'm happy that I've been able to assemble a good squad of local lads who have performed well this season," he added.
"I wish the players and the club the best of luck for the rest of the season and look forward to hopefully seeing Albion back in the Championship in the near future."
Former prop Parkes played for Albion in two spells, once for a short period in the 1990s and then from 2000-2005.
He also spent time at Exeter Chiefs and Cornish Pirates, as well as playing one game for Bath in 2006.
