Delays of 65 minutes were reported at the security gate at about 08:00 BST.
The "IT fault" was resolved but the system went down again about two hours later, leading to manual checks resuming and further delays.
The airport later said the systems failures had been "rectified" but advised travellers to allow extra time.
An airport spokeswoman added cause of the software problems was being investigated.

Mike Cleveland, who was delayed by the first IT problem, said it meant there was no express queue to get through security.
"[The airport staff] said they will come through and grab you for the urgent flights," he said.
