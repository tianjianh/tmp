[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A teenager has been reunited with a message in a bottle she sent as a toddler, which washed ashore in Russia.

Emily Plant of Findochty, Moray, dispatched the bottle in August 2001 as part of a local gala competition.
It was found 15 years later on the Yamal peninsula in Siberia and she was invited to the Arctic Circle Assembly in Iceland to reclaim it.
She also met up with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon who was speaking at the event in Reykjavik.
