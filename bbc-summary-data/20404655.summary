Host David Walliams arrived on stage as James Bond, complete with jet pack.
Girls Aloud, One Direction, 2012 Britain's Got Talent winners Ashleigh Butler and dog Pudsey, and Sir Bruce Forsyth were among the British artists.
Kylie Minogue, Alicia Keys, Neil Diamond and Andrea Bocelli were among the international stars.
The performance of song, comedy and skits began with mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins singing the National Anthem. She also later performed with classical superstar Placido Domingo.
Jenkins, appearing at her fourth Royal Variety Performance, said: "It's an honour. It does make you nervous when the Queen is watching you. You want to do your best."
Girls Aloud sang The Promise, while One Direction sang number one single Little Things.
Reminders of past Royal Variety Performances were shown, with comedian Jimmy Tarbuck introducing comedy clips of himself, Peter Kay and the cast of Only Fools and Horses entertaining in previous years.
Tarbuck first appeared at the Royal Variety Performance in 1964.
"It's a great honour to be asked," he said during rehearsals. "You're appearing with your peers and people you admire. It's such a good bill."
Britain's Got Talent winners Ashleigh and Pudsey performed a James Bond-inspired dance routine, in honour of 50 years of the spy films.
Past stars of the ITV1 talent contest also performed, including dance troupe Diversity and comedy dancing duo Stavros Flatley.
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who celebrate their 65th wedding anniversary on Tuesday, shook the hands of the performers on stage at the end of the evening, while backstage Walliams declared the evening "awesome".
The sold-out performance is due to be broadcast on ITV1 on 3 December at 19:30 GMT. All proceeds are donated to The Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund (EABF), which cares for entertainers throughout the UK who need help.
The performance was first held in 1912.
