[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inspector has described the "systematic neglectful care" at a care home where a woman became severely underweight and later died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yousaf Khan, the owner of Autumn Grange in Nottingham, was jailed for gross negligence manslaughter over the death of Ivy Atkin in 2012.
Mrs Atkin, who was 86 and had dementia, weighed just 25kg (3st 13lbs).
An inspector told an inquest into her death there were "widespread" problems at the home.
Linda Hirst, from the Care Quality Commission (CQC), said Mrs Atkin was not the only resident being neglected.
"The care of people, including Ivy Atkin, who I witnessed directly, they were receiving very poor care," she said.
"I was so concerned I just didn't feel people would be safe over the weekend."
Khan, 47, of Nelson Road, Nottingham, was sentenced to three years and two months at Nottingham Crown Court in February.
His firm Sherwood Rise Ltd was fined Â£300,000 for corporate manslaughter - the first case of its kind in England.
The inquest heard Mrs Atkin died from pneumonia as a result of debilitation and low body mass index (BMI), contributed to by dementia.
Her BMI was just 10.7, while the healthy weight range is between 18.5 and 24.9.
Miss Hirst and her colleagues carried out their unannounced inspection on 2 November 2012, in response to whistle-blowing information.
The CQC inspectors found that the care home did not meet any of their required standards - including safeguarding service users from abuse, meeting nutritional needs, and cleanliness and infection control.
"There was systematic neglectful care, discrimination and further abuse taking place," said Miss Hirst.
"The kitchen was dirty and equipment was broken. People were getting malnutrition.
"The providers were not maintaining the premises appropriately."
Mrs Atkin and the other residents were moved out on 4 November, but she died on 22 November.
The inquest continues.
