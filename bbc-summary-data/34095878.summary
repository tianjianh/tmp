[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Francie Molloy, MP for Mid Ulster, said police visited his home on Saturday morning and warned of an "imminent threat to his life".
"They called around 2am with intelligence relating to an attack by a loyalist paramilitary organisation on me or my home," Mr Molloy said.
"I was surprised at this type of thing, it's concerning.
"I pride myself in representing all sides of the community here in Mid Ulster, and I won't be deterred from doing that.
"It would look as though it relates to events of the last couple of weeks."
The Sinn Féin MP Mickey Brady, who has also been the subject of death threats, has asked those with information to bring it to the police "so that those who are intent in taking us backward are brought to justice".
