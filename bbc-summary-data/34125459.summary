The victim, who is in his 50s, was approached by two men at Peters Hill in the north of the city at about 14:45 BST on Tuesday.
One of the robbers held him at knife-point and demanded money.
When the victim refused he was slashed on the arm.  He then handed over cash but was then slashed again on the arm before the robbers left the scene.
The disabled man was treated in hospital for injuries that are not believed to be life- threatening.
Police said the robbers, both in their early 20s, made off on foot in the direction of the Falls Road in west Belfast.
