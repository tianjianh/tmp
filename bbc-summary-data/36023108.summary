The 32-year-old's first World Series win since 2012 ended the 13-event winning streak of Gwen Jorgensen.
The Welsh triathlete also beat British rival Jodie Stimpson.
"Helen has put a very strong case forward," said Stanford, who has already qualified for Rio along with Vicky Holland.
With an official announcement due in June, two-time world champion Jenkins and England's Commonwealth champion Stimpson are competing to be part of Britain's female triathlon contingent in Rio this summer.
"Personally, I can't see how they can't pick Helen," said Jenkins' Welsh compatriot Stanford.
"British Triathlon were saying that you had to display potential to medal for Rio and she's absolutely done that.
"She's gone out there and won the race and not only that she's beaten Gwen Jorgensen, who is the hot favourite to win gold in Rio, so if you beat her you've shown you have potential to medal so I'd be very surprised if she's not selected."
Stimpson made a strong start to the season, winning the opening World Series event in Abu Dhabi and the sprint distance World Cup in Australia.
But she trailed in 12th, more than three minutes behind the winner, at the Gold Coast.
"Jodie had a fantastic start to the season," added Stanford, the 2013 world champion.
"But sadly she didn't quite have the race she wanted at the Gold Coast which was the actual selection race.
"That was the day they had to really perform and show what they were capable of doing, but she presented a strong case earlier in the year and you never know what the selectors are thinking and which way they will go."
After winning the race in Australia, Jenkins said: "The team is not announced yet but I think I have probably done enough today.
"Our team is so strong and it is so unfair that Jodie might not be going to the Games."
