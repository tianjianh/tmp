GMP Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy's IPCC probe dropped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A criminal probe into the involvement of Greater Manchester's chief constable in an investigation into a suspected child sex offender has been dropped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has withdrawn criminal and gross misconduct notices on Sir Peter Fahy.
They have also been dropped against ex-Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney
The IPCC has been carrying out three investigations based on allegations made by a whistleblower.
Mr Sweeney, who retired during the investigation, was also investigated over his role in the child sex offender case.
An IPCC spokesman said a retired officer had also been told he was no longer being investigated for his role in the investigation into the suspected sex offender.
But a detective inspector and a detective superintendent remained under criminal and gross misconduct notice over their roles in the investigation into an alleged sex offender.
The spokesman said a detective chief inspector had been told he was no longer under criminal investigation but remained under gross misconduct notice.
The IPCC also said an investigation was continuing into GMP's disposal of victim's body parts in the case of serial killer Harold Shipman, without the families' knowledge.
The spokesman added: "The third investigation into whether the actions of a detective chief inspector put public safety at risk is continuing.
"Following enquiries made to date the IPCC is no longer investigating the deployment of a covert listening device having been satisfied that an investigation conducted into this by GMP was appropriate."
Tony Lloyd, Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, welcomed the decision on Sir Peter, adding: "This vindicates the decision I made to ask the chief constable to continue to lead Greater Manchester Police while the Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation took place.
"I am grateful to Sir Peter for his professionalism, which did not falter during what must have been a difficult period."
