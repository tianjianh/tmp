What do you want to know about airport expansion?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
We asked you to send in questions about the Heathrow or Gatwick airport expansion that you want BBC Business correspondent Theo Leggett to investigate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We picked out four questions. You selected this one from Bob White.
Why hasn't the option of building an additional runway at both Gatwick and Heathrow been considered?
Theo will publish his answer to the question on the BBC Business & Economics page
Why are we doing this?
We want to write stories which matter to you.
You can send us your questions about whatever interests you and BBC News will try to answer them.
Take a look at some of the other questions you've wanted us to answer:
Why does the NHS spend on homeopathy?
Could the UK take on EU trade deals?
Pound fall: 'Should I get my dollars now or should I wait?'
Does fracking affect the water supply?
