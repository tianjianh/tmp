People were upset at the journalist's approach while speaking to Nick Varney about an accident on the park's Smiler ride that left 16 people injured.
Many felt her questions - about park safety and the extent of the victims' injuries - were too aggressive.
A 17-year-old had her leg amputated following the crash.
Four other passengers were seriously injured when a carriage full of passengers on the 14-loop roller coaster collided with an empty one.
The incident, on 2 June, resulted in the Staffordshire theme park closing for six days.
In her interview, broadcast three days after the accident, Burley pressed Varney - the chief executive of Merlin Entertainment - to reveal whether a report one of the victims had lost a leg was true.
"We are deeply sorry for the accident that happened," he said.
Burley replied: "I'm sure they are not interested in your sympathy at this stage. They went to have a fantastic day and they have potentially lost a limb. You won't tell us if they have or not."
He responded: "With all due respect, to be telling you stuff like thatâ€¦ That is absolutely personal information to those individuals and their families."
A petition to have Burley sacked over the incident has now gained more than 50,000 signatures.
Ofcom received 1,816 complaints over the interview but said: "We have carefully assessed whether this interview exceeded generally accepted standards.
"In our view, the interviewee was able to respond fully to the questions and put his position across. As a result, we have not taken the matter forward for investigation."
Responding to complaints immediately after the broadcast, Burley tweeted: "For those concerned I was hard on Alton Towers boss, he'll get over it. Not sure those on his ride will be so quick to recover ."
