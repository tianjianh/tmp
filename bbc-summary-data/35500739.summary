A statement said the funeral would be a private service for the family.
"No further details will be released, and we ask that the family's wish for privacy is respected at this time," it added.
Sir Terry had a 50-year career on radio and television, including Wake up to Wogan on BBC Radio 2 and the Wogan chat show on BBC One.
He was also the voice of the Eurovision Song Contest in the UK for many years and had been involved in the Children in Need appeal since it began in 1980.
The veteran broadcaster died of cancer on Sunday at the age of 77.
He had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon.
Tributes poured in from the worlds of showbusiness and politics.
BBC director general Tony Hall hailed him as "a broadcasting legend" while Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "someone millions came to feel was their own special friend".
Broadcaster Simon Mayo said: "There was no-one better at being a friend behind the microphone than Sir Terry".
Chris Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name: "He was the absolute governor."
Limerick-born Sir Terry started his career on Irish broadcaster RTE before moving to the BBC.
