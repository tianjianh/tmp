A missing British man is feared drowned after he jumped off a bridge in the Australian city of Brisbane "for a bit of fun".

The man, 30, was drinking at a hostel before he and three other backpackers decided to jump, police said.
He plunged about 10m into the river and briefly resurfaced before disappearing beneath the water.
His companions, who decided not to jump, alerted authorities who launched a water and aerial search.
The man has not been seen since, police said.
"It's a very sad event obviously," Inspector Sean Cryer told a press conference in Brisbane on Monday.
