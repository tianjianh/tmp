Winston Roddick launches child sex crime team for north Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A specialist team is being set up in north Wales to combat sex crimes against children, the police and crime commissioner's (PCC) office has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
North Wales PCC Winston Roddick said he was responding to the "prevalence and escalation" of that type of crime.
A summit on child sexual exploitation will be held in St Asaph on 14 May.
He added: "I have acted after we saw from the incidents at Rotherham and other parts of the country a staggering amount of child sexual abuse."
Details of the proposal are outlined in the PCC's police and crime plan.
