Watchdog reviews police response over Edinburgh pensioner concerns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquiry has been ordered into how police responded to a pensioner's death in Edinburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers forced entry into a flat in Adelphi Place, Portobello, on Sunday where they found the body of 88-year-old Douglas Iggulden.
His wife Elizabeth, 89, was found collapsed and remains in hospital.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner will look at the initial response by Police Scotland to a report of concern about the couple's welfare.
BBC Scotland understands the investigation concerns the timing of the police response.
The commissioner is also reviewing a separate incident where a possible sighting of an elderly woman who had gone missing from her home in Glasgow, was not passed onto the police inquiry team.
Janet McKay's body was later discovered in Clydebank, more than a week after her disappearance.
