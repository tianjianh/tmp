Ex-Avon and Somerset police chiefs say Nick Gargan must go

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three former Avon and Somerset chief constables have called for current chief Nick Gargan to go to restore "confidence " in the force.

In a letter, David Shattock, Steve Pilkington and Colin Port said leaders should be "inspiring not an embarrassment" and change was needed.
Mr Gargan, who was appointed in January 2013, was found guilty of eight misconduct charges last month.
The 48-year-old is back at work but has temporarily been moved from the force.
He was suspended in May 2014 amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female staff and breaches of data protection legislation.
Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens has said details cannot yet be made public about the misconduct charges. He was cleared of gross misconduct.
Mr Gargan is due to face a sanction hearing with the commissioner, who has the power to sack chief constables, on 19 August.
She said the independent panel that found Mr Gargan guilty on eight counts had recommended "a sanction of eight final written warnings". He is officially still chief constable but is temporarily doing work for the National Police Chief's Council.
But in a letter to Ms Mountstevens, Mr Shattock, Mr Pilkington and Mr Port said there had been "incredulity" that Mr Gargan "can continue to hold his position" and those they had heard from within the force "do not welcome the return of the chief constable with any degree of confidence or enthusiasm".
"It is incomprehensible to us that a chief constable with such a large number of substantiated misconduct findings on his record could be respected as a leader and maintain the morale of the force," they said.
"It is our professional view that confidence cannot be restored without a change of chief constable."
In a statement, Ms Mountstevens said she had read the letter and was taking their "concerns - very seriously" but there was a "process to follow".
"The report is 90 pages long and I am considering the panel's views and recommendations thoroughly ahead of the sanction hearing," she said.
"It could be potentially highly prejudicial to the outcome, if I comment further before the misconduct process is finalised."
Last month, the local branch of the Police Federation expressed a lack of confidence in Mr Gargan and urged the commissioner to "show leadership" on the issue.
Mr Gargan said at the time he understood people had questions and said he would address these.
He added he was "very much looking forward to returning to work" and "beginning the process of rebuilding confidence in the force".
