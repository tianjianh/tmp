Commonwealth Games 2022: London withdraws hosting interest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London has withdrawn interest in hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games, leaving Birmingham and Liverpool as the UK's potential candidate cities.

Manchester had already said it did not want to host on its own, but the city could still stage some events as part of a successful bid from Liverpool.
Australia, Canada and Malaysia are also interested in hosting the Games, which were stripped from Durban in March.
A decision on a formal UK bid will be made later in 2017.
The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has said a final decision on a replacement for the South African city is unlikely to be made before early autumn.
"It is great that four countries - including several UK cities - have expressed an interest in bidding to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games," a statement from the Mayor of London's office read.
"While London remains focused on delivering the biggest sports event of this year - the IPC and IAAF World Athletics Championships - we wish the UK bidders every success in winning the rights to host the Games in 2022."
The Commonwealth Games are held every four years and feature athletes from more than 50 countries, mostly former British colonies.
Britain last hosted the Games in Glasgow in 2014, while the 2002 event was staged in Manchester. The next edition takes place on Australia's Gold Coast in 2018.
