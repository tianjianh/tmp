More complaints have been made by staff at Swansea University's School of Management about they way they have been treated.

The BBC has seen an email written by the pro-dean of the department calling a former staff member "human garbage".
It follows a BBC investigation where employees voiced unhappiness about their treatment at work.
There is currently an investigation ongoing into the department following an earlier review.
The School of Management is headed by Prof Nigel Piercy who began his role as dean in 2013.
His son, Niall Piercy, who was employed as chairman of entrepreneurship in February 2013 and later made pro-dean, wrote the email seen by the BBC's Newyddion 9 programme for S4C.
Responding to a complaint in 2014, the pro-dean referred to a former member of staff as "being generally a worthless, lazy, amoral sack of human garbage".
The BBC is also aware of another email where the pro-dean used derogatory language towards staff.
Since Prof Nigel Piercy took on the role as dean, 23 academic staff - the majority at senior level - have left with several citing the way the department was being managed as the reason behind their departure.
In May, a number of current and former staff spoke to BBC Wales alleging poor management.
Another former employee has come forward to describe her experiences at the department.
Prof Alison Pullen, the department's first female professor, told the BBC how after returning from a conference, she found her office had been emptied and her profile deleted from the school's website without prior consultation.
She said: "I had been removed from the school despite teaching an enormous third year undergrad class of 200 students and marking their papers.
"My possessions had been removed with all my personal files and I had been removed from their website.
"I was extremely shocked and traumatised and it was at that point [that I realised] there was never going to be any consultation even with senior staff, professors. This wasn't just happening to me.
"I think this form of victimisation is very personal."
She said she felt the staff had been let down by the university and "persecution of staff has been allowed to take place."
Prof Pullen, who has made several complaints to the university, said after she contacted HR her office was restored.
Neither Prof Nigel Piercy or Prof Niall Piercy responded to the BBC's request for an interview.
But, in an email, Nigel Piercy disputed Prof Alison Pullen's claims.
He said: "A faulty computer was removed while she was at a conferenceâ€¦ no items were moved or cleared from the office.
"When Prof Pullen resigned she was removed from the webpage, as is standard housekeeping practice."
In response to pro-dean Niall Piercy's emails, Nigel Piercy said that he was not aware of any such incident and that he does not monitor his colleagues' emails.
He added that when staff raise concerns about teaching, the department always worked to resolve them, saying: "I am not aware of formal complaints from any member of staff regarding next year's teaching allocation."
"The School of Management is fully committed to providing the best possible student experience, and accordingly we try hard to ensure staff teach the modules they want to teach and in the manner they want to teach them," he said.
Criticism has also been directed at how the university has dealt with complaints from staff about how the School of Management is being run.
One academic, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: "I'm more disappointed with the university system than what's going on in the schoolâ€¦ there are so many procedures in place in the university and personally so many staff members have approached the personnel department in the university, but in practice nothing concrete has been done until now.
"I think we've been completely let down by what has been done."
In a statement, a spokesman for the University and College Union (UCU) said: "We are currently dealing with a number of cases in the School of Management where UCU members feel that their workload is affecting their well-being and their teaching."
The university declined to put anybody up for interview, but in a statement it said: "The university has robust anti-bullying policies and prides itself on positive relationships with trade unions.
"Any concerns raised internally about the School of Management are dealt with by the university registrar in accordance with procedures agreed with the trade unions."
