Leicester midfielder Danny Drinkwater is fit despite having been unavailable for England duty because of a minor hip problem.

Wes Morgan remains out with a back injury and Nampalys Mendy is a doubt.
Xherdan Shaqiri is set to miss an eighth straight game for Stoke with a calf problem, despite starting for Switzerland last Saturday.
Phil Bardsley is out after his red card against Chelsea, while Geoff Cameron's thigh problem will be monitored.
Glen Johnson and Jack Butland both remain sidelined, although the latter is back in training after a long-term ankle injury.
Steve Wilson: "With Craig Shakespeare bidding to become the first British manager to win his first four Premier League games, Leicester suddenly look to be only a couple of victories away from safety.
"How they would love to have those points chalked up before tackling Atletico Madrid in the Champions League.
"Stoke are having another very creditable season; ninth place again at the moment - the position in which they have finished each of the last three seasons.
"Mark Hughes would have particularly enjoyed their point at Manchester City in their last away game, but would probably concede that they have, at times, been too accommodating on their travels - registering wins at only Hull, Watford and Sunderland."

Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare: "With all the records, I'm very conscious you have to keep a bit of humility about it.
"We know that it wasn't so long ago that our form was being questioned.
"We know that at the moment we are playing with a lot of confidence, but that word 'humility' has to be important from my point of view towards the players to keep them level-headed. We also (like) to make sure there is no complacency."
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "It's difficult to win away games in the Premier League. The most we've achieved in a season is six.
"More often then not we take games to the opposition and look to win. We'll see where that takes us over the remainder of the season.
"Leicester are playing well at the moment. They are a fully committed side. We need to ensure their key players don't have an impact."
I fancy the Foxes to win this. Stoke have had some mixed results of late, and although they won't roll over I don't see them stopping Leicester's momentum.
